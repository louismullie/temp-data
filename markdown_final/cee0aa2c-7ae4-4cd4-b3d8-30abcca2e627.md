## Question

What do nitrates on a urinalysis indicate?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what nitrates or nitrites on a urinalysis indicate and how to interpret them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the chemistry the dipstick actually measures and the bacterial enzymology involved. Then, I should verify the diagnostic performance of nitrites on dipstick, including sensitivity, specificity, and AUC data. Next, I will interpret positive and negative results in clinical context, including common false positives and false negatives. After that, I should review how combining nitrite with leukocyte esterase changes test characteristics. I will then consider population-specific performance and guideline recommendations. Finally, I need to ensure pre-analytical factors and stewardship implications are incorporated so the conclusions are practical and evidence-based.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so we do not conflate concepts. The urine dipstick detects nitrites, not nitrates; nitrites are generated when urinary bacteria reduce dietary nitrates via nitrate reductase, making the nitrite pad an indirect marker of bacteriuria rather than a direct pathogen assay, so a positive nitrite suggests the presence of bacteria capable of this reduction pathway.

> I should confirm the biological prerequisites for a nitrite-positive test. The urine must contain sufficient dietary nitrate substrate, there must be adequate bladder dwell time for reduction to occur, and there needs to be a sufficient bacterial load; classically, at least several hours of dwell time is needed, and clinical laboratories often benchmark culture thresholds at 10⁵ CFU/mL when comparing UA to cultures, though nitrite generation is a function of bacterial metabolism rather than a fixed culture cutoff per se [^117XeZs7] [^111FUqvp].

> Now, I will examine performance characteristics before drawing conclusions. Wait, let me verify the consistency across studies. Nitrite on dipstick is typically highly specific but poorly sensitive for culture-positive UTI; for example, one large study found specificity around 98.7% but sensitivity near 43.2%, and across stewardship data the AUC for nitrite is lower than for pyuria, reflecting its role as a rule-in more than a rule-out marker, while flow cytometry for bacteria and WBCs often outperforms test strip analyzers for early decisions [^111FUqvp] [^117Cf5Nn].

> Interpreting a positive nitrite result, I should confirm what it means clinically. In symptomatic patients, a positive nitrite strongly predicts true bacteriuria and supports empiric treatment while culture is pending; for example, in first-trimester pregnancy nitrite had specificity of 98.6% and PPV of 86.6%, and in symptomatic men the PPV was 96%, with meta-analytic evidence of high accuracy in elderly individuals as well, although pretest probability still governs PPV and should be weighed explicitly in decision-making [^111FPAyC] [^117XeZs7] [^117R7Uff].

> Interpreting a negative nitrite result, hold on, let's not jump to conclusions because sensitivity is limited. A negative nitrite does not exclude UTI; it can be falsely negative with low bladder dwell time, low nitrate diet, high urinary ascorbic acid that interferes with the pad reaction, infections with organisms that do not produce nitrite from nitrate, or when nitrite is further metabolized; initially I might say non–nitrate-reducing organisms include Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, and Pseudomonas, but wait, I should verify this because Pseudomonas can reduce nitrate yet may further reduce nitrite to nitrogen compounds, leading to a negative nitrite pad despite bacterial presence, so the safer teaching is that gram-positive uropathogens like Enterococcus and Staphylococcus often yield nitrite-negative results, and some organisms including Pseudomonas may also produce nitrite-negative results via further reduction pathways [^117XeZs7] [^113uAgMS]. I should also consider that marked hyperbilirubinemia has been associated with decreased specificity of nitrite, reminding me to be cautious about biochemical interferences when interpreting borderline results [^114SK92t].

> Given these limitations, I need to check the impact of combining nitrite with leukocyte esterase. The combination markedly improves sensitivity and reduces the negative likelihood ratio compared with either marker alone; meta-analyses and large cohorts show that "leukocyte esterase or nitrite" increases sensitivity, and in certain settings such as nursing homes a negative combined dipstick achieved very high negative predictive value, although performance can vary with population and specimen quality [^117R7Uff] [^1161SvQk] [^113NoEG5] [^113vEziY].

> Next, I should review how population and sampling context modify test performance. Let me think through the data: in pregnant patients and elderly populations, nitrite retains high specificity and strong PPV, while symptomatic men also show excellent PPV; conversely, older women had poor overall performance of UA parameters in one large study, and catheter-derived or in-and-out specimens reduce nitrite specificity, which tracks with contamination and biofilm dynamics; importantly, in neuro-urological patients, guidelines advise against using dipstick screening for UTI, underscoring the need to match the test to the population [^111FPAyC] [^117R7Uff] [^117XeZs7] [^113NoEG5] [^111FUqvp] [^113a4f66].

> I will now examine guideline integration so practice aligns with recommendations. EAU guidance supports midstream dipstick assessment for nitrites and WBCs in suspected acute bacterial prostatitis and recommends dipstick urinalysis as part of LUTS workups in non-neurogenic men; for stone disease, both EAU and AUA recommend urinalysis including nitrites to screen for infection, while EAU advises against relying on urine odor or cloudiness to diagnose catheter-associated UTI, reflecting the superior diagnostic value of structured urinalysis over nonspecific signs [^115ngibR] [^1133Q5tt] [^111hMgPh] [^111sYGrK] [^114REaDU] [^1175DN7a].

> Before finalizing, I need to ensure pre-analytical factors are addressed because they can confound interpretation. Clean-catch, midstream specimens are preferred; bagged pediatric and catheter specimens reduce accuracy, and specimens should be analyzed promptly within about two hours or refrigerated to prevent degradation and nitrite loss, since delays and storage conditions measurably alter results; stewardship pathways using UA to decide when to culture rely on these basics, and AUC analysis confirms nitrite's modest discrimination versus pyuria, which should temper over-reliance on nitrite alone [^111FUqvp] [^117XeZs7] [^1146tnFP] [^117Cf5Nn].

> Pulling this together, nitrites on urinalysis indicate the presence of nitrate-reducing uropathogens and, when positive in a compatible clinical scenario, are highly specific for UTI and can justify empiric treatment while awaiting culture, but because sensitivity is limited, a negative nitrite cannot exclude UTI and should be interpreted alongside leukocyte esterase, symptoms, microscopy, and population context; if clinical suspicion remains high despite negative nitrite, further evaluation including culture is warranted, consistent with guideline-based diagnostic strategies and stewardship data [^111FUqvp] [^117R7Uff] [^115ngibR] [^113NoEG5].

In urinalysis, nitrates are not clinically significant; the relevant test is **urine nitrites** [^117XeZs7], which reflect bacterial conversion of nitrates to nitrites [^113uAgMS] and suggest a Gram-negative UTI. A positive nitrite test is **highly specific** but **not very sensitive** [^111FUqvp], so a negative result does not rule out infection [^113NoEG5]. Confirm with **urine culture** [^111sYGrK] and interpret results alongside leukocyte esterase and the clinical context [^117Cf5Nn].

---

## Physiological basis of nitrite detection

- **Dietary nitrates**: Nitrates are commonly found in vegetables and are excreted in urine [^113TqxMG].

- **Bacterial conversion**: Certain bacteria (e.g. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Proteus) reduce nitrates to nitrites via nitrate reductase [^113uAgMS].

- **Nitrite detection**: Dipsticks detect nitrites, not nitrates, indicating bacterial presence [^117XeZs7].

---

## Clinical significance of nitrites in urinalysis

- **Indicator of UTI**: Nitrites suggest Gram-negative bacterial infection [^116C12Hu].

- **Specificity and sensitivity**: High specificity (98.7%), low sensitivity (43.2%) [^111FUqvp].

- **False negatives**: Short bladder incubation, low bacterial load, or non-nitrate-reducing bacteria [^117R7Uff].

- **False positives**: Contamination or prolonged storage [^113vD2ya] [^1146tnFP].

---

## Clinical implications and management

A positive nitrite test strongly suggests a Gram-negative UTI [^116C12Hu]; **confirm with urine culture** and treat appropriately [^116bb7WC]. A negative result does not exclude UTI; interpret in conjunction with leukocyte esterase, patient symptoms, and culture [^113NoEG5] [^117Cf5Nn].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Bacterial variability**: Not all bacteria reduce nitrates, limiting sensitivity [^113uAgMS].

- **Sample handling**: Timely analysis is critical; delays can alter results [^1146tnFP].

- **Patient factors**: Diet, hydration, and medications can affect results [^113TqxMG] [^117XeZs7].

---

In urinalysis, nitrates are not clinically significant; **nitrites indicate bacterial infection** and should be interpreted in clinical context and confirmed by culture [^115ngibR].

### Is culture-positive urinary tract infection in febrile children accurately identified by urine dipstick or microanalysis [^116bb7WC]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Fever from a urinary tract source remains the predominant etiology of serious bacterial infection in children aged 0–36 months. Urine culture is the gold standard for diagnosing a urinary tract infection (UTI); however, urine dipstick (UDip) and urine microanalysis (UA) are typically used in real-time by emergency physicians to diagnose and treat UTIs, as cultures can take days to grow and be available. The purpose of this article is to evaluate the literature on the accuracy and utility of the UDip and UA in this pediatric population.

- **Methods**: A structured review of the medical literature was conducted to determine the accuracy of UDip and UA for the diagnosis of UTI in children before the result of the urine culture.

- **Results**: Upon comprehensive review and after applying predefined inclusion criteria, a total of 13 articles met inclusion criteria, addressed the clinical question, and were reviewed in detail.

- **Conclusions**: The literature search did not conclusively identify any component of either the UDip or the UA that would allow a practitioner to conclude definitively that the source of an infant's fever is a UTI.

### Performance of urinalysis tests and their ability in predicting results of urine cultures: A comparison between automated test strip analyser and flow cytometry in various subpopulations and types of samples [^111FUqvp]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

Results of urinalysis are available earlier than urine culture results. If urinalysis can predict results of culture, early decisions can be made on treatment and whether urine samples should be cultured. This study sought to compare the performance of urinalysis tests by automated test strip analyser (nitrite and leucocyte esterase) with flow cytometry (bacteria and white cell count) in different subpopulations and types of samples.

- **Methods**: Consecutive urine samples (n = 2351) from a population with a median age of 45 years, 37.2% men, were tested. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value (NPV) of the tests were calculated using contingency tables. The gold standard was positive urine culture with a cut-off > 10⁵ CFU/mL.

- **Results**: 14% of the cultures were positive (95.6% monomicrobial, 74.7% Enterobacteriaceae). Overall, the nitrite test was the most specific (98.7%) but the least sensitive (43.2%). Bacteria count was the most sensitive (91.7%) and highly specific (87.5%). In infants < 24 months, the sensitivity of bacteria count was reduced (86.1%), but specificity was high (95.9%). The specificity of nitrite was reduced in urine from the in-and-out procedure (81.9%). The sensitivity of bacteria count was reduced in bag specimen urine (83.3%) and in urine from indwelling catheter (84.7%). All tests showed a high NPV. The NPV of the combined flow cytometry tests was higher than those of the automated test strip analyser (99.1% vs 97.4%).

In conclusion, the performance of urinalysis is excellent. Flow cytometry tests performed better.

### Performance of urinalysis parameters in predicting urinary tract infection: Does one size fit all [^113NoEG5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

In a multihospital cohort study of 3392 patients, positive urinalysis parameters had poor positive predictive value for diagnosing urinary tract infection (UTI). Combined urinalysis parameters, such as pyuria or nitrite, performed better than pyuria alone for ruling out UTI. However, the performance of all urinalysis parameters was poor in older women.

- **G6PD deficiency**: Because patients with G6PD deficiency are at increased risk of a hemolytic crisis with sodium nitrite administration, consider alternative therapeutic approaches in these patients. Monitor patients with known or suspected G6PD deficiency for an acute drop in hematocrit. Exchange transfusion may be needed for patients with G6PD deficiency who receive sodium nitrite.

- **Use with other drugs**: Use sodium nitrite with caution in the presence of concomitant antihypertensive medications, diuretics or volume depletion due to diuretics, or drugs known to increase vascular nitric oxide, such as PDE5 inhibitors.

For the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI), low bacterial counts in urine culture need to be considered more often. Non-antibiotic prophylaxis should be prioritized before antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with uncomplicated recurrent UTI (reUTI). Immunoprophylaxis in patients with recurrent UTI deserves better consideration.

### Nitro-time [^115NDm4m]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

Nitrate ions liberated during the metabolism of nitroglycerin can oxidize hemoglobin into methemoglobin. In patients completely lacking cytochrome b reductase activity, approximately 1 mg/kg of nitroglycerin would be required before any clinical significance (≥ 10%) in methemoglobinemia manifests, even assuming the nitrate moieties of nitroglycerin are fully utilized for oxidizing hemoglobin. Patients with normal reductase function would need even larger doses of nitroglycerin for significant methemoglobin production. In one study involving 36 patients undergoing continuous nitroglycerin therapy at 3.1 to 4.4 mg/hr for 2 to 4 weeks, the average methemoglobin level was 0.2%, comparable to levels observed in patients receiving a placebo.

Despite these findings, there are case reports of significant methemoglobinemia associated with moderate overdoses of organic nitrates. None of the affected patients were previously considered unusually susceptible. Methemoglobin levels can be determined by most clinical laboratories. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients showing signs of impaired oxygen delivery despite having adequate cardiac output and arterial pO₂. Characteristically, methemoglobinemic blood is chocolate brown and does not change color upon exposure to air.

When methemoglobinemia is diagnosed, the treatment of choice is methylene blue, administered intravenously at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg.

### The urine dipstick test useful to rule out infections. A meta-analysis of the accuracy [^117R7Uff]. BMC Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Many studies have evaluated the accuracy of dipstick tests as rapid detectors of bacteriuria and urinary tract infections (UTI). The lack of an adequate explanation for the heterogeneity of the dipstick accuracy stimulates an ongoing debate. The objective of the present meta-analysis was to summarize the available evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of the urine dipstick test, taking into account various pre-defined potential sources of heterogeneity.

- **Methods**: Literature from 1990 through 1999 was searched in Medline and Embase, and by reference tracking. Selected publications should be concerned with the diagnosis of bacteriuria or urinary tract infections, investigate the use of dipstick tests for nitrites and/or leukocyte esterase, and present empirical data. A checklist was used to assess methodological quality.

- **Results**: Seventy publications were included. Accuracy of nitrites was high in pregnant women (Diagnostic Odds Ratio = 165) and elderly people (DOR = 108). Positive predictive values were greater than or equal to 80% in elderly patients and in family medicine settings. Accuracy of leukocyte-esterase was high in studies involving urology patients (DOR = 276). Sensitivities were highest in family medicine (86%). Negative predictive values were high in both tests across all patient groups and settings, except for family medicine. The combination of both test results demonstrated a significant increase in sensitivity. Accuracy was high in studies involving urology patients (DOR = 52), in children (DOR = 46), and if clinical information was present (DOR = 28). Sensitivity was highest in studies carried out in family medicine.

### Pregnant patient in the emergency department: An observational investigation of predictive values of symptoms and lab measures in predicting culture confirmed urinary tract infection [^111FPAyC]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Many women in their first trimester present to the Emergency Department (ED) for evaluation. Urinalysis is a common test performed with these patients to evaluate for possible UTI. There are no clear results to determine if a patient requires antibiotics in the ED versus waiting for the culture result to start antibiotics. We prospectively studied a convenience sample of 198 women in their first trimester of pregnancy presenting to a community ED, recording standard symptoms and lab analysis, and then compared these results to the urine culture. We determined that no single symptom was significantly sensitive nor specific for ruling in or out UTI. Overall, the presence of nitrites was the most significant, with a specificity of 98.6%, NPV of 81.9%, and PPV of 86.6%. Presence of specific historical findings, namely dysuria (88% specificity) and hematuria (93% specificity), performed well for predicting culture-positive UTI but performed poorly in ruling out this condition. The diagnosis of a culture-confirmed UTI in the ED cannot be reliably predicted using symptomology or lab values other than nitrites.

### Changes in the composition of urine over six hours using urine dipstick analysis and automated microscopy [^1146tnFP]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

The study shows that a timely urinalysis is critical for accurate results since delayed analysis can considerably change the makeup of the urine, thereby affecting clinical decisions and the management of patients. Future studies should consider more extended time frames, diverse patient populations, and methods of sample handling — such as refrigeration or preservatives — and analysis techniques being more optimized. Additionally, a combination of automated and manual microscopy may offer the most comprehensive and accurate approach to urine analysis, leveraging the strengths of both techniques while mitigating their respective limitations.

### Dipstick urinalysis and the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of urinary tract infection [^111K9ACC]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine whether dipstick urinalysis (DU) augmented the accuracy of clinical assessment in the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI). The study was performed in 627 consecutive patients attending an adult emergency department (ED) in whom the clinical diagnosis of UTI was considered. We excluded 227 patients. Treating clinicians gave the probability of a UTI on an ordinal and continuous scale, before and after DU. The assigned clinical probabilities were then compared to the results of formal urine culture. The areas under receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUC) were calculated.

We found that clinical assessment alone was effective in detecting those patients with a UTI from those without (AUC 0.75; p < 0.0001). There was, however, a statistically significant difference in the accuracy of diagnosing UTI after DU (AUC 0.87; p < 0.0001). Proportionately more patients with a moderate pre-test probability of UTI were re-assigned to a different probability rating following DU, compared to the low or high pre-test probability groups (p < 0.001).

We conclude that DU in combination with clinical assessment is a superior method for diagnosing UTI than clinical assessment alone.

### Miconazole nitrate [^117GMNes]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Miconazole nitrate exhibits fungicidal activity in vitro against species of the genus Candida. The pharmacologic mode of action is unknown. Following intravaginal administration of miconazole nitrate, small amounts are absorbed. Administration of a single dose of miconazole nitrate vaginal suppositories (100 mg) to healthy subjects resulted in total recovery from the urine and feces of 0.85% (± 0.43%) of the administered dose.

Animal studies indicate that the drug crosses the placenta, and doses above those used in humans result in embryo and fetotoxicity (80 mg/kg, orally), although this has not been reported in human subjects (see PRECAUTIONS).

In multi-center clinical trials in 440 women with vulvovaginal candidiasis, the efficacy of treatment with the Miconazole Nitrate Vaginal Suppositories USP, 200 mg for 3 days was compared with treatment for 7 days with Miconazole Nitrate Vaginal Cream 2%. The clinical cure rates (free of microbiological evidence and clinical signs and symptoms of candidiasis at 8 to 10 days and 30 to 35 days post-therapy) were numerically lower, although not statistically different, with the 3-Day Suppository when compared with the 7-Day Cream.

### Urinalysis is predictive for absence of urinary tract infection in men with and without catheters [^1141SyeQ]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2024). High credibility.

To determine the accuracy of negative urinalysis (UA) for predicting negative urine culture and the absence of urinary tract infection (UTI), and optimal urine culture growth cutoff for UTI diagnosis in men with and without urinary catheters, UAs with urine cultures within 1 week from adult men were identified and evaluated. Predictive values for the absence of UTI (absence of ≥ 1 of the following criteria: documentation of UTI diagnosis, antibiotic prescription, uropathogen presence on culture) were calculated.

In total, 22,883 UAs were included. Negative UA had a high predictive value for negative urine culture (0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.94–0.95) and absence of UTI (0.99, CI: 0.99–0.995) in the overall cohort. Negative UA also had a high predictive value for negative urine culture (0.93, CI: 0.90–0.95) and absence of UTI (0.99, CI: 0.98–0.999) in those with indwelling urinary catheters. The traditional threshold of culture growth of 100,000 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL did not capture 22% of UTIs.

UA exhibits high predictive value for negative urine culture and absence of UTI in men, supporting a protocol wherein culture is only performed in the context of abnormal UA. The traditional 100,000 CFU/mL cut-off may not have captured a subset of UTIs in the male population and warrants further investigation.

### Origin of nitrite and nitrate in nasal and exhaled breath condensate and relation to nitric oxide formation [^114BjRiV]. Thorax (2005). Low credibility.

Raised concentrations of nitrate and nitrite have been found in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) in airway disease, and it has been postulated that this reflects increased nitric oxide (NO) metabolism. However, the chemical and anatomical origin of nitrate and nitrite in the airways has not yet been sufficiently studied.

- **Methods**: The fraction of exhaled NO at an exhalation flow rate of 50 ml/s (FE(NO)) and nitrite and nitrate in EBC, nasal condensate, and saliva were measured in 17 tracheostomised and 15 non-tracheostomised subjects, all of whom were non-smokers without respiratory disease. Tracheal and oral samples were taken from the tracheostomised subjects and nasal (during velum closure) and oral samples from the non-tracheostomised subjects. Measurements were performed before and after sodium nitrate ingestion (10 mg/kg) and use of antibacterial mouthwash (chlorhexidine 0.2%).

- **Results**: In tracheostomised subjects, oral FE(NO) increased by 90% (p < 0.01) while tracheal FE(NO) was not affected 60 minutes after nitrate ingestion. Oral EBC nitrite levels were increased 23-fold at 60 minutes (p < 0.001), whereas the nitrite levels in tracheal EBC showed only a minor increase (fourfold, p < 0.05). Nitrate was increased the same amount in oral and tracheal EBC at 60 minutes (2.5-fold, p < 0.05). In non-tracheostomised subjects, oral FE(NO) and EBC nitrite increased after nitrate ingestion, and after chlorhexidine mouthwash, they approached baseline levels again (p < 0.001). Nasal NO, nitrate, and nitrite were not affected by nitrate intake or mouthwash.

### A revalidation and critique of assumptions about urinary sample collection methods, specimen quality and contamination [^113vD2ya]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Low credibility.

A urinary tract infection (UTI) is the leading reason why patients seek treatment in primary care. One in three women will be treated with antibiotics for UTI by the age of 24, and 40% to 50% of women will experience one or more UTIs in their lifetime, with 10–15% experiencing reinfections. A UTI is commonly identified among young adolescents attending sexual health centers and accounts for 17% of treatment cases. In the adult population of 65 years and older, a UTI is the second most common cause of infectious disease related to hospitalizations in the United States. A UTI is a debilitating condition causing the onset of painful urination (dysuria), increased urinary frequency, the inability to start urinating (hesitancy), and the sensation of a sudden need to urinate (urgency), all of which are classified as lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).

Many clinical guidelines advocate urinary dipstick testing for leucocyte esterase and nitrite as a means of detecting UTI, but evidence suggests that their utility might be limited. Dipstick analyses are surrogate tests, referenced not to microscopic pyuria but to a gold standard urine culture threshold for UTI, which guidelines accept as being between 10³ cfu ml⁻¹ and 10⁶ cfu ml⁻¹ of the pure growth of a single urinary pathogen. This test has attracted criticism as well. Furthermore, the literature shows that the methods of sample collection for urine culture have never been validated in appropriate clinical trials. Justification for the use of such methods is based on plausible assumptions without supporting evidence.

### Diagnostic stewardship cutoffs for urinalysis results prior to performing a urine culture: Analysis of data from a healthcare system [^117Cf5Nn]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections are commonly overdiagnosed. To minimize overdiagnosis, some laboratories utilize reflex algorithms that use urinalyses as preliminary screening before potentially proceeding to urine culture. However, the optimal urinalysis cutoffs for this diagnostic stewardship intervention remain poorly defined.

We performed a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis from February 1, 2021, to January 31, 2023, in the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services healthcare system. We examined patient encounters in which urinalysis was ordered synchronously with urine culture. We categorized urine culture isolates as uropathogens or non-uropathogens. We calculated receiver operating characteristic curves of urinalysis parameters' ability, singularly or in combination, to identify uropathogens.

Among 80,949 paired urinalysis and urine cultures (17,488 inpatient, 20,716 emergency department, 42,745 outpatient), cultures yielded 35% (n = 28,993) uropathogens, 4% (n = 2,960) non-uropathogens, 37% (n = 29,951) contaminants, and 24% (n = 19,045) with no growth. Among urinalysis parameters, white blood cells (WBCs) had the highest diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.722, [95% CI 0.718–0.725]), followed by leukocyte esterase (AUC = 0.700, [95% CI 0.690–0.701]), bacteria (AUC = 0.673, [95% CI 0.670–0.677]), nitrite (AUC = 0.627, [95% CI 0.625–0.630]), and squamous epithelial cells (AUC = 0.530, [95% CI 0.526–0.534]). WBC AUC values were consistent across healthcare settings (outpatient, emergency department, and inpatient).

### ASN guidelines on P values [^111d4hQZ]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

To illustrate this point, consider a similar problem in clinical practice: a physician reports to a patient that the result of her diagnostic test was positive. When the patient asks whether the test result could be wrong, she would be poorly served with an answer that the test is highly specific (i.e.g.iven the absence of disease, it is very unlikely that the test result is positive). The patient's primary interest concerns the question: Given that my test result is positive, what is the probability of truly having the disease? This positive predictive value depends not only on specificity but also on sensitivity and the a priori probability of disease.

A clinician weighs the evidence of a test result in view of her combined understanding of the biology of the disease, patient characteristics, and the pre-test probability of disease. That is why the interpretation is not left to the laboratory technician. Similarly, statistically significant results should be interpreted taking the prior expectation and plausibility of the null hypothesis into account. By intuition, people usually get this right. For example, consider a trial report with a statistically significant benefit obtained with a homeopathic, super-diluted remedy. People who do not believe in homeopathy are unlikely to believe the test results. Statistical testing is like interpreting a diagnostic test result by looking only at its specificity — that is, under the null hypothesis of no disease. Interpretation of statistical tests should also take into account the plausibility or likelihood of the alternative hypothesis.

The aim of this manuscript is to initiate a constructive discussion about deviations in measured concentrations of uraemic solutes; these deviations, if not perceived or handled appropriately, may lead to incorrect interpretations of the pathophysiological role of uraemic solutes and/or to erroneous therapeutic decisions. To come to an objective approach towards this problem, variability analysis of reported concentrations may be of help. Striking outliers should either be discarded or considered together with other values which are more consistent with the majority of reported data.

### Urinary nitrate concentration as a marker for kidney transplant rejection [^117Hxhv5]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Kidney transplant rejection remains a problem contributing to graft loss. It is typically asymptomatic, making early diagnosis difficult. Transplanted kidneys remain at risk of rejection despite significant advancements in immunosuppression. Early identification and treatment of rejection episodes are necessary to limit loss of function and prolong the life of the transplanted kidney and recipient. Current practice depends on detecting a creatinine rise; consequently, graft dysfunction and damage are likely by the time of kidney transplant biopsy and subsequent treatment. A biomarker to diagnose transplant rejection at an earlier time point than current practice, or to inform earlier decision-making to biopsy, could be transformative.

In 1996, Smith et al. provided evidence that urinary nitrate concentration is elevated during kidney transplant rejection when compared with urinary tract infection or a non-rejection state. The same group replicated these findings, showing that urinary nitrate concentration was elevated up to 5 days before a biopsy diagnosis of rejection was made. It has been demonstrated that urinary nitrate concentration increases as a result of increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), leading to increased production of nitric oxide (NO) in the transplanted organ. This NO is then rapidly metabolized to its stable oxidation product, nitrate. Also, in 1996, Mugge et al. discovered similar findings in their cardiac transplant patients, where an increased urinary nitrate concentration was noted with moderate/severe cardiac transplant rejection.

### Oxiconazole nitrate [^115fRZtC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

The following definitions were applied to the clinical and microbiological outcomes in patients enrolled in the clinical trials that form the basis for the approval of oxiconazole nitrate cream.

- **Definitions**:
	- **Mycological cure**: No evidence (culture and KOH preparation) of the baseline (original) pathogen in a specimen from the affected area taken at the 2-week post-treatment visit (for tinea [pityriasis] versicolor, mycological cure was limited to KOH only).
	- **Treatment success**: Both a global evaluation of 90% clinical improvement and a microbiologic eradication at the 2-week post-treatment visit.

- **Tinea pedis**: There are no head-to-head comparison trials of the oxiconazole nitrate cream and lotion formulations in the treatment of tinea pedis.

The two pivotal trials for the oxiconazole nitrate cream formulation involved 281 evaluable patients (total from both trials) with clinically and microbiologically established tinea pedis. The combined results of these two clinical trials at the 2-week post-treatment follow-up visit showed that all the improvement and cure rates of the b.i.d.- and q.d.-treated groups did not differ significantly (95% confidence interval) from each other but were statistically (95% confidence interval) superior to the vehicle-treated group.

### Sodium nitrite [^114Eagb3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Warning: Life-threatening hypotension and methemoglobin formation**: Sodium nitrite can cause serious adverse reactions and death in humans, even at doses less than twice the recommended therapeutic dose. Sodium nitrite causes hypotension and methemoglobin formation, which diminishes the oxygen-carrying capacity. Hypotension and methemoglobin formation can occur concurrently or separately. Because of these risks, sodium nitrite should be used to treat acute life-threatening cyanide poisoning and should be used with caution in patients where the diagnosis of cyanide poisoning is uncertain.

Patients should be closely monitored to ensure adequate perfusion and oxygenation during treatment with sodium nitrite. Alternative therapeutic approaches should be considered in patients known to have diminished oxygen or cardiovascular reserve (e.g. smoke inhalation victims, pre-existing anemia, cardiac or respiratory compromise) and those at higher risk of developing methemoglobinemia (e.g. congenital methemoglobin reductase deficiency), as they are at greater risk for potentially life-threatening adverse events related to the use of sodium nitrite [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 and 5.2)].

- **Warning: Life-threatening hypotension and methemoglobin formation**: See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

Sodium nitrite can cause serious adverse reactions and death from:

- **Hypotension (5.1)**
- **Methemoglobin formation (5.2)**

Patients should be closely monitored to ensure adequate perfusion and oxygenation during treatment with sodium nitrite.

### Validity of the urine dipslide under daily practice conditions [^115SwENU]. Family Practice (2003). Low credibility.

So far, the validity of urine dipslides has been studied only under optimal conditions, which may not reflect the situation in daily practice.

- **Objective**: We studied the validity of the urine dipslide as performed under daily practice conditions and assessed the influence of the incubation period (24 hours versus 48 hours) on validity.

- **Methods**: Fresh urine samples of patients with signs or symptoms of a possible urinary tract infection (UTI) were examined in general practice via a nitrite test, a urine sediment, and a dipslide. A second dipslide was inoculated and sent to the hospital microbiology laboratory for culture. This culture acted as the gold standard. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of the tests performed.

- **Results**: Of the 273 patient episodes included, 62% had a UTI (166 of 268 cultures). The sensitivity of the dipslide performed in daily general practice was 73% and the specificity was 94%.

- **Conclusion**: The validity of the dipslide read under practice conditions is lower than under optimal conditions. Actions to improve performance are needed. Nonetheless, using the dipslide instead of the sediment as a second step after the nitrite test would improve the diagnostic work-up of UTI.

### Inorganic nitrate benefits contrast-induced nephropathy after coronary angiography for acute coronary syndromes: the NITRATE-CIN trial [^116FkQyA]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

The NITRATE-CIN study was published in 2024 in the European Heart Journal. It explores the impact of inorganic nitrate on diseases such as non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and contrast-induced nephropathy. The trial examined the role of inorganic nitrate in patients at risk of renal injury undergoing coronary angiography for acute coronary syndromes. Conducted as a single-center, double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT), the study involved 640 patients (171 female, 469 male). Inclusion criteria focused on patients at risk of renal injury undergoing coronary angiography for acute coronary syndromes, while key exclusion criteria included cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, STEMI, chronic kidney failure, and pregnancy.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Inorganic nitrate group (n = 319)**: Received potassium nitrate 12 mmol (equivalent to 744 mg of nitrate) once daily for 5 days, with the first dose administered before coronary angiography.
	- **Placebo group (n = 321)**: Received potassium chloride once daily for 5 days.

- **Primary outcome**: Significant decrease in contrast-induced nephropathy (9.1% vs. 30.5%; OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.34).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- Significant decrease in major adverse cardiac events at 1 year (9.1% vs. 18.1%; OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.73).
	- Significant decrease in all-cause mortality (5.4% vs. 10.9%; OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.84).
	- Significant decrease in major adverse kidney events at 1 year (10.7% vs. 28.4%; OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.66).

### Isosorbide mononitrate [^115k2ECY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Methemoglobinemia has been reported in patients receiving other organic nitrates, and it could also occur as a side effect of isosorbide mononitrate. Nitrate ions liberated during the metabolism of isosorbide mononitrate can oxidize hemoglobin into methemoglobin. Even in patients without cytochrome b5 reductase activity, and assuming that the nitrate moiety of isosorbide mononitrate is applied to the oxidation of hemoglobin, about 2 mg/kg of isosorbide mononitrate should be required before any of these patients manifest clinically significant (≥ 10%) methemoglobinemia. In patients with normal reductase function, significant production of methemoglobin should require even larger doses of isosorbide mononitrate.

In one study, 36 patients received 2 to 4 weeks of continuous nitroglycerin therapy at 3.1 mg to 4.4 mg/hr (equivalent, in the total administered dose of nitrate ions, to 7.8 mg to 11.1 mg of isosorbide mononitrate per hour); the average methemoglobin level measured was 0.2%, comparable to that observed in parallel patients who received a placebo.

Notwithstanding these observations, there are case reports of significant methemoglobinemia in association with moderate overdoses of organic nitrates. None of the affected patients were thought to be unusually susceptible. Methemoglobin levels are available from most clinical laboratories. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients who exhibit signs of impaired oxygen delivery despite adequate cardiac output and adequate arterial pO2.

### Caution - not all UTIs are the same [^1143DosV]. Nature Reviews Urology (2025). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common infections, accounting for approximately 400 million diagnoses per year worldwide. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTIs) occur in healthy individuals with no structural or functional abnormalities of the urinary system and primarily affect women. Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are a type of complicated UTI affecting patients who have a urinary catheter in place, often hospitalized patients or patients with conditions that prevent them from urinating naturally.

Both infections share common symptoms, diagnostics, and treatment options but also differ greatly in pathophysiology, aetiology, risk factors, and comorbidities. These differences could explain why antibiotic treatments, which generally lead to positive outcomes in patients with uUTIs, often fail in patients with CAUTIs. Understanding these differences could guide evidence-based insights into why treatments for CAUTIs should be different from those for uUTIs, specifically by modifying catheters, which initiate the damage-induced segue for UTIs.

### Urinalysis: A comprehensive review [^117XeZs7]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

A complete urinalysis includes physical, chemical, and microscopic examinations. Midstream clean collection is acceptable in most situations, but the specimen should be examined within two hours of collection. Cloudy urine often results from precipitated phosphate crystals in alkaline urine, but pyuria can also be the cause. A strong odor may signal a concentrated specimen rather than a urinary tract infection. Dipstick urinalysis is convenient, though false-positive and false-negative results can occur. Specific gravity provides a reliable assessment of the patient's hydration status. Microhematuria has a range of causes, from benign to life-threatening. Glomerular, renal, and urologic causes of microhematuria can often be differentiated by other elements of the urinalysis. Although transient proteinuria is typically a benign condition, persistent proteinuria requires further work-up. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections diagnosed by positive leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests can be treated without culture.

### Role of dipstick testing in the evaluation of urinary tract infection in nursing home residents [^113vEziY]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2007). Low credibility.

Among 101 nursing home residents with suspected urinary tract infection (UTI), we determined the negative predictive value of dipstick testing for leukocyte esterase and nitrite to be 100% (95% confidence interval, 74%-100%) compared with laboratory evidence of UTI (greater than 10 white blood cells/mm³ on urinalysis and greater than 100,000 colony-forming units/mL on urine culture). Nursing home dipstick testing effectively excluded the possibility of UTI.

### Diagnosis of urinary tract infections in children [^113271Xg]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common occurrence in children. The management and laboratory diagnosis of these infections pose unique challenges that are not encountered in adults. Important factors, such as specimen collection, urinalysis interpretation, culture thresholds, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, require special consideration in children and will be discussed in detail in the following review.

### Nitro-Dur [^1138jVr7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Methemoglobinemia:

Nitrate ions liberated during metabolism of nitroglycerin can oxidize hemoglobin into methemoglobin. Even in patients completely lacking cytochrome b5 reductase activity, and assuming all nitrate moieties of nitroglycerin are applied to the oxidation of hemoglobin, about 1 mg/kg of nitroglycerin is necessary before any patient manifests clinically significant (310%) methemoglobinemia. For patients with normal reductase function, significant production of methemoglobin requires even larger doses of nitroglycerin. In one study involving 36 patients who received continuous nitroglycerin therapy at 3.1 to 4.4 mg/hr for 2 to 4 weeks, the average methemoglobin level was 0.2%; this was comparable to that of parallel patients receiving placebo.

Despite these observations, case reports have documented significant methemoglobinemia with moderate overdoses of organic nitrates. None of the affected individuals were thought to be unusually susceptible.

Methemoglobin levels are accessible from most clinical laboratories. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients showing signs of impaired oxygen delivery despite adequate cardiac output and arterial PO₂. Methemoglobinemic blood is classically described as chocolate brown, with no color change upon exposure to air.

Methemoglobinemia should be treated with methylene blue if cardiac or CNS effects of hypoxia develop. The initial dose is 1 to 2 mg/kg, administered intravenously over 5 minutes.

### Mesnex [^112CTDSo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

- **Laboratory test interferences**: A false positive test for urinary ketones may arise in patients treated with Mesnex when using nitroprusside sodium-based urine tests (including dipstick tests). The addition of glacial acetic acid can be used to differentiate between a false positive result (cherry-red color that fades) and a true positive result (red-violet color that intensifies).

Mesnex may interfere with enzymatic creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) activity tests that use a thiol compound (e.g. N-acetylcysteine) for CPK reactivation. This may result in a falsely low CPK level.

Mesnex may cause false-positive reactions in Tillman's reagent-based urine screening tests for ascorbic acid.

- **Use in patients with a history of adverse reactions to thiol compounds**: Mesnex is a thiol compound, i.e. a sulfhydryl (SH) group-containing organic compound. Hypersensitivity reactions to mesna and to amifostine, another thiol compound, have been reported. It is not clear whether patients who experienced an adverse reaction to a thiol compound are at increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to Mesnex.

### Beyond the urine anion gap: In support of the direct measurement of urinary ammonium [^113oiMJq]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Ammonium is a major urinary buffer necessary for the normal excretion of the daily acid load. Its urinary rate of excretion (UNH₄) may increase several fold in the presence of extrarenal metabolic acidosis. Therefore, measurement of UNH₄ can provide important clues about causes of metabolic acidosis. Because UNH₄ is not commonly measured in clinical laboratories, the urinary anion gap (UAG) was proposed as its surrogate about four decades ago, and it is still frequently used for that purpose.

Several published studies strongly suggest that UAG is not a good index of UNH₄ and support the concept that direct measurement of UNH₄ is an important parameter to define in clinical nephrology. Low UNH₄ levels have recently been found to be associated with a higher risk of metabolic acidosis, loss of kidney function, and death in persons with chronic kidney disease, while surrogates like the UAG do not recapitulate this risk. To advance the field, it is necessary for the medical community to become more familiar with UNH₄ levels in various clinical settings.

Herein, we review the literature, searching for available data on UNH₄ under normal and various pathological conditions, in an attempt to establish reference values to interpret UNH₄ results if and when UNH₄ measurements become available as a routine clinical test. In addition, we present original data in two large populations that provide further evidence that the UAG is not a good predictor of UNH₄. Measurement of urine NH₄ holds promise to aid clinicians in the care of patients, and we encourage its adoption in clinical practice.

### Duration of fever affects the likelihood of a positive bag urinalysis or catheter culture in young children [^117XkXLF]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

To test the hypothesis that there will be a clinically significant rise in the proportion of positive bag urinalyses and catheter cultures in young children with increasing duration of fever, a study was conducted. This was a prospective cohort study of 818 infants and children aged 3–36 months presenting to a tertiary care emergency department with documented fever without source.

Following the documentation of fever for 5 days or more, bag specimens were collected for urinalysis. The primary outcome was the yield of positive bag dipsticks by day, defined as positive for nitrates or more than trace leukocyte esterase. The secondary outcome was positive catheter cultures on each day of fever.

Positive bag urinalyses increased with duration of fever: 14.8% (35/237) on day 1 versus 26.4% (43/163) on day 3 (relative risk [RR] = 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2–2.7; p = 0.004). Positive catheter cultures increased similarly: 4.8% (11/229) on day 1 versus 12.6% (20/159) on day 3 (RR = 2.6; 95% CI = 1.3–5.3; p = 0.005).

The conclusion drawn was that the yield of positive bag urinalyses and catheter cultures increased significantly in children with fever of 3 days or longer duration.

### Diagnostic accuracy of dipsticks for urinary tract infections in acutely hospitalised patients: a prospective population-based observational cohort study [^111dR8Fc]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

In the study population of 1052 patients examined by a dipstick, a classic UTI symptom was present at admission among 184 out of 1052 (17%) patients. The type of urine sample was not reported in 860 out of 1052 (81%), from a newly placed urinary catheter in 111 out of 1052 (11%), from a permanent urinary catheter in 79 out of 1052 (8%), and 'other' in 2 out of 1052 (0.2%). The indication for dipstick analysis was not reported in the electronic medical records in 632 out of 1052 (60%) of patients. For the remaining patients, the attending physician explicitly listed suspected UTI or unknown infection as indications in 393 out of 1052 (37%), suspected gross haematuria or kidney stones in 13 out of 1052 (1%), proteinuria in 7 out of 1052 (0.7%), and ketoacidosis in 3 out of 1052 (0.3%). Overall, dipsticks were interpreted as 'probable UTI' in about half of the patients with a strong reaction for leukocyte esterase, nitrite, or both.

Urine cultures were carried out in 609 out of 1052 (58%), of which 272 out of 609 (45%) were positive. Escherichia coli was the most commonly identified bacterium, found in 139 out of 272 (51%) of cultured urine samples. The proportions with significant bacteriuria did not differ noticeably between patients with or without specific symptoms of UTI, dementia, confusion, a history of fever, and those with symptoms from organ systems other than the genitourinary tract.

The modified CDC criteria of UTI were fulfilled by 89 out of 1052 (8%) of patients. In contrast, a final clinical diagnosis of UTI was assigned by the attending physician in 155 out of 1052 (15%) patients.

### Inorganic nitrate benefits contrast-induced nephropathy after coronary angiography for acute coronary syndromes: The NITRATE-CIN trial [^112bZYvC]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

For our study calculations, we assumed a conservative CIN incidence of 12% in the control group, with a proposed reduction of 60% with inorganic nitrate. This reduction was based on preliminary data from the 80 STEMI patient NITRITE-AMI trial, where an acute intra-coronary bolus of sodium nitrite (10 µmol/L) was associated with an 80% reduction in CIN compared to patients who received a placebo control. A sample size of 640 patients provided a power of 80% and a significance level of 0.05, allowing for a 27% dropout rate, which was the primary endpoint.

All analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. The statistical analysis plan (available with the protocol) was finalized before unblinding the trial group assignments. Data are presented as mean values with standard deviations or median values with interquartile ranges.

- **Primary outcome**: The primary outcome of CIN was analyzed using logistic regression, with estimates made unadjusted, and adjusted for diabetes status and creatinine level at baseline. Pre-specified subgroup analyses were performed on primary outcomes by incorporating and testing interaction terms into the models.

- **Secondary outcomes**: Analyses of secondary outcomes were not adjusted for multiplicity. Differences in secondary outcomes between trial groups were estimated using linear regression for continuous outcomes, and logistic regression for binary outcomes, with and without adjustment for diabetes status and creatinine level at baseline. Assumptions for each model were tested and deemed not to be violated. Secondary endpoints are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

### The abnormal urinalysis [^1126CRh8]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Urinalysis is one of the most commonly performed tests in pediatrics. Whether the findings are expected or incidental, abnormal results are common. Understanding the strengths and limitations of urinalysis allows healthcare providers to maximize its use as a screening tool while avoiding expensive and unnecessary evaluations. This article reviews the significance of abnormal results on urine dipstick testing and urine microscopy. Causes of false positive and false negative results are summarized, and initial diagnostic considerations for abnormal urinalysis findings are provided where appropriate.

### Is there a link between hyperbilirubinemia and elevated urine nitrite [^114SK92t]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine whether hyperbilirubinemia affects the association between a positive urine nitrite test and a positive urine culture. We conducted an institutional review board-approved, retrospective review of 12 months of patient data, compiling information for patients having urinalysis, urine culture, and total serum bilirubin. Patients were divided into three groups according to total serum bilirubin: less than 1.5 mg/dL, 1.5 to 3.0 mg/dL, and greater than 3.0 mg/dL. The point estimates and 95% confidence intervals of the sensitivity, specificity, false-positive proportion (proportion of false positive to all positive tests), and other test characteristics of urine nitrite as an indicator of urinary tract infection were calculated and tested for trend as a function of the three total serum bilirubin ranges.

A total of 3,174 patients met our study criteria. The specificity of the nitrite test decreased as a function of increasing total serum bilirubin (0.974, 0.966, and 0.855 for the three total bilirubin levels, respectively) with a significant trend (P < 0.01). For patients with total serum bilirubin above 3.0 mg/dL, it was approximately four times more likely that a positive urine nitrite test would be a "false positive".

### Urine trouble: Should we think differently about UTI [^115iUiqd]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is clinically important, as it is one of the most common bacterial infections in adult women. However, the understanding of UTI remains based on the now disproven concept that the urinary bladder is sterile. As a result, standards for UTI diagnosis have significant limitations that may reduce opportunities to improve patient care. Using data from our work and numerous other peer-reviewed studies, we identified four major limitations in the contemporary UTI description: the language of UTI, UTI diagnostic testing, the Escherichia coli-centric view of UTI, and the colony-forming units (CFU) threshold-based diagnosis. Contemporary methods and technology, combined with rigorous clinical research, can be used to correct these limitations.

### Interleukin-6 concentrations in the urine and dipstick analyses were related to bacteriuria but not symptoms in the elderly: A cross sectional study of 421 nursing home residents [^111mDhRb]. BMC Geriatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Urine dipsticks were analyzed for nitrite and leukocyte esterase in urine specimens from 408 out of 421 residents. Urine dipstick analyses were not performed in 13 out of 421 residents, mostly due to insufficient urine volume. Among all residents, regardless of bacteriuria, 26% (106/408) of nitrite dipsticks were positive and 22% (90/408) of leukocyte esterase dipsticks were ≥ 3+.

Leukocyte esterase dipsticks ≥ 3+ were more common (p < 10⁻⁶) among residents with significant growth of bacteria in the urine; 46% (61/132) versus 11% (29/276) in residents with negative urine cultures. Positive nitrite dipsticks were more common (p < 10⁻⁶) among residents with positive urine cultures; 64% (84/132) versus 8% (22/276) in residents with negative urine cultures.

- **Symptoms, bacteriuria and antibiotic treatments**: The prevalence of new or increased symptoms, occurring during the last month and still present when urine specimens were obtained, is provided in Table 1. There were no significant differences in the proportion of positive urine cultures among those with or without nonspecific symptoms; however, there were fewer positive urine cultures among residents with urinary frequency (Table 1). Residents with some of the symptoms had a higher prevalence of antibiotic treatments during the last month (Table 2).

### Comparison of test characteristics of urine dipstick and urinalysis at various test cutoff points [^1173eXVD]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The study objective is to compare the test characteristics of urine dipstick and urinalysis at various test cutoff points in women presenting to emergency departments and an intermediate care center with symptoms of urinary tract infection.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective, observational study of adult women presenting to one of two community hospital emergency departments (EDs) or an intermediate care center. The symptoms included dysuria, urgency, or urinary frequency on history, or suprapubic or costovertebral angle tenderness on examination. Patients were excluded if they had taken antibiotics in the past 72 hours, had indwelling Foley catheters, symptomatic vaginal discharge, diabetes mellitus, immunodeficiency disorders, or were unable to provide a reliable history. The patient's clean-catch or catheterized urine specimen was tested immediately by a nurse using a Multistix 9 SG reagent strip. A second aliquot was sent within one hour of collection to the hospital laboratory, where a semiautomated microscopic urinalysis and a urine culture were performed. A positive urine culture was defined as more than 100,000 colonies of one or two uropathogenic bacteria per mL of urine at 48 hours. Dipstick and urinalysis data were compared with urine culture results. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were calculated at various definitions of a positive test or "test cutoff points" for combinations of leukocyte esterase, nitrite, and blood on dipstick and for RBCs and WBCs on urinalysis. The probability of an erroneous decision to withhold treatment on the basis of a negative test result was defined as "undertreatment".

### EAU guidelines on urolithiasis [^111sYGrK]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for nephrolithiasis, more specifically with respect to urine tests, the EAU 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining urinalysis with the following measurements in patients with stones of unknown composition:

- **pH measurement**: Conduct this to assess the acidity or alkalinity of the urine.

- **Dipstick test for leukocytes, erythrocytes, nitrites**: Use this test to check for the presence of white blood cells, red blood cells, and nitrites in the urine.

- **Protein, specific weight**: These measurements help to evaluate the concentration and protein levels in the urine.

- **Urine cultures**: Perform this to identify any bacterial infections present.

- **Microscopy of urinary sediment (morning urine)**: Examine the sediment under a microscope to enhance diagnostic accuracy.

- **Cyanide nitroprusside test (cystine exclusion)**: Use this test to check for the presence of cystine, aiding in the exclusion of cystinuria.

### The NITRATE-OCT study-inorganic nitrate reduces in-stent restenosis in patients with stable coronary artery disease: A double-blind, randomised controlled trial [^112j7GYL]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

Inorganic nitrate, administered once daily, raises levels of nitrite and nitrate in blood, urine, and saliva in patients with CAD.

There was a statistically significant increase at 6 months in the plasma nitrate concentration compared to baseline of approximately 6.1-fold, and a significant increase of about 2.0-fold in plasma nitrite concentration. These rises were accompanied by statistically significant increases in saliva nitrate concentration by approximately 5.6-fold and saliva nitrite by approximately 3.5-fold, as well as urine nitrate concentration by about 5.0-fold and nitrite concentration by around 3.3-fold. In contrast, the levels of nitrite or nitrate remained mostly stable over time in the placebo-treated group, with only a small (1.3-fold) rise in plasma nitrate concentration and a decrease (0.6-fold) in salivary nitrate at 6 months. Inorganic nitrate treatment caused a statistically significant, but clinically unimportant, rise in methaemoglobin levels from 0.3% to 0.5%. Post-hoc analysis of the dose received relative to body weight, and comparison with the extent of in-stent LLL in both groups, identified a statistically significant (P = 0.0083) inverse correlation between the dose received and extent of LLL.

### The association between urinary nitrate and prostate-specific antigen without prostatic disease: a cohort study [^116FGY17]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

The results were obtained after adjusting for age; race (Mexican American, other Hispanic, non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, other race); education level (high school graduate and less than and above); BMI (≥ 25 kg/m², 10ng/mL); urinary creatinine (mg/dL); drinking (no, yes).

This indicates a nonlinear correlation between the prostate-specific antigen ratio and urinary nitrate. Initially, urinary nitrate levels remain relatively stable or exhibit minimal change as the prostate-specific antigen ratio increases. However, as the ratio continues to rise, urinary nitrate levels gradually decrease, with the rate of decline accelerating over time.

### Reproducibility of nitrate-stimulated tilt testing in patients with suspected vasovagal syncope and a healthy control group [^117TMhy3]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Nitrate-stimulated tilt testing may be used to diagnose vasovagal syncope or guide therapy. At the time of writing, the reproducibility of the test in patients with clinically suspected vasovagal syncope and healthy controls is undetermined. A high reproducibility is a prerequisite for correct interpretation of the test result. This study investigates the reproducibility of a nitrate-stimulated tilt test in patients with clinically suspected vasovagal syncope and a healthy control group.

- **Methods and results**: We studied 43 patients (24 women, 19 men) with a typical history of vasovagal syncope and 18 healthy controls (3 women, 15 men). We used a combined tilt protocol with a 30-minute passive and 15-minute nitrate-stimulated phase. The second tilt test was performed 16 ± 12 days after the first. In both patients and controls, overall positive tilt responses were reproduced in the second test 100% of the time. In contrast, the reproducibility of an overall negative test was 50% in patients but 93% in controls. Overall hemodynamic responses to tilt were reproducible in 80%.

Nitrate-stimulated tilt testing in both patients with suspected vasovagal syncope and controls has excellent reproducibility of positive results but moderate reproducibility of negative results. Importantly, these results remain valid at a repeat interval of 2 weeks or longer. These data suggest that in patients with suspected vasovagal syncope, a nitrate-stimulated tilt test may provide a suitable tool to evaluate the efficacy of a therapeutic approach.

### Urinary nitrate concentration as a marker for kidney transplant rejection [^111FvRdm]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Early identification and treatment of kidney transplant rejection episodes are vital to limit loss of function and prolong the life of the transplanted kidney and recipient. Practice depends on detecting a creatinine rise. A biomarker to diagnose transplant rejection at an earlier time point than current practice, or to inform earlier decision-making for biopsy, could be transformative.

It has previously been shown that urinary nitrate concentration is elevated in renal transplant rejection. Nitrate is a nitric oxide (NO) oxidation product. Transplant rejection upregulates NO synthesis via inducible nitric oxide synthase, leading to elevations in urinary nitrate concentration. We have recently validated a urinary nitrate concentration assay which could provide results in a clinically relevant timeframe. Our aim was to determine whether urinary nitrate concentration is a useful tool to predict renal transplant rejection in the context of contemporary clinical practice.

- **Methods**: We conducted a prospective observational study, recruiting renal transplant participants over an 18-month period. We made no alterations to the patients' clinical care, including medications, immunosuppression, diet, and frequency of visits. We collected urine samples from every clinical attendance. We assessed the urinary nitrate to creatinine ratio (uNCR) between patient groups: routine attendances, biopsy-proven rejection, biopsy-proven no rejection, and other callbacks. uNCR was examined over time for those with biopsy-proven transplant rejection.

These four groups were compared.

### The urine anion gap: A clinically useful index of ammonium excretion [^1134MScZ]. The American Journal of the Medical Sciences (1986). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "Urine Anion Gap" is utilized for assessing conditions such as lithium toxicity, ethylene glycol poisoning, sepsis and septic shock, chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injury, metabolic acidosis, and diabetic ketoacidosis.

The Urine Anion Gap (UAG) is primarily used in the evaluation of patients with metabolic acidosis, specifically to differentiate between renal and extrarenal causes. It is calculated using the formula: UAG = (urine sodium + urine potassium) - urine chloride. A positive UAG suggests a renal cause of metabolic acidosis, such as renal tubular acidosis, while a negative UAG indicates an extrarenal cause, such as diarrhea. Importantly, the UAG is not applicable in patients with mixed acid-base disorders or those with significant proteinuria or ketoacidosis, as these conditions can interfere with the accuracy of the calculation.

### Diagnosis, evaluation and follow-up of asymptomatic microhematuria (AMH) in adults: AUA guideline [^115cQW3R]. The Journal of Urology (2012). High credibility.

The Diagnostic Criteria for Asymptomatic Microhematuria is a clinical tool designed to identify patients with asymptomatic microhematuria, a condition that can be an early indicator of serious urologic disease. This tool is particularly useful in primary care settings, where early detection can facilitate timely referral for further diagnostic evaluation and treatment.

The primary components of this diagnostic criteria include the presence of three or more red blood cells per high-power field in a properly collected urinary specimen, and the exclusion of an obvious benign cause. The diagnostic criteria are met if both these conditions are fulfilled. The presence of red blood cells in the urine is a key indicator of microhematuria, while the exclusion of benign causes helps to rule out conditions that may cause similar symptoms but do not require further urologic evaluation.

The result is determined based on these two components. If both conditions are met, the diagnostic criteria for asymptomatic microhematuria are fulfilled. If either condition is not met, the diagnostic criteria are not fulfilled, suggesting that the patient's symptoms may be due to a different cause. This tool thus aids in the accurate diagnosis of asymptomatic microhematuria, enabling appropriate management and treatment of the condition.

The diagnostic criteria for asymptomatic microhematuria are evaluated by considering two essential conditions related to urine analysis:

- **Presence of red blood cells**: The first condition is the presence of three or more red blood cells per high-power field in a properly collected urinary specimen.
- **Exclusion of benign causes**: The second condition is the exclusion of an obvious benign cause. If both conditions are not met, it suggests that the patient's symptoms may be due to a different cause.

### Nitrate, nitrite and nitric oxide reductases: from the last universal common ancestor to modern bacterial pathogens [^113uAgMS]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

The electrochemical gradient that ensues from the enzymatic activity of cytochromes such as nitrate reductase, nitric oxide reductase, and quinol oxidase contributes to the bioenergetics of the bacterial cell. Reduction of nitrogen oxides by bacterial pathogens can, however, be uncoupled from proton translocation and biosynthesis of ATP or NH₄⁺, but still linked to quinol and NADH oxidation. Ancestral nitric oxide reductases, as well as cytochrome c oxidases and quinol bo oxidases evolved from the former, are capable of binding and detoxifying nitric oxide to nitrous oxide. The NO-metabolizing activity associated with these cytochromes can be a sizable source of antinitrosative defense in bacteria during their associations with host cells. Nitrosylation of terminal cytochromes arrests respiration, reprograms bacterial metabolism, stimulates antioxidant defenses, and alters antibiotic cytotoxicity. Collectively, the bioenergetics and regulation of redox homeostasis that accompanies the utilization of nitrogen oxides and detoxification of nitric oxide by cytochromes of the electron transport chain increases fitness of many Gram-positive and -negative pathogens during their associations with invertebrate and vertebrate hosts.

### Intravesical nitric oxide production discriminates between classic and nonulcer interstitial cystitis [^115GTzvD]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Interstitial cystitis (IC) is one of the most bothersome conditions in urological practice. There are two subtypes, classic and nonulcer IC, with similar symptoms but different outcomes concerning clinical course and response to treatment. Histologically, there are fundamental differences between these subtypes: classic IC presents with a severe abnormality of the urothelium and characteristic inflammatory cell infiltrates, while inflammation is scant in nonulcer IC. Regulation of urinary nitric oxide synthase activity has been proposed to be of importance for immunological responses in IC. We present evidence of a profound difference between the two subtypes concerning nitric oxide production, mirroring the differences in inflammatory response in IC.

A total of 17 patients with both subtypes and active disease, as well as patients with disease in remission, were included in the study. All were diagnosed according to National Institute for Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases criteria. Luminal nitric oxide was measured in the bladder of patients using a chemiluminescence nitric oxide analyzer.

All patients with classic IC had high levels of nitric oxide (NO). None of the other patients exhibited any significant increase in NO levels in the bladder. The NO level in patients with classic IC was not related to symptoms but rather to their classification in this specific subgroup of IC. The highest levels of NO were found in patients in the initial phase of classic IC.

The difference in NO evaporation between classic and nonulcer IC allows for subtyping.

### Sole dependence on urine testing strips and the ability to identify clinically significant disease: Challenging the current paradigm for heme detection in general clinical situations [^114vxgmo]. Laboratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The ability of health care professionals to provide patient care is potentially compromised when predicated on untested, although longstanding, perspectives. One such example is urinalysis testing, which has been simplified to use only urine testing strips for the detection of microscopic hematuria.

- **Objective**: To determine whether urine testing strips are sufficient for identification of clinically significant findings in urinalysis.

- **Methods**: To determine the presence of microscopic hematuria, a collection of urine specimens that had tested heme negative was examined during this 3-month study period.

- **Results**: Of the 342 patients from whom urine specimens were examined during this interval, 50 had microscopic hematuria, despite having tested negative for heme via urine testing strip. Additionally, 30% were not receiving any medication known to produce microscopic hematuria, and 18% had clinically significant pathology.

- **Conclusions**: Diagnosis of significant clinical pathologic manifestations would have been compromised had microscopic examination not been performed on the urine specimens from the individuals in the cohort. Examination of the novel approach of including microscopic examination of specimens in a specific clinical situation challenges the dominant paradigm of reliance on assaying using urine testing strips only. This reveals that the method is not only unreliable for determining microscopic hematuria but also is less than optimal in general clinical practice. The findings of this study provide evidence of the importance of microscopic evaluation as a routine component in specific clinical settings.

### The use of urinary dipstick tests to exclude urinary tract infection: a systematic review of the literature [^1161SvQk]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

Several systematic reviews have examined the use of dipstick tests to diagnose or rule in urinary tract infection (UTI). We examined the evidence relating to the use of urine leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests in adults to exclude or rule out UTI. A search of the literature from 1966 to 2003 revealed 30 studies containing relevant and suitable information, and 23 of these, which used a cut-off of 108 colony-forming units per liter, were combined in a meta-analysis.

The leukocyte esterase or nitrite test combination, with one or the other test positive, was used in 14 studies and showed the highest sensitivity and the lowest negative likelihood ratio. While there was significant heterogeneity between the studies, 7 of 14 demonstrated significant decreases in pretest to posttest probability, with a pooled posttest probability of 5% for the negative result. In certain circumstances, there is evidence for the use of urinalysis as a rule-out test for UTI.

### Urinalysis findings and urinary kidney injury biomarker concentrations [^117GgmrA]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

In this post-hoc analysis of a subcohort from a large, multicenter prospective cohort study of cardiac surgery patients without creatinine-based acute kidney injury, we did not find evidence of an association between either pre- or postoperative biomarker levels and age or sex. However, there were significant differences in biomarker levels associated with urine dipstick findings, including proteinuria, hematuria, leukocyte esterase, and nitrites.

All biomarkers were mildly correlated with hematuria, indicating that blood might interfere with biomarker levels or their measurement, even in the absence of overt kidney injury evidenced by creatinine rise. Preexisting substances in the urine interfering with assays for novel analytes have been previously described.

We found evidence that proteinuria is associated with all four biomarkers both pre- and post-operatively. Dipstick proteinuria is a marker of preexisting kidney damage and is associated with both the incidence and outcomes of acute kidney injury. In addition, there is evidence that proteinuria may represent subclinical or early acute tubular necrosis, which has not yet manifested as a rise in creatinine. Thus, part of the correlation we observed between proteinuria and biomarker levels may be the association between proteinuria and subclinical kidney injury. When we adjusted for measures of discrimination of AKI for urine protein, all pre-op AUCs diminished, and 2 of the 4 post-operative AUCs diminished. Since dipstick proteinuria is a readily available and inexpensive test, future studies should assess…

### Nitric oxide for preventing pre-eclampsia and its complications [^115DjLp6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Pre-eclampsia, a multisystem disorder of pregnancy characterized by high blood pressure and protein in the urine, is associated with endothelial dysfunction. Nitric oxide mediates many functions of the endothelium, including vasodilatation and inhibition of platelet aggregation. Pre-eclampsia may be associated with nitric oxide deficiency, but the evidence to support this suggestion is contradictory. Nevertheless, it has been hypothesized that agents which increase nitric oxide may prevent pre-eclampsia.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness and safety of nitric oxide donors and precursors for preventing pre-eclampsia and its complications.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (November 2006), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 3), and EMBASE (2002 to December 2004).

- **Selection criteria**: Studies were included if they were randomized trials evaluating nitric oxide donors or precursors for preventing pre-eclampsia and its complications.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Both review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. Data were extracted and double-checked for accuracy.

- **Main results**: Six trials (310 women) were included. Four were of good quality and two were of uncertain quality. Four trials (170 women) compared nitric oxide donors (glyceryl trinitrate) or precursors (L-arginine) with either placebo or no intervention. There are insufficient data for reliable conclusions about the effects on pre-eclampsia (four trials, 170 women; relative risk (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.

### Association of urinary nitrate with diabetes complication and disease-specific mortality among adults with hyperglycemia [^1126bzxd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

**Sensitivity analysis**: Four sets of sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the association between urinary nitrate and diabetes complications, disease-specific, and all-cause mortality. In set 1, participants who had a follow-up period of less than 2 years were excluded to assess the impact of acute illness or accident on results. In set 2, we excluded the participants who had extreme values (> 99% and/or < 1%) of urinary creatinine, perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate. In set 3, corrected urinary perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate values were calculated by dividing by urinary creatinine, which was further used in the statistical model to exclude the impact of urine dilution on the results. In set 4, we evaluated whether age, gender, BMI, smoking, and drinking had a modification effect on these relationships.

### Food sources of nitrates and nitrites: The physiologic context for potential health benefits [^113TqxMG]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

The presence of nitrates and nitrites in food is associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal cancer and, in infants, methemoglobinemia. Despite the physiological roles for nitrate and nitrite in vascular and immune function, consideration of food sources of nitrates and nitrites as healthful dietary components has received little attention. Approximately 80% of dietary nitrates are derived from vegetable consumption; sources of nitrites include vegetables, fruit, and processed meats. Nitrites are produced endogenously through the oxidation of nitric oxide and through a reduction of nitrate by commensal bacteria in the mouth and gastrointestinal tract.

The dietary provision of nitrates and nitrites from vegetables and fruit may contribute to the blood pressure-lowering effects of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. We quantified nitrate and nitrite concentrations by HPLC in a convenience sample of foods. Incorporating these values into two hypothetical dietary patterns that emphasize high-nitrate or low-nitrate vegetable and fruit choices based on the DASH diet, we found that nitrate concentrations in these two patterns vary from 174 to 1222 mg. The hypothetical high-nitrate DASH diet pattern exceeds the World Health Organization's Acceptable Daily Intake for nitrate by 550% for a 60-kg adult. These data call into question the rationale for recommendations to limit nitrate and nitrite consumption from plant foods; a comprehensive reevaluation of the health effects of food sources of nitrates and nitrites is appropriate.

### Plasma nitrate and incidence of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in the community: The Framingham Offspring Study [^114XK42R]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Plasma nitrate is frequently considered a measure of the individual's overall exposure to nitrate derived from various (patho-) physiological pathways and exogenous (i.e. dietary) sources, as well as the individual's capacity to eliminate nitrate. Dietary intake of nitrate in the United States is commonly estimated to range between 40 and 100 mg/d but may exceed 1200 mg with specific diets or dietary supplements. High doses of nitrate may be required to significantly increase the plasma nitrate concentration.

In adults, a low (≈35 mg/d of nitrate for a person of 70 kg) or high (≈133 mg/d of nitrate for a person of 70 kg) nitrate diet induced no clinically relevant fluctuations or differences in the plasma nitrate concentration. However, specific nitrate-enriched diets or intake of dietary supplements corresponding to nitrate doses above 300 mg may lead to significant fluctuations and increases in plasma nitrate, with peak concentrations reached after ≈1 to 3.0 hours. Urinary nitrate excretion usually exceeds dietary intake, which indicates a significant endogenous nitrate formation rate. NO synthesis has been identified as the major endogenous source of nitrite and nitrate. However, NO is highly reactive and has a short half-life in vivo, which precludes its measurement outside of experimental settings. Free NO reacts within seconds to form nitrite (NO₂⁻), which, in turn, rapidly reacts to form nitrate (NO₃⁻). This process may explain the variations in plasma nitrate concentration.

### Chemet [^116qzp3b]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: CHEMET may interfere with serum and urinary laboratory tests.

- **Laboratory test interference**: CHEMET may cause interference in laboratory tests involving serum and urine. In vitro studies indicate that CHEMET can lead to false positives for ketones in urine when using nitroprusside reagents. It may also result in falsely decreased measurements of serum uric acid and creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) levels.

- **Use with other chelation therapies**: The concurrent use of CHEMET with other chelation therapies, such as CaNa2EDTA, is not recommended.

### When should a new test become the current reference standard [^1179B8zu]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The evaluation of claims that a new diagnostic test is better than the gold standard test is hindered by the lack of a perfect reference judge. However, this problem may be sidestepped by focusing on the clinical consequences of the decision rather than on the estimation of accuracy. Consequences can be assessed by the use of a "fair umpire" test that is not perfect yet can discriminate between disease and non-disease cases and is not biased in favor of one test.

This article discusses three principles to aid judgments about the value of new tests. First, the consequences are best examined in cases with disagreement between the tests. Second, resolving these disagreements requires a fair, but not necessarily perfect, umpire test. Finally, umpire tests include consequences, such as prognosis and response to treatment, as well as causal exposures and other test results.

### Neglected analytes in the 24-h urine: Ammonium and sulfate [^117SLVRP]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). High credibility.

Evaluation of the kidney stone patient includes measurement of 24-hour urine chemistries. This review summarizes the application of physiological principles to the interpretation of urine chemistries, using sulfate and ammonium to estimate diet acid load and the renal response.

Recent findings show increased recognition of the need to measure urine ammonium excretion in clinical settings to understand renal acid excretion. Some 24-hour urine kidney stone panels include ammonium measurements, providing an opportunity to apply this measurement to clinical practice. To better interpret ammonium excretion, an estimate of dietary acid load is needed to understand the driving forces for ammonium excretion. Sulfate is also included in some kidney stone panels and functions as an estimate of diet acid load. By combining these analytes with urine pH, clinicians can quickly estimate dietary stone risk as well as potential bowel disease, acidification disorders, and the presence of urease-producing bacteria, all of which can affect stone risk.

Measurement of ammonium and sulfate excretion, along with urine pH, provides important insights into the acid/alkali content of diet, presence and severity of bowel disease, presence of renal acidification disorders, and urinary infection.
