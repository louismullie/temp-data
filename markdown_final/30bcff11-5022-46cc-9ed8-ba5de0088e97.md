## Question

Medicine used for anginal pain other than nitrate

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about medications for anginal pain other than nitrates. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the distinction between immediate relief and chronic symptom control. Then, I should verify the guideline-backed first-line non-nitrate classes and their mechanisms. Next, I will examine second-line agents and where they fit. After that, I need to consider special populations such as vasospastic angina, microvascular angina, heart failure, and patients on PDE5 inhibitors. Finally, I should review combination strategies, safety, and practical prescribing pearls before summarizing the hierarchy and key takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: angina reflects a supply–demand mismatch, and while short-acting nitrates remain first-line for acute relief, the question here is about non-nitrate options for chronic symptom control and for patients who cannot take nitrates, so I should keep the acute versus chronic distinction explicit and ensure I'm not conflating them [^1138Vzvo] [^1128KimB].

> I will now examine the guideline-backed first-line non-nitrate classes, starting with beta-blockers, because they reduce heart rate and contractility, thereby lowering myocardial oxygen demand; wait, let me verify the strength of evidence and any caveats. Contemporary guidelines endorse beta-blockers as a first-line antianginal option, with meta-analytic data showing fewer angina episodes versus calcium channel blockers and no mortality difference, though the evidence base for "first choice" is weaker than traditionally assumed, so I should be cautious not to overstate hierarchy [^114eteL7] [^113cb9Yy].

> Next, I should review calcium channel blockers, both dihydropyridines and non-dihydropyridines, which reduce afterload and coronary vasomotor tone; hold on, I should verify their role in vasospastic angina specifically. For vasospastic angina, calcium channel blockers are first-line and beta-blockers are generally avoided due to potential unopposed alpha-agonism that may worsen spasm, so I need to ensure I tailor the class choice to the suspected mechanism [^113fzk68] [^115oQ6R1].

> Let me consider the second-line agents, and I should confirm where ranolazine fits. Ranolazine, a late sodium current inhibitor, is recommended as add-on therapy for patients who remain symptomatic despite beta-blockers, CCBs, or long-acting nitrates, with randomized data showing reductions in angina frequency and nitroglycerin use; I should double-check that it does not improve mortality, which is correct, so expectations should remain symptom-focused [^116dTCon] [^115gq4xR].

> I need to check ivabradine next, especially for patients with contraindications to beta-blockers or persistent elevated heart rate. Ivabradine lowers sinus rate via If inhibition and has shown noninferiority to atenolol and amlodipine in stable angina, with particular utility when resting heart rate remains high despite therapy; wait, I should confirm that it is not a vasodilator and thus avoids hypotension, which is accurate [^114eteL7] [^113cb9Yy].

> Now, nicorandil deserves attention; hold on, I should verify its availability and outcomes data. Nicorandil, a potassium channel opener with nitrate-like effects, reduced major coronary events in the IONA trial and is used as add-on therapy in some regions, though it is not available in the United States; I should note that while it can be effective for refractory angina, regional access and adverse effects like ulcers may limit use [^112kWWTr] [^114oDPMj].

> Let me synthesize the non-nitrate hierarchy without overstating any single agent. Practically, beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers are the core first-line non-nitrate options, with ranolazine and ivabradine as preferred add-ons when symptoms persist or when first-line agents are not tolerated, and nicorandil as a regional option with outcome data; I should confirm that guidelines emphasize individualized selection and combination therapy when needed, which they do [^113cb9Yy] [^113fwhca].

> But wait, what if the angina phenotype is vasospastic rather than classic exertional ischemia; I should double-check the approach. In vasospastic angina, calcium channel blockers are first-line and beta-blockers should generally be avoided, with long-acting nitrates considered adjuncts and short-acting nitrates for acute episodes; I need to ensure I also mention statins and smoking cessation as supportive therapies that reduce vasoreactivity and events in this phenotype [^113fzk68] [^114oDPMj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about nitrates in microvascular angina; I should verify whether long-acting nitrates help or harm. In coronary microvascular dysfunction, long-acting nitrates are often ineffective and may worsen symptoms via steal physiology, so beta-blockers or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are preferred first-line, with ranolazine or nicorandil considered if symptoms persist; I need to ensure I also note that ACE inhibitors and statins can improve endothelial function and symptoms in selected patients [^114GGJnY] [^113anHSn] [^111oC9oF].

> I should confirm the approach in heart failure with concomitant angina, because not all vasodilators are safe. In HFrEF, beta-blockers and nitrates are favored for angina control, while most calcium channel blockers should be avoided except for amlodipine, which does not worsen survival; this means that when choosing a non-nitrate, I need to prefer beta-blockers and avoid non-DHP CCBs in significant LV dysfunction [^112ELAWM] [^114MZdPf].

> Next, I should review the critical drug–drug interaction with PDE5 inhibitors, and I need to ensure timing is precise. Nitrates are contraindicated within 24 hours of sildenafil or vardenafil and within 48 hours of tadalafil due to the risk of profound hypotension; therefore, in patients who require PDE5 inhibitors, non-nitrate antianginals such as beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ranolazine, or ivabradine must be used for symptom control, and I should explicitly counsel on this hazard [^113PUmRb] [^111f5UDm] [^115UWCj8].

> Let me think about combination therapy and practical sequencing, and I should double-check that guidelines endorse stepwise addition. If angina persists on a single agent, adding a second from a different class is recommended, for example beta-blocker plus dihydropyridine CCB, or beta-blocker plus ranolazine or ivabradine, with attention to heart rate, blood pressure, and conduction effects; I should confirm that dose optimization is often underdone in practice, which trials and quality studies repeatedly show [^113cb9Yy] [^113fwhca] [^112LAE6d].

> I need to ensure safety and monitoring are addressed, and I should verify specific cautions. Non-DHP CCBs can worsen bradycardia or LV dysfunction when combined with beta-blockers, ranolazine can prolong QT and requires baseline and periodic ECGs, and abrupt nitrate withdrawal can precipitate rebound angina in some patients, so any nitrate taper should be deliberate and monitored; these points should be incorporated into follow-up plans [^113fwhca] [^1149kaAL].

> Let me reconsider the overall hierarchy to ensure internal consistency and alignment with evidence. Non-nitrate antianginals include beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers as foundational first-line therapy, with ranolazine and ivabradine as key second-line options for persistent symptoms or intolerance, and nicorandil as a regional alternative with outcome benefit; selection should be phenotype-driven, with calcium channel blockers prioritized in vasospastic angina, beta-blockers or CCBs in microvascular angina, and careful avoidance of harmful combinations such as nitrates with recent PDE5 inhibitor use [^113cb9Yy] [^113fzk68] [^114GGJnY] [^113PUmRb].

---

Non-nitrate antianginal options include **beta-blockers** (first-line for chronic angina) [^113cb9Yy], **calcium channel blockers** (especially for vasospastic angina) [^113fzk68], and **ranolazine** (add-on for refractory symptoms) [^116dTCon]. Ivabradine is appropriate for **persistent angina with elevated heart rate** or when beta-blockers are not tolerated [^114eteL7], and **nicorandil** is an alternative where available [^112kWWTr]. Trimetazidine is used in some regions for **metabolic modulation** [^113iVktZ]. These agents reduce angina frequency and improve exercise tolerance, but do not reduce mortality; selection should be individualized based on comorbidities and tolerance [^1138Vzvo].

---

## Beta-blockers

Beta-blockers are a cornerstone of **antianginal therapy**, reducing myocardial oxygen demand by decreasing heart rate, contractility, and blood pressure [^113fwhca]. They are **particularly beneficial** in patients with chronic stable angina, especially those with concomitant hypertension, arrhythmias, or prior myocardial infarction [^notfound].

- **Mechanism of action**: Beta-blockers competitively inhibit beta-adrenergic receptors, reducing sympathetic activity, heart rate, and myocardial contractility, thereby decreasing myocardial oxygen demand [^114eteL7].

- **Clinical evidence**: Beta-blockers have been shown to reduce angina frequency, improve exercise tolerance, and delay ischemia during stress testing [^113fwhca].

- **Limitations**: Beta-blockers may be contraindicated in patients with bradycardia, severe asthma, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [^notfound].

---

## Calcium channel blockers (CCBs)

Calcium channel blockers are another **first-line therapy** for angina, particularly effective in vasospastic angina and in patients who cannot tolerate beta-blockers [^113fzk68]. They reduce myocardial oxygen demand by decreasing afterload and coronary vasospasm [^113abVGv].

- **Mechanism of action**: CCBs inhibit calcium influx into vascular smooth muscle and myocardial cells, leading to vasodilation, reduced afterload, and decreased myocardial oxygen demand [^notfound].

- **Clinical evidence**: CCBs effectively reduce angina frequency, improve exercise tolerance, and are particularly useful in vasospastic angina [^113fzk68].

- **Limitations**: Non-dihydropyridine CCBs (e.g. verapamil, diltiazem) may cause bradycardia and should be used cautiously in patients with conduction abnormalities [^113fwhca].

---

## Ranolazine

Ranolazine is a **second-line antianginal agent** recommended for patients with persistent angina despite optimal therapy with beta-blockers, CCBs, or long-acting nitrates [^116dTCon]. It exerts its antianginal effects by inhibiting the late sodium current, thereby reducing intracellular calcium overload and myocardial oxygen demand [^112P42g1].

- **Mechanism of action**: Ranolazine inhibits the late sodium current, reducing intracellular calcium accumulation, myocardial oxygen demand, and ischemia-induced ventricular dysfunction [^112P42g1].

- **Clinical evidence**: Ranolazine significantly reduces angina frequency and improves exercise tolerance in patients with chronic stable angina [^115gq4xR].

- **Limitations**: Ranolazine may cause QT prolongation and should be used cautiously in patients with existing QT prolongation or those on QT-prolonging medications [^1149kaAL].

---

## Ivabradine

Ivabradine is a **selective inhibitor of the funny current (If)** in the sinoatrial node, resulting in heart rate reduction without affecting myocardial contractility or blood pressure. It is particularly useful in patients with angina and elevated heart rate or those intolerant to beta-blockers [^114eteL7].

- **Mechanism of action**: Ivabradine selectively inhibits the If current, reducing heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand without affecting contractility or blood pressure [^114eteL7].

- **Clinical evidence**: Ivabradine has been shown to reduce angina frequency, improve exercise tolerance, and delay ischemia during stress testing [^notfound].

- **Limitations**: Ivabradine may cause bradycardia and visual disturbances (phosphenes) [^notfound].

---

## Nicorandil

Nicorandil is a **potassium channel opener** that provides both vasodilatory and antianginal effects. It is particularly useful in patients with vasospastic angina or those intolerant to other antianginal agents [^11222RH4].

- **Mechanism of action**: Nicorandil opens potassium channels, leading to vasodilation, reduced preload and afterload, and decreased myocardial oxygen demand [^11677a7T].

- **Clinical evidence**: Nicorandil has been shown to reduce angina frequency and improve exercise tolerance, with additional cardioprotective benefits demonstrated in the IONA trial [^112kWWTr].

- **Limitations**: Nicorandil may cause gastrointestinal ulcers and should be used cautiously in patients with gastrointestinal disorders [^notfound].

---

## Trimetazidine

Trimetazidine is a **metabolic modulator** that improves myocardial energy metabolism, thereby reducing ischemia-induced cellular damage and improving cardiac function. It is particularly useful in patients with persistent angina despite optimal therapy [^113iVktZ].

- **Mechanism of action**: Trimetazidine optimizes myocardial energy metabolism by shifting energy production from fatty acid oxidation to glucose oxidation, thereby preserving cellular function during ischemia [^notfound].

- **Clinical evidence**: Trimetazidine has been shown to reduce angina frequency, improve exercise tolerance, and enhance quality of life in patients with chronic stable angina [^notfound].

- **Limitations**: Trimetazidine may cause gastrointestinal disturbances and should be used cautiously in patients with gastrointestinal disorders [^notfound].

---

Non-nitrate antianginal medications include beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ranolazine, ivabradine, nicorandil, and trimetazidine. These agents provide effective symptom relief and improve exercise tolerance, but **do not significantly reduce mortality**. Selection should be individualized based on patient comorbidities, tolerance, and specific angina phenotype [^1138Vzvo].

### Pharmacological and emerging therapies in the treatment of chronic angina [^11713b2i]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Chronic angina is a common manifestation of ischaemic heart disease. Medical treatments are the mainstay approach to reduce the occurrence of angina and improve patients' quality of life. This Series paper focuses on commonly used standard treatments (eg, nitrates, β blockers, and calcium-channel blockers), emerging anti-angina treatments (which are not available in all parts of the world), and experimental treatments. Although many emerging treatments are available, evidence is scarce about their ability to reduce angina and ischaemia.

### Angina (chronic stable) [^113eN98s]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Stable angina is usually caused by coronary atherosclerosis, and affects up to 16% of men and 10% of women aged 65–74 years in the UK. Risk factors include hypertension, elevated serum cholesterol levels, smoking, physical inactivity, and overweight. People with angina are at increased risk of other cardiovascular events and mortality compared with people without angina. Among people not thought to need coronary artery revascularisation, annual mortality is 1–2% and the annual non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) rate is 2–3%.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are effects of long-term drug treatment for stable angina? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2007 (BMJ Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found nine systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the long-term effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, long-acting nitrates, potassium channel openers, combinations of these anti-anginal drug treatments and the use of these anti-anginal drug treatment as an adjunct to existing therapies.

The goals of optimal medical therapy in patients with stable angina pectoris are to reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality and future cardiovascular events, improve exercise capacity, and enhance quality of life. Whereas myocardial revascularization is frequently employed in the management of patients with stable angina, a variety of pharmacologic interventions are recommended as part of optimal medical management. The use of short- and rapidly-acting nitrates (eg, sublingual nitroglycerin spray and tablets) is at the core of the therapeutic armamentarium and should be integrated into optimal medical therapy for stable angina along with exercise therapy. The potential clinical implications from these observations are that prophylactic sublingual nitrates, when combined with cardiac rehabilitation, may allow the patient with angina to exercise to a greater functional capacity than without sublingual nitrates.

Short‑acting nitrates for acute angina relief — practical use and comparative formulation data: Short‑acting nitrates help to relieve acute episodes of angina, and administering a short‑acting nitrate prior to activity that typically triggers symptoms can decrease symptoms. In randomized studies, nitroglycerin spray compared with a sublingual formulation is more effective and efficient at relieving angina, with less headache.

Regarding medical management for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to antianginal therapy, ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate antianginal therapy with either a β-blocker, CCB, or long-acting nitrate to relieve angina or equivalent symptoms in patients with chronic coronary disease and angina. Add a second antianginal agent from a different therapeutic class (β-blockers, CCBs, long-acting nitrates) if remaining symptomatic after initial treatment.

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) — analgesics: Patients presenting with known or suspected ACS often experience chest pain or other uncomfortable symptoms, and rapid and effective pain relief remains an important treatment goal to prevent sympathetic activation and adverse clinical sequelae. Analgesic therapies may provide symptomatic relief, but they have not been shown to improve clinical outcomes in patients with ACS. Nitrates and opiate medications remain effective treatment options for management of pain in ACS but should be thoughtfully utilized to prevent potential harm, and rapid coronary revascularization should be pursued for patients with ongoing ischemic symptoms that are not relieved with nitrates.

### Expert consensus document: A' diamond'approach to personalized treatment of angina [^113iVktZ]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

In clinical guidelines, drugs for symptomatic angina are classified as being first choice (β-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, short-acting nitrates) or second choice (ivabradine, nicorandil, ranolazine, trimetazidine), with the recommendation to reserve second-choice medications for patients who have contraindications to first-choice agents, do not tolerate them, or remain symptomatic. No direct comparisons between first-choice and second-choice treatments have demonstrated the superiority of one group of drugs over the other. Meta-analyses show that all antianginal drugs have similar efficacy in reducing symptoms, but provide no evidence for improvement in survival. The newer, second-choice drugs have more evidence-based clinical data that are more contemporary than is available for traditional first-choice drugs. Considering some drugs, but not others, to be first choice is, therefore, difficult. Moreover, double or triple therapy is often needed to control angina. Patients with angina can have several comorbidities, and symptoms can result from various underlying pathophysiologies. Some agents, in addition to having antianginal effects, have properties that could be useful depending on the comorbidities present and the mechanisms of angina, but the guidelines do not provide recommendations on the optimal combinations of drugs. In this Consensus Statement, we propose an individualized approach to angina treatment, which takes into consideration the patient, their comorbidities, and the underlying mechanism of disease.

### Vardenafil [^115UWCj8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WHO SHOULD NOT TAKE VARDENAFIL ORALLY DISINTEGRATING TABLETS?

Do not take Vardenafil orally disintegrating tablet if you:

Take any medicines called "nitrates" (see "What important information should you know about vardenafil orally disintegrating tablet?"). Nitrates are commonly used to treat angina. Angina is a symptom of heart disease and can cause pain in your chest, jaw, or down your arm. Medicines called nitrates include nitroglycerin that is found in tablets, sprays, ointments, pastes, or patches. Nitrates can also be found in other medicines such as isosorbide dinitrate or isosorbide mononitrate. Some recreational drugs called "poppers" also contain nitrates, such as amyl nitrate and butyl nitrate. Do not use vardenafil orally disintegrating tablet if you are using these drugs. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure if any of your medicines are nitrates.
Take riociguat, a guanylate cyclase stimulator, a medicine that treats pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic-thrombotic pulmonary hypertension.
Have been told by your healthcare provider to not have sexual activity because of health problems. Sexual activity can put an extra strain on your heart, especially if your heart is already weak from a heart attack or heart disease.

### Stable angina – who needs revascularisation? [^114dZXdq]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2007). Low credibility.

In the UK, about 5% of men and 3% of women have, or have had, angina. Also, estimates suggest that, each year, around 340,000 people present with the symptom for the first time. Characterised by pain or discomfort in the chest, angina is usually caused by atherosclerotic coronary artery disease and so carries an increased risk of cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction and death from coronary heart disease (CHD). In stable angina, the symptoms are induced by exertion, reflecting the limitation of blood supply through the narrowed arteries and the resulting myocardial ischaemia. The condition is not only potentially distressing, but may also limit daily function and quality of life. To address these problems and the elevated cardiovascular risk, standard management includes lifestyle measures (e.g. physical activity without excessive exertion, stopping smoking, weight control); tackling other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. raised blood pressure, diabetes mellitus); and medication to control angina (e.g. nitrates, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists) and to reduce overall cardiovascular risk (e.g. aspirin, statin therapy). Where such non-invasive measures alone are inadequate, revascularisation (restoration of adequate blood supply to the heart muscle) by using coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may also be needed. Here we discuss methods for, and difficulties in, assessing patients who present with suspected stable angina to identify those who could benefit from revascularisation.

### Anti-anginal drugs-beliefs and evidence: systematic review covering 50 years of medical treatment [^1138Vzvo]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic stable angina is the most prevalent symptom of ischaemic heart disease and its management is a priority. Current guidelines recommend pharmacological therapy with drugs classified as being first line (beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, short acting nitrates) or second line (long-acting nitrates, ivabradine, nicorandil, ranolazine, and trimetazidine). Second line drugs are indicated for patients who have contraindications to first line agents, do not tolerate them or remain symptomatic. Evidence that one drug is superior to another has been questioned. Between January and March 2018, we performed a systematic review of articles written in English over the past 50years English-written articles in Medline and Embase following preferred reporting items and the Cochrane collaboration approach. We included double blind randomized studies comparing parallel groups on treatment of angina in patients with stable coronary artery disease, with a sample size of, at least, 100 patients (50 patients per group), with a minimum follow-up of 1 week and an outcome measured on exercise testing, duration of exercise being the preferred outcome. Thirteen studies fulfilled our criteria. Nine studies involved between 100 and 300 patients, (2818 in total) and a further four enrolled greater than 300 patients. Evidence of equivalence was demonstrated for the use of beta-blockers (atenolol), calcium antagonists (amlodipine, nifedipine), and channel inhibitor (ivabradine) in three of these studies. Taken all together, in none of the studies was there evidence that one drug was superior to another in the treatment of angina or to prolong total exercise duration. There is a paucity of data comparing the efficacy of anti-anginal agents. The little available evidence shows that no anti-anginal drug is superior to another and equivalence has been shown only for three classes of drugs. Guidelines draw conclusions not from evidence but from clinical beliefs.

### Inorganic nitrate in angina study: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^115B1p1t]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

In this double-blind randomized placebo-controlled crossover trial, we investigated whether oral sodium nitrate, when added to existing background medication, reduces exertional ischemia in patients with angina.

Methods and Results

Seventy patients with stable angina, positive electrocardiogram treadmill test, and either angiographic or functional test evidence of significant ischemic heart disease were randomized to receive oral treatment with either placebo or sodium nitrate (600 mg; 7 mmol) for 7 to 10 days, followed by a 2-week washout period before crossing over to the other treatment (n = 34 placebo-nitrate, n = 36 nitrate-placebo). At baseline and at the end of each treatment, patients underwent modified Bruce electrocardiogram treadmill test, modified Seattle Questionnaire, and subgroups were investigated with dobutamine stress, echocardiogram, and blood tests. The primary outcome was time to 1 mm ST depression on electrocardiogram treadmill test. Compared with placebo, inorganic nitrate treatment tended to increase the primary outcome exercise time to 1 mm ST segment depression (645.6 [603.1, 688.0] seconds versus 661.2 [6183, 704.0] seconds, P = 0.10) and significantly increased total exercise time (744.4 [702.4, 786.4] seconds versus 760.9 [719.5, 802.2] seconds, P = 0.04; mean [95% confidence interval]). Nitrate treatment robustly increased plasma nitrate (18.3 [15.2, 21.5] versus 297.6 [218.4, 376.8] μmol/L, P < 0.0001) and almost doubled circulating nitrite concentrations (346 [285, 405] versus 552 [398, 706] nmol/L, P = 0.003; placebo versus nitrate treatment). Other secondary outcomes were not significantly altered by the intervention. Patients on antacid medication appeared to benefit less from nitrate supplementation.

Conclusions

Sodium nitrate treatment may confer a modest exercise capacity benefit in patients with chronic angina who are taking other background medication.

### Inorganic nitrate in angina study: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^115FdJih]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

In our study population there were no differences in Modified Seattle Questionnaire, use of GTN, or angina between treatment arms. It has to be noted that the latter 3 secondary outcomes were always felt to be particularly weak end points for this particular study design; nevertheless, we felt they should be reported. The treatment arms were short, and angina episodes and GTN use were less frequently reported than expected during the individual test weeks (< 1 per treatment period, Table 2).

Nowadays, revascularization is performed rapidly after listing for a procedure. Therefore, we elected a relatively short treatment period (7 to 10 days) to avoid interference with potential clinical revascularization plans. We cannot exclude a greater effect with a longer treatment period.

Many of our patients were elderly, had multivessel disease, and over years adapted their lifestyle to avoid angina. There was a clear discrepancy between their infrequent subjective reporting of angina despite objective severe disease, limiting chest pain on treadmill testing, and electrocardigraphic and echocardiographic evidence of inducible ischemia on functional testing. Even patients who on screening in their own description belonged to Canadian Cardiovascular Society class III were objectively limited on exercise at low workload but reported only 1 or even no angina episodes and little GTN use during the test weeks later. Consequently, the study was underpowered for these secondary end points. Despite previous reports of proangiogenic markers in skeletal muscle (animal model) and plasma in healthy volunteers, we observed no increase in systemic proangiogenic markers in our angina population.

### Inorganic nitrate in angina study: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^1124daC5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

It is difficult to prove antianginal effects in patients on multiple background medications. Although our findings indicate at most modest effects of nitrate when it is given as add‐on therapy, we cannot rule out a stronger benefit if given as a monotherapy. However, we believe that the strength of our study lies in the analysis of real‐life clinical scenarios including patients with multiple comorbidities on polypharmacy. The crossover design made it possible to account for this variation. Chronic angina patients would be very unlikely to be treated with inorganic nitrate monotherapy in the presence of potent first‐line anti‐anginals, and similar studies would be ethically difficult to defend. In this context, it is quite exciting that a dietary treatment strategy has modest benefits on exercise capacity without lowering BP or heart rate. No current standard antianginal medication offers any prognostic benefit for the patients. In the context of a trend to increased time to 1‐mm ST depression and a significantly increased total exercise capacity together with the well‐described prognostic benefit of a nitrate‐rich Mediterranean diet or the fruit‐ and vegetable‐rich DASH diet, 2, 48, 57 it appears appropriate to recommend that angina patients adhere to the above diets. Although the treatment period was relatively short (in order to avoid interference of natural disease progression on the outcome analysis in this crossover design), the supplementation resulted in better exercise performance. The results of a longer‐term supplementation will need to be established in further studies. Although rare and usually mild, nausea and vomiting were reported. Patients ought to be alerted to this possible adverse effect.

### Inorganic nitrate in angina study: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^114mcCK6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

In this double‐blind randomized placebo‐controlled crossover trial, we investigated whether oral sodium nitrate, when added to existing background medication, reduces exertional ischemia in patients with angina.

Methods and Results

Seventy patients with stable angina, positive electrocardiogram treadmill test, and either angiographic or functional test evidence of significant ischemic heart disease were randomized to receive oral treatment with either placebo or sodium nitrate (600 mg; 7 mmol) for 7 to 10 days, followed by a 2‐week washout period before crossing over to the other treatment (n = 34 placebo‐nitrate, n = 36 nitrate‐placebo). At baseline and at the end of each treatment, patients underwent modified Bruce electrocardiogram treadmill test, modified Seattle Questionnaire, and subgroups were investigated with dobutamine stress, echocardiogram, and blood tests. The primary outcome was time to 1 mmdepression on electrocardiogram treadmill test. Compared with placebo, inorganic nitrate treatment tended to increase the primary outcome exercise time to 1 mmsegment depression (645.6 [603.1, 688.0] seconds versus 661.2 [6183, 704.0] seconds, P = 0.10) and significantly increased total exercise time (744.4 [702.4, 786.4] seconds versus 760.9 [719.5, 802.2] seconds, P = 0.04; mean [95% confidence interval]). Nitrate treatment robustly increased plasma nitrate (18.3 [15.2, 21.5] versus 297.6 [218.4, 376.8] μmol/L, P < 0.0001) and almost doubled circulating nitrite concentrations (346 [285, 405] versus 552 [398, 706] nmol/L, P = 0.003; placebo versus nitrate treatment). Other secondary outcomes were not significantly altered by the intervention. Patients on antacid medication appeared to benefit less from nitrate supplementation.

Conclusions

Sodium nitrate treatment may confer a modest exercise capacity benefit in patients with chronic angina who are taking other background medication.

### Medical therapy versus myocardial revascularization in chronic coronary syndrome and stable angina [^114aNenx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of death in the United States. Angina is encountered frequently in clinical practice. Effective management of patients with coronary artery disease and stable angina should consist of therapy aimed at symptom control and reduction of adverse clinical outcomes. Therapeutic options for angina include antianginal drugs: nitrates, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ranolazine, and myocardial revascularization. Recent trials have shown that although revascularization is slightly better in controlling symptoms, optimal medical therapy that includes aggressive risk factor modification is equally effective in reducing the risk of future coronary events and death. On the basis of the available data, it seems appropriate to prescribe optimal medical therapy in most patients with coronary artery disease and stable angina, and reserve myocardial revascularization for selected patients with disabling symptoms despite optimal medical therapy.

### Treatment of refractory angina in patients not suitable for revascularization [^114HMdGw]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

A growing number of patients, particularly those with advanced, chronic coronary artery disease, experience symptoms of angina that are refractory to treatment with β-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and long-acting nitrates, despite revascularization. The management of patients with refractory angina who are unsuitable for further revascularization is strikingly different across the world, and is contingent on local resources and available expertise. Mortality in this patient population has decreased, but enhancing quality of life remains a challenge. New treatment principles are emerging in current practice, such as metabolic modulation, therapeutic angiogenesis, and novel interventional techniques (coronary in-flow redistribution and approaches to chronic total occlusion). The contemporary management of refractory angina encourages individualized, patient-centred care in interdisciplinary, specialized clinics. Global initiatives are required to address complex clinical problem-solving for patients with refractory angina. In this Review, we discuss the epidemiology of refractory angina, and provide an update on the pharmacological, noninvasive, and interventional options that are available to these patients or are under development.

### Nicorandil for angina – an update [^11677a7T]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2003). Low credibility.

Around 2 million people in the UK have angina pectoris and are therefore at high risk of severe coronary events such as myocardial infarction (MI) or sudden death. Conventional management of patients with stable angina includes glyceryl trinitrate, a beta-blocker, aspirin and a statin, with the aim of controlling symptoms and reducing the risk of a coronary event. For patients unable to tolerate a beta-blocker, the choice is less clear but calcium channel blockers and long-acting nitrates provide effective symptom control. Another option is nicorandil (Ikorel — Rhône-Poulenc Rorer), a potassium channel activator licensed for the "prevention and long term treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris". In our review of nicorandil 8 years ago, we concluded that it provided symptom control that was as good as, but no better than, other less expensive anti-anginal drugs. Since then, new data have suggested that nicorandil might reduce the frequency of coronary events in patients with stable angina. Here, we consider these findings and reassess the place of nicorandil for patients with angina.

### Safety of nitrate withdrawal in angina-free and hemodynamically stable patients with coronary artery disease [^114WQ5rZ]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

To assess the consequences of nitrate withdrawal in angina-free and hemodynamically stable coronary patients.

Design

Prospective, open, intervention study.

Setting

Cardiology outpatient clinic of a university-affiliated municipal hospital.

Patients

Angina-free patients who were hemodynamically stable for at least 3 months before study onset were enrolled. They were all regularly receiving nitrates for symptom control. Those with significant reasons to avoid stopping nitrates, such as heart failure (ejection fraction < 35%) or high BP (> 160 mm Hg systolic and/or > 100 mm Hg diastolic), and noncompliant patients were excluded.

Interventions

After providing informed consent and undergoing an exercise test (whenever possible), the participants were randomized to abruptly discontinue (study group) or continue (control group) nitrate treatment. Follow-up continued for at least 3 months after study entry.

Measurements and Results

Eighty patients were randomized to the study group and 40 patients to the control group (mean age [± 1 SD], 65.5 ± 11 years and 66.1 ± 10.9 years, respectively; p = not significant). The first month, eight study patients (10%) had a recurrence of anginal symptoms, compared with one control subject (2.5%) [p = not significant]. All eight patients responded promptly and favorably to the resumption of nitrate administration.

Conclusions

Nitrate administration can be safely discontinued in angina-free and hemodynamically stable coronary patients who receive this medication on a regular basis. If relapse of anginal symptoms occurs, it will be within 1 month following nitrate withdrawal, and will resolve satisfactorily with reinstatement of treatment.

### Efficacy of the long-acting nitro vasodilator pentaerithrityl tetranitrate in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris receiving anti-anginal background therapy with β-blockers: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115D9Bhq]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the predominant cause of death in most developed countries. The most common manifestation of this disease is chronic stable angina pectoris, a clinical syndrome characterized by discomfort in the chest, jaw, shoulder, back, or arm typically aggravated by exertion or emotional stress.

With respect to treatment of patients with chronic stable angina, guidelines differentiate among drugs which relieve acute angina pectoris (such as short-acting nitrates), drugs that may improve prognosis (such as statins, ACE-inhibitors, and aspirin, or, in the secondary prevention, beta-receptor blockers), and drugs that can be added for patients who remain symptomatic despite therapy with the other classes of agents (such as calcium antagonists, beta-receptor blockers, and long-acting organic nitrates).

Pentaerithrityl tetranitrate (PETN) is a long-acting nitrate vasodilator used in the treatment of angina pectoris. Similar to nitroglycerin (GTN), it is the nitric acid ester of a polyalcohol, in this case pentaerithrityl instead of glycerine.

Recent pre-clinical and clinical studies have established that, rather than a homogeneous class, organic nitrates represent a heterogeneous group of substances that differ greatly with respect to side effects such as the induction of nitrate tolerance and endothelial dysfunction (for review see Munzel et al.). Although ISDN, ISMN, and GTN have been documented to cause tolerance – and endothelial dysfunction – mainly due to the pro-oxidant effects of these compounds, the organic nitrate PETN was shown to be deprived of these side effects, and it actually improved endothelial function in an animal model of diabetes mellitus. This favourable profile may be due to the up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes such as the heme-oxygenase-1, thereby preventing the development of tolerance and endothelial dysfunction. Furthermore, PETN has been associated with increased numbers and improved function of circulating endothelial progenitor cells, and it has been shown to have protective properties similar to those of ischaemic pre-conditioning.

The current trial is the largest to date to investigate the effects of long-term therapy with an organic nitrate, PETN, when compared with placebo, in patients with stable angina pectoris undergoing therapy with beta-blockers and/or ivabradine.

### 2023 AHA / ACC / ACCP / ASPC / NLA / PCNA guideline for the management of patients with chronic coronary disease: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113fwhca]. Circulation (2023). High credibility.

Recommendation-specific supportive text — drug selection and combination strategies emphasizes that beta blockers have been considered the first antianginal to use in patients with symptomatic CCD, although the evidence basis for this prioritization is not strong. Early randomized, placebo-controlled studies found that beta blockers increased the percentage of patients free of exertional angina, reduced anginal attacks and reduced nitroglycerin consumption. A meta-analysis of 72 studies comparing beta blockers with CCBs found fewer episodes of angina per week with beta blockers and lower rates of drug discontinuation, with no difference observed in the rate of death or MI between the 2 drug classes and no difference in the primary endpoint of exercise duration in a more recent meta-analysis. In randomized, placebo-controlled trials, CCBs effectively relieve angina, decrease nitroglycerin consumption, and increase exercise duration, and long-acting nitrates decrease angina and improve exercise duration. Non-dihydropyridine CCBs (verapamil and diltiazem) can further depress LV function and should not be used in patients with CCD and significant LV dysfunction; in patients with CCD and angina refractory to 1 agent, a combination with another antianginal agent improves symptom control, and non-dihydropyridine CCBs should be used with caution in patients on beta blockers because of the potential for synergistic induction or exacerbation of bradycardia and LV dysfunction; the addition of a long-acting nitrate to a beta blocker or a CCB improves exercise tolerance, reduces angina frequency and short-acting nitrate use. Control of symptoms may be achieved by most patients, but full freedom from angina is only achieved in 40% to 50%, depending on anginal frequency at the onset of treatment.

Tailored therapeutic approaches and novel treatment options

Given the pathophysiologic and phenotypic heterogeneity of women with ANOCA, tailored therapeutic strategies are key. Most studies of ANOCA therapies have assessed anti-ischemic medications in relatively small, phenotypically diverse cohorts with short-term follow-up with modest results. However, the mechanistic insights provided by these studies lend themselves to being applied within a stratified framework. These have been described in detail prior reviews and are summarized here (Table 1).

Table 1
Summary of the Current and Novel Therapeutic Strategies Targeting the Primary Endotypes of ANOCA

Anti-vasospastic therapies

CCBs (amlodipine, nifedipine, benidipine) have been shown to improve symptom frequency and prognosis in vasospastic angina (VSA) and are the only drug designated as first-line in these patients. Both vascular smooth muscle selective dihydropyridine CCBs and nondihydropyridine CCBs (diltiazem, verapamil) have been shown to be effective in the treatment of VSA, though the former have been more widely studied. Refractory VSA may warrant a combination of both classes of CCBs. Acute episodes of VSA often respond to short-acting nitrates. Insufficient evidence exists on the symptomatic or prognostic benefit of long-acting nitrates, and concerns of aggravating symptoms due to steal and increased MACE with tolerance from chronic nitrate use have been raised. Statins (fluvastatin) may benefit VSA by suppression of smooth muscle reactivity. Cilostazol, a phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor, has been shown to improve VSA symptoms in multicenter RCTs. Nicorandil, a nitrate-like cGMP-mediated vasodilator and fasudil, a rho-kinase inhibitor, have been shown to improve VSA symptoms in multiple RCTs, however are not available in the United States. Smoking is a major trigger of VSA and cessation has been associated with a reduction in anginal symptoms and MACE.

### Sexual function in patients with chronic angina pectoris [^114HsFHM]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Drugs for erectile dysfunction (ED) may be contraindicated with nitrates commonly used to treat patients with angina pectoris, and certain antianginal therapies may worsen ED. The American Heart Association and the Princeton Consensus Conference panel of experts recommend that patients with coronary artery disease and ED who experience angina pectoris undergo full medical evaluations to assess the cardiovascular risks associated with resuming sexual activity before being prescribed therapy for ED. Current antianginal therapies include β blockers, calcium channel blockers, short- and long-acting nitrates, and ranolazine, a late sodium current inhibitor. Short- and long-acting nitrates remain a contraindication with phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors commonly used to treat patients with ED, and the benefits of the other antianginal therapies must be weighed against their effects on cardiovascular health and erectile function. In conclusion, patients with coronary artery disease and ED who wish to initiate phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor therapy and need to discontinue nitrate therapy need treatment options that manage their angina pectoris effectively, maintain their cardiovascular health, and provide the freedom to maintain their sexual function.

### Trial to show the impact of nicorandil in angina (IONA): design, methodology, and management [^1176AD4n]. Heart (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

IONA (impact of nicorandil in angina) is a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial that will test the hypothesis that nicorandil (target dose of 20 mg twice daily) will reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events in a cohort of men and women with effort angina and additional risk factors.

Methods

The primary composite end point of the study is coronary heart disease death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or unplanned hospital admission for cardiac chest pain, and the secondary end point is the combined outcome of coronary heart disease death or non-fatal myocardial infarction. Other cardiovascular outcomes and all cause mortality will also be reported.

Results

More than 5000 subjects have been randomised to receive nicorandil or placebo in addition to normal antianginal treatment. The target population, the assessments made, and the management of the trial are described in detail.

Conclusions

The IONA study has achieved its first aim of randomising more than 5000 high risk subjects with effort angina. Subject follow up will be complete in the third quarter of 2001.

### Efficacy of the long-acting nitro vasodilator pentaerithrityl tetranitrate in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris receiving anti-anginal background therapy with β-blockers: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113gbXME]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Therapy with organic nitrates is commonly used in the management of patients with angina pectoris, and the current guidelines encourage the use of long-acting nitrates in patients who remain symptomatic despite appropriate anti-anginal therapy with beta-blockers. The major limitation of nitrate therapy, however, is that, due to the development of nitrate tolerance, it can only be applied on a 12 h intermittent basis, thus typically providing no protection during night hours and exposing patients to rebound phenomena. – A number of possible approaches have been proposed to address this issue, including co-administration of compounds aimed at limiting the oxidant effects of GTN and other nitrates, as well as the use of nitrates with independent antioxidant properties. PETN is an organic nitrate that has been shown to induce the expression of the antioxidant enzyme heme-oxygenase-1and that, in human studies, has been shown to be deprived of the side effects common to other nitrates, including the induction of nitrate toleranceand endothelial dysfunction. To date, the anti-ischaemic efficacy of this drug has not been studied in large multicentre clinical trials.

Summary of the findings

The CLEOPATRA study was designed to investigate the anti-anginal efficacy of PETN administered on top of a background anti-ischaemic therapy. Patients enrolled received appropriate anti-anginal therapy with a beta-blocker or ivabradine with add-on PETN 80 mg b.i.d. or placebo. The study was run as a multicentre, randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled trial with centralized analysis of data and safety assessment, and the primary efficacy endpoint was the change in TED after 12 weeks of treatment. As expected, an important placebo (or time) effect was shown for all endpoints. When the analysis included the whole population of patients enrolled into the study, no difference was shown between PETN and placebo for any of the endpoints. Notably, an analysis that included the baseline TED as a covariate evidenced that the benefit of PETN was more pronounced in those patients who had a lower TED at randomization. In line with this, a clear superiority of PETN over placebo was demonstrated with regard to all clinically relevant efficacy endpoints in the subset of patients showing low exercise capacity and distinct symptoms of angina pectoris.

### Pharmacologic treatment of patients with myocardial ischemia with No obstructive coronary artery disease [^111oC9oF]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Half of women and 1/3 of men with angina and ischemia on stress testing have ischemia with no obstructive coronary artery disease (INOCA). These patients have quality of life (QoL) impairment comparable with patients with obstructive coronary artery disease. Clinicians generally treat INOCA with traditional antianginal agents despite previous studies demonstrating variable response to these medications. We performed a systematic review to evaluate the efficacy and safety of available pharmacologic therapies for INOCA. We systematically searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, MEDLINE, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform in July 2017 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating pharmacologic agents for INOCA. The primary outcome of interest was QoL. Secondary outcomes included subjective and objective efficacy measures and safety outcomes. We included 35 RCTs from 333 identified studies. Interventions that improved QoL with moderate-quality evidence included angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (± statin) and ranolazine. Low-to-very-low-quality evidence also suggests that ACE inhibitors, β blockers, calcium-channel blockers, nicorandil, ranolazine, and statins may decrease angina frequency and delay ischemia on stress testing. Other interventions, most notably nitrates, did not significantly improve any outcome. In conclusion, evidence for pharmacologic treatment of INOCA is generally poor, and higher-quality RCTs using a standardized definition of INOCA are needed. Moderate-quality evidence suggests that ACE inhibitors and ranolazine improve QoL. Other interventions had low-quality evidence or no evidence of efficacy.

### Management of vasospastic angina [^113fzk68]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Vasospastic angina is a well-established cause of chest pain that is caused by coronary artery spasm. It can be clinically diagnosed during a spontaneous episode by documenting nitrate-responsive rest angina with associated transient ischaemic ECG changes but more often requires provocative coronary spasm testing with acetylcholine during coronary angiography. Vasospastic angina may result in recurrent episodes of angina (including nocturnal angina), which can progress on to major adverse cardiac events. Calcium channel blockers are first-line therapy for this condition, given their anti-anginal and cardioprotective benefits. Despite an established diagnostic and therapeutic management pathway for vasospastic angina, this diagnosis is often overlooked in patients presenting with chest pain. Thus, there is need for increased clinical awareness of vasospastic angina to improve outcomes in affected patients.

Box 1
Definition of angina (NICE guidelines)

Typical angina: (requires all three)

Constricting discomfort in the front of the chest or in the neck, shoulders, jaw or arms.
Precipitated by physical exertion.
Relieved by rest or sublingual glyceryl trinitrate within about 5 min Presence of two of the features is defined as atypical angina. Presence of one or none of the features is defined as non-anginal chest pain. Stable angina may be excluded if pain is non-anginal provided clinical suspicion is not raised based on other aspects of the history and risk factors. Do not define typical, atypical and non-anginal chest pain differently in men and women or different ethnic groups.

Six decades have passed since the first reported invasive coronary angiogram; however, many physicians still consider detecting obstructive epicardial CAD on coronary angiography a 'sine qua non' for the diagnosis of angina. The detection of obstructive CAD allows evidence-based medical treatment and consideration of myocardial revascularisation. However, underlying pathophysiology is more nuanced with contributions from anatomical atherosclerotic and/or functional alterations of epicardial vessels and/or microcirculation (figure 1).ESC guidelineshave revised nomenclature ('Chronic Coronary Syndromes') in part reflecting the importance of patients with signs and symptoms of ischaemia without obstructive coronary artery disease — INOCA. Around half of all patients with angina undergoing elective coronary angiography have no obstructive epicardial CAD. This large, heterogeneous chronic coronary syndrome is comprised of distinct vasomotor disorders including microvascular angina (MVA) and/or vasospastic angina (VSA) — the two most common underlying disorders of coronary vascular function in the INOCA population. Crucially, we stress that there are often multiple mechanisms of myocardial ischaemia occurring in various coronary compartments via different mechanisms. These frequently coexist in combination; however, an appreciation of this fact can help stratify treatment and help us understand patients with poor treatment response (eg, angina after revascularisation).

### Physiology of angina and its alleviation with nitroglycerin: insights from invasive catheter laboratory measurements during exercise [^117AFc7z]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Editorial, see p

Although a common symptom and described as early as 1785, the exact mechanisms underlying exercise-induced angina are poorly understood. Nitroglycerin, generally referred to as glyceryl trinitrate, was the first medication used for the treatment of angina, described by Murrel in 1879, and, in its short-acting forms, remains first-line therapy for most patients today. The mechanisms by which nitrates are purported to exert their antianginal effect are numerous, with effects on preload, afterload, and myocardial perfusion being described. –

Despite this large body of work, the hierarchical relevance of these observations and applicability to patients with coronary artery disease have been limited by the methods used. We developed a novel protocol whereby patients with coronary artery disease could undergo symptom-limited exercise on the catheterization laboratory table. This enabled, for the first time, the immediate effects of nitroglycerin to be assessed with simultaneous invasive central aortic and coronary hemodynamic measurements. This protocol also served to test the feasibility of using such a paradigm in the investigation of novel and established antianginal therapies.

Angina pectoris — symptom pattern and diagnostic caveat: Angina pectoris is perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort that builds gradually in intensity (over several minutes), is usually precipitated by stress or occurring at rest (as in the case of an ACS) with characteristic radiation to the left arm, neck, or jaw and associated symptoms such as dyspnea, nausea, and lightheadedness. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion, and a detailed assessment of cardiovascular risk factors, review of systems, past medical history, and family and social history should complement the assessment of presenting symptoms.

Table 17 — INOCA endotype vasospastic angina (epicardial spasm) defines spasm as a reduction in coronary diameter ≥ 90% after intracoronary acetylcholine compared with baseline after intracoronary glyceryl trinitrate administration in an epicardial segment together with symptoms and ST-segment deviation on the ECG. Baseline therapy states that if atherosclerosis or endothelial impairment is present, aspirin and statin should be considered, with sublingual nitroglycerin as needed, plus smoking cessation and lifestyle changes. Antianginal therapy is first line CCB (eg, verapamil 40 mg BID uptitrated), second line long-acting nitrate (eg, isosorbide mononitrate 10 mg BID), and third line to change nitrate to nicorandil (eg, nicorandil 5 mg BID), with nicorandil noted as currently unavailable in the United States.

Treatment of microvascular angina

The management of MVA represents a major unmet need because the lack of large, randomized studies with homogeneous patient group makes it difficult to generate evidence-based recommendations. Two outcome trials are currently underway: the Women's IschemiA TRial to Reduce Events In Non-ObstRuctive CAD (WARRIOR), a multicentre, prospective, randomized, blinded outcome evaluation (PROBE design) of a pragmatic strategy of intensive medical treatment vs. usual care in 4422 symptomatic women with ischaemia and no obstructive CAD (NCT 03417388); and the International Coronary Microvascular Angina Trial (iCorMicA: NCT04674449) of stratified medicine in angina. Furthermore, the treatment of MVA has been empirical because its pathophysiology appears to be multifactorial with overlapping phenotypes that often coexist. Recent reports discussed the management of MVA patients and suggested some potential treatment strategies. Anti-atherothrombotic treatments with statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), and low-dose aspirin may improve symptoms and outcomes of MVA patients. Patients enrolled in the present study received oral treatment with statins (62%), nitrates (43%), ACE-I (25%), and ARB (17%) as determined by attending physicians after the diagnosis of MVA was made. Furthermore, conventional anti-anginal therapies, including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and nitrates, are reasonable first-line regimens for MVA patients given the underlying pathophysiology. Regarding vasodilators, there was a sex difference in the present study as women received more frequently nitrates, whereas men received more frequently calcium channel blockers. More frequent use of nitrates in women might represent more frequent anginal attacks than in men, which is consistent with our observations of significantly lower SAQ scores in physical limitation and angina stability among women.

Epicardial spasm (vasospastic angina)

The poor nitrate response or tolerance seen in MVA contrasts with patients with vasospastic angina, in whom nitrates are a cornerstone of therapy and BB are relatively contraindicated. Dual pathologies (VSA with underlying microvascular disease) is increasingly recognised. A diagnosis of VSA facilitates treatment using non-dihydropiridine calcium antagonists (eg, diltiazem-controlled release up to 500 mg daily). Overall, CCB are effective in treating over 90% of patients. High doses of calcium antagonists (non-dihydropiridine and dihydropyridine) may be required either alone or in combination. Unfortunately, ankle swelling, constipation and other side effects may render some patients intolerant. In these cases, long-term nitrates may be used with good efficacy in this group. In about 10% of cases, coronary artery spasm may be refractory to optimal vasodilator therapy. Japanese VSA registry data shows nitrates were not associated with MACE reduction in VSA, and importantly when added to Nicorandil were potentially associated with higher rates of adverse cardiac events. Alpha blockers (eg, clonidine) may be helpful in selected patients with persistent vasospasm. In patients with poor nitrate tolerance the K+-channel opener nicorandil (5–10 mg two times a day) can be tried. Consider secondary causes in refractory VSA (eg, coronary vasculitis) and in selected patients with ACS presentations, coronary angioplasty may be considered as a bailout option.

### Impact of nicorandil in angina: subgroup analyses [^116a2pms]. Heart (2004). Low credibility.

Aims

IONA (impact of nicorandil in angina) is a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial of nicorandil, with a target dose of 20 mg twice daily. The consistency of benefits seen in subgroups is reported.

Methods

The primary composite end point of the study was coronary heart disease death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or unplanned hospitalisation for cardiac chest pain. Subgroups were defined using baseline characteristics including, age, sex, histories of smoking, diabetes, hypertension, myocardial infarction, revascularisation, anginal status, anti-anginal treatment, other cardiovascular drugs, and an overall assessment of risk.

Results

A total of 5126 patients were randomised to receive nicorandil or identical placebo in addition to standard anti-anginal treatment. Overall, nicorandil reduced the incidence of the primary end point from 15.5% to 13.1% (hazard ratio (HR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.97; p = 0.014). There was no evidence of significant heterogeneity of benefit across all subgroups studied. The absolute risk reduction was greatest and the numbers needed to treat to prevent one event was lowest in subjects at greatest risk.

Conclusions

The IONA study demonstrates a significant improvement in outcome by nicorandil treatment across a broad range of patients with stable angina.

### Prognostic impact of chronic vasodilator therapy in patients with vasospastic angina [^115D1vP4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background Chronic vasodilator therapy with long-acting nitrate is frequently used to treat vasospastic angina. However, the clinical benefits of this approach are controversial. We investigated the prognostic impact of vasodilator therapy in patients with vasospastic angina from the multicenter, prospective VA-KOREA (Vasospastic Angina in KOREA) registry. Methods and Results We analyzed data from 1895 patients with positive intracoronary ergonovine provocation test results. The patients were divided into 4 groups: no vasodilator (n = 359), nonnitrate vasodilator (n = 1187), conventional nitrate (n = 209), and a combination of conventional nitrate and other vasodilators (n = 140). The primary end point was a composite of cardiac death, acute coronary syndrome, and new-onset arrhythmia at 2 years. Secondary end points were the individual components of the primary end point, all-cause death, and rehospitalization due to recurrent angina. The groups did not differ in terms of the risk of the primary end point. However, the acute coronary syndrome risk was significantly higher in the conventional nitrate (hazard ratio [HR], 2.49; 95% CI, 1.01–6.14; P = 0.047) and combination groups (HR, 3.34; 95% CI, 1.15–9.75, P = 0.027) compared with the no-vasodilator group, as assessed using the inverse probability of treatment weights. Subgroup analyses revealed prominent adverse effects of nitrate in patients with an intermediate positive ergonovine provocation test result and in those with low Japanese Coronary Spasm Association scores. Conclusions Long-acting nitrate-based chronic vasodilator therapy was associated with an increased 2-year risk of acute coronary syndrome in patients with vasospastic angina, especially in low-risk patients.

Pharmacological

Although NICE guidelines offer either BB or CCB first line, although we support BB initially because they are generally better tolerated (table 2). Long-term evidence of efficacy is limited between BB and CCB and there are no proven safety concerns favouring one or the other. Dihydropyridine calcium may be added to BB if blood pressure permits. NICE CG126 states third line options can be either added on (or substituted if BB/CCB not tolerated). These include nitrates (eg, isosorbide mononitrate 30–120 mg controlled release), ivabradine (eg, 2.5–7.5 mg two times a day), nicorandil (5–30 mg two times a day) or ranolazine (375–500 mg two times a day). These are all third line medications that can be used based and combined with BB and/or CCB depending on comorbidities, contraindications, patient preference and drug costs (figure 3). The RIVER-PCI study found that anti-ischaemic pharmacotherapy with ranolazine did not improve the prognosis of patients with incomplete revascularisation after percutaneous coronary intervention. This was a reminder that alleviation of ischaemia may not improve 'hard' endpoints in patients with chronic coronary syndromes but helps us to remain focused on improving their quality of life.

### Novel therapeutic approaches to treating chronic angina in the setting of chronic ischemic heart disease [^1149kaAL]. Clinical Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Pharmacologic therapy to alleviate symptoms in chronic angina has been enhanced by the recent approval of several novel compounds that complement the traditional approach using beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, calcium antagonists, and long-acting nitrates. In the United States, ranolazine, a drug that inhibits late I(Na), was approved for patients with chronic angina that remain symptomatic on beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, or long-acting nitrates, on the basis of an acceptable safety profile and efficacy in several randomized placebo controlled studies. A slight increase in the QT interval is observed (< 10 ms on average) at the maximum approved dose of 1,000 mg twice daily. Therefore, an ECG should be acquired at baseline and during follow-up, and the drug should not be used in patients with QT prolongation or those who are on QT prolonging drugs unless longer term randomized outcome data demonstrates no excess risk. The MERLIN trial of non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE ACS) randomized 6,560 patients to assess the potential benefit of ranolazine in reducing the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and recurrent ischemia, with results expected in 2007. In Europe, ivabradine, a drug that inhibits the hyperpolarization-activated mixed sodium/potassium inward I(f) current, which slows the rest and exercise heart rate, was approved in 2005. Ivabradine at a dose of 10 mg twice daily has been shown to have similar efficacy to amlodipine 10 mg once daily or atenolol 100 mg once daily in alleviating chronic angina symptoms. In this review, several other novel investigational approaches are presented and patient selection considerations for the most recent approved drugs for chronic angina are discussed.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) with concomitant angina pectoris — patients who have both angina pectoris and HF should be given drugs that relieve angina along with drugs that are appropriate in the management of HF; both nitrates and beta-blockers can improve anginal symptoms and may produce hemodynamic and clinical benefits in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and thus, they are preferred if these conditions coexist, and the decrease in ventricular volume and pressures produced by diuretics may exert independent antianginal effects. Because short-and long-term treatment with these drugs has increased the risk of worsening HF and death in patients with LV dysfunction, most calcium channel blockers should be avoided in patients with HF, and of available agents, only amlodipine has been shown not to adversely affect survival. In patients with both HF and angina pectoris, strong consideration should be given to the use of coronary revascularization, and coronary artery bypass surgery has been shown to lessen angina and reduce the risk of death in patients who have multivessel disease, reduced LVEF, and stable angina.

### Periods of cluster headache induced by nitrate therapy and spontaneous remission of angina pectoris during active clusters [^114LitiL]. Cephalalgia (2004). Low credibility.

Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) is known to induce single extra attacks of cluster headache (CH) during active cluster periods, most probably via actions of nitric oxide (NO). Induction of whole periods of CH by organic nitrates has, however, attracted little attention in the literature. We report on eight patients with episodic CH and coexistent effort-induced angina pectoris. Cases 1–6 had been free of their headaches for many years but got recurrence of CH within a few weeks after the administration of long-acting organic nitrates (isosorbide-dinitrate, isosorbide-5-mononitrate or slow-release GTN) aimed at treating their chest pains. These nitrate-induced headache periods were more severe and had a longer duration than the previous spontaneous ones. Furthermore, one of the subjects and two additional cases experienced a marked reduction of their anginal attacks during successive CH periods. Exercise time to effort-induced angina was increased in all three patients and one of them revealed a markedly elevated threshold for eliciting ischaemic cardiac symptoms by standardized physical exercise on a cycle ergometer. We hypothesize whether extra CH periods elicited by sustained nitrate therapy and remission of angina pectoris during active clusters are caused by central mechanisms involving inhibition of sympathetic tone and effects on both cranial vessels and cardiac functions.

Sub-analysis in symptomatic patients

For the analysis of the effects of PETN in patients with refractory angina despite background anti-anginal therapy, subjects reporting at least two angina pectoris attacks and taking two doses of short-acting nitrates per week and with a baseline TED ≤ 9 min were selected. A total of 120 patients, 55 on PETN and 65 on placebo, met these criteria. Demographic characteristics in this subpopulation were similar to those of the ITT population and not different between groups. In this group of patients with distinct and clinically relevant symptoms of angina pectoris, the change in TED at 6 and 12 weeks was markedly larger in the PETN group than in the control group (Figure 3, P = 0.05 and P = 0.017). Similarly, changes in MET, TAP, TLA, and TST at 12 weeks in this group of symptomatic patients were markedly larger in the PETN group (respectively, P = 0.03, P = 0.05, P = 0.003, Figures 4 and 5). Finally, the frequency of angina pectoris attacks decreased after both PETN and placebo (a decrease in the angina stability scale was observed in 24.5% of those randomized to PETN and in 12.7% of those randomized to placebo; change in the angina frequency scale — PETN: 21.4%; placebo: 15.7%). The use of short-acting nitrates decreased in both groups (PETN: −1.7 doses/week, median −2; placebo: −2.5 doses/week, median −2).

Figure 3
In the subgroup of patients with refractory angina pectoris (defined as at least two episodes of angina per week, self-administration of at least two doses of sublingual nitrates per week, and total exercise duration ≤ 9 min), the change in total exercise duration at 6 and 12 weeks was markedly larger in the pentaerithrityl tetranitrate group than in the control group. ANCOVA means are presented with 95% confidence intervals. The change from baseline was 118.2 s in the pentaerithrityl tetranitrate group and 69.9 s in the placebo group at 12 weeks. A difference between pentaerithrityl tetranitrate and placebo was already observed at week 6 with an improvement of 61.2 s in the pentaerithrityl tetranitrate group and 28.8 s in the placebo group.

Vasospastic angina — diagnostic criteria: Diagnosis considers "Nitrate-responsive angina: during spontaneous episode, with at least 1 of the following" clinical features, plus ECG and angiographic findings. Transient ischemia is supported by "Transient ischemic electrocardiographic changes: during spontaneous episode, including any of the following in at least 2 contiguous leads: ST segment elevation ≥ 0.1 mV; ST segment depression ≥ 0.1 mV; New negative U waves". Coronary spasm is defined as "transient total or subtotal coronary artery occlusion (> 90% constriction) with angina and ischemic electrocardiographic changes either spontaneously or in response to a provocative stimulus (typically acetylcholine, ergonovine, or hyperventilation)". "Definitive" vasospastic angina requires nitrate-responsive angina during spontaneous episodes and fulfillment of either transient ischemic ECG changes or coronary spasm criteria, whereas "Suspected" vasospastic angina is when nitrate-responsive angina is present but ischemic ECG changes are equivocal or unavailable and spasm criteria are equivocal.

Advances in pharmacotherapy for stable angina have produced a wide choice of drugs with various mechanisms of action, potentially enabling individualized, patient-specific treatment strategies to be developed. In this Review, the various treatment options for patients with stable angina are discussed. Data from randomized, clinical trials of established and novel drugs are reviewed, with particular emphasis on the proposed mechanisms of action, benefits of therapy, and adverse-effect profiles. The role of coronary revascularization in conjunction with optimal medical therapy as a treatment strategy is discussed, although drug therapy might reduce the need for prompt revascularization if the procedure is being considered solely for the purpose of alleviating angina. Finally, trials to investigate stimulation of angiogenesis using growth-factor, gene, and cell therapy are used to illustrate the challenges of chemically inducing the growth of adequate, durable blood vessels.

### Re-thinking angina [^112P42g1]. Clinical Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

William Heberden in 1772 published "some account of the disorder of the breast" which contains the essential elements of angina pectoris as we understand it today. The number of existing cases in the U.S. population today is 6.4 million. Myocardial ischemia manifested by angina pectoris can be either acute or chronic. Patients with chronic stable angina will be the focus of this supplement. The majority of patients are symptomatic but approximately 25% can be asymptomatic. The clinical manifestations of myocardial ischemia generally are chest discomfort, arrhythmias, and LV dysfunction. Myocardial ischemia is a result of imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and myocardial oxygen demand. High grade coronary stenosis are the usual cause of decreased oxygen supply. The classic hemodynamic factors increasing myocardial oxygen demand include hypertension and increased heart rate due to tachyarrhythmias of any etiology. Exertion is the usual precipitating cause of chronic myocardial ischemia. New information has come forward indicating that myocardial ischemia is associated with disruption of cellular sodium and calcium homeostasis. Ischemia results in a rise of intracellular sodium concentration and thus sodium overload which then activates the sodium calcium exchanger and leads to increased intracellular calcium. When this occurs there is electrical instability and mechanical dysfunction which increases oxygen demand and decreases oxygen supply. The compound Ranolazine is thought to selectively inhibit the late sodium current and attenuates the abnormalities of ventricular repolarization and contractility associated with myocardial ischemia. This compound is the first new class of anti-anginal medication approved in 25 years which may provide physicians with additional therapy for chronic stable angina along with the other anti-angina agents, beta blockers, calcium antagonists and nitrates.

### Management of persistent angina after myocardial infarction treated with percutaneous coronary intervention: insights from the TRANSLATE-ACS study [^115cXcRf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Limitations

This analysis is limited to patient‐reported angina, and it is unknown whether these patients have objective myocardial ischemia that would benefit from use of medical antianginal therapy. Participants were only asked the SAQ's 2 questions about angina frequency; answers to questions from the SAQ's other domains — physical limitation (though this was collected as part of the EuroQOL 5 dimensions), angina stability, treatment satisfaction, and disease perception — were not collected. Participants were not asked about dyspnea, which is not well captured by the SAQ and may be an anginal equivalent; this study may thus underestimate the true prevalence of residual angina in the TRANSLATE‐ACS population. Moreover, we excluded patients with missing angina status at 6 weeks; compared with patients with known angina status, these patients were younger, more frequently women, and more frequently had government insurance — all variables associated with angina among patients with known angina status. If patients with missing angina were more likely to have angina than those with known angina status, as might be predicted from patient characteristics, our study would underestimate the prevalence of residual angina in the post‐PCI population. In addition, hypertension was associated with prescription of non–β‐blocker anti‐anginal therapy at 12 months among patients with 6‐week angina; since calcium channel blockers and long‐acting nitrates are also used as antihypertensive agents, this suggests that clinicians may not have recognized angina even in some patients who were treated with non–β‐blocker anti‐anginal medications. Though such patients would be treated with non–β‐blocker anti‐anginal medications, they may not have their anti‐anginal medications titrated as aggressively as patients purposefully treated for angina. Further, exercise frequency and tolerance were not captured in TRANSLATE‐ACS, and it is possible that patients reporting angina in our study were actually more physically active than patients without angina, and that their physical activity unmasked angina; however, the higher frequency of difficulty with mobility, self‐care, usual activities, pain, and anxiety/depression among patients with angina argues against this possibility. Regardless, angina has effects on quality of life beyond limiting physical activity, and it remains important to treat patients' symptoms. Lastly, we do not report on outcomes related to use or escalation of non–β‐blocker antianginal medications; any outcomes analysis would be limited by substantial confounding by indication. Without knowing about care processes contributing to underuse of antianginals, outcomes comparisons between treatment strategies may be flawed.

### Chronic nitrate therapy is associated with different presentation and evolution of acute coronary syndromes: insights from 52, 693 patients in the global registry of acute coronary events [^1121VEzK]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

Brief episode(s) of ischaemia may increase cardiac tolerance to a subsequent major ischaemic insult ('preconditioning'). Nitrates can pharmacologically mimic ischaemic preconditioning in animals. In this study, we investigated whether antecedent nitrate therapy affords protection toward acute ischaemic events using data from the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events.

Methods and Results

The dataset comprised 52,693 patients from 123 centres in 14 countries: 42,138 (80%) were nitrate-naïve and 10,555 (20%) were on chronic nitrates at admission. In nitrate-naïve patients, admission diagnosis was ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in 41%, whereas 59% presented with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS). In contrast, only 18% nitrate users showed STEMI, whereas 82% presented with NSTE-ACS. Thus, among nitrate users clinical presentation was tilted toward NSTE-ACS by more than four-fold, STEMI occurring in less than one of five patients (P < 0.0001). After adjustment (age, sex, medical history, prior therapy, revascularization, previous angina), chronic nitrate use remained independent predictor of NSTE-ACS (OR 1.36; 95% CI 1.26–1.46; P < 0.0001). Furthermore, regardless of presentation, within both STEMI and NSTEMI populations, antecedent nitrate use was associated with significantly lower levels of CK-MB and troponin (P < 0.0001 for all).

Conclusion

In this large multinational registry, chronic nitrate use was associated with a shift away from STEMI in favour of NSTE-ACS and with less release of markers of cardiac necrosis. These findings suggest that in nitrate users acute coronary events may develop to a smaller extent. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials are warranted to establish whether nitrate therapy may pharmacologically precondition the heart toward ischaemic episodes.

### Effect of nicorandil on coronary events in patients with stable angina: the impact of nicorandil in angina (IONA) randomised trial [^112kWWTr]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

Background

In addition to its anti-ischaemic effects, the antianginal drug nicorandil is thought to have cardioprotective properties. We did a randomised trial to find out whether nicorandil could reduce the frequency of coronary events in men and women with stable angina and additional risk factors.

Methods

5126 patients were randomly assigned 20 mg nicorandil twice daily (n = 2565) or identical placebo (n = 2561) in addition to standard antianginal therapy. The primary composite endpoint was coronary heart disease death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or unplanned hospital admission for cardiac chest pain. The secondary endpoint was the combined outcome of coronary heart disease death or non-fatal myocardial infarction. Other outcomes reported include all-cause mortality, all cardiovascular events, and acute coronary syndromes. Mean follow-up was 1.6 years (SD 0.5). Analysis was by intention to treat.

Findings

There were 398 (15.5%) primary endpoint events in the placebo group and 337 (13.1%) in the nicorandil group (hazard ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.72–0.97; p = 0.014). The frequency of the secondary endpoint was not significantly different between the groups (134 events [5.2%] vs 107 events [4.2%]; 0.79, 0.61–1.02; p = 0.068). The rate of acute coronary syndromes was 195 (7.6%) in the placebo group and 156 (6.1%) in the nicorandil group (0.79, 0.64–0.98; p = 0.028), and the corresponding rates for all cardiovascular events were 436 (17.0%) and 378 (14.7%; 0.86, 0.75–0.98; p = 0.027).

Interpretation

We showed a significant improvement in outcome due to a reduction in major coronary events by antianginal therapy with nicorandil in patients with stable angina.

### Therapeutic approaches for the no-option refractory angina patient [^111jbsvw]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Medium credibility.

The combination of an aging population and improved survival rates among patients with coronary artery disease has resulted in an increase in the number of patients with refractory angina or anginal equivalent symptoms despite maximal medical therapy. Patients with refractory angina are often referred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory; however, they have often exhausted conventional revascularization options; thus, this population is often deemed as having "no options". We review the definition, prevalence, outcomes, therapeutic options, and treatment considerations for no-option refractory angina patients and focus on novel therapies for this complex and challenging population. We propose a multidisciplinary team approach for the evaluation and management of patients with refractory angina, ideally in a designated clinic. The severe limitations and symptomatology experienced by these patients highlight the need for additional research into the development of innovative treatments.

### Angina hospitalization rates in women with signs and symptoms of ischemia but no obstructive coronary artery disease: a report from the WISE (women's ischemia syndrome evaluation) study [^111Wt4XH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

There was a statistically significant difference in angina hospitalization between women with no CAD and women with nonobstructive CAD (P = 0.03) (Figure). Univariate predictors of angina hospitalization for these 2 combined groups using hazard ratios were hypertension 1.52 (1.06–2.18, P = 0.024), dyslipidemia 1.54 (1.07–2.21, P = 0.020), nonobstructive CAD 1.56 (1.10–2.21, P = 0.012), use of nitrates 2.64 (1.84–3.76, P < 0.0001), statins 1.81 (1.24–2.65, P = 0.002), and angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers 1.80 (1.23–2.65, P = 0.003). Multivariate predictors of angina hospitalization using adjusted hazard ratios to baseline characteristics were significant for the use of nitrates 2.58 (1.80–3.69, P < 0.0001), statins 1.80 (1.20–2.70, P = 0.004) and angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors/ angiotensin receptor blockers 1.81 (1.22–2.68, P = 0.003).

When we added anginal characteristics into the multivariate model, including the chest pain descriptors of typical angina, number of symptoms checked, pain frequency, usual severity of pain (severity at its worst), " chest pain severity at its worst " had a statistically significant hazard ratio of 2.16 (1.29–3.64, P = 0.004).

Conclusions

Routine prescription of vasodilators did not affect clinical outcomes in patients with ERGT‐confirmed VSA in a nationwide, multicenter, prospective registry. However, long‐acting nitrate‐based chronic vasodilator therapy was associated with an increased 2‐year risk of ACS in patients with VSA, especially in low‐risk patients. However, as this study used a retrospective design, additional large‐scale randomized trials are required for validation.

### Stable atypical chest pain with negative anatomical or functional diagnostic test: diagnosis no matter what or prevention at any cost? [^111kH1mk]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

In the last 15 years, 36 244 patients > 35 years old were examined in our clinics. Of these, 3588 (10%) reported that they had experienced chest pain for more than 2 days at the date of evaluation (Table 1). We excluded patients with diagnosed or suspected acute coronary syndromes at the time of the evaluation (88 patients, 2.5%), known coronary artery disease (172 patients, 4.7%), and patients with significant congenital defects, significant valve diseases, cardiomyopathies, or known or suspected channelopathies (30 patients, 0.8%). The final assessment involved 3298 patients (9%).

Table 1
Reason for a referral to the clinics

The cardiologic examination and ECG were performed at the request of the general medical practitioner after booking at the Unified Reservation Center (Centro Unico di prenotazione (CUP)), with a median waiting time of 10 days. Patients requiring an urgent cardiologic examination were excluded from the analysis. At the time of the visit, chest pain was defined according to the Diamond and Forrester classification as typical angina (typical retrosternal chest pain of typical type and duration, caused by exercise or emotional stress, relieved by rest and/or nitrates within minutes), atypical chest pain (meeting two of the previous characteristics), and non‐anginal chest pain (satisfies only one or none of the above characteristics) (Table 2). 20 In cases of non‐anginal chest pain, a stress test was not recommended. Patients with typical chest pain underwent an exercise ECG that was performed within 1 to 3 days of the visit at the discretion of the cardiologist. The PPT of stable coronary artery disease was also calculated based on the ESC guidelines. 20

### Ranolazine for stable angina pectoris [^116SvUwE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Stable angina pectoris is a chronic medical condition with significant impact on mortality and quality of life; it can be macrovascular or microvascular in origin. Ranolazine is a second-line anti-anginal drug approved for use in people with stable angina. However, the effects of ranolazine for people with angina are considered to be modest, with uncertain clinical relevance.

Objectives

To assess the effects of ranolazine on cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, quality of life, acute myocardial infarction incidence, angina episodes frequency and adverse events incidence in stable angina patients, used either as monotherapy or as add-on therapy, and compared to placebo or any other anti-anginal agent.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science in February 2016, as well as regional databases and trials registers. We also screened reference lists.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which directly compared the effects of ranolazine versus placebo or other anti-anginals in people with stable angina pectoris were eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Estimates of treatment effects were calculated using risk ratios (RR), mean differences (MD) and standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a fixed-effect model. Where we found statistically significant heterogeneity (Chi² P < 0.10), we used a random-effects model for pooling estimates. Meta-analysis was not performed where we found considerable heterogeneity (I² ≥ 75%). We used GRADE criteria to assess evidence quality and the GRADE profiler (GRADEpro GDT) to import data from Review Manager 5.3 to create 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included 17 RCTs (9975 participants, mean age 63.3 years). We found very limited (or no) data to inform most planned comparisons. Summary data were used to inform comparison of ranolazine versus placebo. Overall, risk of bias was assessed as unclear. For add-on ranolazine compared to placebo, no data were available to estimate cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality. We found uncertainty about the effect of ranolazine on: all-cause mortality (1000 mg twice daily, RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.26 to 2.71; 3 studies, 2053 participants; low quality evidence); quality of life (any dose, SMD 0.25, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.52; 4 studies, 1563 participants; I² = 73%; moderate quality evidence); and incidence of non-fatal acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (1000mg twice daily, RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.07; 2 studies, 1509 participants; low quality evidence). Add-on ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily reduced the fervour of angina episodes (MD -0.66, 95% CI -0.97 to -0.35; 3 studies, 2004 participants; I² = 39%; moderate quality evidence) but increased the risk of non-serious adverse events (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.40; 3 studies, 2053 participants; moderate quality evidence). For ranolazine as monotherapy compared to placebo, we found uncertain effect on cardiovascular mortality (1000 mg twice daily, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.88; 1 study, 2604 participants; low quality evidence). No data were available to estimate non-cardiovascular mortality. We also found an uncertain effect on all-cause mortality for ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.25; 3 studies, 6249 participants; low quality evidence), quality of life (1000 mg twice daily, MD 0.28, 95% CI -1.57 to 2.13; 3 studies, 2254 participants; moderate quality evidence), non-fatal AMI incidence (any dose, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.12; 3 studies, 2983 participants; I² = 50%; low quality evidence), and frequency of angina episodes (any dose, MD 0.08, 95% CI -0.85 to 1.01; 2 studies, 402 participants; low quality evidence). We found an increased risk for non-serious adverse events associated with ranolazine (any dose, RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.00; 3 studies, 947 participants; very low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We found very low quality evidence showing that people with stable angina who received ranolazine as monotherapy had increased risk of presenting non-serious adverse events compared to those given placebo. We found low quality evidence indicating that people with stable angina who received ranolazine showed uncertain effect on the risk of cardiovascular death (for ranolazine given as monotherapy), all-cause death and non-fatal AMI, and the frequency of angina episodes (for ranolazine given as monotherapy) compared to those given placebo. Moderate quality evidence indicated that people with stable angina who received ranolazine showed uncertain effect on quality of life compared with people who received placebo. Moderate quality evidence also indicated that people with stable angina who received ranolazine as add-on therapy had fewer angina episodes but increased risk of presenting non-serious adverse events compared to those given placebo.

### Stable coronary syndromes: pathophysiology, diagnostic advances and therapeutic need [^115Yhkq8]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Therapy

Pharmacological symptomatic therapy

A detailed review of therapy for the different disorders of coronary artery function is beyond the scope of this review. A summary of currently available therapies aligning with the different SCS disease endotypes is shown in table 2 (see additional references in online supplementary file 1). Robust evidence for the treatment of SCS is lacking. The treatment effect in many studies is potentially diluted by enrolment of heterogeneous groups of patients with distinct pathophysiological mechanisms of CMD that may respond differently to specific treatment modalities. Current European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines provide recommendations for patients with CMD suggesting ß-blockers as first-line therapy, with calcium antagonists recommended if the former is not tolerated or efficacious. Unlike in patients with angina and obstructive CAD, nitrates are not generally effective for treating SCS due to CMD. In a randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial of ranolazine led by the WISE investigators, although there were no overall improvements in angina and MPRi with ranolazine, benefit was observed in the subgroup of patients with a reduced CFR (< 2.5) at baseline. Patients with VSA may benefit symptomatically from treatment with both nitrate and calcium channel antagonists while the latter may have prognostic benefit. Rho-kinase inhibitors and endothelin-receptor antagonists represent potential future therapeutic options.

Table 2
Treatment of SCS endotypes

Secondary prevention

ESC guidelines support the use of secondary prevention with aspirin and statin therapy. In contrast, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline-95 on management of stable angina cites the enigmatic term 'Syndrome X', but guidance on the diagnosis and management is limited, reflecting the limited evidence base. Contemporary guidelines should be followed for the management of vascular risk factors in patients with INOCA. In patients with CMD, statin therapy reduces ischaemia as revealed by reduced ST-segment deviation following exercise testing and improves exercise capacity and flow-mediated dilatation in the brachial artery in patients with CMD. ACE inhibitors (ACEi) improve endothelial dysfunction and vasoreactivity via NO stimulation helping to reverse vascular hypertrophy and improve vascular compliance.

Non-pharmacological therapy

Lifestyle measures promote well-being in patients with INOCA through smoking cessation, healthy eating (eg, Mediterranean diet) and physical activity. The Comprehensive Treatment of Angina in Women With Microvascular Dysfunction trial (NCT02910154) will randomise women with angina and CMD to comprehensive multimodality intervention (dietary, exercise, and statin and ACEi therapy) or control therapy to determine whether angina and microvascular dysfunction can be improved.

### International observational analysis of evolution and outcomes of chronic stable angina: the multinational CLARIFY study [^112LuJiM]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

The presence of angina was recorded at baseline and yearly visits, and was defined as chest pain during physical exertion or equivalent symptoms necessitating occasional or permanent use of antianginal drugs in the judgment of the investigator. We aimed to describe the natural history of angina pectoris. Patients were categorized according to the presence of angina at baseline. Yearly changes in angina status are presented, up to the first myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization, given that these events can result in complications that may affect anginal status. Hence, patients were censored after occurrence of myocardial infarction or revascularization. Conversely, data from patients experiencing unstable angina that did not lead to coronary revascularization or myocardial infarction were analyzed.

To assess the consequences of angina evolution on cardiovascular outcomes, patients were categorized into 4 groups according to the evolution of angina between baseline and 1 year: persistence, resolution, occurrence (if angina was absent at baseline and appeared at 1 year), or absence of angina (if angina was absent at baseline and 1 year).

In patients with regression of angina (if angina was present at year N and absent at year N+1), control of angina was ascribed to coronary revascularization if the latter had been performed during the previous year as an elective procedure or for unstable angina. If no coronary revascularization had been performed, control of angina was ascribed to medical therapy if antianginal treatments, including β-blockers, ivabradine, calcium antagonists, long-acting nitrates, or other antianginal drugs (trimetazine, ranolazine, nicorandil, and molsidomine) had been added or increased and if β-blockers were switched or dosage increased. In patients who had not undergone revascularization or changes in antianginal therapy in the year before resolution, the control of angina was deemed as being without new medical intervention.

Subgroup analyses were performed in patients with previous myocardial infarction at baseline, known ischemia at baseline, diabetes, and multivessel CAD.

The primary outcome was the composite of cardiovascular death or nonfatal myocardial infarction. Secondary outcomes were all-cause death, cardiovascular death, fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, and elective myocardial revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting).

### Medical treatment of patients with stable angina pectoris referred for coronary angiography: failure of treatment or failure to treat [^112LAE6d]. Clinical Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Patients referred for elective coronary arteriography because of stable angina pectoris frequently do not receive appropriate medical therapy prior to arteriography. Persistence of symptoms due to lack of appropriate therapy may influence the decision to catheterize and the treatment chosen following catheterization.

Hypothesis

The present study evaluates whether patients with stable angina pectoris referred for cardiac catheterization received optimal therapy prior to the procedure. We also evaluated whether medical therapy was optimized as a result of the hospitalization for catheterization.

Methods

We evaluated prospectively the adequacy of medical therapy in 333 consecutive patients undergoing elective coronary arteriography. Of these, 160 had stable angina pectoris as their main problem and constituted the study group.

Results

Mean duration of angina was 7.5 ± 6.3 months. Canadian Cardiovascular Society angina grade 1 was present in 20, grade 2 in 77, grade 3 or 4 in 63 patients. Arteriography showed a ≥ 50% coronary stenosis in 141 of 160 patients. Aspirin was used by 96%, and 86% received at least one drug aimed at relieving anginal symptoms: beta blockers in 69%, calcium blockers in 30%, and long-acting nitrates in 29%. Antianginal drugs and drugs aimed at treating risk factors were usually taken at a low, subtherapeutic dosage. Only 35 of 110 patients taking beta blockers had a resting heart rate of < 60/min. Following catheterization, 88 of 141 patients with coronary stenosis of ≥ 50% underwent percutanous intervention and 5 had urgent surgery. Optimization of treatment was advised in only 7 of 48 patients for whom medical therapy or elective surgery was recommended.

Conclusion

Patients with stable angina pectoris are frequently referred for cardiac catheterization without making a serious attempt to control their symptoms by medical therapy. Risk factors are undertreated. With proper pharmacotherapy, many patients might have become asymptomatic and have chosen not to undergo catheterization and subsequent percutaneous interventions.

### Ranolazine: a contemporary review [^116adDNn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Guidelines

The American College of Cardiology Foundation and the American Heart Association published the Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Patients with Stable Ischemic Heart Disease in 2012. Ranolazine was recommended for patients with stable ischemic heart disease if unable to use acceptable doses of β‐blockers (Class of recommendation IIa, Level of Evidence B). 3

The European Society of Cardiology 2013 guidelines recommend ranolazine among agents for second‐line symptomatic treatment for angina, without evidence of benefit on prognosis (Class of recommendation IIa and Level of Evidence B). 2

Lastly, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society issued a position statement regarding management options for patients with refractory angina pectoris in 2009. Using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) convention, the use of ranolazine for patients unable to tolerate optimal doses of conventional anti‐anginal agents received a weak recommendation based on moderate‐quality evidence. 4

### Diagnosis of patients with angina and non-obstructive coronary disease in the catheter laboratory [^113anHSn]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Antianginal therapies for CMD

While the evidence base for antianginal therapy in CMD is less mature than for other conditions, notably obstructive CAD, we believe there is sufficient evidence, as outlined in contemporary guidelines, to make informed, personalised decisions for patients with ongoing symptoms and demonstrable ischaemia. Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are efficacious in both CMD and coronary vasospasm and therefore should be used first line for CMD where coronary vasospasm has not been ruled out. Beta-blockers can be beneficial in CMD but may potentiate coronary vasospasm due to unopposed α-receptor agonism, meaning they should be used as first-line therapy for CMD provided coronary vasospasm has been ruled out by vasoreactivity testing with acetylcholine. Nicorandil and ranolazine should be used as second-line and third-line therapies for CMD if symptoms persist.

Therapies for coronary vasospasm

The clinical manifestations of coronary vasospasm include sudden cardiac death, myocardial infarction and syncope, with therapies such as calcium channel blockers and statins shown to improve this adverse prognosis. Calcium channel blocker are highly efficacious for treating coronary vasospasm with long-acting nitrates being suitable second-line agents, while statins augment the effect of both and should also be considered a first-line agent. Novel therapeutics are being investigated for coronary vasospasm and these studies give an indication of the paradigm shift in therapeutics that needs to be considered for patients with NOCAD. Endothelin is a potent vasoconstrictor and abnormalities in the endothelin pathway are associated with coronary microvascular dysfunction. Endothelin receptor antagonist therapy has been associated with enhanced coronary endothelial function in patients with angiographically unobstructed coronaries and this may represent a targeted therapeutic agent for patients with epicardial and microvascular endothelial dysfunction.

### Efficacy of the long-acting nitro vasodilator pentaerithrityl tetranitrate in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris receiving anti-anginal background therapy with β-blockers: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^112SHeD7]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Study protocol

The study design is depicted in Figure 1. Before randomization, patients were requested to return to the study centres on two occasions. During the 'inclusion visit', the criteria listed above were evaluated and therapy with long-acting nitrates and calcium-channel antagonists was suspended for at least four half-lives. During the 'selection visit', the first exercise treadmill test was performed. All patients were then administered placebo tablets to be taken b.i.d. (single-blind placebo run-in period) for 1 week, after which ('randomization visit', V0) a second ETT was performed. At this point, patients were randomized to receive PETN 80 mg or placebo b.i.d. (8 a.m. and 1 p.m.). Background anti-anginal therapy with beta-blockers, ivabradine, ACE-inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers, statins, and diuretics was protracted as indicated. Patients, investigators, central readers of the ETT data, and the sponsor were blinded to the treatment received by the patients. After 6 weeks and 12 weeks of therapy, a third (6-week ETT, 'control visit', V1) and fourth ETT (12-week ETT, 'end of trial visit', V2) were performed. At each visit, data on the frequency of angina attacks and consumption of short-acting nitrates were collected from patient diaries and standard questionnaires. Patients also underwent a physical examination as well as sampling of blood chemistry and haematology prior to randomization (selection visit) and at the end of the trial (V2). 12-lead ECGs at rest were performed on each visit. Concomitant treatment with long-acting nitrates and calcium antagonists or substances that would interfere with the interpretation of the ECG such as antiarrhythmic agents and digitalis was considered to be an exclusion criterion.

Figure 1
Study protocol. All patients underwent four exercise treadmill tests: the first at the moment of enrolment into the study, the second 1 week later after a 7-day patient-blinded run-in period during which they received placebo treatment. The third and fourth treadmill tests were performed at 6 and 12 weeks into treatment.

### Ranolazine [^115gq4xR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Ranolazine has been evaluated in patients with chronic angina who remained symptomatic despite treatment with the maximum dose of an antianginal agent. In the ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p = 0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p = 0.014) were observed with ranolazine compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates.

Table 3 Angina Frequency and Nitroglycerin Use (ERICA)

a 1000 mg twice daily

Gender Effects on angina frequency and exercise tolerance were considerably smaller in women than in men. In CARISA, the improvement in Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) in females was about 33% of that in males at the 1000 mg twice-daily dose level. In ERICA, where the primary endpoint was angina attack frequency, the mean reduction in weekly angina attacks was 0.3 for females and 1.3 for males.

Race

There were insufficient numbers of non-Caucasian patients to allow for analyses of efficacy or safety by racial subgroup.

14.2	Lack of Benefit in Acute Coronary Syndrome

In a large (n = 6560) placebo-controlled trial (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there was no benefit shown on outcome measures. However, the study is somewhat reassuring regarding proarrhythmic risks, as ventricular arrhythmias were less common on ranolazine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)], and there was no difference between ranolazine and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine: placebo 0.99 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.22).

### Achieving optimal medical therapy: insights from the ORBITA trial [^115Tg6zA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this analysis of medical therapy in the ORBITA trial, we have shown that, within a 12‐week trial period, it is possible to achieve guideline‐directed truly optimal medical therapy. Antianginal therapy was initiated and uptitrated to effective doses in the majority. Amlodipine, bisoprolol, ranolazine, and ivabradine were well tolerated, whereas isosorbide mononitrate and nicorandil were associated with more adverse effects than other antianginal agents. Statins were well tolerated, causing adverse effects in only a small minority of patients.

Antianginal Therapy in Trials of PCI

The first trial of PCI for angina in the balloon angioplasty era, the ACME (Angioplasty Compared to Medicine) trial, used a "stepped‐care approach" with medical therapy in the control arm. Relatively low levels of medical therapy were achieved at 6 months, with 59%, 50%, and 71% of patients taking nitrates, β blockers, and calcium channel antagonists, respectively, in the control arm, and much lower levels in the treatment arm. 13 Multiple trials in stable CAD followed; however, the importance of attempting to attain truly optimal medical therapy was emphasized and integrated into trial design by the COURAGE (Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation) trial. 3 At randomization, 67.4%, 86.8%, and 41.4% of patients were on a nitrate, β blocker, and calcium channel antagonist, respectively. Medical therapy was more modest in the subsequent FAME 2 (Fractional Flow Reserve Versus Angiography for Multivessel Evaluation 2) trial, with 76.7% on β blockers and only 23.1% on calcium channel antagonists. Nitrate use was unreported. More recently, the ISCHEMIA trial was designed to compare an initial invasive or conservative strategy, in patients with moderate to severe ischemia. Despite the complexity of medication optimization in this large, multicenter, international trial, a great deal of effort was invested in trying to attain optimal medical therapy. 14 There was a high level of β‐blocker use, 81.0%, with lower levels of calcium channel antagonist use, 30.2%, at enrollment, 14 and similar proportions at follow‐up. 5

Ranolazine has been evaluated in patients with chronic angina who remained symptomatic despite treatment with the maximum dose of an antianginal agent. In the ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 4. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p = 0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p = 0.014) were observed with ranolazine compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates.

### Phenotype-based management of coronary microvascular dysfunction [^114GGJnY]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Microvascular angina

Although obviously a lot less accurate than the information provided by invasive coronary physiology studies and non-invasive tests such as PET or cardiac MRI perfusion scans, the clinical presentation with predominantly effort-induced angina, rest-angina suggestive of vasospasm or "mixed" effort and rest angina, helps clinicians to at least suspect the prevailing mechanism of angina in a given patient and identify suitable initial antianginal therapies. First line therapy in effort-induced MVA entails a trial of beta-blockers (selective beta-blockers, or combined alpha/beta-blockers) or calcium channel antagonists (dihydropyridine and/or non-dihydropyridine). Long-acting nitrates should be avoided in general, as they are frequently ineffective and may aggravate symptoms due to a 'steal effect'. However, up to 50% of MVA patients find short-acting sublingual nitrates, oral nitrates or skin GTN patches helpful. Nicorandil may be helpful in cases of vasospastic MVA, as it is in patients with variant angina. These therapies aid with vasodilatation as well as reduction in myocardial oxygen consumption.

Renin-angiotensin system blockade is recommended. ACE inhibitors have been demonstrated to improve hyperemic myocardial blood flow, CFR and angina burden in patients with MVA. Statins may have additional benefit in MVA, over and above standard lipid control and plaque modification. Studies suggest anti-inflammatory properties, increase in endothelial nitric oxide release and inhibition of the rho kinase pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells, which leads to vasodilatation.

Ranolazine is mentioned in guidance documents, with potentially better response in patients with low CFR.

Vasospastic angina

Patients with epicardial or microvascular spasm should undergo initial therapy with calcium channel blockade. This encourages vascular smooth muscle relaxation, reduces propensity toward spasm, and potentially reduces myocardial oxygen demand. High doses and/or a combination of non-dihydropyridine (verapamil or diltiazem) with dihydropyridine (amlodipine) calcium blockers may be required. In contrast to MVA, long-acting nitrates are useful adjuncts in epicardial spasm, while beta-blockers are avoided. Nicorandil is also an option.

Mixed (microvascular and vasospastic)

The combination of treatments in this group reflects the mixed pathologies described above. Calcium channel antagonists (dihydropyridine and/or non-dihydropyridine) are considered first line, followed by nicorandil and/or third line agents such as ranolazine or trimetazidine.

Introduction

Angina pectoris is typically caused by myocardial ischaemia owing to an imbalance between myocardial perfusion and oxygen demand. Elevated heart rate increases myocardial oxygen demand and limits tissue perfusion, the latter by reducing the duration of diastole during which most myocardial perfusion occurs. Long-term prognosis in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris is favourableand medical and interventional therapies show similar benefit. Thus, current treatment guidelines advocate an initial approach with medical therapy. – Beta-blockers reduce myocardial ischaemia and prevent angina pectoris largely by lowering heart rate and are recommended as an initial therapy for stable angina pectoris, unless contraindicated. –

In modern clinical practice, however, many patients with stable angina pectoris require treatment with more than one anti-anginal drug, in addition to short-acting nitrates. Ivabradine is a pure heart rate-lowering agent that acts by inhibiting I f, an important ionic current involved in the pacemaker activity in cells of the sino-atrial node. Ivabradine reduces the slope of spontaneous diastolic depolarization in these cells and lowers heart rate at rest and during exercise. Given as monotherapy (with short-acting nitrates allowed as required), ivabradine has demonstrated anti-ischaemic and anti-anginal efficacy in randomized trials in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris when compared with placeboand has been shown to be non-inferior to atenololor amlodipine. The drug has been recommended for the medical management of patients with stable angina pectoris who are intolerant of beta-blockers or in whom these agents are contraindicated.

The primary purpose of the present study was to evaluate the anti-ischaemic and anti-anginal efficacy of ivabradine, relative to placebo, when given to patients with chronic stable angina pectoris receiving beta-blocker therapy.

Clinical assessment of patients considered to have refractory angina

A stepwise approach to patients with refractory angina is summarized in Table 1. A detailed clinical assessment including a careful history is essential to identify underlying ischaemic mechanisms and determine initial approach to investigation. Particular attention should be placed on symptoms and mechanisms associated with ANOCA/INOCA, including coronary vasospasm. Variation in symptom reporting according to age, gender, and ethnicity should be considered. Conditions associated with anginal-type pain in addition to non-cardiac causes of chest pain should be considered (see Supplementary data online, Table S2). Trials of drugs aimed at improving suspected non-cardiac causes of chest pain, such as proton-pump inhibitors for gastro-oesophageal reflux, may be diagnostically and therapeutically useful.

### Testing the effectiveness of converting patients to long-acting antianginal medications: the quality of life in angina research trial (QUART) [^112igvxB]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Our purpose was to test the hypothesis that converting patients with stable angina to long-acting antianginal medications would improve their functional status, symptom control, treatment satisfaction, and quality of life.

Methods and Results

A single-blind randomized trial of 100 patients with stable coronary artery disease was performed in the outpatient clinic of a Veterans Affairs Health System. Outpatients with chronic stable angina taking at least 2 antianginal medications were studied. Patients were randomized to one of two treatments: optimal adjustment of their usual antianginal medications or conversion to solely long-acting medications (long-acting diltiazem ± nitroglycerin patches ± atenolol) with subsequent optimization. The primary outcome was the 3-month change in Seattle Angina Questionnaire scores. Although no differences in physical limitation scores were noted, patients randomized to receive long-acting medications had improved symptom control (3-month improvement in anginal stability [19.1 vs 5.6, P = 0.02] and anginal frequency [17.8 vs 5.5, P = 0.006]), more treatment satisfaction (3-month improvement of 8.2 vs 3.0, P = 0.057), and better quality of life (3-month improvement of 11.2 vs 5.6, P = 0.09) compared with patients whose pretrial medications were optimized. The improvement in symptom control was statistically significant.

Conclusion

Converting patients with chronic, stable angina to long-acting antianginal medications resulted in substantial improvements in symptom control with a trend toward better treatment satisfaction and quality of life.

### Long-acting nitrates in the treatment of angina pectoris… [^112VaXFd]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

"LONG-ACTING" nitrates are widely regarded as a mainstay of medical therapy for angina pectoris, but their efficacy and duration of action remain controversial. Moreover, a confusing variety of nitrate preparations is currently available. Now that other effective modes of angina prophylaxis exist, a critical awareness of the usefulness and limitations of long-acting nitrates is all the more important. This review will outline nitrate pharmacology and propose a practical approach to the rational selection of an effective nitrate regimen for the individual patient. The therapeutic effectiveness of sublingual nitroglycerin in typical angina pectoris is clear-cut and undisputed. Administration of an effective dose during anginal pain clearly reduces the duration of the episode if the patient's untreated angina normally persists long enough for sublingual nitroglycerin to take effect.

While this effect is helpful and reas. Reichek N. Long-Acting Nitrates in the Treatment of Angina Pectoris. JAMA. 1976; 236: 1399–1402.

### Diagnostic potential of amyl nitrite and nitroglycerin… [^111gbxwU]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Introduced respectively by Brunton in 1867 and Murrell in 1879, amyl nitrite inhalations and nitroglycerin "sub-linguations" appeared to be so effective in alleviating anginal pain that they were often used as diagnostic tests for myocardial ischemia. As contrasted with noncoronary pain, that of "true" angina was expected to respond to either amyl nitrite or nitroglycerin — both drugs having been assumed to differ from each other only in their side effects. These simplistic presuppositions of predictable effectiveness of these drugs and uniformity of their actions are no longer tenable. Increasing knowledge of the hemodynamics of angina and the pharmacodynamics of nitrites is providing new insights into the intricacies of their interrelationships.

Because both amyl nitrite and nitroglycerin are primarily smooth muscle relaxants, and thus vasodilators, their initial effect is that of arteriolar and venous dilation — the former resulting in diminished venous return to the heart, the latter in decreased resistance to left ventricular.

### Topical nitroglycerin for ischemic heart disease… [^111AYZuj]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

THE MAINSTAY of medical management of angina pectoris continues to be β-blocking agents and nitrates. Used initially in the treatment of Raynaud's disease, 1 nitroglycerin ointment was first introduced for the treatment of angina pectoris in 1955, but at that time it did not receive widespread clinical application. In the past few years, topical nitroglycerin has enjoyed a revival as a therapeutic agent, especially for patients with unstable or nocturnal angina. We compared the physiological and clinical effectiveness of sublingual and topical nitroglycerin when used in patients with ischemic heart disease. Mechanism of Action of Nitroglycerin Myocardial ischemia is the result of an imbalance between myocardial oxygen demand and myocardial oxygen supply. Although nitroglycerin has been shown to be clinically effective in the therapy of this condition, its exact mechanism of action is still uncertain.

At the present time it seems prudent to consider that nitroglycerin alters the. Miner JA, Conti CR. Topical Nitroglycerin for Ischemic Heart Disease. JAMA. 1978; 239: 2166–2167.
