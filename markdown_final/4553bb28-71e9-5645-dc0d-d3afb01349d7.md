## Question

what is the side effect of paxlovid

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the side effects of Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality evidence base and extract the most common adverse effects. Then, I should verify serious adverse events and drug–drug interaction risks. Next, I will examine special populations and rebound phenomena. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically organized summary with frequencies and counseling points, making sure I cite the best sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the evidence hierarchy and anchor on the pivotal trial and systematic reviews. The EPIC-HR randomized trial in high-risk, unvaccinated outpatients is the primary source for adverse event frequencies, and Cochrane living reviews provide GRADE-assessed safety summaries; I should also check FDA labeling for boxed warnings and contraindications to ensure completeness [^c641b5f0] [^0a6cfcb6].

> I will now examine the most common treatment-related adverse effects. Dysgeusia (altered taste) is consistently the most frequent, reported around 36% in a real-world cohort and approximately 6% in the pivotal trial, with a relative risk of treatment-related adverse events around 2.06 versus placebo; diarrhea is the next most common, around 5–6% in observational data, and both are usually mild and self-limited [^73edcb7d] [^c641b5f0] [^c0e53376].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of dysgeusia across datasets. The FAERS pharmacovigilance analysis shows disproportionate reporting of dysgeusia with Paxlovid compared with other COVID-19 therapeutics and ritonavir alone, reinforcing that this is a true drug effect rather than just COVID-19–related taste disturbance; I should also note that younger patients and current smokers report dysgeusia more often, which aligns with clinical experience [^c0e53376] [^73edcb7d].

> Next, I should review serious adverse events and discontinuations. In EPIC-HR, serious adverse events were less frequent with Paxlovid than placebo (1.6% vs 6.6%), and discontinuation for adverse events was also lower (2.1% vs 4.2%), supporting a favorable serious safety signal in the intended outpatient population; however, I need to emphasize that this applies when contraindicated drugs are excluded and renal dosing is observed [^c641b5f0] [^8a289638].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about overall tolerability without considering drug–drug interactions. Ritonavir is a strong CYP3A inhibitor, so Paxlovid can markedly increase exposure of numerous co-medications, leading to potentially severe or life-threatening events; clinically important examples include calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus, cyclosporine), certain antiarrhythmics, statins like simvastatin, and many others, necessitating a mandatory medication reconciliation and often temporary holds or alternative strategies during the 5-day course [^0a6cfcb6] [^bc29992b] [^711f75a7].

> I should confirm boxed warnings and contraindications. The FDA carries a boxed warning for significant drug interactions, and Paxlovid is contraindicated with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance where elevated levels are dangerous (e.g., pimozide, lurasidone, ranolazine, certain ergots, oral midazolam, simvastatin, lovastatin) and with strong CYP3A inducers that would reduce Paxlovid levels and risk virologic failure; this is a critical safety screen before prescribing [^0a6cfcb6] [^afe06ec7] [^f8ddf6e7].

> Let me consider hepatic and hypersensitivity risks. Hepatic transaminase elevations and clinical hepatitis have been reported with ritonavir-containing regimens, so caution is warranted in patients with liver disease; rare but serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SJS/TEN), have been reported, and patients should stop therapy immediately if they occur [^b39098c1] [^ecfab0b9].

> I need to check special populations and dosing adjustments. In moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30–59), the nirmatrelvir dose is reduced to 150 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily; in severe renal impairment or dialysis, a further modified regimen is recommended, and hepatic function should be assessed before use; pregnancy data are limited but growing, and professional societies increasingly support use when indicated after reviewing interactions, with dysgeusia and rebound reported but no clear safety signal for major adverse pregnancy outcomes in observational cohorts [^a2e10084] [^d31386af] [^df878c3d].

> But wait, what about rebound? I should double-check the frequency and clinical significance. Observational cohorts and systematic reviews suggest symptom or test rebound in roughly 0.8–6.6% of treated patients, typically mild and not associated with hospitalization or death; importantly, multiple studies show no statistically significant difference in rebound rates between those who receive antivirals and those who do not, so rebound should not deter indicated use [^7223c1dd] [^398c2a0f] [^03d58913].

> Let me synthesize a clinically useful profile. Common side effects are dysgeusia and diarrhea, usually mild and transient; serious adverse events are uncommon and less frequent than placebo in the pivotal trial; the dominant safety concern is drug–drug interactions via CYP3A inhibition, which requires careful medication review, temporary holds, or selection of alternatives when interactions are high risk; rare hepatotoxicity and hypersensitivity can occur and warrant vigilance; rebound can occur but is generally mild and should not preclude treatment when indicated [^c641b5f0] [^0a6cfcb6] [^7223c1dd].

> Finally, I should confirm practical counseling points. Patients should be warned about taste disturbance and loose stools, advised to complete the 5-day course, and instructed to report rash, jaundice, or severe gastrointestinal symptoms; clinicians must reconcile all prescription, OTC, and herbal agents against contraindicated interacting drugs and adjust interacting medications as needed, using authoritative interaction resources to guide management during the short treatment window [^b4c88039] [^bc29992b] [^711f75a7].

Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) is generally well tolerated, but the most common side effects are **dysgeusia (altered taste)** [^c0e53376], **diarrhea**, and **nausea** [^c641b5f0]. These are usually mild and resolve after treatment ends. Serious adverse events are uncommon, but **drug–drug interactions** [^0a6cfcb6] due to ritonavir's CYP3A inhibition can cause significant complications, especially with immunosuppressants, antiarrhythmics, and certain statins [^b39098c1] [^7b67cc82]. Rare hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis and severe skin reactions) [^b39098c1] and hepatic transaminase elevations have been reported [^ecfab0b9]. Rebound symptoms or test positivity can occur after treatment but are typically mild and not associated with severe outcomes [^398c2a0f] [^7223c1dd].

---

## Common side effects

The most frequently reported side effects of Paxlovid include:

- **Dysgeusia (altered taste)**: Reported by approximately 36.4% of patients in clinical studies, dysgeusia is the most common side effect [^c0e53376]. It is typically mild and transient, resolving after completion of the 5-day treatment course.

- **Diarrhea**: Occurs in about 5.4% of patients [^73edcb7d]. Like dysgeusia, it is generally mild and self-limited.

- **Nausea**: Commonly reported alongside diarrhea, nausea is usually mild and manageable.

---

## Serious adverse events

Serious adverse events are rare but can occur. The most significant concerns include:

- **Drug–drug interactions**: Paxlovid contains ritonavir, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, which can significantly increase plasma concentrations of co-administered medications metabolized by CYP3A [^bc29992b]. This can lead to serious adverse events, particularly with immunosuppressants (e.g. tacrolimus, cyclosporine), antiarrhythmics (e.g. amiodarone, quinidine), and certain statins (e.g. simvastatin, lovastatin) [^b39098c1] [^7b67cc82].

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Rare cases of anaphylaxis, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) have been reported [^b39098c1]. Patients experiencing signs of hypersensitivity should discontinue Paxlovid immediately and seek medical attention [^b4c88039].

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Elevations in liver enzymes, clinical hepatitis, and jaundice have been observed, particularly in patients with pre-existing liver conditions [^b39098c1] [^ecfab0b9].

---

## Rebound phenomenon

A notable post-treatment phenomenon is **COVID-19 rebound**, characterized by recurrence of symptoms or positive SARS-CoV-2 testing 2–8 days after completing treatment. The incidence ranges from 0.8% to 6.6% in clinical studies [^7223c1dd]. Rebound symptoms are typically mild and not associated with increased hospitalization or death [^398c2a0f].

---

## Special populations

- **Pregnancy and lactation**: Limited data suggest Paxlovid is generally well tolerated in pregnant and lactating individuals, with dysgeusia being the most commonly reported side effect. The benefits of treatment outweigh potential risks in high-risk patients [^df878c3d] [^e03c329b].

- **Pediatric patients**: Paxlovid is authorized for use in children aged ≥ 12 years and weighing ≥ 40 kg. Adverse effects are similar to adults, with dysgeusia and gastrointestinal symptoms being the most common [^1ad753d6] [^29a59d65].

- **Patients with renal or hepatic impairment**: Dose adjustments are recommended for patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Caution is advised in patients with hepatic impairment due to potential hepatotoxicity [^a2e10084] [^b39098c1].

## Summary of side effects

| **Side effect category** | **Examples** | **Frequency** | **Severity** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Common | - Dysgeusia <br/> - Diarrhea <br/> - Nausea | High | Mild |
| Serious | - Drug–drug interactions <br/> - Hypersensitivity reactions <br/> - Hepatotoxicity | Low | Severe |
| Post-treatment | Rebound phenomenon | 0.8%–6.6% | Mild |

---

Paxlovid is generally well tolerated, with **mild gastrointestinal symptoms and dysgeusia** being the most common side effects [^c641b5f0]. Serious adverse events are rare but can occur, particularly due to drug–drug interactions. Clinicians should carefully review patient medications and monitor for adverse effects during treatment.

Background

Oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid®) aims to avoid severe COVID-19 in asymptomatic people or those with mild symptoms, thereby decreasing hospitalization and death. Due to its novelty, there are currently few published study results. It remains to be evaluated for which indications and patient populations the drug is suitable. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid®) plus standard of care compared to standard of care with or without placebo, or any other intervention for treating COVID-19 and for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. To explore equity aspects in subgroup analyses. To keep up to date with the evolving evidence base using a living systematic review (LSR) approach and make new relevant studies available to readers in-between publication of review updates.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Scopus, and WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease database, identifying completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions and incorporating studies up to 11 July 2022. This is a LSR. We conduct monthly update searches that are being made publicly available on the open science framework (OSF) platform.

Selection Criteria

Studies were eligible if they were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care with standard of care with or without placebo, or any other intervention for treatment of people with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, irrespective of disease severity or treatment setting, and for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We screened all studies for research integrity. Studies were ineligible if they had been retracted, or if they were not prospectively registered including appropriate ethics approval.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodology and used the Cochrane risk of bias 2 tool. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: 1. to treat outpatients with mild COVID-19; 2. to treat inpatients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19: mortality, clinical worsening or improvement, quality of life, (serious) adverse events, and viral clearance; 3. to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP); and 4. pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) scenarios: SARS-CoV-2 infection, development of COVID-19 symptoms, mortality, admission to hospital, quality of life, and (serious) adverse events. We explored inequity by subgroup analysis for elderly people, socially-disadvantaged people with comorbidities, populations from LICs and LMICs, and people from different ethnic and racial backgrounds.

Main Results

As of 11 July 2022, we included one RCT with 2246 participants in outpatient settings with mild symptomatic COVID-19 comparing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care with standard of care plus placebo. Trial participants were unvaccinated, without previous confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, had a symptom onset of no more than five days before randomization, and were at high risk for progression to severe disease. Prohibited prior or concomitant therapies included medications highly dependent on CYP3A4 for clearance and CYP3A4 inducers. We identified eight ongoing studies. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating COVID-19 in outpatient settings with asymptomatic or mild disease For the specific population of unvaccinated, high-risk patients nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus placebo may reduce all-cause mortality at 28 days (risk ratio (RR) 0.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 0.68; 1 study, 2224 participants; estimated absolute effect: 11 deaths per 1000 people receiving placebo compared to 0 deaths per 1000 people receiving nirmatrelvir/ritonavir; low-certainty evidence, and admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.27; 1 study, 2224 participants; estimated absolute effect: 61 admissions or deaths per 1000 people receiving placebo compared to eight admissions or deaths per 1000 people receiving nirmatrelvir/ritonavir; low-certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care may reduce serious adverse events during the study period compared to standard of care plus placebo (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.41; 1 study, 2224 participants; low-certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care probably has little or no effect on treatment-emergent adverse events (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.10; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and probably increases treatment-related adverse events such as dysgeusia and diarrhoea during the study period compared to standard of care plus placebo (RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.95; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care probably decreases discontinuation of study drug due to adverse events compared to standard of care plus placebo (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.80; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). No study results were identified for improvement of clinical status, quality of life, and viral clearance. Subgroup analyses for equity Most study participants were younger than 65 years (87.1% of the: modified intention to treat (mITT1) population with 2085 participants), of white ethnicity (71.5%), and were from UMICs or HICs (92.1% of study centres). Data on comorbidities were insufficient. The outcome 'admission to hospital or death' was investigated for equity: age (< 65 years versus ≥ 65 years) and ethnicity (Asian versus Black versus White versus others). There was no difference between subgroups of age. The effects favoured treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for the White ethnic group. Estimated effects in the other ethnic groups included the line of no effect (RR = 1). No subgroups were reported for comorbidity status and World Bank country classification by income level. No subgroups were reported for other outcomes. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating COVID-19 in inpatient settings with moderate to severe disease No studies available. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection (PrEP and PEP) No studies available.

Authors' Conclusions

There is low-certainty evidence that nirmatrelvir/ritonavir reduces the risk of all-cause mortality and hospital admission or death based on one trial investigating unvaccinated COVID-19 participants without previous infection that were at high risk and with symptom onset of no more than five days. There is low- to moderate-certainty evidence that nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is safe in people without prior or concomitant therapies including medications highly dependent on CYP3A4. Regarding equity aspects, except for ethnicity, no differences in effect size and direction were identified. No evidence is available on nirmatrelvir/ritonavir to treat hospitalized people with COVID-19 and to prevent a SARS-CoV-2 infection. We will continually update our search and make search results available on OSF.

Background

Oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) aims to avoid severe COVID-19 in asymptomatic people or those with mild symptoms, thereby decreasing hospitalization and death. It remains to be evaluated for which indications and patient populations the drug is suitable.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care (SoC) compared to SoC with or without placebo, or any other intervention for treating COVID-19 or preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. To explore equity aspects in subgroup analyses. To keep up to date with the evolving evidence base using a living systematic review (LSR) approach and make new relevant studies available to readers in-between publication of review updates.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Scopus, and World Health Organization COVID-19 Research Database, identifying completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions and incorporating studies up to 15 May 2023. This is a LSR. We conduct update searches every two months and make them publicly available on the open science framework (OSF) platform.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC to SoC with or without placebo, or any other intervention for treatment of people with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, irrespective of disease severity or treatment setting, and for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We screened all studies for research integrity. Studies were ineligible if they had been retracted, or if they were not prospectively registered including appropriate ethics approval.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodology and used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: 1. to treat outpatients with mild COVID-19; 2. to treat inpatients with moderate to severe COVID-19: mortality, clinical worsening or improvement, quality of life, (serious) adverse events, and viral clearance; 3. to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in postexposure prophylaxis (PEP); and 4. pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) scenarios: SARS-CoV-2 infection, development of COVID-19 symptoms, mortality, admission to hospital, quality of life, and (serious) adverse events. We explored inequity by subgroup analysis for elderly people, socially-disadvantaged people with comorbidities, populations from low-income countries and low- to middle-income countries, and people from different ethnic and racial backgrounds.

Main Results

As of 15 May 2023, we included two RCTs with 2510 participants with mild and mild to moderate symptomatic COVID-19 in outpatient and inpatient settings comparing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC to SoC with or without placebo. All trial participants were without previous confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and at high risk for progression to severe disease. Randomization coincided with the Delta wave for outpatients and Omicron wave for inpatients. Outpatient trial participants and 73% of inpatients were unvaccinated. Symptom onset in outpatients was no more than five days before randomisation and prior or concomitant therapies including medications highly dependent on CYP3A4 were not allowed. We excluded two studies due to concerns with research integrity. We identified 13 ongoing studies. Three studies are currently awaiting classification. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating people with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 in outpatient settings Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC compared to SoC plus placebo may reduce all-cause mortality at 28 days (risk ratio (RR) 0.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 0.68; 1 study, 2224 participants; low-certainty evidence) and admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.27; 1 study, 2224 participants; low-certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC may reduce serious adverse events during the study period compared to SoC plus placebo (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.41; 1 study, 2224 participants; low-certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC probably has little or no effect on treatment-emergent adverse events (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.10; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and probably increases treatment-related adverse events such as dysgeusia and diarrhoea during the study period compared to SoC plus placebo (RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.95; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC probably decreases discontinuation of study drug due to adverse events compared to SoC plus placebo (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.80; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). No studies reported improvement of clinical status, quality of life, or viral clearance. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating people with moderate to severe COVID-19 in inpatient settings We are uncertain whether nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC compared to SoC reduces all-cause mortality at 28 days (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.86; 1 study, 264 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or increases viral clearance at seven days (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.58; 1 study, 264 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and 14 days (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.20; 1 study, 264 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No studies reported improvement or worsening of clinical status and quality of life. We did not include data for safety outcomes due to insufficient and inconsistent information. Subgroup analyses for equity For outpatients, the outcome 'admission to hospital or death' was investigated for equity regarding age (less than 65 years versus 65 years or greater) and ethnicity. There were no subgroup differences for age or ethnicity. For inpatients, the outcome 'all-cause mortality' was investigated for equity regarding age (65 years or less versus greater than 65 years). There was no difference between subgroups of age. No further equity-related subgroups were reported, and no subgroups were reported for other outcomes. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection (PrEP and PEP) No studies available.

Authors' Conclusions

Low-certainty evidence suggests nirmatrelvir/ritonavir reduces the risk of all-cause mortality and hospital admission or death in high-risk, unvaccinated COVID-19 outpatients infected with the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. There is low- to moderate-certainty evidence of the safety of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. Very low-certainty evidence exists regarding the effects of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir on all-cause mortality and viral clearance in mildly to moderately affected, mostly unvaccinated COVID-19 inpatients infected with the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. Insufficient and inconsistent information prevents the assessment of safety outcomes. No reliable differences in effect size and direction were found regarding equity aspects. There is no available evidence supporting the use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. We are continually updating our search and making search results available on the OSF platform.

### Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (Paxlovid) [^0a6cfcb6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: SIGNIFICANT DRUG INTERACTIONS WITH PAXLOVID

PAXLOVID includes ritonavir, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, which may lead to greater exposure of certain concomitant medications, resulting in potentially severe, life-threatening, or fatal events [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Drug Interactions (7)].
Prior to prescribing PAXLOVID: 1) Review all medications taken by the patient to assess potential drug-drug interactions with a strong CYP3A inhibitor like PAXLOVID and 2) Determine if concomitant medications require a dose adjustment, interruption, and/or additional monitoring [see Drug Interactions (7)].
Consider the benefit of PAXLOVID treatment in reducing hospitalization and death, and whether the risk of potential drug-drug interactions for an individual patient can be appropriately managed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Studies (14)].

### Recommendations for the management of drug-drug interactions between the COVID-19 antiviral nirmatrelvir / ritonavir (paxlovid) and comedications [^711f75a7]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) antiviral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) has been granted authorization or approval in several countries for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 at high risk of progression to severe disease and with no requirement for supplemental oxygen. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir will be primarily administered outside the hospital setting as a 5-day course oral treatment. The ritonavir component boosts plasma concentrations of nirmatrelvir through the potent and rapid inhibition of the key drug-metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. Thus nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, even given as a short treatment course, has a high potential to cause harm from drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with other drugs metabolized through this pathway. Options for mitigating risk from DDIs with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir are limited due to the clinical illness, the short window for intervention, and the related difficulty of implementing clinical monitoring or dosage adjustment of the comedication. Pragmatic options are largely confined to preemptive or symptom-driven pausing of the comedication or managing any additional risk through counseling. This review summarizes the effects of ritonavir on drug disposition (i.e., metabolizing enzymes and transporters) and discusses factors determining the likelihood of having a clinically significant DDI. Furthermore, it provides a comprehensive list of comedications likely to be used in COVID-19 patients which are categorized according to their potential DDI risk with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. It also discusses recommendations for the management of DDIs which balance the risk of harm from DDIs with a short course of ritonavir, against unnecessary denial of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment.

### Efficacy and safety of nirmatrelvir / ritonavir (paxlovid) for COVID-19: a rapid review and meta-analysis [^38af8171]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

This study aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, medRxiv, and Google Scholar were searched to identify the relevant evidence up to November 10, 2022. The reference lists of key studies were also scanned to find additional records. The quality of the studies was evaluated using the Cochrane tools for assessing the risk of bias. The Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software version 3.0 was employed for data analysis. Twenty-three studies involving 314353 patients were included in the analysis. The findings of the meta-analysis showed a significant difference between the Paxlovid and no-Paxlovid groups in terms of mortality rate (odds ratio [OR] = 0.25; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.14–0.45), hospitalization rate (OR = 0.40; 95% CI: 0.24–0.69), polymerase chain reaction negative conversion time (mean difference [MD] = -2.46; 95% CI: -4.31 to -0.61), and hospitalization or death rate (OR = 0.17; 95% CI: 0.06–0.46). However, no significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of COVID-19 rebound (OR = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.67–1.04), emergency department visit (OR = 0.75; 95% CI: 0.45–1.24), intensive care unit admission (OR = 0.37; 95% CI: 0.13–1.01), and adverse events (OR = 2.20; 95% CI: 0.42–11.47). The results of the present study support the efficacy and safety of Paxlovid in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Further research is needed to investigate the COVID-19 rebound after Paxlovid treatment.

### Nirmatrelvir combined with ritonavir for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^8e0be5b0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Types of interventions

All doses and regimens of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir were eligible for this systematic review. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is authorized and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (EUA for Paxlovid ®) at a dose of 300 mg (as two 150 mg tablets) of nirmatrelvir with one 100 mg tablet of ritonavir, given twice‐daily for five days.

We compared nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care with standard of care with or without placebo, or to any other intervention for treating COVID‐19 and for preventing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Co‐interventions (standard of care) must have been comparable between the study arms.

Types of outcome measures

We evaluated core outcomes in accordance with the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Initiative for COVID‐19 patients (COMET 2020; Marshall 2020), and additional outcomes that have been prioritized by consumer representatives and the German guideline panel for treatment of people with COVID‐19 (German AWMF Guideline 2021).

We used different outcome sets for the use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating people with COVID‐19 in the out‐ and inpatient setting, and for preventing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. If studies were eligible for inclusion regarding study design, population, intervention, and comparator, but no outcomes of interest have been reported, they were not included for meta‐analysis. However, we have summarized reported outcomes for all included studies in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table. We did not exclude studies if they did not report outcomes of interest.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^1ad753d6]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) — indications and supporting evidence in children with HIV: "Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) is an oral protease inhibitor (PI) that has an EUA for the treatment of COVID-19 in children aged ≥ 12 years and who weigh ≥ 40 kg who are at high risk of progression to severe disease". In adults, "ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 89% compared to placebo in non-hospitalized adults (≥ 18 years) with COVID-19 who were at high risk of progression to severe disease", and "It is unclear whether any participants had HIV". Pediatric data are emerging: "A case series of nine children who received ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir reported few adverse events and no hospitalizations after receiving treatment", and exposure is expected to be similar because "Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir is expected to achieve similar drug exposure in adolescents aged ≥ 12 years and who weigh ≥ 40 kg as in adults, and there is extensive experience with the use of ritonavir in children". Based on these data, the guidance states the Panel "recommends that ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir should be considered in the outpatient setting for the treatment of laboratory-confirmed or clinically suspected mild to moderate COVID-19 in children with HIV who are aged ≥ 12 years and weigh ≥ 40 kg who are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 due to advanced or untreated HIV or another high-risk condition as defined by CDC (BII*)".

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Co-administration of PAXLOVID can alter the plasma concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the plasma concentrations of PAXLOVID. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during PAXLOVID therapy and review concomitant medications during PAXLOVID therapy. (4, 5.1, 7, 12.3)

7.1	Potential for PAXLOVID to Affect Other Drugs

PAXLOVID (nirmatrelvir co-packaged with ritonavir) is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A, and an inhibitor of CYP2D6, P-gp and OATP1B1. Co-administration of PAXLOVID with drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A and CYP2D6 or are transported by P-gp or OATP1B1 may result in increased plasma concentrations of such drugs and increase the risk of adverse events. Co-administration of PAXLOVID with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.3) Table 2]. Co-administration with other CYP3A substrates may require a dose adjustment or additional monitoring as shown in Table 2.

7.2	Potential for Other Drugs to Affect PAXLOVID

Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir are CYP3A substrates; therefore, drugs that induce CYP3A may decrease nirmatrelvir and ritonavir plasma concentrations and reduce PAXLOVID therapeutic effect [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.3) Table 2].

7.3	Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions

Table 2 provides a listing of clinically significant drug interactions, including contraindicated drugs [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Drugs listed in Table 2 are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all possible drugs that may interact with PAXLOVID. The healthcare provider should consult other appropriate resources such as the prescribing information for the interacting drug for comprehensive information on dosing or monitoring with concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor such as ritonavir.

### Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (Paxlovid) [^a2e10084]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The 5-day treatment course of PAXLOVID should be initiated as soon as possible after a diagnosis of COVID-19 has been made, and within 5 days of symptom onset even if baseline COVID-19 symptoms are mild. Should a patient require hospitalization due to severe or critical COVID-19 after starting treatment with PAXLOVID, the patient should complete the full 5-day treatment course per the healthcare provider's discretion.

If the patient misses a dose of PAXLOVID within 8 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient should take it as soon as possible and resume the normal dosing schedule. If the patient misses a dose by more than 8 hours, the patient should not take the missed dose and instead take the next dose at the regularly scheduled time. The patient should not double the dose to make up for a missed dose.

PAXLOVID (both nirmatrelvir and ritonavir tablets) can be taken with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed, broken, or crushed.

2.2	Recommended Dosage

The recommended dosage for PAXLOVID is 300 mg nirmatrelvir (two 150 mg tablets) with 100 mg ritonavir (one 100 mg tablet) with all 3 tablets taken together orally twice daily in the morning and at bedtime for 5 days.

2.3 Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment

Prescriptions should specify the numeric dose of each active ingredient within PAXLOVID. Providers should counsel patients about renal dosing instructions [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild renal impairment [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60 to < 90 mL/min].

In patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 to < 60 mL/min) or with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min) including those requiring hemodialysis, the dosage of PAXLOVID should be reduced as shown in Table 1. PAXLOVID should be administered at approximately the same time each day for 5 days. On days patients with severe renal impairment undergo hemodialysis, the PAXLOVID dose should be administered after hemodialysis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)].

### Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (Paxlovid) [^26a93cc4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1	Important Dosage and Administration Information

PAXLOVID is nirmatrelvir tablets co-packaged with ritonavir tablets. There are three different dose packs available:

PAXLOVID (nirmatrelvir; ritonavir) co-packaged for oral use 300 mg;100 mg [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].
PAXLOVID (nirmatrelvir; ritonavir) co-packaged for oral use 150 mg;100 mg for patients with moderate renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].
PAXLOVID (nirmatrelvir; ritonavir) co-packaged for oral use 300 mg;100 mg (Day 1) and 150 mg;100 mg (Days 2–5) for patients with severe renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Nirmatrelvir must be co-administered with ritonavir. Failure to correctly co-administer nirmatrelvir with ritonavir may result in plasma levels of nirmatrelvir that are insufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic effect.

Prescriptions should specify the numeric dose of each active ingredient within PAXLOVID [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)]. Completion of the full 5-day treatment course and continued isolation in accordance with public health recommendations are important to maximize viral clearance and minimize transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

### Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (paxlovid) for mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pregnancy and lactation [^df878c3d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid) is recommended to reduce the risk of hospitalization from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pregnancy. Data on use in pregnancy, including prescribing patterns and patient experience (adverse effects, incidence of rebound), are limited. We performed a cross-sectional study in which we surveyed a cohort of vaccinated pregnant or lactating individuals with breakthrough COVID-19. Of 35 pregnant respondents, 51.4% were prescribed and 34.3% took nirmatrelvir-ritonavir; of these, 91.7% experienced dysgeusia and 50.0% had rebound (50.0% positive test result, 33.3% return of symptoms). Three of five lactating respondents were prescribed and two took nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. There were no significant adverse outcomes. Unknown risk was the most common reason for declining nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. More research is needed to establish the safety of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in pregnancy and lactation, to improve public health messaging, and to increase uptake of this treatment.

### Impact of extended-course oral nirmatrelvir / ritonavir in established long COVID: a case series [^266d7944]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Prior case series suggest that a 5-day course of oral Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) benefits some people with Long COVID, within and/or outside of the context of an acute reinfection. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no prior case series of people with Long COVID who have attempted longer courses of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.

Methods

We documented a case series of 13 individuals with Long COVID who initiated extended courses (> 5 days; range: 7.5–30 days) of oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir outside (n = 11) of and within (n = 2) the context of an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants reported on symptoms and health experiences before, during, and after their use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.

Results

Among those who take an extended course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir outside of the context of an acute infection, some experience a meaningful reduction in symptoms, although not all benefits persist. Others experience no effect on symptoms. One participant stopped early due to intense stomach pain. For the two participants who took an extended course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir within the context of an acute reinfection, both report eventually returning to their pre-re-infection baseline.

Conclusions

Extended courses of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may have meaningful benefits for some people with Long COVID but not others. We encourage researchers to study how and why nirmatrelvir/ritonavir benefits some and what course length is most effective, with the goal of informing clinical recommendations for using nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and/or other antivirals as a potential treatment for Long COVID.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir are present in human breast milk in small amounts (less than 2%). In a clinical lactation study in 8 lactating women, nirmatrelvir and ritonavir were estimated to be present in human milk at a mean weight-normalized infant daily dose of 0.16 mg/kg/day (1.8% of maternal weight-adjusted daily dose) and 0.006 mg/kg/day (0.2% of maternal weight-adjusted daily dose), respectively (see Data).

There are no available data on the effects of nirmatrelvir or ritonavir on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for PAXLOVID and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from PAXLOVID or from the underlying maternal condition. Breastfeeding individuals with COVID-19 should follow practices according to clinical guidelines to avoid exposing the infant to COVID-19.

Data

In a clinical pharmacokinetics study, 8 healthy lactating women who were at least 12 weeks postpartum were administered 3 oral doses every 12 hours (steady state dosing) of 300 mg/100 mg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. The mean daily amount of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir recovered in breast milk was 0.752 mg and 0.027 mg, respectively, representing 0.13% and 0.014% of the corresponding administered daily maternal doses (unadjusted for weight). The estimated daily infant dose (assuming average milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day), was 0.16 mg/kg/day and 0.006 mg/kg/day, 1.8% and 0.2% of the maternal dose, respectively, for nirmatrelvir and ritonavir.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Contraception

Use of ritonavir may reduce the efficacy of combined hormonal contraceptives. Advise patients using combined hormonal contraceptives to use an effective alternative contraceptive method or an additional barrier method of contraception [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

8.4 Pediatric Use

The optimal dose of PAXLOVID has not been established in pediatric patients.

5.1	Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions

Initiation of PAXLOVID, which contains ritonavir, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving PAXLOVID, may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A. Medications that induce CYP3A may decrease concentrations of PAXLOVID. These interactions may lead to:

Clinically significant adverse reactions, potentially leading to severe, life-threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medications.
Loss of therapeutic effect of PAXLOVID and possible development of viral resistance.

Severe, life-threatening, and/or fatal adverse reactions due to drug interactions have been reported in patients treated with PAXLOVID. The most commonly reported concomitant medications resulting in serious adverse reactions were calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus, cyclosporine), followed by calcium channel blockers.

Prior to prescribing PAXLOVID, review all medications taken by the patient to assess potential drug-drug interactions and determine if concomitant medications require a dose adjustment, interruption, and/or additional monitoring (e.g., calcineurin inhibitors) [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]. See Table 2 for clinically significant drug interactions, including contraindicated drugs. Drugs listed in Table 2 are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all possible drugs that may interact with PAXLOVID.

Consider the benefit of PAXLOVID treatment in reducing hospitalization and death, and whether the risk of potential drug-drug interactions for an individual patient can be appropriately managed [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Studies (14)].

5.2	Hypersensitivity Reactions

Anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (including toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome), and other hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with PAXLOVID [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue PAXLOVID and initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive care.

5.3	Hepatotoxicity

Hepatic transaminase elevations, clinical hepatitis, and jaundice have occurred in patients receiving ritonavir. Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering PAXLOVID to patients with pre-existing liver diseases, liver enzyme abnormalities, or hepatitis.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of nirmatrelvir / ritonavir and molnupiravir for COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b126105a]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) with molnupiravir in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To end this, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, medRxiv, and Google Scholar were systematically searched to collect relevant evidence up to February 15, 2023. The risk of bias was evaluated using the risk of bias in nonrandomized studies of interventions tool. Data were analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. Eighteen studies involving 57659 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed a significant difference between nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and molnupiravir in terms of all-cause mortality rate (odds ratio [OR] = 0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.44–0.67), all-cause hospitalization rate (OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.54–0.69), death or hospitalization rate (OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.38–0.99), and negative polymerase chain reaction conversion time (mean difference = -1.55, 95% CI: -1.74 to -1.37). However, no significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of COVID-19 rebound (OR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.71–1.07). In terms of safety, although the incidence of any adverse events was higher in the nirmatrelvir/ritonavir group (OR = 2.52, 95% CI: 1.57–4.06), no significant difference was observed between the two treatments in terms of adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation (OR = 1.18, 95% CI: 0.69–2.00). The present meta-analysis demonstrated the significant superiority of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir over molnupiravir in improving clinical efficacy in COVID-19 patients during the prevalence of Omicron variant. These findings, however, need to be further confirmed.

### Molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: oral coronavirus disease 2019 antiviral drugs [^f7bedab4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

At a crucial time with rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant globally, the United States Food and Drug Administration has issued an emergency use authorization for 2 oral antivirals, molnupiravir (in persons aged ≥ 18 years) and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid) (in persons aged ≥ 12 years weighing ≥ 40 kg), for the outpatient treatment of patients with mild to moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who are at risk for progression. Molnupiravir is a nucleoside analogue, whereas nirmatrelvir is a SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitor, and ritonavir is a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease inhibitor. Drug interactions are a major concern for nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir demonstrated a greater risk reduction in hospitalization and death than molnupiravir compared to placebo. Both drugs need to be started within 5 days of symptoms onset and given for 5 days' duration. This article reviews the 2 oral COVID-19 antiviral drugs including the mechanisms of action, antiviral activity, pharmacokinetics, drug interactions, clinical experience including trials, adverse events, recommended indications, and formulary considerations.

### Nirmatrelvir / ritonavir regimen for mild / moderately severe COVID-19: a rapid review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^a04b1aac]. Annals of Family Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of the approved nirmatrelvir/ritonavir regimen for treatment of laboratory-confirmed mild/moderately severe COVID-19 remains unclear.

Methods

We systematically identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and real-world studies (RWS; observational studies) of the efficacy/effectiveness and/or safety of the approved nirmatrelvir/ritonavir regimen for COVID-19. We pooled appropriate data (adjusted estimates for RWS) using an inverse variance, random-effects model. We calculated statistical heterogeneity using the I² statistic. Results are presented as relative risk (RR) with associated 95% CI. We further assessed risk of bias/study quality and conducted trial sequential analysis of the evidence from RCTs.

Results

We included 4 RCTs (4,070 persons) and 16 RWS (1,925,047 persons) of adults (aged ≥ 18 years). One and 3 RCTs were of low and unclear risk of bias, respectively. The RWS were of good quality. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir significantly decreased COVID-19 hospitalization compared with placebo/no treatment (RR = 0.17; 95% CI, 0.10–0.31; I² = 77.2%; 2 RCTs, 3,542 persons), but there was no significant difference for decrease of worsening severity (RR = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.66–1.01; I² = 47.5%; 3 RCTs, 1,824 persons), viral clearance (RR = 1.19; 95% CI, 0.93–1.51; I² = 82%; 2 RCTs, 528 persons), adverse events (RR = 1.41; 95% CI, 0.92–2.14; I² = 70.6%; 4 RCTs, 4,070 persons), serious adverse events (RR = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.41–1.62; I² = 0%; 3 RCTs, 3,806 persons), and all-cause mortality (RR = 0.27; 95% CI, 0.04–1.70; I² = 49.9%; 3 RCTs, 3,806 persons), although trial sequential analysis suggested that the current total sample sizes for these outcomes were not large enough for conclusions to be drawn. Real-world studies also showed significantly decreased COVID-19 hospitalization (RR = 0.48; 95% CI, 0.37–0.60; I² = 95.0%; 11 RWS, 1,421,398 persons) and all-cause mortality (RR = 0.24; 95% CI, 0.14–0.34; I² = 65%; 7 RWS, 286,131 persons) for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir compared with no treatment.

Conclusions

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir appears to be promising for preventing hospitalization and potentially decreasing all-cause mortality for persons with mild/moderately severe COVID-19, but the evidence is weak. More studies are needed.

### Efficacy and safety of paxlovid (nirmatrelvir / ritonavir) in the treatment of COVID-19: an updated meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^425f088c]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

Our study is aimed to access the efficacy and safety outcomes for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients treated with Paxlovid. According to inclusion and exclusion criteria, databases were used to retrieve articles from 1 January 2020 to 1 January 2023. Article screening, quality evaluation and data extraction were completed and cross-checked. The meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis (TSA) were conducted using RevMan, StataMP, and TSA software. A total of 42 original articles were included. Overall meta-analysis results showed that for death, hospitalisation, death or hospitalisation, emergency department (ED) visit, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and extra oxygen requirement outcomes, every odds ratio (OR) was < 1 and p < 0.05. For rebound outcome, the OR was > 1 and p > 0.05. For adverse events (AEs) outcome, the OR was > 1 and p < 0.05. In conclusion, Paxlovid effectively reduced the risks of death, hospitalisation, death or hospitalisation, ED visit, ICU admission, and extra oxygen requirement. There was no significant statistical difference considering rebound, but people should pay attention to possible AEs. However, for rebound and AEs outcomes, observations in certain subgroups suggested conclusions contrary to the overall meta-analysis. Trial sequential analysis indicated these two outcomes have a risk of false negative or false positive conclusions, so additional original studies are needed for further validation.

### Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and COVID-19 mortality and hospitalization among patients with vulnerability to COVID-19 complications [^5d74240b]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Postmarket analysis of individuals who receive nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (Paxlovid [Pfizer]) is essential because they differ substantially from individuals included in published clinical trials.

Objective

To examine the association of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir with prevention of death or admission to hospital in individuals with different risks of complications from COVID-19 infection.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This is a cohort study of adult patients in British Columbia, Canada, between February 1, 2022, and February 3, 2023. Patients were eligible if they belonged to 1 of 4 higher-risk groups of individuals who received priority for COVID-19 vaccination. Two groups included clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) people who were severely (CEV1) or moderately immunocompromised (CEV2). CEV3 individuals were not immunocompromised but had medical conditions associated with a high risk for complications from COVID-19. A fourth expanded eligibility (EXEL) group was added to allow wider access to nirmatrelvir and ritonavir for certain other higher-risk individuals who were not in a CEV group, such as those older than 70 years who were unvaccinated.

Exposures

Patients with COVID-19 who received nirmatrelvir and ritonavir were matched to patients in the same vulnerability group; who were of the same sex, age, and propensity score for nirmatrelvir and ritonavir treatment; and who were also infected within 1 month of the individual treated with nirmatrelvir and ritonavir.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was death from any cause or emergency hospitalization with COVID-19 within 28 days.

Results

There were 6866 individuals included in the study, of whom 3888 (56.6%) were female and whose median (IQR) age was 70 (57–80) years. Compared with unexposed controls, treatment with nirmatrelvir and ritonavir was associated with statistically significant relative reductions in the primary outcome in the CEV1 group (560 patients; risk difference [RD], -2.5%, 95% CI, -4.8% to -0.2%) and the CEV2 group (2628 patients; RD, -1.7%; 95% CI, -2.9% to -0.5%). In the CEV3 group, the RD was -1.3%, but the findings were not statistically significant (2100 patients; 95% CI, -2.8% to 0.1%). In the EXEL group, treatment was associated with higher risk of the outcome (RD, 1.0%), but the findings were not statistically significant (1578 patients; 95% CI, -0.9% to 2.9%).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study of 6866 individuals in British Columbia, nirmatrelvir and ritonavir treatment was associated with reduced risk of COVID-19 hospitalization or death in CEV individuals, with the greatest benefit observed in severely immunocompromised individuals. No reduction in the primary outcome was observed in lower-risk individuals, including those aged 70 years or older without serious comorbidities.

### Nirmatrelvir combined with ritonavir for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^af63d767]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Description of the intervention

Pfizer's drug combination nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) aims to avoid severe COVID‐19 in asymptomatic people or those with mild symptoms, thereby decreasing hospitalization and death. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is a combination of the SARS‐CoV‐2 protease inhibitor nirmatrelvir, and ritonavir, a CYP3A4 inhibitor used in the treatment of HIV to enhance HIV protease inhibitors. Nirmatrelvir blocks the activity of the SARS‐CoV‐2‐3CL pro protease, an enzyme needed for viral replication. In humans, nirmatrelvir is metabolized by the P450 cytochrome enzyme CYP3A4. In order to remain active in the body for longer periods of time, nirmatrelvir is co‐administered with low‐dose ritonavir, to slow down the breakdown of nirmatrelvir (Pfizer 2021). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is to be administered orally within five days of symptom onset and taken twice daily for five days. Given the inactivation of CYP3A4 by ritonavir, a common enzyme in drug metabolism, ritonavir interferes with the metabolism of many drugs, can alter their plasma concentrations, and increase drug‐related adverse effects. The applicability of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may thus be limited in some populations at high risk of severe COVID‐19, such as those with comorbidities requiring medications metabolized using the CYP3A4 enzyme. As 3CL pro, the substrate‐binding site is highly conserved among all coronaviruses and shares no homology with human proteases, a SARS‐CoV‐2‐3CL pro antagonist will be highly specific to SARS‐CoV‐2 and less affected by virus mutations (Dai 2020) compared to antivirals binding to other sites, more prone to mutation.

### Prevalence of contraindications to nirmatrelvir-ritonavir among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at risk for progression to severe disease [^5ca0c3a2]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The availability of outpatient treatment options for COVID-19, such as nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, remdesivir, molnupiravir, and monoclonal antibodies, raises hopes for reducing COVID-19–related morbidity and mortality. Among these options, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid)may be preferred for most high-risk patients because of the convenience of oral dosing and its high efficacy vs placebo in reducing hospitalization or death, as reported in a phase 2/3 trial.

However, there are circumstances in which nirmatrelvir-ritonavir should not be used, due to the effect of ritonavir. Ritonavir may elevate the concentrations of drugs highly dependent on hepatic cytochrome P-450 3A (CYP3A) metabolism, potentially resulting in serious reactions. Conversely, coadministration with potent CYP3A inducers can significantly reduce nirmatrelvir concentrations, potentially leading to the loss of virologic response. Furthermore, patients with severe kidney impairment and severe liver impairment were excluded from the clinical trials. These medical contraindications may be prevalent in patients with COVID-19 who are at high risk for progression to severe disease, as suggested by a recent study.

We examined the prevalence of contraindications to nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We hypothesized that the rate would be high in these patients.

### Pediatric nirmatrelvir / ritonavir prescribing patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic [^5eb24a3f]. Hospital Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) in December 2021 allowing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) administration to children aged ≥ 12 years, at risk for progression to severe disease, for treatment of mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although the FDA has authorized nirmatrelvir/ritonavir use for adults aged ≥ 18 years, its use in patients aged 12 to 17 years remains restricted to EUA.

Numerous factors increase the risks of severe disease, hospitalization, and complications from COVID-19 among children. Children with chronic disease, compared with those without, have an eightfold increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalization. COVID-19 viral coinfections, occurring almost 3 times more frequently in children than adults, also increase the risks of severe disease and hospitalization. Although nirmatrelvir/ritonavir has a potential role in mitigating COVID-19 disease burden among children, data on pediatric use, safety, efficacy, and effectiveness remain limited, even 2 years post-FDA EUA issuance. Use of extrapolated adult data to guide pediatric usehas fueled uncertainty about the relative benefits and burdens of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir among children, including those at highest risk for COVID-19–related hospitalization. This study leverages data from PEDSnet, a national pediatric learning health system, to identify pediatric nirmatrelvir/ritonavir prescribing rates and associated factors, with special focus on children at highest risk for COVID-19–related hospitalization. This study is among the first to characterize factors associated with pediatric nirmatrelvir/ritonavir prescribing using a national data source.

### Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (Paxlovid) [^8a289638]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

A total of 2,113 subjects were randomized to receive either PAXLOVID or placebo. At baseline, mean age was 45 years; 51% were male; 71% were White, 15% were Asian, 9% were American Indian or Alaska Native, 4% were Black or African American, and 1% was missing or unknown; 41% were Hispanic or Latino; 67% of subjects had onset of symptoms ≤ 3 days before initiation of study treatment; 49% of subjects were serological negative at baseline; the mean (SD) baseline viral RNA in nasopharyngeal samples was 4.71 log₁₀ copies/mL (2.89); 27% of subjects had a baseline viral RNA of ≥ 10⁷ (log₁₀ copies/mL); 6% of subjects either received or were expected to receive COVID-19 therapeutic monoclonal antibody treatment at the time of randomization and were excluded from the mITT and mITT1 analyses.

The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between the PAXLOVID and placebo groups.

The proportions of subjects who discontinued treatment due to an adverse event were 2.0% in the PAXLOVID group and 4.2% in the placebo group.

Table 9 provides results of the primary endpoint in mITT1 analysis population. For the primary endpoint, the relative risk reduction in the mITT1 analysis population for PAXLOVID compared to placebo was 86% (95% CI: 72%, 93%).

Consistent results were observed in the mITT and mITT2 analysis populations.

Similar trends have been observed across subgroups of subjects (see Figure 1).

### Impact of extended-course oral nirmatrelvir / ritonavir in established long COVID: a case series [^a0af1348]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

If clinical trials do indeed detect a signal, there should be a clear regulatory pathway to ensure that these drugs can be made accessible to patients, especially since there are currently no FDA-approved treatments specifically for Long COVID. This might entail consideration of options like expanded access, fast-track designation, and breakthrough therapy designation to both encourage industry participation and increase access of pharmaceutical treatments to Long COVID patients.

In conclusion, while the case series findings are heterogeneous, we describe the use of long courses of Paxlovid as a potentially promising pharmaceutical treatment to support at least some people with Long COVID. These cases provide strong rationale for the ongoing study of antivirals for Long COVID to determine if, when, and how they should be used in this patient population.

Results

We report on the results of 13 cases who had Long COVID at the time of taking nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. Cases 1–11 (Tables 1 and 2) took an extended course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir while negative for SARS-CoV-2, outside of the context of an acute infection; Cases 12–13 (Table 3) did so while positive for SARS-CoV-2, in the context of an acute refinfection. We also report SARS-CoV-2 vaccination history; unless otherwise noted, vaccination did not affect patients' Long COVID symptoms and patients reported no more than temporary side effects.

Table 1
Summary of cases who took extended courses of Paxlovid outside the context of an acute re-infection and experienced any improvement

For individuals indicated as having short-term improvements but not sustained improvements, this means that any improvements observed eventually dissipated. For case 4, he started valacyclovir one day before he started the long course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, so it is difficult to determine if the benefits are due to nirmaltrelvir/ritonavir, valacyclovir, or both.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^29a59d65]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

COVID-19 treatment in children with HIV — ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir use, dosing, interactions, and safety: Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir may be administered with other ARVs, including those that contain ritonavir or cobicistat, without any interruption or modification to the child's usual antiretroviral therapy (AIII). Children taking an ARV regimen that includes ritonavir or cobicistat should be monitored for increased side effects, but doses of ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir and/or other ARVs do not need to be adjusted. Patients with untreated or poorly controlled HIV could theoretically develop PI resistance while taking ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir. Renal and hepatic function should be evaluated prior to initiating ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir, and doses should be adjusted if needed. Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir should be started within 5 days of symptom onset (BII*) and administered orally twice daily for 5 days. Patients should be advised that a small proportion experience rebound 2 to 8 days after taking ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir, and the potential for viral rebound should not dissuade providers from offering it to patients at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 who could potentially benefit (AIII). Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir has potential for drug–drug interactions due to being both a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitor and a CYP3A substrate; providers should consult the FDA Paxlovid Emergency Use Authorization Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers, the Infectious Diseases Society of America resource, and/or the University of Liverpool COVID-19 Drug–Drug Interaction website for guidance. Other potential side effects include gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), altered taste, and increased blood pressure.

### A mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 immunity predicts paxlovid rebound [^f4c1f313]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid), an oral antiviral medication targeting SARS-CoV-2, remains an important treatment for COVID-19. Initial studies of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir were performed in SARS-CoV-2 unvaccinated patients without prior confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, most individuals have now either been vaccinated and/or have experienced SARS-CoV-2 infection. After nirmatrelvir/ritonavir became widely available, reports surfaced of "Paxlovid rebound", a phenomenon in which symptoms (and SARS-CoV-2 test positivity) would initially resolve, but after finishing treatment, symptoms and test positivity would return. We used a previously described parsimonious mathematical model of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection to model the effect of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment in unvaccinated and vaccinated patients. Model simulations show that viral rebound after treatment occurs only in vaccinated patients, while unvaccinated (SARS-COV-2 naïve) patients treated with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir do not experience any rebound in viral load. This work suggests that an approach combining parsimonious models of the immune system could be used to gain important insights in the context of emerging pathogens.

### Paxlovid for the treatment of severe or critical COVID-19 in children [^cb619c76]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment regimens

The indications, dosage, and administration frequency for Paxlovid were determined by a team of pediatricians and pharmacologists on a case-by-case basis, considering pediatric pharmacokinetic characteristics. It is important to note that our study focused on observation and data collection rather than active intervention. The recommended treatment regimen is as follows for children under 12 years old who weigh less 40 kg, the prescribed dosage is 7.5 mg/kg of Nirmatrelvir and 2.5 mg/kg of Ritonavir, administered twice daily for five days. For children aged 12 to 18 who weigh more than 40 kg, the dosage is 300/100 mg of Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir orally twice daily. In the control group, 60 patients received routine treatment. Further details regarding the Paxlovid dosing protocol can be found in the supplementary materials (Appendix S5). To distinguish between drug side effects and symptoms of the disease itself, adverse events were defined specifically as new clinical manifestations that arose after the administration of Paxlovid, as outlined in the Paxlovid package insert. Additionally, a qualified pharmacologist ensured that any potential adverse reactions from concurrent medications were excluded from the analysis.

Data collection and definitions

Data were collected from patient medical records, including information on age, sex, weight, height, underlying conditions and laboratory parameters. Additional data included clinical symptoms at admission, recovery times for symptoms (excluding fever), adverse events during treatment and other relevant clinical details. Follow-up data were also gathered six months post-treatment, covering a range of symptoms and restoring academic activities. Serum concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (Supplementary Appendix S2). Blood samples were collected during treatment, whenever feasible.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

Drug Interactions

Inform patients that PAXLOVID may interact with certain drugs and is contraindicated for use with certain drugs; therefore, advise patients to report to their healthcare provider the use of any prescription, non-prescription medication, or herbal products [see Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Drug Interactions (7)].

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Inform patients that anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions, and other hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, even following a single dose of PAXLOVID. Advise them to immediately discontinue the drug and to inform their healthcare provider at the first sign of a skin rash, hives or other skin reactions, difficulty in swallowing or breathing, any swelling suggesting angioedema (for example, swelling of the lips, tongue, face, tightness of the throat, hoarseness), or other symptoms of an allergic reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Dosage Modification in Patients with Renal Impairment

Moderate Renal Impairment

To ensure appropriate dosing in patients with moderate renal impairment, instruct such patients that they will be taking one 150 mg nirmatrelvir tablet with one 100 mg ritonavir tablet together twice daily for 5 days [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

### SARS-CoV-2 rebound with and without use of COVID-19 oral antivirals [^398c2a0f]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Early treatment with a first-line therapy (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir [Paxlovid] or remdesivir) or second-line therapy (molnupiravir) prevents hospitalization and death among patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are at risk for severe disease and is recommended by the National Institutes of Health COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines. On May 25, 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treatment of adults at high risk for severe disease. Although antiviral therapies are widely available, they are underutilized, possibly because of reports of SARS-CoV-2 rebound after treatment. To enhance current understanding of rebound, CDC reviewed SARS-CoV-2 rebound studies published during February 1, 2020- November 29, 2023. Overall, seven of 23 studies that met inclusion criteria, one randomized trial and six observational studies, compared rebound for persons who received antiviral treatment with that for persons who did not receive antiviral treatment. In four studies, including the randomized trial, no statistically significant difference in rebound rates was identified among persons receiving treatment and those not receiving treatment. Depending on the definition used, the prevalence of rebound varied. No hospitalizations or deaths were reported among outpatients who experienced rebound, because COVID-19 signs and symptoms were mild. Persons receiving antiviral treatment might be at higher risk for rebound compared with persons not receiving treatment because of host factors or treatment-induced viral suppression early in the course of illness. The potential for rebound should not deter clinicians from prescribing lifesaving antiviral treatments when indicated to prevent morbidity and mortality from COVID-19.

### Nirmatrelvir combined with ritonavir for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^cda785e3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Certainty of the evidence

The certainty of evidence for prioritized outcomes presented in the summary of findings table ranged from low to moderate (Table 1).

We downgraded the certainty of evidence for all outcomes included in our summary of findings table due to risk of bias arising from use of an inappropriate per‐protocol analysis only including participants randomly assigned to study intervention who took ≥ 1 dose of study intervention and had ≥ 1 post‐baseline visits through day 28. Additionally, the outcomes 'treatment‐related adverse events during the study period' and 'discontinuation of study medication due to adverse events' were not prospectively registered. All‐cause mortality at 28 days and serious adverse events during the study period were further downgraded for serious imprecision due to low number of events. The outcome 'admission to hospital or death within 28 days' was additionally downgraded for serious indirectness as the study only assessed COVID‐19 related hospitalizations.

We did not consider downgrading for publication bias because the intervention is new and most of the studies are still ongoing.

We identified no study results reporting on improvement of clinical status, quality of life, and viral clearance.

Timing of outcome measurement

We collected information on outcomes from all time points reported in the publications and study reports. If only a few studies contributed data to an outcome, we planned to pool different time points, provided the studies produced valid data and pooling was clinically reasonable. The current review version included one study.

In case of time‐to‐event analysis, e.g. for time to death, we planned to use the longest follow‐up time measured from randomization.

We have reported time points of outcome measurement in the footnotes of the forest plots. We included SAEs and AEs occurring during the study period, includingAEs during active treatment and long‐term AEs. If sufficient data had been available, we planned to group the measurement time points of eligible outcomes into those measured directly after treatment (up to seven days), medium‐term outcomes (up to 14 days), and longer‐term outcomes (28 days or more).

### Association of treatment with nirmatrelvir and the risk of post-COVID-19 condition [^0edf3289]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Post–COVID-19 condition (PCC), also known as long COVID, is the disease encompassing the post–acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and it affects millions of people around the world. Despite PCC affecting a substantial portion of the patient population, there is no approved medication for the prevention or treatment of PCC. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the underlying mechanisms of PCC including persistence of the virus (or its fragments) or intensity of the inflammation during the acute phase of the disease. The antiviral nirmatrelvir (in combination with ritonavir, marketed under the name Paxlovid) that has been shown to reduce the risk of progression to severe acute COVID-19 has been suggested as a candidate drug that may reduce the risk of developing PCC. In December 2021, oral nirmatrelvir was approved in the US for the treatment of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (typically within 5 days of symptom onset) in nonhospitalized people at risk of progression to severe COVID-19 illness. Millions of people in the US have since received treatment with nirmatrelvir. Urgent calls have been made to evaluate whether treatment with nirmatrelvir in the acute phase of COVID-19 reduces the risk of PCC — but data have thus far been lacking. Addressing this question will guide treatment approaches of SARS-CoV-2 infections and will inform the effort to develop and optimize prevention and treatment strategies for PCC.

### Association of nirmatrelvir / ritonavir treatment on upper respiratory severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (SARS-cov-2 RT-PCR) negative conversion rates among high-risk patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [^73edcb7d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Secondary Outcomes

At day 15, 89.7% of patients treated with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir within 5 days of symptom onset had their upper respiratory RT-PCR convert from positive to negative. This day 15 conversion occurred 42.0% of nontreated patients. Of the patients who initiated nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 5 days after symptom onset, 51.8% converted (Table 2). Adjustment for baseline differences between the groups had little effect on the hazard ratio for the effect of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment. The hazard ratio for the day 15 conversion rate for patients treated within 5 days of symptom onset was substantially higher (4.33 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 3.31–5.65) compared with nontreated patients, with the hazard ratio little affected by the adjustment for baseline characteristics (Table 2).

Table 2.
Comparison of Negative Conversion Between Patients Treated With and Without Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir

Subgroup analysis of time to negative conversion of RT-PCR testing in patients receiving nirmatrelvir/ritonavir showed no statistically significant association with a patient's sex, age, clinical classification, baseline comorbidities, risk factors, or vaccination history in either the minimally or adjusted model (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 2). Patients having lower Ct values before the treatment (eg, larger viral load) were associated with a lower rate of negative RT-PCR conversion within 10 days after the treatment.

Among patients treated with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, 103 (39.9%) patients experienced at least 1 side effect. The most common side effects were dysgeusia (94 [36.4%]) and diarrhea (14 [5.4%]). Subgroup analysis also showed that elderly patients (ie, aged ≥ 60 years) were less likely to report side effects, particularly for dysgeusia (odds ratio, 0.48 [95% CI,.26–.87]) (Supplementary Table 2). There was a statistically significant greater risk of experiencing any side effect, in particular dysgeusia in patients who were current smokers, had baseline N gene and ORF Ct values < 30, or were vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2; patients in these subgroups were statistically significantly younger than those in the reference group.

COVID-19 outpatient treatment for children with HIV — ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) should be considered for laboratory-confirmed or clinically suspected mild to moderate COVID-19 in children with HIV who are aged ≥ 12 years, weigh ≥ 40 kg, and are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 due to advanced or untreated HIV or another high-risk condition as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir should be started within 5 days of symptom onset; it may be administered with antiretrovirals, including those that contain ritonavir or cobicistat, without any interruption of or modification to the antiretroviral therapy. Remdesivir (Veklury) may be considered in the outpatient setting for children with HIV who are aged ≥ 28 days, weigh ≥ 3 kg, and are at high risk as defined by CDC, and remdesivir should be started within 7 days of symptom onset, but its use could be considered in children with HIV with severe immunosuppression who have had > 7 days of symptoms. For non-hospitalized children with HIV aged ≥ 12 years at high risk, ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir is the preferred treatment, but remdesivir may be considered if ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir is unavailable or contraindicated.

### Effectiveness of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir versus azvudine for adult inpatients with severe or critical COVID-19 [^9112cd72]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Background

In China, both nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid) and azvudine have been granted approval to treat adult SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with moderate symptoms. Information about the clinical effect of the two available agents among inpatients with severe or critical COVID-19 is scarce.

Purpose

To compare the clinical outcomes of Paxlovid and azvudine among adult inpatients with severe or critical COVID-19.

Method

We conducted a retrospective cohort study in two large medical centres after the epidemic control measures were lifted in China. A new propensity score matched-inverse probability of treatment weighting cohort was constructed to evaluate the in-hospital all-cause mortality, hospital length of stay, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and safety.

Results

A total of 955 individuals were in the cohort. The antiviral therapy strategies were decided by the senior physician and the supplies of the pharmacy. A total of 451 patients were in the Paxlovid group, and 504 patients were in the azvudine group. Compared with Paxlovid, the effects of azvudine on in-hospital all-cause mortality were not significantly different, and the OR (95% CI) was 1.084 (0.822 to 1.430), and the average hospital length of stay of patients discharged alive was also similar in the azvudine group, and the difference (day) and (95% CI) was 0.530 (−0.334 to 1.393). After 7 days of therapy, the degree of decline in the SOFA score was greater in the Paxlovid group than in the azvudine group (p < 0.001). The change in glomerular filtration rate was not significantly different (p = 0.824).

Conclusion

Paxlovid and azvudine had similar effectiveness on in-hospital all-cause mortality and hospital length of stay. Compared with the azvudine group, after 7 days of therapy, the degree of decline in SOFA score was significantly higher in the Paxlovid group. These findings need to be verified in larger prospective studies or randomised controlled trials.

### Tacrolimus drug-drug interaction with nirmatrelvir / ritonavir (paxlovid ™) managed with phenytoin [^33b41e79]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) pandemic has had a significant impact on communities and health systems. The Federal Drug Administration (FDA) authorized Pfizer's nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid™) through an EUA for the treatment of mild to moderate cases of COVID-19 at high risk for progression to severe disease. Patients with a history of transplant who test positive for COVID-19 are considered high risk because of their immunosuppression and are therefore candidates for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.

Case Report

This is a case of a 67-year-old female with a past medical history of orthotopic heart transplant who received tacrolimus as part of her immunosuppressive regimen. She originally presented with complaints of dyspnea and cough for several days in the setting of COVID-19. The patient was started on nirmatrelvir/ritonavir due to her high risk for progression to severe disease. Four days after starting nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, she presented to the ED for slowed speech, fatigue, weakness, and loss of appetite. Upon admission she was found to have a supratherapeutic tacrolimus level of 176.4 ng/mL and an acute kidney injury. In this case, phenytoin was used as a CYP3A4 inducer to quickly decrease the tacrolimus level to within therapeutic range.

Conclusion

This case highlights the strong and important drug-drug interaction between tacrolimus and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir leading to toxic levels of tacrolimus. It also demonstrates the utility and effectiveness of phenytoin as a "rescue" medication for tacrolimus toxicity.

### Nirmatrelvir combined with ritonavir for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^4a3fb371]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Certainty of the evidence

The certainty of evidence for prioritized outcomes presented in the summary of findings tables ranged from low to moderate for outpatients (Table 1), and was very low for inpatients (Table 2).

For outpatients, we downgraded the certainty of evidence for all outcomes included in our summary of findings table due to risk of bias arising from use of an inappropriate per‐protocol analysis only including participants randomly assigned to study intervention who received one or greater more doses of study intervention and had one or more postbaseline visits by day 28. Additionally, the outcomes 'treatment‐related adverse events during the study period; and 'discontinuation of study medication due to adverse events' were not prospectively registered. All‐cause mortality at 28 days and SAEs during the study period were further downgraded for serious imprecision due to low number of events. The outcome 'admission to hospital or death within 28 days' was additionally downgraded for serious indirectness as the study only assessed COVID‐19‐related hospitalizations.

For inpatients, we downgraded the certainty of evidence for all outcomes included in our summary of findings table for indirectness due to an atypical hospital population of mildly to moderately affected patients and twice for imprecision using the minimally contextualized approach.

We did not consider downgrading for publication bias because the intervention is new and most of the studies are still ongoing.

We identified no study results reporting on improvement of clinical status, quality of life, and viral clearance.

### Comparative effectiveness of combination therapy with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and remdesivir versus monotherapy with remdesivir or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in patients hospitalised with COVID-19: a target trial emulation study [^08113078]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Background

Remdesivir (Veklury, Gilead Sciences, Foster City, CA, USA) and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid, Pfizer, New York, NY, USA) were reported to improve the outcome of patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 symptoms. Preclinical data suggest that nirmatrelvir-ritonavir might be more effective than remdesivir alone or in combination with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir for people at high risk of severe COVID-19. We aimed to assess the safety and effectiveness of combining remdesivir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir compared with using each drug alone for adults hospitalised with COVID-19.

Methods

In this target trial emulation study, we used electronic health records of patients aged 18 years or older who received either combination treatment of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and remdesivir or monotherapy of either drug between March 16 and Dec 31, 2022, within 5 days of hospitalisation for COVID-19 in Hong Kong. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was applied to balance baseline patient characteristics across the treatment groups. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Cox proportional hazards regression adjusting weighting was used to compare the risk of all-cause mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or ventilatory support for 90 days of follow-up between groups.

Findings

Between March 16 and Dec 31, 2022, 18196 participants were identified from electronic health records and assigned to receive remdesivir (n = 4232), nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (n = 13656), or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and remdesivir (n = 308). By applying an inverse probability of treatment weighting, a weighted sample composed of 18410 recipients of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and remdesivir combination treatment, 18178 recipients of remdesivir monotherapy, and 18287 recipients of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir monotherapy was obtained. After a median follow-up of 84 days (IQR 45–90), risk of mortality was lower in patients who received nirmatrelvir-ritonavir monotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.18 [95% CI 0.15 to 0.20]; absolute risk reduction [ARR] -16.33% [95% CI -16.98 to -15.68]) or remdesivir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir combination therapy (HR 0.66 [95% CI 0.49 to 0.89]; ARR -6.52% [95% CI -7.29 to -5.74]) than in patients who received remdesivir monotherapy. Similar results were observed for ICU admission or ventilatory support (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir monotherapy: HR 0.09 [95% CI 0.07 to 0.11]; ARR -10.04% [95% CI -10.53 to -9.56]; combination therapy: HR 0.68 [95% CI 0.42 to 1.12]; ARR -3.24% [95% CI -3.84 to -2.64]). Compared with combination therapy, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir monotherapy was associated with lower risk of mortality (HR 0.27 [95% CI 0.20 to 0.37]; ARR -9.81% [95% CI -10.39 to -9.24]) and ICU admission or ventilatory support (HR 0.13 [95% CI 0.08 to 0.22]; ARR -6.80% [95% CI -7.22 to -6.39]).

Interpretation

Our study highlighted the potential for reduced risk of mortality, ICU admission, or the need for ventilatory support in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir as a monotherapy compared with treatment regimens based on nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and remdesivir combination therapy or remdesivir monotherapy. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to support the validity of the current results.

### Effectiveness of molnupiravir vs nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in non-hospitalised and hospitalised patients with COVID-19: a target trial emulation study [^200e7d91]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The ongoing spread of COVID-19 has highlighted the need for effective antiviral treatments. Two oral antiviral drugs, molnupiravir (Lagevrio) and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid) have shown promise as novel treatment options for adults with COVID-19 from phase III randomised controlled trials, namely the Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients (EPIC-HR) trial and the Molnupiravir for Oral Treatment of COVID-19 in an Outpatient Setting (MOVe-OUT) trial. There is limited evidence directly comparing the effectiveness of these two antiviral treatments. Nevertheless, several clinical guidelines, including National Institutes of Health from US and National Health and Medical Research Council in Australia, recommend nirmatrelvir–ritonavir over molnupiravir, provided that patients do not have any contraindications to either drugs. Consequently, understanding their relative effectiveness profiles is crucial for informing public health policy and guiding clinical practice.

### Antiviral efficacy of RAY1216 monotherapy and combination therapy with ritonavir in patients with COVID-19: a phase 2, single centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^30a2b6e4]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

As a member of the Coronaviridae family of enveloped, single-strand, positive-sense RNA viruses, the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome is translated into approximately 30 proteins upon entry into the host cell cytoplasm. 3CLpro, the main viral protease of Coronaviridae, is an appealing target for antiviral drugs because it is required for the proteolytic maturation of viral polyproteins and is highly conserved among coronaviruses. Paxlovid is the first oral 3CLpro inhibitor targeting the SARS-CoV-2 virus, that consists of the combination of nirmatrelvir, a second-generation protease inhibitor, and ritonavir, a pharmacological enhancer; a low dose of ritonavir helps slow down the metabolism or breakdown of nirmatrelvir so that it remains active in the body for longer at higher concentrations and helps to fight the virus. Paxlovid remains the recommended and preferred treatment for SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. According to a study of Paxlovid, by day 28 following randomisation, 1% (6/607) of Paxlovid recipients who received treatment within 5 days of the onset of symptoms were hospitalised up to day 28 without dying, compared to 7% (41/612) of the placebo group who experienced 10 fatalities (2%). Paxlovid also has been shown to be effective against the Omicron variant, and a phase 2–3 double-blind, randomised, controlled trial demonstrated that it was 89% effective in patients at risk of serious illness, lowering the hospitalisation rate by 6% and accelerating the viral clearance and viral load.

4 CONTRAINDICATIONS

PAXLOVID is contraindicated in patients with a history of clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions [e.g., toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) or Stevens-Johnson syndrome] to its active ingredients (nirmatrelvir or ritonavir) or any other components of the product.

PAXLOVID is contraindicated with drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A and for which elevated concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening reactions and drugs that are strong CYP3A inducers where significantly reduced nirmatrelvir or ritonavir plasma concentrations may be associated with the potential for loss of virologic response and possible resistance. There are certain other drugs for which concomitant use with PAXLOVID should be avoided and/or dose adjustment, interruption, or therapeutic monitoring is recommended. Drugs listed in this section are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all drugs that may be contraindicated with PAXLOVID. The healthcare provider should consult other appropriate resources such as the prescribing information for the interacting drug for comprehensive information on dosing or monitoring with concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor like PAXLOVID [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]:

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir — The guideline panel suggests the use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for ambulatory patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at high risk for progression to severe disease who are within five days of symptom onset. The effect of repeating the same drug (for another course) after a viral rebound is unknown regards to patient important outcomes such as need for hospitalization, invasive ventilation, or death. Study limitations of observational medical records database studies includes misclassifications in admission diagnosis and absence of adequate compliance determination, among others. More data are needed on the potential adverse effects of this medication, and future studies are important to inform the impact of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in hospitalized patients, in vaccinated high-risk patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and in symptomatic immune- compromised patients with persistently elevated viral loads.

Introduction

Rapid global dissemination and widespread devastation have resulted from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The spike protein is the target of the majority of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. However, the Omicron variant of the spike protein has now become the dominant variant globally, resulting in increased vaccine breakthrough rates and widespread resistance to neutralising antibodies. As a result, finding effective therapies for COVID-19 patients that do not target the spike protein remains a top priority in order to overcome the upcoming unexpected mutations before the COVID-19 epidemic can be fully controlled.

For a specific viral replication cycle of SARS-CoV-2, 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) is essential for the processing of viral polyproteins into functional units, making it an attractive antiviral target. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 replication can be inhibited by drugs selectively inhibiting 3CLpro, and there is a low likelihood of off-target activity due to the lack of known human analogues. Paxlovid is an oral antiviral drug developed by Pfizer that combines nirmatrelvir and ritonavir. Nirmatrelvir is a 3CLpro inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2, and ritonavir works as a cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor to slow the metabolism of nirmatrelvir and raise its serum levels. On December 22, 2021, the United States Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorisation for Paxlovid to treat COVID-19 in adults and children (≥ 12 years old and weighing ≥ 40 kg) at high risk of developing severe COVID-19. However, Paxlovid has complex interactions with other medications, such as systemic corticosteroids, antiarrhythmic drugs, anticancer drugs, calcium channel blockers, and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors. Due to the ritonavir component of the combination, Paxlovid is not recommended for those with certain medical conditions. Therefore, because of the rising number of cases and fatalities globally as well as the extremely limited treatment options, there is an urgent unmet medical need for new efficient 3CLpro inhibitors with fewer restrictions on combined medication that can control COVID-19.

### Vaccines and therapeutics for immunocompromised patients with COVID-19 [^e6719f88]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Antiviral therapy

Nirmatrelvir dramatically reduces risk of hospitalization and death in high-risk outpatients with COVID-19. It is co-packaged with the pharmacologic booster ritonavir (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir; Paxlovid). Ritonavir is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and as such significantly and dangerously increases the serum levels of drugs such as cyclosporin, tacrolimus, everolimus and sirolimus, which are frequently used in immunocompromised patients (particularly transplant recipients). Use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir should be approached with extreme caution in transplant recipients.

Molnupiravir is the other major orally available antiviral agent. It does not have the drug interactions associated with ritonavir, but is contraindicated in patients under 18 and in pregnancy as it may harm bone and cartilage growth and can cause embryo-fetal toxicities. Molnupiravir efficacy is uncertain. There are also concerns that this drug may drive evolution of SARS-CoV-2 mutations to potentially generate variants of concern, and have long-term risk for mutagenicity in humans. Both of these concerns are heightened in immunocompromised patients. In unvaccinated outpatients with COVID-19, its use was associated with moderate reductions in hospitalizations and deaths but its efficacy in vaccinated people is less clear. An open labeled study of over 25,000 vaccinated outpatients (about 9% of which were immunocompromised), which compared molnupiravir to usual care, showed that molnupiravir treatment resulted in more rapid time to recovery, but did not reduce need for hospitalization (1% in both groups). Of note, the highest risk patients in either arm were eligible to also receive mAb, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and those in the usual care arm could even receive molnupiravir. Although no head-to-head RCTs have been performed comparing the two orally available drugs, response rate outcomes from an observational comparative study in Hong Kong suggest that nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is the more effective of the two drugs.

### Cardiovascular drug interactions with Nirmatrelvir / ritonavir in patients With COVID-19: JACC Review topic of the week [^7b67cc82]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (NMVr) is used to treat symptomatic, nonhospitalized patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) who are at high risk of progression to severe disease. Patients with cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular disease are at a high risk of developing adverse events from COVID-19 and as a result have a higher likelihood of receiving NMVr. Ritonavir, the pharmaceutical enhancer used in NMVr, is an inhibitor of the enzymes of CYP450 pathway, particularly CYP3A4 and to a lesser degree CYP2D6, and affects the P-glycoprotein pump. Co-administration of NMVr with medications commonly used to manage cardiovascular conditions can potentially cause significant drug-drug interactions and may lead to severe adverse effects. It is crucial to be aware of such interactions and take appropriate measures to avoid them. In this review, we discuss potential drug-drug interactions between NMVr and commonly used cardiovascular medications based on their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic properties.

### Paxlovid for the treatment of severe or critical COVID-19 in children [^c3a641bc]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic brought over 774 million infections and 7 million fatalities worldwide. Up to now, there are still 200–300 thousand additional cases and several hundred deaths per week across the globe. Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir (Paxlovid) has been proven effective for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults. However, clinical data on its use in children remain limited. While Phase II/III trials for pediatric patients (NCT05261139) are ongoing, no published results are yet available. Only a few case reports and small case series have assessed Paxlovid in children, with one retrospective study evaluating its safety and efficacy in 31 pediatric ICU patients, including 9 who received Paxlovid. Due to the lack of robust evidence, current guidelines recommend the use of Paxlovid in children on a case-by-case basis. This uncertainty can present challenges for clinicians in making treatment decisions.

Although Paxlovid has been recommended for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults, specifically when administered within 5 days of symptom onset, its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated in severe or critical cases. While COVID-19 in children is generally less severe than in adults, children with underlying health conditions are at a higher risk for complications such as hospitalization, intensive care, mechanical ventilation, and even death. A global study involving 1,500 children with cancer found that 20% experienced severe or critical COVID-19, with a mortality rate of 3%. Given that an estimated 400,000 children and adolescents aged 0–19 are diagnosed with cancer annually, this suggests that approximately 12,000 children could potentially die from COVID-19. Therefore, providing Paxlovid to children, especially those with compromised immune systems due to underlying conditions, may help prevent the progression of COVID-19 to severe stages and reduce mortality rates.

To further assess the safety and effectiveness of Paxlovid in pediatric populations, we conducted a prospective observational study. This study included children and adolescents treated with Paxlovid, with cases stratified by severity, and followed up over a 6-month period.

### International collaboration to develop and harmonize drug interaction guidance for nirmatrelvir / ritonavir during COVID-19: lessons learned for future pandemic preparedness [^86e204e4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

In December 2021/January 2022, the SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drug, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, was authorized in the United States, Canada, and Europe. However, ritonavir has significant drug-drug interaction potential, and information resources were incomplete or provided conflicting advice for certain DDIs. Within the challenging pandemic setting, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was being prescribed largely by clinicians unfamiliar with ritonavir. COVID-19 affects people with comorbidities and polypharmacy who could benefit from therapy, but prescriber uncertainty surrounding the appropriate management of DDIs was a barrier to the use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. To support clinicians, the National Institutes of Health COVID-19 Guidelines Panel, the Ontario Science Table, and the University of Liverpool independently developed prescribing guidelines. Ultimately, the groups united to establish the LiON-PK (Liverpool-Ontario-NIH Pharmacokinetics) collaboration. Here we describe how the team developed pragmatic and harmonized guidance for managing DDIs with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. This framework may inform development of prescribing resources for other complex medications, or for future pandemic preparedness.

Harms — nirmatrelvir/ritonavir emphasize safety signals and interactions: Limited evidence from hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 receiving nirmatrelvir/ritonavir suggest increased serious adverse events and adverse events (RR 1.20; 95% CI: 0.38, 3.84; low CoE and RR: 1.40; 95% CI: 0.65, 3.04; low CoE). Serious treatment-emergent adverse events were not reported in the FDA EUA. Given co-formulation with ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic booster, there is potential for significant drug interactions. Contraindications exist between agents that can have their levels increased or decreased by nirmatrelvir and/or ritonavir and agents that can increase the metabolism of the components of nirmatrelvir and/or ritonavir, resulting in a loss of virologic response and possible resistance. These drug interactions can result in treatment failure or serious adverse events.

### Postmarketing reporting of paxlovid-related dysgeusia: a real-world pharmacovigilance study [^c0e53376]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

A novel COVID-19 therapeutic, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid), is commonly associated with reports of dysgeusia. The Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database was used to determine the real-world reporting of Paxlovid-associated dysgeusia (PAD), identify associated factors, and describe the relative reporting rates of dysgeusia for Paxlovid compared to other COVID-19 therapeutics (OCT), ritonavir alone, and other protease inhibitors (OPI).

Study Design

Observational retrospective.

Setting

Tertiary academic medical center.

Methods

We collected patient and adverse event characteristics reported in the FAERS database between January 1968 and September 2022. Disproportionality analyses were used to compare the reporting of PAD to dysgeusia reported for OCT, ritonavir, and OPI.

Results

345,229 adverse events were included in the present study. Dysgeusia was a frequently reported Paxlovid-associated adverse event (17.5%) and was associated with nonserious COVID-19 infection (reporting odds ratio [ROR] 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2, 1.7) and female sex (ROR = 1.7; 95% CI 1.6, 1.9). Paxlovid was more likely to be associated with the reporting of dysgeusia compared to OCT (ROR 305.4; 95% CI 164.1, 568.5), ritonavir (ROR 28.0; 95% CI 24.1, 32.7), and OPI (ROR 49.0; 95% CI 42.8, 56.1).

Conclusion

Dysgeusia is much more likely to be reported by patients receiving Paxlovid than those receiving OCT, ritonavir alone, or OPI. These findings suggest a potential mechanism of dysgeusia that causes distorted taste out of proportion to the background effects of COVID-19 infection and specific to nirmatrelvir. Future studies are needed to determine the underlying pathophysiology and long-term clinical implications for patients who report dysgeusia with Paxlovid.

### Interactions of the protease inhibitor, ritonavir, with common anesthesia drugs [^ad6e3f58]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

A full list of drug interactions with ritonavir is available from the UK NIH COVID‐19 treatment guidelines (Paxlovid HCP fact Sheet 03182022.pdf). A comprehensive guide to drugs that can be compromised during ritonavir administration has been published by Manzolini and colleagues. These drugs can be grouped using a traffic light system that ranges from red (do not co‐administer) through orange (potential interaction) to yellow (weak interaction) and green (no interaction expected). Drugs discussed in this current review fall under the "red or orange" classification.

Current guidelines from pediatric anesthesia societies often recommend postponement of nonessential anesthesia and surgery in children until at least 14 days after onset of COVID‐19 symptoms. This delay avoids anesthesia in the early course of the disease when nirmatrelvir–ritonavir might be given. There will be occasions when the need for medical intervention cannot be postponed and anesthesiology practitioners should be mindful of potential interactions between ritonavir and drugs used during anesthesia and adapt perioperative care appropriately.

We review drugs interactions with ritonavir in order to help guide anesthetic practice. Pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic simulation is used to demonstrate impact of interactions and why some interactions may have little clinical importance while others have major clinical impact. We demonstrate that most, if not all, anticipated effects of drug interactions relevant to anesthesia could be anticipated and dealt with if the nature those interactions were better understood.

### Public health impact of paxlovid as treatment for COVID-19, United States [^43fa4d93]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

We evaluated the population-level benefits of expanding treatment with the antiviral drug Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) in the United States for SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant infections. Using a multiscale mathematical model, we found that treating 20% of symptomatic case-patients with Paxlovid over a period of 300 days beginning in January 2022 resulted in life and cost savings. In a low-transmission scenario (effective reproduction number of 1.2), this approach could avert 0.28 million (95% CI 0.03–0.59 million) hospitalizations and save US $56.95 billion (95% CI US $2.62-$122.63 billion). In a higher transmission scenario (effective reproduction number of 3), the benefits increase, potentially preventing 0.85 million (95% CI 0.36–1.38 million) hospitalizations and saving US $170.17 billion (95% CI US $60.49-$286.14 billion). Our findings suggest that timely and widespread use of Paxlovid could be an effective and economical approach to mitigate the effects of COVID-19.

### Treating asthma in the time of COVID [^231f7ae2]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

The Precision Interventions for Severe and/or Exacerbation-Prone Asthma clinical trials network is actively assessing novel treatments for severe asthma during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and has needed to adapt to various clinical dilemmas posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Pharmacologic interactions between established asthma therapies and novel drug interventions for COVID-19 infection, including antivirals, biologics, and vaccines, have emerged as a critical and unanticipated issue in the clinical care of asthma. In particular, impaired metabolism of some long-acting beta-2 agonists by the cytochrome P4503A4 enzyme in the setting of antiviral treatment using ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (NVM/r, brand name Paxlovid) may increase risk for adverse cardiovascular events. Although available data have documented the potential for such interactions, these issues are largely unappreciated by clinicians who treat asthma, or those dispensing COVID-19 interventions in patients who happen to have asthma. Because these drug-drug interactions have not previously been relevant to patient care, clinicians have had no guidance on management strategies to reduce potentially serious interactions between treatments for asthma and COVID-19. The Precision Interventions for Severe and/or Exacerbation-Prone Asthma network considered the available literature and product information, and herein share our considerations and plans for treating asthma within the context of these novel COVID-19-related therapies.

### Strategies and efforts in circumventing the emergence of antiviral resistance against conventional antivirals [^96b5a67f]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

Pharmacokinetic enhancement was also applied for COVID-19, such is the case of Paxlovid, which is the combination of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 3C-like protease inhibitor nirmatrelvir and ritonavir, which also reduced the metabolism of nirmatrelvir in the liver, allowing for prolonged nirmatrelvir antiviral effect(Fig. 5B).

Another way of improving the pharmacokinetic profile of a drug is by changing the delivery system such as by delivery to the target site. Antivirals against respiratory infections such influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and coronaviruses had better bioavailability at the target site, when delivered by inhalation through devices like nebulisers and aerosol inhalers, and also lower systematic exposure and toxicity. Also being explored are delivery methods like biocompatible targeted nanoparticles carrying drugs which have improved antiviral effect when compared to the same drug administered in vitro without nanoparticle delivery. Such delivery systems offer advantages of site specificity, controlled and sustained release, and compound stability. Additionally, hydrophobicity composition, size and surface to volume ratio of the particle can be modified to suit targeting needs, reducing off-target and undesirable side-effects, while improving bioavailability and lowering frequency of administration.

Ritonavir Interactions With ASMs

Another potential clinically relevant interaction exists between lamotrigine (LTG) and ritonavir (r), an element of the WHO recommendation for PEP. Ritonavir (r) can reduce lamotrigine (LTG) concentration by 50% within days, therefore lamotrigine dosing may need to be modified during short-term PEP treatment containing ritonavir (r). Irrespective of potential lamotrigine adjustments or decreases during PEP, the removal of ritonavir (r) may contribute to a rise in serum lamotrigine concentration. This may be associated with both transient increased adverse effects of lamotrigine, similar to those during the placebo week of estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, as well as increased risk of Steven's Johnson Syndrome (SJS). Data from withdrawal of lamotrigine during long-term inpatient monitoring suggest the risk of SJS is low if lamotrigine dosing was lower for less than 7 days, but the duration of ritonavir (r) in PEP typically lasts 4 weeks. Therefore, during this period of PEP and afterward, the dosing of lamotrigine may need to be increased and additional counseling provided regarding monitoring for SJS. In addition to lamotrigine, the European Medicines agency recently issues a warning regarding the interaction with everolimus and ritonavir, which also is an element of treatment for Covid-19 in combination with nirmatrelvir in Paxlovid.

Other ASMs and Other ARTs Without Known Interactions

In addition to highlighting the presence of known or theoretical interaction between certain ASMs and many of the ARTs used in PrEP/PEP, we emphasize that there are several ASMs without known or limited interactions. When possible, patients with anticipated need for PrEP/PEP should aim to achieve seizure and side effect freedom with these noninteracting ASMs. However, one third of patients with epilepsy have medication-resistant epilepsy, defined by failure by 2 or more appropriately prescribed and tolerated ASMs, therefore this may not be possible. Additionally, while levetiracetam (LEV) was recently added to the WHO essential medications list, these modern ASMs often are not widely available globally due to cost, regulatory approval, and supply chain challenges. Analogously, modern ARTs typically have fewer drug–drug interactions; therefore, they may emerge as preferred elements of PrEP and PEP regimens in people taking ASMs.

### Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic-led guidance for patients with cystic fibrosis taking elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir for the treatment of COVID-19 [^6df0cac2]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

One notable therapeutic challenge is in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2)). In people with CF, viral respiratory tract infections can lead to acute pulmonary exacerbations with a negative impact on lung function.COVID‐19 infection triggers a cytokine storm which can lead to the life‐threatening respiratory distress syndrome, potentially putting the population with CF infected with COVID‐19 at high risk of serious illness. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently issued an emergency use authorization for the use of the nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir (Paxlovid) for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID‐19. Nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir treatment significantly reduces hospital admissions and deaths among people with COVID‐19 who are at high risk of severe illness. Nirmatrelvir is coadministered with ritonavir, a CYP3A inhibitor, to boost nirmatrelvir concentrations to achieve therapeutic levels. However, due to the potent inhibition effect of ritonavir, it may increase plasma concentrations of drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A. Therefore, coadministration of nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir is contraindicated with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated concentrations are associated with serious and/or life‐threatening reactions. Since all three components of elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor are eliminated mainly through CYP3A, nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir is expected to exhibit a significant drug interaction with elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor. Thus, the use of nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir in people with CF would require an adjusted dosing regimen of elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor to prevent increased plasma concentrations and potential adverse drug reactions. However, there are currently no clinical data available regarding the interactions of elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor with nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir, and no specific dosing guidelines have been established. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the proper guidance regarding the use of nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir for people with CF to prevent progression of COVID‐19 to severe disease.

### Comparing molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir / ritonavir efficacy and the effects on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in animal models [^dee0f4af]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Therapeutic options against SARS-CoV-2 are underutilized. Two oral drugs, molnupiravir and paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir), have received emergency use authorization. Initial trials suggested greater efficacy of paxlovid, but recent studies indicated comparable potency in older adults. Here, we compare both drugs in two animal models; the Roborovski dwarf hamster model for severe COVID-19-like lung infection and the ferret SARS-CoV-2 transmission model. Dwarf hamsters treated with either drug survive VOC omicron infection with equivalent lung titer reduction. Viral RNA copies in the upper respiratory tract of female ferrets receiving 1.25mg/kg molnupiravir twice-daily are not significantly reduced, but infectious titers are lowered by > 2log orders and direct-contact transmission is stopped. Female ferrets dosed with 20 or 100mg/kg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir twice-daily show 1-2log order reduction of viral RNA copies and infectious titers, which correlates with low nirmatrelvir exposure in nasal turbinates. Virus replication resurges towards nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment end and virus transmits efficiently (20mg/kg group) or partially (100mg/kg group). Prophylactic treatment with 20mg/kg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir does not prevent spread from infected ferrets, but prophylactic 5mg/kg molnupiravir or 100mg/kg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir block productive transmission. These data confirm reports of similar efficacy in older adults and inform on possible epidemiologic benefit of antiviral treatment.

### Antiviral therapy for COVID-19 virus: a narrative review and bibliometric analysis [^e97dd45d]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 epidemic has become a major international health emergency. Millions of people have died as a result of this phenomenon since it began. Has there been any successful pharmacological treatment for COVID-19 since the initial report on the virus? How many searches are undertaken to address the impact of the infection? What is the number of drugs that have undergone investigation? What are the mechanisms of action and adverse effects associated with the investigated pharmaceuticals used to treat COVID-19? Has the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved any medication to treat COVID-19? To date, our understanding is based on a restricted corpus of published investigations into the treatment of COVID-19. It is important to note that no single study comprehensively encompasses all pharmacological interventions for COVID-19. This paper provides an introductory summary of a bibliometric analysis conducted on the data about COVID-19, sourced explicitly from two platforms, namely PubMed and ScienceDirect. The analysis encompasses the period spanning from 2019 to 2022. Furthermore, this study examines the published literature about the pharmacological interventions for the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), explicitly focusing on the safety and effectiveness of different medications such as Remdesivir (marketed as Veklury®), Lopinavir/Ritonavir (commercially known as Kaletra® or Aluvia®), Ribavirin, Favipiravir (marketed as Avigan®), Ivermectin, Casirivimab and Imdevimab (branded as Ronapreve®), Sotrovimab (marketed as Xevudy®), Anakinra, Molnupiravir, Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir (marketed as Paxlovid®), and Galidesivir. Findings indicate that while Remdesivir and Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir show significant efficacy in reducing hospitalization and severe outcomes, drugs like Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Ivermectin have inconsistent results. Our insights suggest a multifaceted approach incorporating these therapies can significantly improve patient outcomes. Repurposing drugs has been critical in rapidly responding to COVID-19, allowing existing medications to be used in new ways to combat the virus. Combination therapies and further research are essential to optimize treatment strategies.

### Distal protein-protein interactions contribute to nirmatrelvir resistance [^e9722941]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Since its emergence in late 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has had immense health, economic, and social impacts globally. With new infection rates remaining high, SARS-CoV-2 continues to pose an urgent health threat. The main protease (M pro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a homo-dimeric cysteine protease responsible for cleaving the viral polyproteins into its mature substituents, including M pro itself, during viral replication. M pro is a validated drug target and is inhibited by nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332), which is the active agent in Pfizer's oral COVID-19 drug, Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir combination). While Paxlovid is one of the most effective COVID-19 treatments to date, M pro has demonstrated that it is prone to mutations in and outside the active site, many of which have resulted in SARS-CoV-2 variants showing in vitro resistance to nirmatrelvir –, as well as several in immunocompromised patients –.

### Comparison of safety and efficacy between nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and molnupiravir in the treatment of COVID-19 infection in patients with advanced kidney disease: a retrospective observational study [^e7cd49b7]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this observational study, we showed that patients with COVID-19 and advanced CKD (eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m²) who received nirmatrelvir-ritonavir had lower all-cause mortality at day 90 after treatment than those who received molnupiravir. Between nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and molnupiravir, the use of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir was associated with a lower hospitalisation rate. The two treatment arms had similar ICU admission rates and rates of complications including hepatic impairment, respiratory and cardiovascular incidents.

Effective anti-viral therapy has been recommended for patients with COVID-19 who are at risk of clinical deterioration, with CKD being one of the major risk factors. However, the use of nirmatrelvir has been limited among patients with CKD based on its renal excretion. Patients with eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m² were not included in the EPIC-HR trial, and thus clinical data regarding its safety and effectiveness has been scant. In patients with better renal function, the safety profile of nirmatrelvir was reported to be favorable with minimal serious adverse effects. The nirmatrelvir-ritonavir group even had a lower rate of serious adverse events (2%) than in the placebo group (7%). In patients with more advanced kidney disease, nirmatrelvir serum concentration is inevitably higher. The maximum tolerated dose of nirmatrelvir in humans remains a question. One animal study found no adverse effects even when nirmatrelvir was dosed at 1000 mg/kg per day, which was equivalent to 8 times the recommended dose in humans. Peak plasma concentration of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in patients receiving intermittent haemodialysis can be up to 4 times of that in patients with normal renal function. Hepatotoxicity is one of the side effects of nirmatrelvir and hence hepatic tolerance is one of the concerns when dosing in patients with advanced kidney disease. Lingscheid et al. reported a case series of treatment of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in 4 patients with end-stage kidney disease requiring intermittent haemodialysis. None of the patients developed hepatic impairment after receiving nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (150 mg nirmatrelvir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily for 5 days). Similar study on patients receiving intermittent haemodialysis showed that nirmatrelvir-ritonavir was in general well tolerated without hepatic impairment reported. Our study concurred with the issue of hepatotoxicity that both treatment arms of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and molnupiravir had similar rates of hepatic impairment. Regarding efficacy, Hiremath et al. prescribed a modified regimen of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir suggested by a group of Canadian physicians to dialysis patients (300 mg nirmatrelvir + 100 mg ritonavir on day 1 then 150 mg nirmatrelvir + 100 mg ritonavir, dose after dialysis for those on haemodialysis). Most patients (96%) were able to complete the regimen and there were no deaths at day 30. Our study further compared the efficacy of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir with molnupiravir and showed that the former was associated with a lower all-cause mortality than the latter.

### Virologic response and safety of ibuzatrelvir, A novel SARS-CoV-2 antiviral, in adults with COVID-19 [^415448fe]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Vaccination, naturally acquired immunity, antiviral therapies such as nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (NMV/r; Paxlovid; Pfizer Inc, New York, NY), and improved understanding of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) management have led to better outcomes for patients with COVID-19 compared with early during the pandemic. However, new variants evade immune response, allowing COVID-19 to continue causing high mortality and straining global healthcare systems. This burden persists partly because antiviral therapies for patients at high risk for severe COVID-19 are underused; one reason for this is potential risk of drug–drug interactions with NMV/r. New, efficacious antiviral therapies with safety profiles appropriate for a broader population are needed.

Ibuzatrelvir (PF-07817883) is a second-generation, orally bioavailable, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) M pro inhibitor that has demonstrated potent, pan-human coronavirus antiviral activity. Ibuzatrelvir achieves expected therapeutic systemic concentrations (> 90% of the population achieving free minimum observed plasma concentration [C min] ≥ 90% maximal effective concentration [EC 90]) without the need for a co-administered agent (eg, ritonavir) to increase drug exposures. Because ritonavir is a potent cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitor, administration of ibuzatrelvir alone (without ritonavir), as well as low potential of ibuzatrelvir to affect the pharmacokinetics (PK) of other drugs, may simplify clinical management. Our aim in this study was to evaluate virologic response and safety of different ibuzatrelvir doses among nonhospitalized adults with confirmed, symptomatic COVID-19.

### Leritrelvir for the treatment of mild or moderate COVID-19 without co-administered ritonavir: a multicentre randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^66855ab1]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The continuing evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus triggers immune escape and higher infectivity, considerably challenging existing vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. Accessible and effective antiviral therapy is essential for combating COVID-19 in the aspects of blocking viral infection, reducing viral shedding, and improving prognosis.

Various small-molecule anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs have been developed ever since, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is the first oral anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug recommended by WHOfor the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. Nirmatrelvir is a peptidomimetic inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M pro, 3CL) and also a human cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 substrate. Ritonavir, a strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitor and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor, is co-administered with nirmatrelvir to increase the blood concentration of nirmatrelvir, thereby boosting it effective against SARS-CoV-2. Because many medications depend on CYP3A4 for clearance, precaution should be taken to avoid unexpected side effects due to drug–drug interaction when considering concomitant use with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.

### Influenza in pregnancy: prevention and treatment aug 2025 update [^07c116f3]. ACOG (2025). High credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy — Paxlovid use and influenza co-infection: If a pregnant patient tests positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, obstetric care professionals should discuss and offer Paxlovid to mitigate the severity of infection, as well as to lower the risk of long COVID. The dosage for Paxlovid in patients with normal renal function is 300 mg of nirmatrelvir (two 150-mg tablets) with 100 mg of ritonavir (one 100-mg tablet), with all three tablets taken together twice daily for 5 days, and for moderate renal impairment the nirmatrelvir component is lowered by half, to one 150-mg tablet twice daily. Obstetrician–gynecologists should ensure that the patient has no contraindications and should review any possible drug–drug interactions and how to handle them before prescribing Paxlovid. If there is suspected or confirmed co-infection with influenza and SARS-CoV-2, both oseltamivir and Paxlovid should be prescribed and can be taken together. There are no clinically significant drug–drug interactions between the antiviral agents or immunomodulators that are used to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2 and the antiviral agents that are used to treat influenza. Obstetrician–gynecologists and other obstetric care professionals should refer to ACOG recommendations frequently for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 treatment recommendation updates.

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY

13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Nirmatrelvir

Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with nirmatrelvir.

Nirmatrelvir was negative for mutagenic or clastogenic activity in a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays including the Ames bacterial reverse mutation assay using S. typhimurium and E. coli, the in vitro micronucleus assay using human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells, and the in vivo rat micronucleus assays.

In a fertility and early embryonic development study, nirmatrelvir was administered orally to male and female rats at doses of 60, 200, or 1,000 mg/kg/day once daily beginning 14 days prior to mating, throughout the mating phase, and continued through GD 6 for females and for a total of 32 doses for males. There were no effects on fertility, reproductive performance, or early embryonic development at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day, resulting in systemic exposure (AUC24) approximately 5 times higher than exposure at the approved human dose of PAXLOVID.

Ritonavir

Carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats have been conducted on ritonavir. In male mice, at levels of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day, there was a dose dependent increase in the incidence of both adenomas and combined adenomas and carcinomas in the liver. Based on AUC measurements, the exposure at the high dose was approximately 25 times higher than the exposure in humans at the approved human dose of PAXLOVID. No carcinogenic effects were observed in females at up to the highest dose tested, resulting in systemic exposure (AUC24) approximately 25 times higher than the exposure in humans at the approved human dose of PAXLOVID. In rats dosed at levels of 7, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day, there were no carcinogenic effects. In this study, the exposure at the high dose was approximately 5 times higher than the exposure in humans at the approved human dose of PAXLOVID.

Ritonavir was found to be negative for mutagenic or clastogenic activity in a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays including the Ames bacterial reverse mutation assay using S. typhimurium and E. coli, the mouse lymphoma assay, the mouse micronucleus test and chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes.

Ritonavir produced no effects on fertility in rats at drug exposures approximately 18 (male) and 27 (female) times higher than the exposure in humans at the approved human dose of PAXLOVID.

Overall risk of bias by outcome

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir versus placebo in outpatient settings

We have some concern regarding risk of bias for all outcomes included in the Table 1. For the outcomes 'all‐cause mortality at 28 days', 'worsening of clinical status: admission to hospital or death at 28 days', 'SAEs during the study period', and 'any grade TEAEs during the study period', the included study was at overall some concern of bias due to use of an inappropriate per‐protocol analysis (EPIC‐HR 2021; Table 22; Table 23; Table 26; Table 27). For the outcome 'admission to hospital or death at 28 days', we applied the respective risk of bias assessments to the subgroup analyses, as well (EPIC‐HR 2021; Table 24; Table 25). For the outcomes 'TRAEs during the study period' and 'discontinuation of study medication due to adverse events' the study has been assessed as overall some concern of bias due to use of an inappropriate per‐protocol analysis and lack of prospective outcome registration (EPIC‐HR 2021; Table 28; Table 29).

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir versus standard of care in inpatient settings

We have no concern of bias regarding the outcomes included in the Table 2. For the outcomes 'all‐cause mortality at 28 days', 'viral clearance at seven days', and 'viral clearance at 14 days', the included study was assessed at no concerns for bias (Liu 2023; Table 30; Table 32; Table 33). We also applied the respective risk of bias assessments to the subgroup analysis for age (Liu 2023; Table 31).

Medical history was notable for hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, type 2 diabetes, and a recently diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection for which she was prescribed ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) two days before the presentation. On arrival at the hospital, she was found to have marked bradycardia with widened QRS, hyperglycaemia and metabolic acidosis. Transvenous pacing along with pressor support and insulin were initiated, and she was admitted to the intensive care unit. Drug interaction between ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir and verapamil leading to verapamil toxicity was suspected of causing her symptoms, and both drugs were withheld. She reverted to sinus rhythm on the fourth day, and the pacemaker was discontinued.

SARS-CoV-2 infection and coinfection management in pregnancy — If a pregnant patient tests positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, obstetric care professionals should prescribe Paxlovid® (nirmatrelvir and ritonavir). The dosage for Paxlovid is 300 mg nirmatrelvir (two 150-mg tablets) with 100 mg ritonavir (one 100-mg tablet), with all three tablets taken together twice daily for 5 days. Obstetrician–gynecologists should ensure that the patient has no contraindications and should review any possible drug–drug interactions and how to handle them before prescribing Paxlovid. If there is suspected or confirmed co-infection with influenza and SARS-CoV-2, both oseltamivir and Paxlovid® should be prescribed and can be taken together. There are no clinically significant drug–drug interactions between the antiviral agents or immunomodulators that are used to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2 and the antiviral agents that are used to treat influenza.

### SARS-CoV-2 rebound with and without use of COVID-19 oral antivirals [^69fed4c0]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

COVID-19 has caused approximately 6.5 million hospitalizations and 1.1 million deaths in the United States. * Although hospitalizations and deaths are currently much lower than they were during the peak of the pandemic, COVID-19 continues to cause substantial morbidity and mortality. As of December 9, 2023, approximately 23,000 hospitalizations per week were reported among patients with COVID-19, with highest rates among persons aged ≥ 65 years. Currently, health care providers are positioned to mitigate COVID-19 morbidity and mortality with safe and effective vaccines † and early diagnosis and treatment.

Antiviral Therapeutics

Early treatment with first-line therapy (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir [Paxlovid] or remdesivir) or second-line therapy (molnupiravir) reduces the prevalence of hospitalization and death among patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are at risk for severe disease, and is recommended by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines. The two oral antivirals, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and molnupiravir, are widely available but underutilized. The limited use of these antivirals might be partially attributable to reports of rebound after treatment, especially with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. § However, rebound was reported before the advent of COVID-19 antivirals and was related to immunity and individual level factors.

Table 30 — GRADE evidence profile, viral rebound — evaluates nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (n/r) versus no nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for ambulatory patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who experienced viral rebound after completing an initial course. No direct evidence was found on the effect of repeat n/r for this population; serious adverse events were not reported; and the effect of repeating the same drug for another course after a viral rebound is unknown for patient important outcomes. Available information indicates observational evidence showed hospitalization after n/r has been infrequent, with explanations noting no comparative effectiveness available and study limitations of observational medical records database studies including misclassifications and absence of adequate compliance determination.

### Hospitalization and emergency department encounters for COVID-19 after paxlovid treatment-California, December 2021-may 2022 [^2fff376a]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) is a combination protease inhibitor that blocks replication of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) and has been shown to reduce the risk for hospitalization and death among patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are at risk for progression to severe disease* (1). In December 2021, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for early treatment with Paxlovid among persons with mild to moderate cases of COVID-19 who are at high risk for progression to severe disease (2). FDA and a small number of published case reports have documented recurrence of COVID-19 symptoms or a positive viral test result (COVID-19 rebound) 2–8 days after recovery or a negative SARS-CoV-2 test result among patients treated with Paxlovid (3–7); however, large-scale studies investigating severe illness after Paxlovid treatment are limited. This study used electronic health record (EHR) data from a large integrated health care system in California (Kaiser Permanente Southern California [KPSC]) to describe hospital admissions and emergency department (ED) encounters related to SARS-CoV-2 infections during the 5–15 days after pharmacy dispensation of a 5-day treatment course of Paxlovid. Among 5,287 persons aged ≥ 12 years who received Paxlovid during December 31, 2021-May 26, 2022, 73% had received ≥ 3 doses of COVID-19 vaccine †, and 8% were unvaccinated. During the 5–15 days after Paxlovid treatment was dispensed, six hospitalizations and 39 ED encounters considered to be related to SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified, representing < 1% of all patients to whom Paxlovid treatment was dispensed during the study period. Among these 45 persons, 21 (47%) were aged ≥ 65 years, and 35 (78%) had at least one underlying medical condition § (8). This study found that hospitalization or ED encounters for COVID-19 during the 5–15 days after Paxlovid treatment was dispensed for mild to moderate COVID-19 illness were rarely identified. When administered as an early-stage treatment, Paxlovid might prevent COVID-19-related hospitalization among persons with mild to moderate cases of COVID-19 who are at risk for progression to severe disease.
