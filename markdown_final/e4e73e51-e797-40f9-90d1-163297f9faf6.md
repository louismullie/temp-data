## Question

What is optic neuritis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about optic neuritis — specifically, they want a detailed explanation covering its definition, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, key bedside findings, etiologies and subtypes (including MS, NMOSD, and MOGAD), diagnostic workup and imaging, treatment principles (including acute and preventive therapy and controversies from ONTT), prognosis, special populations, unmet needs, and a practical clinical algorithm with key takeaways. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the clinical presentation and key bedside findings. Next, I will classify etiologies and subtypes, including MS, NMOSD, and MOGAD. After that, I need to review the diagnostic workup and imaging strategy. Then, I will examine treatment principles, including acute and preventive therapy, and clarify controversies from ONTT. Finally, I should assess prognosis, special populations, and unmet needs, and close with a practical clinical algorithm and key takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology. Optic neuritis is best understood as an inflammatory optic neuropathy of the central nervous system optic nerve, most often demyelinating, with immune-mediated mechanisms that include T-cell and antibody-driven processes, and it can be the first manifestation of broader CNS demyelinating disease such as MS, NMOSD, or MOGAD [^115HZV18] [^112hQ8N2] [^111pkpD7].

> I will now examine the clinical presentation. Typical optic neuritis presents with subacute, painful vision loss evolving over days, often accompanied by dyschromatopsia, a relative afferent pupillary defect when unilateral, and pain worsened by eye movements. The optic disc is frequently normal in the acute phase, though mild disc edema can occur, and severe disc swelling with hemorrhages or exudates should prompt consideration of atypical etiologies [^116W8RkR] [^111pkpD7] [^111QKQjQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology before classifying subtypes. I should confirm the major categories: typical MS-associated or idiopathic optic neuritis, which is usually unilateral and often monophasic. Atypical antibody-mediated forms including AQP4-IgG NMOSD and MOG-IgG MOGAD, which can be bilateral, more severe, and relapsing. And other inflammatory or systemic causes such as sarcoidosis, CRION, or infectious etiologies. Importantly, MOGAD is particularly prevalent in children and can mimic NMOSD clinically [^115HZV18] [^112hQ8N2] [^1126UjvS].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic workup. Wait, let me verify the core tests: MRI of the brain and orbits with fat-suppressed contrast sequences is essential to detect optic nerve enhancement and demyelinating lesions, and to stratify MS risk. OCT quantifies retinal nerve fiber layer and ganglion cell layer thinning to document neuroaxonal loss. And antibody testing for AQP4-IgG and MOG-IgG using cell-based assays should be sent when features are atypical or severe, recognizing that MOG testing is particularly informative in children and that indiscriminate testing lowers specificity [^116jVNTZ] [^111pkpD7] [^115SfiVw].

> I need to ensure the treatment principles are aligned with subtype and severity. For typical MS-associated optic neuritis, high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone accelerates visual recovery but does not improve long-term outcomes, so treatment is optional and should be framed with shared decision-making. For atypical antibody-mediated optic neuritis, early high-dose IV steroids are often critical, and plasma exchange is frequently added in severe or steroid-refractory cases. For relapse prevention, NMOSD requires long-term complement or B-cell targeted therapies such as eculizumab, inebilizumab, or satralizumab, whereas MOGAD may benefit from steroid-sparing immunosuppressants like rituximab or mycophenolate, with relapse risk linked to rapid steroid tapering [^115m2jDc] [^116mVWt1] [^114i9CZU] [^116JA63X].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought corticosteroids improve long-term visual outcomes in typical optic neuritis, but I should double-check that. The ONTT and subsequent meta-analyses show IV steroids hasten early recovery without altering 1-year visual acuity, and low-dose oral prednisone alone increased relapse risk, so I need to correct that misconception and emphasize shared decision-making for acute steroid use in typical cases [^115m2jDc] [^116mVWt1] [^1175dMfv].

> Let me consider prognosis and recovery patterns. Most patients with typical optic neuritis recover high-contrast visual acuity to 20/40 or better by 6 to 12 months, but persistent deficits in contrast sensitivity, color vision, and visual fields are common and correlate with RNFL thinning on OCT. Baseline severity predicts long-term outcomes, and in children, MOGAD is frequent and visual recovery is often good, though relapses can occur. Conversely, AQP4-NMOSD carries higher risks of severe, recurrent attacks with poor recovery if untreated [^112JaSZs] [^116W8RkR] [^1126UjvS] [^112hQ8N2].

> I should confirm special populations and modifiers. Pediatric optic neuritis differs from adult disease with higher rates of bilateral involvement and MOGAD. Sex and race influence epidemiology and outcomes, with female predominance and higher incidence in Black and Hispanic populations in recent US data. And although the classic ONTT cohort was predominantly White, contemporary cohorts underscore the need to consider diverse phenotypes and access to care when counseling patients [^114K3niq] [^115UmvPJ] [^112QjTVW].

> But wait, what about unmet needs and evolving therapies. There remains no proven therapy to prevent neuroaxonal loss after typical optic neuritis, though neuroprotection trials such as phenytoin have shown reduced RNFL loss in phase 2, and erythropoietin has been explored as a potential neuroprotectant. OCT-derived structural measures and low-contrast acuity are now standard outcomes in trials, and consensus diagnostic criteria for MOGAD and updated ON classifications aim to improve early, accurate phenotyping and targeted therapy [^113FDSKj] [^1116GHTf] [^113hwAxT] [^115HZV18].

> Let me synthesize a practical clinical algorithm. In a patient with subacute painful vision loss and an RAPD, I should obtain urgent MRI brain and orbits with contrast, send AQP4-IgG and MOG-IgG if features are atypical or severe, and arrange OCT to quantify baseline injury. If typical MS-ON is likely, I will discuss that IV steroids speed recovery but do not change long-term vision, and if atypical antibody-mediated ON is suspected, I will start high-dose IV steroids promptly and escalate to plasma exchange if there is no rapid improvement, while initiating long-term relapse prevention for NMOSD or MOGAD once confirmed [^116jVNTZ] [^115SfiVw] [^115m2jDc] [^114i9CZU].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the key messages are explicit. Optic neuritis is an inflammatory CNS optic neuropathy with a broad differential spanning MS, NMOSD, MOGAD, and other causes. Accurate early classification using MRI and antibody testing drives prognosis and management. High-dose IV steroids accelerate recovery in typical cases without altering long-term outcomes, whereas atypical antibody-mediated forms require urgent immunotherapy and relapse prevention. OCT provides a window into neuroaxonal injury and supports both clinical care and research into neuroprotection [^112hQ8N2] [^115HZV18] [^111pkpD7].

Optic neuritis is an **inflammatory demyelinating optic neuropathy** causing acute, painful vision loss with dyschromatopsia and a relative afferent pupillary defect [^117TueTw]. It is most often unilateral in adults, bilateral in children, and strongly associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) [^111dxJz6]; however, it can also herald neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD), which carry different prognoses and treatments [^115HZV18] [^112hQ8N2]. Diagnosis is clinical, supported by MRI of the brain and orbits with contrast, OCT, and serologic testing for AQP4-IgG and MOG-IgG [^116jVNTZ] [^114RTvRq]. High-dose intravenous corticosteroids speed recovery but do not change long-term visual outcomes in typical MS-associated ON [^115m2jDc]; NMOSD/MOGAD often require plasma exchange and long-term immunosuppression [^114RTvRq] [^112hQ8N2]. Most patients recover visual acuity to near-normal, but persistent deficits in contrast, color vision, and visual fields are common, and recurrence risk varies by etiology [^112JaSZs] [^116W8RkR].

---

## Clinical presentation

Optic neuritis typically presents with the following **clinical features**:

- **Visual acuity loss**: Acute, subacute, or progressive, ranging from mild to severe (counting fingers to no light perception) [^116W8RkR].

- **Pain**: Retro-orbital or periocular pain, often worsened by eye movements [^116W8RkR].

- **Color vision impairment**: Dyschromatopsia, frequently disproportionate to acuity loss [^116W8RkR].

- **Visual field defects**: Central scotoma, paracentral defects, or altitudinal defects [^116W8RkR].

- **Relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD)**: Present in unilateral cases [^116W8RkR].

- **Phosphenes**: Transient flashes of light with eye movements [^notfound].

- **Optic disc appearance**: Usually normal (retrobulbar neuritis) or mildly hyperemic with blurred margins; papillitis with disc swelling is less common [^116W8RkR].

---

## Etiology and associated conditions

Optic neuritis has diverse etiologies; the **most common associations** are:

| **Category** | **Associated conditions** |
|-|-|
| Demyelinating diseases | - Multiple sclerosis (MS) [^111dxJz6] <br/> - Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) [^114i9CZU] <br/> - Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) [^1126UjvS] |
| Infectious diseases | - Viral infections (e.g. measles, mumps, influenza, Epstein-Barr virus) [^115GQGFa] <br/> - Bacterial infections (e.g. Lyme disease, syphilis, tuberculosis) [^115GQGFa] |
| Autoimmune diseases | - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [^1167dw5H] <br/> - Sjögren's syndrome [^115GQGFa] <br/> - Sarcoidosis [^115GQGFa] |
| Idiopathic | - Cases with no identifiable underlying cause [^1175dMfv] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Optic neuritis is primarily a clinical diagnosis, but **ancillary tests** are essential to confirm the diagnosis, exclude mimics, and identify underlying etiologies:

- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: Brain and orbits with contrast to detect optic nerve enhancement, demyelinating lesions, and assess MS risk [^113tkRsP].

- **Optical coherence tomography (OCT)**: Quantifies retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning, a marker of axonal loss and predictor of visual outcomes [^116W8RkR].

- **Serologic testing**: AQP4-IgG (NMOSD) and MOG-IgG (MOGAD) to differentiate from MS-associated ON [^114RTvRq].

- **Lumbar puncture**: Optional; oligoclonal bands support MS diagnosis [^notfound].

---

## Treatment

Treatment depends on the **underlying etiology** and severity:

- **Typical MS-associated ON**: High-dose intravenous corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 1 g/day for 3–5 days) accelerate recovery but do not improve long-term visual outcomes [^115m2jDc] [^116mVWt1].

- **NMOSD/MOGAD-associated ON**: High-dose corticosteroids followed by plasma exchange (PLEX) if severe or steroid-refractory; long-term immunosuppression (e.g. rituximab, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil) to prevent relapses [^113hJGat] [^116zsXsD].

- **Idiopathic ON**: Observation or corticosteroids based on severity and patient preference [^116mVWt1].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Prognosis varies by **etiology**:

- **MS-associated ON**: Excellent recovery in ~90% to near-normal acuity, but persistent deficits in contrast sensitivity, color vision, and visual fields are common [^114ekBit] [^116W8RkR].

- **NMOSD/MOGAD-associated ON**: Recovery is often incomplete, with higher risks of severe visual loss and recurrence; early aggressive treatment improves outcomes [^112hQ8N2] [^1132vfHb].

- **Recurrence**: Common in MS, NMOSD, and MOGAD; recurrence risk guides long-term immunotherapy decisions [^116JA63X] [^114i9CZU].

---

## Complications

Potential **complications** include:

- **Persistent visual deficits**: Reduced acuity, contrast sensitivity, color vision, and visual field defects [^116W8RkR].

- **Optic nerve atrophy**: Chronic RNFL thinning and optic disc pallor [^116W8RkR].

- **Conversion to MS**: Approximately 20% at 5 years, 50% at 15 years following an initial ON episode [^113ut1h7].

- **Recurrent ON**: Increases risk of cumulative visual impairment and disability [^113hJGat].

---

## Recent advances

Recent developments include the **discovery of AQP4-IgG and MOG-IgG** as biomarkers distinguishing NMOSD and MOGAD from MS-associated ON [^115HZV18], the **introduction of OCT** as a biomarker for axonal injury and a tool for monitoring disease progression [^116W8RkR], and the **approval of targeted therapies** — eculizumab, satralizumab, and inebilizumab — for NMOSD, reducing relapse risk and improving outcomes [^114i9CZU].

---

Optic neuritis is an inflammatory demyelinating optic neuropathy with characteristic clinical features and diverse etiologies. Accurate diagnosis and **etiology-specific treatment** are essential to optimize visual outcomes and prevent recurrence.

### Optic neuritis with potential for poor outcome [^116mpZ1v]. Practical Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

The Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial previously reported that corticosteroids accelerated visual recovery in optic neuritis (ON) without improving outcome. This finding related largely to multiple sclerosis (MS), and subsequently neurologists tended to await spontaneous recovery in ON. Since then, non-MS cases of ON have been identified with antibodies to aquaporin-4 (AQP4) or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). These disorders can closely mimic multiple sclerosis-associated or idiopathic demyelinating optic neuritis (MS/IDON) initially but risk a worse visual outcome. Scrutinising the clinical features and neuroimaging often enables differentiation between MS/IDON and other causes of ON. Early treatment with high-dose corticosteroids is an important determinant of visual outcome in non-MS/IDON. Prompt use of plasma exchange may also save sight. In this review, we contrast the presentations of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein associated optic neuritis (MOG-ON) and aquaporin 4 associated optic neuritis (AQP4-ON) with MS/IDON and provide an approach to acute management while awaiting results of antibody testing.

### The changing landscape of optic neuritis: a narrative review [^112ptRdX]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Optic neuritis (ON) is an inflammatory optic neuropathy that is often a harbinger of central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disorders. ON is frequently misdiagnosed in the clinical arena, leading to either inappropriate management or diagnostic delays. As a result, patients may fail to achieve optimal recovery. The treatment response to corticosteroids and long term risk of multiple sclerosis was established in the first clinical trials conducted roughly 30 years ago. Spontaneous resolution was observed in the vast majority of patients and intravenous high-dose corticosteroids hastened recovery; half of the patients eventually developed multiple sclerosis. Over the ensuing decades, the number of inflammatory conditions associated with ON has significantly expanded exposing substantial variability in the prognosis, treatment, and management of ON patients. ON subtypes can frequently be distinguished by distinct clinical, serological, and radiological profiles allowing expedited and specialized treatment. Guided by an increased understanding of the immunopathology underlying optic nerve and associated CNS injuries, novel disease management strategies are emerging to minimize vision loss, improve long-term surveillance strategies, and minimize CNS injury and disability. Knowledge regarding the clinical signs and symptoms of different ON subtypes is essential to guide acute therapy, prognosticate recovery, accurately identify underlying CNS inflammatory disorders, and facilitate study design for the next generation of clinical and translational trials.

### Clinically isolated syndromes suggestive of multiple sclerosis, part I: natural history, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and prognosis [^111dxJz6]. The Lancet: Neurology (2005). Medium credibility.

In 85% of young adults with multiple sclerosis (MS), onset is a subacute clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) of the optic nerves, brainstem, or spinal cord. Methods of assessing the prognosis for patients who present with a CIS have been sought, because only 30–70% of patients with a CIS develop MS. When clinically silent brain lesions are seen on MRI, the likelihood of developing MS is high. MS can be diagnosed within 3 months of CIS presentation with certain MRI and CSF criteria. Disability from MS is less likely in patients with a CIS of optic neuritis or sensory symptoms only, few or no MRI lesions, a long period to the first relapse, and no disability after the first 5 years. Development of more reliable prognostic markers will enable new treatments to be targeted for those who are most likely to benefit. We encourage continued clinical and laboratory assessment of patients with a CIS.

### Prognostic factors of first-onset optic neuritis based on diagnostic criteria and antibody status: a multicentre analysis of 427 eyes [^1132vfHb]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Optic neuritis (ON) prognosis is influenced by various factors including attack severity, underlying aetiologies, treatments and consequences of previous episodes. This study, conducted on a large cohort of first ON episodes, aimed to identify unique prognostic factors for each ON subtype, while excluding any potential influence from pre-existing sequelae.

Methods

Patients experiencing their first ON episodes, with complete aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody testing, and clinical data for applying multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnostic criteria, were enrolled. 427 eyes from 355 patients from 10 hospitals were categorised into four subgroups: neuromyelitis optica with AQP4 IgG (NMOSD-ON), MOG antibody-associated disease (MOGAD-ON), ON in MS (MS-ON) or idiopathic ON (ION). Prognostic factors linked to complete recovery (regaining 20/20 visual acuity (VA)) or moderate recovery (regaining 20/40 VA) were assessed through multivariable Cox regression analysis.

Results

VA at nadir emerged as a robust prognostic factor for both complete and moderate recovery, spanning all ON subtypes. Early intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) was associated with enhanced complete recovery in NMOSD-ON and MOGAD-ON, but not in MS-ON or ION. Interestingly, in NMOSD-ON, even a slight IVMP delay in IVMP by > 3days had a significant negative impact, whereas a moderate delay up to 7–9days was permissible in MOGAD-ON. Female sex predicted poor recovery in MOGAD-ON, while older age hindered moderate recovery in NMOSD-ON and ION.

Conclusion

This comprehensive multicentre analysis on first-onset ON unveils subtype-specific prognostic factors. These insights will assist tailored treatment strategies and patient counselling for ON.

### Association of individual-level factors with visual outcomes in optic neuritis: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^111vr277]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

Shared decision-making is a central part of patient-centered health care and is particularly important when the benefits of an intervention have a marginal effect on outcomes and harms are an important concern. Personalizing the ONTT data to inform clinicians and patients about treatment benefits and long-term outcome has the potential to support both evidence-based care and shared decision-making. Further studies are needed to understand those patients with poor recovery and, importantly, to integrate information about corticosteroid benefits with estimates of corticosteroid harms.

### Disease course of clinically isolated optic neuritis [^114JXDhC]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Optic neuritis is a frequent manifestation of multiple sclerosis (MS) and the most common optic neuropathy in young adults. Because its natural course is comparatively short, it has become a popular setting for clinical neuroprotection trials. With a mounting interest in short and cost-effective trials has come the need for high-quality data on the early course of glucocorticosteroid-treated optic neuritis, representing the likely course in a placebo group. The gold standard in this regard remains the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT), a multicentric study conducted in the 1980s that followed up over 400 participants with acute optic neuritis at standardized intervals with a battery of visual tests. Owing to the limitations of its time, the ONTT was not able to include 2 outcomes that have since proven to be of immense value: optical coherence tomography (OCT), which quantifies thicknesses of retinal neuronal layers on a micrometer scale, and low-contrast letter acuity, the psychophysical parameter which most closely mirrors disease-induced subjective changes.

More recent clinical cohorts which include these outcomes are typically limited by a much lower number of participants, irregular follow-up, monocentric recruitment, inclusion of patients with long-standing MS (who are apt to preexisting visual system changes), and a limited number of clinical outcomes. We aim to address these limitations and provide a new reference on the early course of glucocorticosteroid-treated acute optic neuritis, based on longitudinal data from 12 German tertiary academic centers acquired in the TONE study, described below.

### Acute optic neuritis: unmet clinical needs and model for new therapies [^1133uEQo]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Idiopathic demyelinating optic neuritis (ON) most commonly presents as acute unilateral vision loss and eye pain and is frequently associated with multiple sclerosis. Although emphasis is often placed on the good recovery of high-contrast visual acuity, persistent deficits are frequently observed in other aspects of vision, including contrast sensitivity, visual field testing, color vision, motion perception, and vision-related quality of life. Persistent and profound structural and functional changes are often revealed by imaging and electrophysiologic techniques, including optical coherence tomography, visual-evoked potentials, and nonconventional MRI. These abnormalities can impair patients' abilities to perform daily activities (e.g., driving, working) so they have important implications for patients' quality of life. In this article, we review the sequelae from ON, including clinical, structural, and functional changes and their interrelationships. The unmet needs in each of these areas are considered and the progress made toward meeting those needs is examined. Finally, we provide an overview of past and present investigational approaches for disease modification in ON.

### Case for a new corticosteroid treatment trial in optic neuritis: review of updated evidence [^1128TJC3]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Novel diagnostic groupings

Over the past 25 years, new developments have changed our understanding of the clinical spectrum and causes, the diagnostic workup and the impact of ON on patients. While testing for just syphilis, glucose and antinuclear antibodies was sufficient in 1992, contemporary diagnostic workup includes testing for autoantibodies, such as those to AQP4 and MOG. It is now possible to subgroup patients with ON with greater precision in relation to aetiology, in order to explore differences in prognosis by subgroup. Table 1 summarises tests that should be considered for a new ONTT.

### Case for a new corticosteroid treatment trial in optic neuritis: review of updated evidence [^113oV28Q]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Optic neuritis (ON) is a condition that causes loss of vision. Most frequently, ON affects one eye, but occasionally, simultaneous bilateral loss of vision occurs. Typically, a variable degree of spontaneous recovery takes place within about 3 months and can continue for up to 1 year. There are a number of triggers for ON, ranging from postvaccination episodes to any type of inflammation and specific autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS), neuromyelitis optica (NMO), and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) ON amongothers. In about 5% of patients, there is risk of severe permanent loss of vision and blindness. A major challenge is that it is not possible to know the subtype of ON at presentation. While certain demographic features, symptoms and clinical signs are suggestive, more definitive results from blood tests and neuroimaging can take days or weeks to obtain. Furthermore, negative findings in the blood tests do not rule out non-multiple sclerosis-associated optic neuritis (MSON).

The clinical management of patients who suffer from MSON has been profoundly influenced by the 1992 US Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT). This trial recommended intravenous corticosteroids, not to improve the final outcome but to speed up visual recovery. There were, however, limitations to the ONTT protocol, which may have influenced the findings. First, the ONTT used a vague definition of 'symptom onset'. This is relevant because loss of vision (used in the ONTT) is frequently preceded by several days of pain from inflammation. Second, there was delayed treatment initiation, at a mean of 5.0 ± 1.6 days, which was timed from the visual loss but not from the onset of pain. Third, by contemporary standards, the trial primary outcome measure of high-contrast visual acuity (HCVA) was relatively crude. Fourth, the ONTT recruited a heterogeneous cohort of ON types, including a minority of MOG antibody-positive cases, who may well behave differently from MSON and be corticosteroid sensitive and even corticosteroid dependent. There were no aquaporin 4 (AQP4) seropositive cases in the ONTT. Furthermore, the ONTT did not include any pharmacokinetic data. It was thus not possible for investigators to comment on blood levels, resulting in an inability to propose a plausible biological explanation for as to why oral versus intravenous corticosteroids should be harmful compared with intravenous corticosteroids.

Method of literature search

We conducted a systematic review using the Cochrane methodology and reported the findings according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, OTSeeker, PEDro and PsycINFO databases were searched using the terms 'optic neuritis', 'optic perineuritis', 'demyelinating' and 'multiple sclerosis'. Related definitions and descriptions were extracted. Two independent reviewers determined whether the studies met inclusion the inclusion criteria: reviews or randomised controlled trials; categorised interventions based on the name, core components and diagnostic populations; rated the quality of evidence and determined the strengths of recommendations using the GRADE criteria; and made recommendations using the evidence alert traffic light system.

### Disease course of clinically isolated optic neuritis [^113EVfCn]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Our analysis confirms the feasibility of acute optic neuritis as a model for clinical neuroprotection and remyelination. This study builds upon previous works by including a larger number of patients who uniformly presented with acute optic neuritis as a clinically isolated syndrome, recruitment from multiple centers, standardized follow-up with a multimodal functional characterization of the visual system, and optical coherence tomography including macular outer retinal layer segmentation. We expect our findings to be applicable to most central European patients presenting with acute idiopathic or multiple sclerosis–associated optic neuritis and a baseline high-contrast visual acuity of less than 0.5 decimal. They should provide a reasonable expectation of the disease course in a methylprednisolone-treated placebo group in a clinical trial and may serve as a future reference on the disease course of optic neuritis.

### The course of visual recovery after optic neuritis: experience of the optic neuritis treatment trial [^112JaSZs]. Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To define the time course of visual recovery after optic neuritis and factors predictive of this course in the patients enrolled in the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial.

Methods

The cohort for this study consisted of the 438 patients who completed the 6-month follow-up visit. Visual acuity was measured at baseline and at seven follow-up visits during the first 6 months. Factors predictive of recovery were evaluated with univariate and multivariate statistical tests.

Results

Visual recovery was rapid in all three treatment groups. In almost all patients, regardless of treatment group and initial severity of visual loss, improvement began within the first month. Among the 278 patients with baseline visual acuity of 20/ 50 or worse, all patients improved at least one line of visual acuity, and all except six improved at least three lines, during the 6-month follow-up period. Baseline visual acuity was the best predictor of the 6-month visual acuity outcome (P = 0.0001). Older age was statistically associated with a slightly worse outcome (P = 0.02), but this appeared to be of no clinical importance.

Conclusions

In most patients with optic neuritis, visual recovery is rapid. The only factor of value in predicting the visual outcome is initial severity of visual loss. However, even when initial loss is severe, visual recovery is still good in most patients. Patients not following the usual course of visual recovery should be considered atypical. For such patients, further investigation in regard to etiology of the visual loss may be appropriate.

### Challenges and opportunities in designing clinical trials for neuromyelitis optica [^116cMWiW]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Current management of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is noncurative and only partially effective. Immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents are the mainstays of maintenance treatment. Safer, better-tolerated, and proven effective treatments are needed. The perceived rarity of NMO has impeded clinical trials for this disease. However, a diagnostic biomarker and recognition of a wider spectrum of NMO presentations has expanded the patient population from which study candidates might be recruited. Emerging insights into the pathogenesis of NMO have provided rationale for exploring new therapeutic targets. Academic, pharmaceutical, and regulatory communities are increasingly interested in meeting the unmet needs of patients with NMO. Clinical trials powered to yield unambiguous outcomes and designed to facilitate rapid evaluation of an expanding pipeline of experimental agents are needed. NMO-related disability occurs incrementally as a result of attacks; thus, limiting attack frequency and severity are critical treatment goals. Yet, the severity of NMO and perception that currently available agents are effective pose challenges to study design. We propose strategies for NMO clinical trials to evaluate agents targeting recovery from acute attacks and prevention of relapses, the 2 primary goals of NMO treatment. Aligning the interests of all stakeholders is an essential step to this end.

### Diagnosis and classification of autoimmune optic neuropathy [^112L4AkH]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

The spectrum of autoimmune optic neuropathies (ON) is extending. The phenotypic spectrum includes single isolated optic neuritis (SION), relapsing isolated optic neuritis (RION), chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy (CRION), the neuromyelitis optica (NMO) spectrum disorder, multiple sclerosis associated optic neuritis (MSON) and unclassified optic neuritis (UCON) forms. Epidemiological data suggests a slight female predominance. The ethnic heritage is relevant as Caucasian patients are more likely to suffer from MSON, whilst SION, RION, CRION and NMO are more frequent in non-Caucasian patients. Importantly, prognosis for recovery of visual function is good in MSON, but poorer in NMO and CRION which also have a high chance for recurrent episodes. Testing for serum anti-AQP4 autoantibodies is advised in all patients with severe, atypical or recurrent ON because of the high diagnostic specificity. The diagnostic specificity may be aided by testing for glial biomarkers in the CSF and prognostic accuracy by testing for biomarkers for neuroaxonal degeneration. Optical coherence tomography is a highly accurate tool to document the final outcome. The current clinical classification criteria rely on the phenotype, response to treatment and presence of anti-AQP4 autoantibodies.

### Optic nerve as a 5th location in the revised McDonald diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis: limitations of OCT in the acute phase [^112tQ4Ax]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Background

In 2024, the new International Panel diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis (MS) were presented at ECTRIMS, significantly enhancing diagnostic accuracy. For the first time, these updated criteria include optical coherence tomography (OCT) to identify optic nerve involvement as a fifth diagnostic location, offering an innovative approach to MS diagnosis. This addition aims to improve sensitivity in detecting early signs of the disease, particularly in cases where optic nerve involvement might otherwise go undetected. The present report aims to provide a comparison of OCT metrics from the acute to the chronic phase of optic neuritis (ON), clarifying the variability seen with the disease progression. Both general OCT measures for clinicians and advanced OCT metrics in the MS criteria, available to select researchers, are reviewed to improve OCT interpretation in clinical practice, aiding in more accurate MS diagnoses.

### Association of race / ethnicity with visual outcomes following acute optic neuritis: an analysis of the optic neuritis treatment trial [^112QjTVW]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2014). Medium credibility.

IMPORTANCE Retrospective studies have demonstrated disparate outcomes following acute optic neuritis in individuals of African descent compared with individuals of white race/ethnicity. However, published analyses of the prospectively collected Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT) data identified no association between worse visual outcomes and black race/ethnicity. OBJECTIVES To investigate the associations of age, sex, and race/ethnicity with visual outcomes following acute optic neuritis through application of longitudinal data analysis techniques to the ONTT data set. DESIGN Secondary analysis of the ONTT (a prospective randomized controlled trial) data set. Our models included effects of treatment (placebo, oral prednisone, or intravenous methylprednisolone), time, and treatment×time interaction, as well as demographic covariates of age, sex, and race/ethnicity. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS The ONTT data were collected at multiple centers in the United States. Patients of black (n = 58) and white (n = 388) race/ethnicity with acute optic neuritis who enrolled in the ONTT within 8 days of symptom onset were included in analyses. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The contrast sensitivity and visual acuity (logMAR) in the affected eye were modeled using 2-stage mixed-effects regression techniques. All available follow-up data from baseline to 15 to 18 years were included. RESULTS The data identified no relationship of age, sex, or treatment with contrast sensitivity or visual acuity outcomes. Race/ethnicity was significantly related to contrast sensitivity (P < .001) and visual acuity (P < .001) during a 15-year period following acute optic neuritis, with black race/ethnicity being associated with worse scores for both. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Race/ethnicity seems to be associated with contrast sensitivity and visual acuity outcomes in affected eyes following acute optic neuritis. To our knowledge, this is the largest cohort of black race/ethnicity with acute optic neuritis to be studied and represents the first evidence from a prospectively collected data set to support a hypothesis of race/ethnicity-dependent visual outcomes of acute optic neuritis.

### What's new in neuromyelitis optica? A short review for the clinical neurologist [^111iuSWg]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

The evolution of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) from a rare, incurable and misunderstood disease with almost universally poor outcomes to its present state in just over a decade is unprecedented in neurology and possibly in medicine. Our knowledge of NMOSD biology has led to the recognition of wider phenotypes, new disease mechanisms, and thus clinical trials of new and effective treatments. This article aims to update readers on the recent developments in NMOSD with particular emphasis on clinical advances, the 2015 diagnostic criteria, biomarkers, imaging, and therapeutic interventions.

### Earlier and more frequent diagnosis of multiple sclerosis using the McDonald criteria [^116sg4oB]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

One potential limitation of our study is an over-representation of patients with optic neuritis, which may have a more benign prognosis that other CIS types. However, almost 80% of patients with optic neuritis had baseline MRI abnormalities, indicating a group at high-risk for developing MS.

In conclusion, the McDonald criteria allow MS to be diagnosed sooner and more often in patients with CIS. While the McDonald criteria facilitate an earlier diagnosis of MS, up to a third of patients with CIS who satisfy the 2010 criteria do not have further clinical events, at least in the medium-term.

### An update on optic neuritis [^114RTvRq]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Optic neuritis (ON) is the most common cause of subacute optic neuropathy in young adults. Although most cases of optic neuritis (ON) are classified as typical, meaning idiopathic or associated with multiple sclerosis, there is a growing understanding of atypical forms of optic neuritis such as antibody mediated aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-IgG neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and the recently described entity, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody-associated disease (MOGAD). Differentiating typical ON from atypical ON is important because they have different prognoses and treatments. Findings of atypical ON, including severe vision loss with poor recovery with steroids or steroid dependence, prominent optic disc edema, bilateral vision loss, and childhood or late adult onset, should prompt serologic testing for AQP4-IgG and MOG-IgG. Although the traditional division of typical and atypical ON can be helpful, it should be noted that there can be severe presentations of otherwise typical ON and mild presentations of atypical ON that blur these traditional lines. Rare causes of autoimmune optic neuropathies, such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and collapsin response-mediator protein 5 (CRMP5) autoimmunity also should be considered in patients with bilateral painless optic neuropathy associated with optic disc edema, especially if there are other accompanying suggestive neurologic symptoms/signs. Typical ON usually recovers well without treatment, though recovery may be expedited by steroids. Atypical ON is usually treated with intravenous steroids, and some forms, such as NMOSD, often require plasma exchange for acute attacks and long-term immunosuppressive therapy to prevent relapses. Since treatment is tailored to the cause of the ON, elucidating the etiology of the ON is of the utmost importance.

### Association of individual-level factors with visual outcomes in optic neuritis: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^111iUUBm]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Limitations

Our study has important limitations. First, the ONTT consisted primarily of women who were white with typical demyelinating optic neuritis. Therefore, our findings cannot be generalized to patients with atypical optic neuritis, including neuromyelitis optica and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein–associated optic neuritis or those who would not have met the ONTT inclusion criteria. We also did not find an association between symptom duration and long-term visual function but cannot address whether hyperacute corticosteroid treatment before the onset of vision loss would have aborted the attack. Second, the ONTT data are more than 25 years old. Although little evidence suggests that the diagnosis or natural history of optic neuritis has changed substantially over time, external validation in a more modern cohort is needed. Third, few patients with poor visual function both at baseline and at 1 year were included. Further work should be undertaken to understand why some people with poor visual function do not substantially recover and to try to estimate who might be at risk. Third, we did not include optic neuritis recurrences as a variable in our models, because that information is unknown to the clinician at the time of initial presentation when corticosteroid treatment decisions are made. An unanticipated finding of the ONTT was that patients treated with oral corticosteroids were more likely to have an optic neuritis relapse. This finding is potentially important because those with a relapse were more likely to have a poor outcome. Fourth, MS is now diagnosed using more sensitive criteria (2017 McDonald criteria). Therefore, the association between MS and optic neuritis visual outcomes should be evaluated in a study that can apply the 2017 McDonald criteria. Last, because the ONTT was underpowered to detect serious corticosteroid harms, we cannot use this data set to estimate risks of individual-level harms.

### Diagnostic criteria for MOGAD [^113hwAxT]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

The panel also recommend that patient selection needed to be more focused to improve the positive predictive value of testing, recommending that tests should be carried out in patients who have clinical and/or radiological features in keeping with MOGAD rather than all patients with demyelinating disease. They also noted that almost 50% of paediatric patients with optic neuritis/ADEM were MOG-IgG positive compared to 5% of adults with optic neuritis. They suggest that only testing patients with certain features, including severe optic disc oedema or longitudinally extensive optic nerve lesions, amongst others, would increase the diagnostic yield of MOG tests and recommend that MOG testing should not be requested as part of routine screening for patients suspected of having MS due to a 0.3–2.5% false positive rate.

Comment:

This paper forms the first international, consensus diagnostic criteria for MOGAD and requires validation in existing cohorts. The panel lays out clear criteria for the identification of patients with MOGAD which will allow for better longitudinal evaluation of MOGAD. If all future cohorts include patients that are classified by the same criteria, the consistency and validity of comparisons between different groups will improve. As MOGAD remains a relatively rare disease, having consensus diagnostic criteria is also important to allow for collaboration between groups and is an important step towards clinical trials to optimise clinical management and explore new therapeutic options.

### How far should I manage acute optic neuritis as an ophthalmologist? A United Kingdom perspective [^113XpMaK]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Over the past decade, the role of ophthalmologists in diagnosing and managing ON has evolved significantly. The diverse causes of ON, many of which require urgent intervention, have highlighted the criticality of timely management in ON, akin to stroke care, under the principle of "time is vision". Effective collaboration with neuro-ophthalmologists or neurologists is essential for specialised investigation and treatment. Ophthalmologists have a vital role to play in advancing the differential diagnosis, taking the time-critical first decisions about investigation and management and identifying conditions that may arise as complications of treatment.

Secondly, it is important to note that while MRI imaging generally reveals demyelination effectively, older studies reported that 60% of ON patients had normal MRI. This contrasts with later literature, which predominantly focuses on MS-ON and adheres to established radiological criteria for MRI acquisition and interpretation. In everyday clinical practice, the effectiveness of MRI depends on the location of the optic nerve involvement and the imaging protocol and quality. MRI is highly effective for imaging stationary parts of the optic nerve up to the chiasm, but cannot detect pre-laminar ON (inflammation anterior to the lamina cribrosa).

Thirdly, in the UK population, the risk of treating an undifferentiated ON which is driven by an infectious disease process is low. Typically, serology results for infectious diseases come back in time to prevent potential long-term complications from unopposed corticosteroid treatment.

Corticosteroid treatment for suspected or confirmed MS-ON?

We also take the 'Time is Vision' perspective in suspected MS-ON. The 1992 landmark Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT) historically guided the treatment of acute monocular ON in a certain patient demographic. The trial recruited 457 patients, 77% female, 85% white, with a mean age of 32 years. There have been calls for a new ONTT to address limitations and evidence gaps. Re-analysis revealed inclusion of a small number of patients with MOG-ON, a corticosteroid-sensitive and sometimes even corticosteroid-dependent ON. Few recruited patients were treated in the hyperacute phase (< 48 h from pain onset) with a mean time to treatment of 51.6 days after visual loss, and so the benefits of early corticosteroid treatment were not assessed. The ONTT also used high contrast visual acuity as the primary outcome measure. More sensitive visual function tests include Low Contrast Visual Acuity (LC-VA) and Colour Assessment and Diagnosis (CAD). Furthermore, the ONTT recruited a heterogeneous ON cohort, but findings were not generalisable to all ON patients, and especially to patients with more severe or bilateral non-MS-ON.

### Clinical phenotype, radiological features, and treatment of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-immunoglobulin G (MOG-IgG) optic neuritis [^116zsXsD]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the clinical characteristics, radiological manifestations and treatment of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-immunoglobulin G (IgG) optic neuritis.

Recent Findings

Serum antibodies to MOG have recently been found to be a biomarker of MOG-IgG-associated disorder (MOGAD), a demyelinating disease distinct from both multiple sclerosis (MS) and aquaporin-4-IgG neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD). The phenotype of MOGAD is broad and includes optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, and acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (ADEM). Optic neuritis is the most common presentation in adults, whereas ADEM is the most common presentation in children. Clinical characteristics suggestive of MOG-IgG optic neuritis include recurrent optic neuritis, prominent disc edema, and perineural enhancement of the optic nerve on magnetic resonance imaging. Although the nadir of vision loss is severe with MOG-IgG optic neuritis, the recovery is typically better than AQP4-IgG optic neuritis and therefore has a favorable overall prognosis. Patients with relapsing disease will often need chronic immunotherapy. Rituximab, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and monthly intravenous immune globulin are the most commonly utilized treatments.

Summary

MOGAD is a unique entity that is separate from both MS and AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD. Recognition of the clinical and radiologic features allow for the correct diagnosis. Future randomized trials will determine the optimal treatment for MOGAD.

### New therapies for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder [^114i9CZU]. The Lancet: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Background

Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder is an autoimmune disease of the CNS that primarily affects the optic nerves and spinal cord. Most patients have serum antibodies targeting the aquaporin-4 water channel expressed on the end-feet of astrocytes. Although the prevalence of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder is limited to around 1–2 people per 100000, severe immune-mediated attacks can quickly lead to blindness and paralysis if undiagnosed and untreated. However, diagnosis is straightforward when the highly specific serum aquaporin-4 antibodies are detected with cell-based assays.

Recent Developments

Four randomised controlled trials have tested the efficacy of three new therapies (eculizumab, satralizumab, and inebilizumab) for patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder that all showed a benefit in preventing future attacks. These therapies have different targets within the immune pathogenic process, and the four trials have similarities and differences that mean they might change the therapeutic landscape for people with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder in different ways. Efficacy, safety, tolerability, and practical considerations, including potential cost, differ for each drug and might affect the rate of use in real-world populations of patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. WHERE NEXT? Despite the rarity of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, a relative abundance of preventive treatment options now exists. In the future, trials should focus on areas of unmet need, including aquaporin-4 seronegative disease, and on development of treatments for acute relapses and for recovery from autoimmune attacks in the CNS.

### Neuromyelitis optica: clinical predictors of a relapsing course and survival [^112deXhL]. Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The relapsing form of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is characterized by recurrent optic neuritis and myelitis, usually leading to severe, permanent, relapse-related neurologic impairment (e.g., blindness, paraplegia) within 5 years. Aggressive therapy aimed at relapse prevention initiated soon after disease onset may be expected to have a relatively greater impact on early relapse-related disability in NMO than in typical MS. Early prediction of a relapsing course and subsequent disease severity would facilitate design and implementation of clinical trials of such therapies.

Methods

A database of clinical and laboratory features of patients with NMO (n = 80) was used to develop potentially useful models predictive of a relapsing disease course and of subsequent disease severity as measured by survival.

Results

Predictors of a relapsing course were longer interattack interval between the first two clinical events (rate ratio [RR] = 2.16; per month increase), older age at onset (RR = 1.08; per year increase), female sex (RR = 10.0, female vs male), and less severe motor impairment with the sentinel myelitis event (RR = 0.48; per severity scale point increase). A history of other autoimmune disease (RR = 4.15; presence vs absence), higher attack frequency during the first 2 years of disease (RR = 1.21; per attack), and better motor recovery following the index myelitis event (RR = 1.84; per point increase) were associated with mortality due to relapsing NMO.

Conclusions

These predictive models identify several clinical features, each available at diagnosis or early in the disease course, that predict relapsing disease and survival. These results may be useful to identify patients at high risk for severe, relapsing neuromyelitis optica in order to initiate early therapy for relapse prevention and to design clinical trials to study such interventions.

### Re-evaluating the treatment of acute optic neuritis [^111kCRaU]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

In a subsequent analysis, patients randomised to receive treatment with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone in conjunction with 11-day low-dose oral prednisone taper exhibited a significantly reduced risk of developing clinically definite MS (defined by the development of a second bona fide inflammatory demyelinating syndrome) over the subsequent 2 years. Notwithstanding this apparently noteworthy outcome, no significant disease-modifying effects were confirmed beyond the second year of ascertainment. Although the data from the ONTT have been reviewed rigorously, some have questioned the finding that intravenous steroids may produce a short-term benefit in delaying the onset of MS and that the risk of recurrent optic neuritis increases with the use of oral prednisone alone. Concerns include the lack of treatment blinding, post hoc analyses, small sample sizes, recoding of patient classifications and changes in the statistical assumptions. Despite the wealth of data gathered in the ONTT, critical questions regarding patient management remain unanswered. These include the following: (1) whether corticosteroid treatment is beneficial in patients whose symptom duration is longer than 8 days; (2) whether higher doses of corticosteroids are more effective than lower doses; (3) what is the optimal corticosteroid regimen; (4) whether the observed increased ON recurrence rate associated with oral prednisone also is observed in MS attacks and (5) whether high-dose methylprednisolone given periodically will improve the prognosis for patients with MS.

### Optic neuritis: the eye as a window to the brain [^114birKA]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute optic neuritis is a common clinical problem, requiring a structured assessment to guide management and prevent visual loss. The optic nerve is the most accessible part of the central nervous system, so optic neuritis also represents an important paradigm to help decipher mechanisms of damage and recovery in the central nervous system. Important developments include the advent of optical coherence tomography as a biomarker of central nervous system axonal loss, the discovery of new pathological antibodies, notably against aquaporin-4 and, more recently, myelin oligodendrocyte protein, and emerging evidence for sodium channel blockade as a novel therapeutic approach to address energy failure in neuroinflammatory disease.

Recent Findings

We will present a practical approach to assessment of optic neuritis, highlighting the role of optical coherence tomography, when to test for new antibodies and the results of recent trials of sodium channel blockers.

Summary

Optic neuritis remains a clinical diagnosis; increasingly optical coherence tomography is a key ancillary investigation. Patients with 'typical' optic neuritis, commonly a first presentation of multiple sclerosis, must be distinguished from 'atypical' optic neuritis, who require testing for new pathological antibodies and require more aggressive-targeted treatment. Sodium channel blockade is an emerging and novel potential therapeutic pathway in neuroinflammatory disease.

### Real-world application of the 2022 diagnostic criteria for first-ever episode of optic neuritis [^117DMQWL]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Optic neuritis (ON) admits diverse differential diagnoses. Petzold proposed diagnostic criteria for ON in 2022, although real-world application of these criteria is missing. We conducted a retrospective review of patients with ON. We classified patients into definite or possible ON, and into groups A (typical neuritis), B (painless), or C (binocular) and estimated the frequency of etiologies for each group. We included 77 patients, with 62% definite and 38% possible ON. CRION and NMOSD-AQP4 negative-ON were less commonly seen in definite ON. Application of the 2022 criteria revealed a lower-than-expected frequency of definite ON, particularly for seronegative non-MS causes.

### Phenytoin for neuroprotection in patients with acute optic neuritis: a randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial [^113FDSKj]. The Lancet: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute demyelinating optic neuritis, a common feature of multiple sclerosis, can damage vision through neurodegeneration in the optic nerve and in its fibres in the retina. Inhibition of voltage-gated sodium channels is neuroprotective in preclinical models. In this study we aimed to establish whether sodium-channel inhibition with phenytoin is neuroprotective in patient with acute optic neuritis.

Methods

We did a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase 2 trial at two UK academic hospitals in London and Sheffield. Patients with acute optic neuritis aged 18–60 years, presenting within 2 weeks of onset, with visual acuity of 6/9 or worse, were randomly assigned (1:1) by minimisation via a web-based service to oral phenytoin (maintenance dose 4 mg/kg per day if randomised before or on July 16, 2013, and 6 mg/kg per day if randomised on or after July 17, 2013) or placebo for 3 months, stratified by time from onset, centre, previous multiple sclerosis diagnosis, use of disease-modifying treatment, and use of corticosteroids for acute optic neuritis. Participants and treating and assessing physicians were masked to group assignment. The primary outcome was retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness in the affected eye at 6 months, adjusted for fellow-eye RNFL thickness at baseline, analysed in a modified intention-to-treat population of all randomised participants who were followed up at 6 months. Safety was analysed in the entire population, including those who were lost to follow-up. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT 01451593.

Findings

We recruited 86 participants between Feb 3, 2012, and May 22, 2014 (42 assigned to phenytoin and 44 to placebo). 29 were assigned to phenytoin 4 mg/kg and 13 to phenytoin 6 mg/kg. Five participants were lost to follow-up, so the primary analysis included 81 participants (39 assigned to phenytoin and 42 to placebo). Mean 6-month RNFL thickness in the affected eye at 6 months was 81.46 μm (SD 16.27) in the phenytoin group (a mean decrease of 16.69 μm [SD 13.73] from baseline) versus 74.29 μm (15.14) in the placebo group (a mean decrease of 23.79 μm [13.97] since baseline; adjusted 6-month difference of 7.15 μm [95% CI 1.08–13.22]; p = 0.021), corresponding to a 30% reduction in the extent of RNFL loss with phenytoin compared with placebo. Treatment was well tolerated, with five (12%) of 42 patients having a serious adverse event in the phenytoin group (only one, severe rash, was attributable to phenytoin) compared with two (5%) of 44 in the placebo group.

Interpretation

These findings support the concept of neuroprotection with phenytoin in patients with acute optic neuritis at concentrations at which it blocks voltage-gated sodium channels selectively. Further investigation in larger clinical trials in optic neuritis and in relapsing multiple sclerosis is warranted.

### Childhood optic neuritis clinical features and outcome [^117MJ4qj]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2011). Low credibility.

Aim

To describe clinical features and outcome of a series of children with first-episode optic neuritis investigated in three paediatric neurology centres.

Methods

Databases were searched to identify children (< 16 years) with optic neuritis and life table analysis was used.

Results

44 children (female/male ratio 1.8) median age 10.9 years were followed up for median 1 year. Optic neuritis was unilateral in 43%. Maximal visual deficit was severe (< 6/60) in 77%, with full recovery in 70%. Cumulative probability of developing MS (11/44) or NMO (3/44) at 2 years was 0.45. Relapsing optic neuritis was a strong predictor for development of MS or NMO. A positive MRI (> 1 brain T2 hyperintense lesion) was a strong predictor for development of MS.

Discussion

Childhood optic neuritis is associated with severe visual deficit with good recovery. An initial abnormal MRI brain scan or relapsing optic neuritis should alert the clinician to MS or NMO diagnosis.

### MOG antibody-associated optic neuritis [^115SfiVw]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

MOG IgG testing

The detection of serum MOG IgG using a live cell-based assay is highly specific and sensitive for a diagnosis consistent with MOGAD. In contrast, fixed cell-based assays have lower sensitivity and specificity. Serum is the recommended biospecimen for testing for MOG IgG. While CSF may be positive for MOG IgG in 40–60% of patients with MOGAD, in many patients the diagnosis would be missed if CSF was tested in isolation.

Given that up to 50% of children presenting with demyelination under the age of 10 years will have MOGAD as a final diagnosis, all children in this age group with a first presentation consistent with demyelination, including optic neuritis, should be tested for MOG IgG. In contrast, MOG IgG serological testing should only be performed in adults with demyelination in the context of a suspected clinical or radiological phenotype for MOGAD. Testing large numbers of unselected patients with likely MS-ON in the context of typical MS brain lesions who have a low pre-test probability for MOGAD, will stretch the specificity for even the most specific and sensitive diagnostic biomarker.

Finally, interpretation of CSF-restricted MOG IgG (for example in a seronegative patient with ON) requires clinical acumen. While this may be contributory to the diagnosis in seronegative cases where there is a clinicoradiological profile highly associated with MOGAD, in atypical cases this could represent a false positive result.

### Acute optic neuritis: unmet clinical needs and model for new therapies [^114ekBit]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Although idiopathic demyelinating optic neuritis (ON) broadly describes the vision loss associated with any inflammation of the CNS white matter tract referred to as the optic nerve, the term is most commonly associated with the unilateral visual loss that occurs in multiple sclerosis (MS). Atypical ON may be associated with neuromyelitis optica, infections, or systemic etiologies, but this article will focus predominantly on the typical demyelinating ON syndrome associated with MS. Typical ON is characterized by a loss of vision that develops over days and is associated with dyschromatopsia, visual field loss, and pain that is often exacerbated by eye movements. Usually there are no retinal exudates or severe disc swelling and vision is better than no light perception.

Significant knowledge about the clinical course of ON derives from the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT). First published in 1992, the ONTT established that high-dose IV corticosteroid treatment slightly accelerated the rate of recovery but had no effect on long-term visual outcomes. Visual fields and contrast sensitivity were the primary measures of efficacy and showed a slight advantage of high-dose IV corticosteroids over placebo at 6 months. Nevertheless, vision for most patients in all treatment groups at 6 months was characterized as "normal" based on high-contrast visual acuity, a secondary outcome measured using Snellen charts, which was 20/50 or better for > 90% of patients regardless of treatment assignment. This created the impression that most patients make an excellent recovery following acute ON. However, a follow-up study 5–8 years later found abnormalities in affected eyes vs fellow eyes for the primary endpoints of contrast sensitivity (58% vs 17%) and visual field (33% vs 12%), as well as the secondary endpoints of high-contrast visual acuity (39% vs 16%) and color vision (37% vs 18%). Furthermore, as described in the sections that follow, advances in imaging and electrophysiologic techniques over the past 2 decades have revealed that persistent structural and functional damage is detectable following episodes of acute ON and that the associated visual deficits may have considerable impact on quality of life (QOL) measures. Given the development of therapies with the potential to prevent neuroaxonal loss and facilitate remyelination following acute ON, it is time to reassess the extent of spontaneous recovery in ON and the approaches to determining outcomes so that unmet needs may be identified and addressed.

### Neuroprotection and visual function after optic neuritis [^1153kg8G]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This article discusses the advantages and pitfalls of testing neuroprotective treatment strategies in patients suffering from optic neuritis.

Recent Findings

Spectral domain optical coherence tomography now permits for automated segmentation of individual retinal layers. The peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (pRNFL) has been used in 13 of the 15 trials reviewed. Twelve trials also made use of electrophysiology. Overestimation of good visual recovery in the past has recently been recognized. Assessment of low contrast visual acuity and colour vision are now mainstream.

Summary

The availability of highly accurate and robust trial outcome measures has facilitated research on this topic. A single long-term structural outcome measurement of the pRNFL is sufficient. For shorter term, assessments of the ganglion cell/inner plexiform layer and axonal birefringence are promising. Longitudinal blood levels of neurofilament proteins permit to recognize axonal loss at presentation and monitor changes longitudinally. Inner nuclear layer volume changes relate to inflammatory disease activity. Pitfalls are related to the timing of events. Hyperacute recruitment is needed for future trials. The onset of demyelination is not known, which complicates timing of electrophysiological recordings. Optic disc oedema precludes the use of the pRNFL from the affected eye as a baseline variable. The concomitant use of corticosteroids complicates interpretation of trial data.

### The investigation of acute optic neuritis: a review and proposed protocol [^116jVNTZ]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Optic neuritis is an inflammatory optic neuropathy that affects many patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) at some point during their disease course. Differentiation of acute episodes of MS-associated optic neuritis from other autoimmune and inflammatory optic neuropathies is vital for treatment choice and further patient management, but is not always straightforward. Over the past decade, a number of new imaging, laboratory and electrophysiological techniques have entered the clinical arena. To date, however, no consensus guidelines have been devised to specify how and when these techniques can be most rationally applied for the diagnostic work-up of patients with acute optic neuritis. In this article, we review the literature and attempt to formulate a consensus for the investigation of patients with acute optic neuritis, both in standard care and in research with relevance to clinical treatment trials.

### Are PHOMS a clinical sign of optic neuritis? [^112x3f3W]. Eye (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Assess the prevalence and evolution of PHOMS in optic neuritis.

Methods

We analysed the medical files of 126 patients included in the OCTON cohort. Patients' medical files, digital retinal images and OCT examinations were reviewed, searching for optic nerve head oedema and PHOMS at the initial presentation and during the follow-up.

Results

We included 102 patients in the final analysis. Twenty-nine (29) eyes had optic nerve head oedema at the initial presentation. PHOMS were found to be present in 8 eyes affected with optic neuritis. All cases of PHOMS were associated with optic nerve head oedema. All the PHOMS decreased in size and disappeared with the improvement of the oedema.

Discussion

Our results show that PHOMS is not a common sign of optic neuritis. We didn't observe any case of PHOMS in the absence of optic nerve head oedema in eyes with optic neuritis. PHOMS seem to be a rare sign of optic neuritis associated to optic nerve head oedema, and they tend to disappear with the improvement of the optic nerve head oedema. We suggest that the presence of PHOMS in optic neuritis eyes with no optic nerve oedema should be a considered warning sign.

### Management of acute optic neuritis [^115m2jDc]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

Optic neuritis is a common condition that causes reversible loss of vision. It can be clinically isolated or can arise as one of the manifestations of multiple sclerosis. Occasional cases are due to other causes, and in these instances management can differ radically. The treatment of optic neuritis has been investigated in several trials, the results of which have shown that corticosteroids speed up the recovery of vision without affecting the final visual outcome. Other aspects of management, however, are controversial, and there is uncertainty about when to investigate and when to treat the condition. Here we review the diagnostic features of optic neuritis, its differential diagnosis, and give practical guidance about management of patients. The condition's association with multiple sclerosis will be considered in the light of studies that define the risk for development of multiple sclerosis and with respect to results of trials of disease-modifying drugs in these individuals.

### Patients' knowledge and perception on optic neuritis management before and after an information session [^112xnVsq]. BMC Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Integrating evidenced based practice into daily clinical care of patients is the driving force behind much needed clinical research. It is commonly assumed that clinical evidence ultimately transforms clinical management by health professionals and results in better patient outcomes. Recently it has been highlighted that evaluation of the impact of major clinical trials "Translational T2 Clinical Research" is essential when assessing the effects of interventions designed to improve quality of care. Although such translational research is important to implement change, there are other barriers to change that may occur at the level of the patient, the clinician or the healthcare system.

Patient preferences in adopting the best practice for their own management is not known. Making evidence based decisions is a complex process integrating evidence based information with patient's circumstances and the individual patient's preferences. Surveying patient understanding of their condition, their choice of treatment and barriers to treatment options is important to implement best practice.

Optic neuritis (ON) is an acute inflammation of the optic nerve resulting in painful loss of vision. Optic neuritis may be a clinically isolated syndrome but it can also be associated with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) which is a systemic demyelinating condition. In about a quarter of MS cases, the patient first presents with optic neuritis and over half of MS patients have at least one episode of optic neuritis during the course of their condition. There is Level 1 evidence obtained from at least one properly designed randomized controlled trial that treatment of an acute optic neuritis with intravenous corticosteroid followed by oral steroid results in faster vision recovery. Optic neuritis is an ideal model to investigate patient understanding and belief as the signs and symptoms of optic neurits can be readily identified; the natural history of the condition and the effect of treatment with intravenous steroid have been studied. Treatment with intravenous corticosteroid can help with faster vision recovery but does not change the final vision. As optic neuritis is a prominent feature of MS, which is a chronic condition that affects young people in the most productive years of their lives, and understanding patient preferences is essential to ensure good chronic disease management.

The aim of this study is to evaluate patient understanding and preferences regarding the treatment of acute optic neuritis and to determine whether a patient information session can assist in increasing the likelihood that patients will engage in guideline recommended best practice management.

### Visual function at baseline and 1 month in acute optic neuritis: predictors of visual outcome [^114UbCaK]. Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify cutpoints for visual measures at baseline and 1 month predictive of abnormal 6-month vision that could be used as eligibility criteria in a clinical trial to test potential neuroprotection or myelin repair agents in patients with optic neuritis. To determine whether moderate-to-severe dysfunction in one or more visual measures at baseline or 1 month correlates with having major vision loss at 6 months.

Methods

We used the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial database to evaluate various cutpoints for baseline and 1-month vision levels that predicted abnormal 6-month vision. For selected cutpoints, we computed a 95% CI for positive predictive value and the required sample size if the cutpoint was to be used for clinical trial eligibility. We evaluated whether the degree of visual loss at baseline, 1 month, or change in visual function from baseline to 1 month correlated with 6-month visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, or threshold visual field.

Results

The best cutpoints for baseline and 1 month were visual acuity ≤ 20/50, contrast sensitivity < 1.0 log units, and visual field mean deviation ≤ -15 dB. The same levels of visual dysfunction at 1 month, but not at baseline, correlated with having 6-month moderate-to-severe loss for each of these measures (p = 0.01). A trial could require as few as 100 subjects for an outcome variable of one or more abnormal measures. Cutpoints at 1 month were highly predictive of abnormal 6-month vision, but the proportion of patients who would be eligible for a trial would be small.

Conclusion

Provided data can be used either for the clinician to counsel patients on expected visual outcome or for designing studies to test therapies that might reduce the amount of permanent optic nerve damage due to optic neuritis in high-risk patients.

### MOG antibody-associated optic neuritis [^116JA63X]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) is a demyelinating disorder, distinct from multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). MOGAD most frequently presents with optic neuritis (MOG-ON), often with characteristic clinical and radiological features. Bilateral involvement, disc swelling clinically and radiologically, and longitudinally extensive optic nerve hyperintensity with associated optic perineuritis on MRI are key characteristics that can help distinguish MOG-ON from optic neuritis due to other aetiologies. The detection of serum MOG immunoglobulin G utilising a live cell-based assay in a patient with a compatible clinical phenotype is highly specific for the diagnosis of MOGAD. This review will highlight the key clinical and radiological features which expedite diagnosis, as well as ancillary investigations such as visual fields, visual evoked potentials and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, which may be less discriminatory. Optical coherence tomography can identify optic nerve swelling acutely, and atrophy chronically, and may transpire to have utility as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker. MOG-ON appears to be largely responsive to corticosteroids, which are often the mainstay of acute management. However, relapses are common in patients in whom follow-up is prolonged, often in the context of early or rapid corticosteroid tapering. Establishing optimal acute therapy, the role of maintenance steroid-sparing immunotherapy for long-term relapse prevention, and identifying predictors of relapsing disease remain key research priorities in MOG-ON.

### Diagnosis and classification of optic neuritis [^115HZV18]. The Lancet: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

There is no consensus regarding the classification of optic neuritis, and precise diagnostic criteria are not available. This reality means that the diagnosis of disorders that have optic neuritis as the first manifestation can be challenging. Accurate diagnosis of optic neuritis at presentation can facilitate the timely treatment of individuals with multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease. Epidemiological data show that, cumulatively, optic neuritis is most frequently caused by many conditions other than multiple sclerosis. Worldwide, the cause and management of optic neuritis varies with geographical location, treatment availability, and ethnic background. We have developed diagnostic criteria for optic neuritis and a classification of optic neuritis subgroups. Our diagnostic criteria are based on clinical features that permit a diagnosis of possible optic neuritis; further paraclinical tests, utilising brain, orbital, and retinal imaging, together with antibody and other protein biomarker data, can lead to a diagnosis of definite optic neuritis. Paraclinical tests can also be applied retrospectively on stored samples and historical brain or retinal scans, which will be useful for future validation studies. Our criteria have the potential to reduce the risk of misdiagnosis, provide information on optic neuritis disease course that can guide future treatment trial design, and enable physicians to judge the likelihood of a need for long-term pharmacological management, which might differ according to optic neuritis subgroups.

### Applying a genetic risk score model to enhance prediction of future multiple sclerosis diagnosis at first presentation with optic neuritis [^114YLUkL]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Optic neuritis (ON) is associated with numerous immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, but 50% patients are ultimately diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS). Differentiating MS-ON from non-MS-ON acutely is challenging but important; non-MS ON often requires urgent immunosuppression to preserve vision. Using data from the United Kingdom Biobank we showed that combining an MS-genetic risk score (GRS) with demographic risk factors (age, sex) significantly improved MS prediction in undifferentiated ON; one standard deviation of MS-GRS increased the Hazard of MS 1.3-fold (95% confidence interval 1.07–1.55, P < 0.01). Participants stratified into quartiles of predicted risk developed incident MS at rates varying from 4% (95%CI 0.5–7%, lowest risk quartile) to 41% (95%CI 33–49%, highest risk quartile). The model replicated across two cohorts (Geisinger, USA, and FinnGen, Finland). This study indicates that a combined model might enhance individual MS risk stratification, paving the way for precision-based ON treatment and earlier MS disease-modifying therapy.

### EFNS guidelines on diagnosis and management of neuromyelitis optica [^116yRtxS]. European Journal of Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, EFNS 2010 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- the predominant course of neuromyelitis optica is characterized by recurrent severe attacks of myelitis and/or uni- or bilateral optic neuritis with incomplete recovery and is up to 10 times more prevalent in women than in men

- age of onset, the late 30s, is approximately 10 years later than the age of onset in multiple sclerosis, but neuromyelitis optica may also occur in children and elderly people

- optic neuritis with severe visual loss and in rapid succession may be indicative of neuromyelitis optica

- optic atrophy is more pronounced than in multiple sclerosis and may form cavitation

- complete transverse myelitis is typical for neuromyelitis optica, and partial transverse myelitis syndromes are more indicative of multiple sclerosis

- expansion of the spinal cord lesion may lead to brainstem symptoms and life-threatening complications.

### Prevalence of pediatric and adult optic neuritis in the United States from 2016 to 2023 [^115UmvPJ]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

What was known before

Data on the prevalence of optic neuritis (ON) is limited with reported rates between 5.5 and 115.3 per 100,000.
The latest and only large prevalence study carried out in the United States encompassed data from 1985 to 1991 and did not include information on race or ethnicity.
Optic neuritis has been shown to be associated with COVID-19 infection but no US prevalence study has examined the rate of optic neuritis since the pandemic.

What this study adds

Optic neuritis most often affects female and Black individuals.
The prevalence of optic neuritis has remained stable in the general population from 2016 to 2023.
The Hispanic or Latino populations and younger populations have demonstrated significant increases in the prevalence of optic neuritis.

### Corticosteroids for treating optic neuritis [^1175dMfv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Optic neuritis is an inflammatory disease of the optic nerve. It usually presents with an abrupt loss of vision and recovery of vision is almost never complete. It occurs more commonly in women than in men. Closely linked in pathogenesis, optic neuritis may be the initial manifestation for multiple sclerosis. In some people, no underlying cause can be found.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of corticosteroids on visual recovery in eyes with acute optic neuritis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 4), MEDLINE (January 1950 to April 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2015), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (January 1982 to April 2015), PubMed (January 1946 to April 2015), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). There were no date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. The metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) was last searched on 6 March 2014. The electronic databases were last searched on 7 April 2015. We also searched reference lists of identified trial reports for additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated systemic corticosteroids, in any form, dose or route of administration, in people with acute optic neuritis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included six RCTs with a total of 750 participants. Each trial was conducted in a different country: Denmark, Germany, India, Japan, UK, and United States. Additionally, we identified two ongoing trials not due to be completed until 2016. Among the six trials included in this review, we judged one to be at high risk of bias. The remaining five trials were judged to be at either low or uncertain risk of biases. Five trials compared only two intervention groups and one trial had a three-arm comparison of oral corticosteroids or intravenous corticosteroids with placebo. Of the five trials with only two intervention groups, two trials compared oral corticosteroids versus placebo, two trials compared intravenous corticosteroids with placebo, and one trial compared intravenous dexamethasone with intravenous methylprednisolone plus oral prednisolone. Three trials evaluating oral corticosteroids used varying doses of corticosteroids versus placebo. In the meta-analyses to assess visual acuity, the risk ratio (RR) was 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.23; participants = 398) at one month; 0.92 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.11; participants = 355) at six months; and 0.93 (95% CI 0.70 to 1.24; participants = 368) at one year. In the meta-analyses of two trials evaluating corticosteroids with total dose greater than 3000 mg administered intravenously, the RR of normal visual acuity (defined as 20/20 Snellen fraction or equivalent) in the intravenous corticosteroids group compared with the placebo group was 1.05 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.26; participants = 346) at six months. The RR of contrast sensitivity in the normal range for the same comparison was 1.11 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.33; participants = 346) at six months follow-up. The RR of normal visual field for this comparison was 1.08 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.21; 346 participants) at six months; and 1.01 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.19; participants = 316) at one year. Four trials reported adverse events primarily related to gastrointestinal symptoms and sleep disturbance; one trial reported minor adverse event of acne.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no conclusive evidence of benefit in terms of recovery to normal visual acuity, visual field or contrast sensitivity six months after initiation with either intravenous or oral corticosteroids at the doses evaluated in trials included in this review.

### Optic neuritis: current challenges in diagnosis and management [^111BXDjC]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The primary aim of this review is to describe the clinical course, salient imaging features, and relevant serological profiles of common optic neuritis (ON) subtypes. Key diagnostic challenges and treatment options will also be discussed.

Recent Findings

ON is a broad term that describes an inflammatory optic nerve injury arising from a variety of potential causes. ON can occur sporadically, however there is particular concern for co-associated central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory syndromes including multiple sclerosis (MS), neuromyelitis optic spectrum disorders (NMOSD), and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody associated disease (MOGAD). The ON subtypes that often herald MS, NMOSD, and MOGAD differ with respect to serological antibody profile and neuroimaging characteristics, yet there is significant overlap in their clinical presentations. A discerning history and thorough examination are critical to rendering the correct diagnosis.

Summary

Optic neuritis subtypes vary with respect to their long-term prognosis and accordingly, require different acute treatment strategies. Moreover, delays in identifying MOGAD, and certainly NMOSD, can be highly detrimental because affected individuals are vulnerable to permanent vision loss and neurologic disability from relapses.

### Optic neuritis [^117TueTw]. The Lancet: Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute optic neuritis is the most common optic neuropathy affecting young adults. Exciting developments have occurred over the past decade in understanding of optic neuritis pathophysiology, and these developments have been translated into treatment trials. In its typical form, optic neuritis presents as an inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the optic nerve, which can be associated with multiple sclerosis. Atypical forms of optic neuritis can occur, either in association with other inflammatory disorders or in isolation. Differential diagnosis includes various optic nerve and retinal disorders. Diagnostic investigations include MRI, visual evoked potentials, and CSF examination. Optical coherence tomography can show retinal axonal loss, which correlates with measures of persistent visual dysfunction. Treatment of typical forms with high-dose corticosteroids shortens the period of acute visual dysfunction but does not affect the final visual outcome. Atypical forms can necessitate prolonged immunosuppressive regimens. Optical coherence tomography and visual evoked potential measures are suitable for detection of neuroaxonal loss and myelin repair after optic neuritis. Clinical trials are underway to identify potential neuroprotective or remyelinating treatments for acutely symptomatic inflammatory demyelinating CNS lesions.

### Hyperacute optic neuritis in a patient with COVID-19 infection and vaccination: a case report [^114na4tm]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Ultimately, this case represents a rare neuro-ophthalmologic complication of COVID-19, and highlights the importance of considering SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients presenting with new onset visual and inflammatory ophthalmologic symptoms. High clinical suspicion is needed, and multidisciplinary evaluation including by the primary, neurology, and ophthalmology teams are required to determine appropriate treatment, often with high dose corticosteroids. Prognosis and visual recovery are typically good.

In conclusion, the patient presented in this study developed a hyperacute optic neuritis with a mild clinical presentation after receiving her COVID-19 booster vaccination. This case is unique in that the patient was exposed to both the virus and the vaccine prior to her presentation. Though it is difficult to know exactly what caused her presentation, it is possible that the initial exposure to the COVID-19 virus primed the patient's immune system, leading to a rapid inflammatory response upon COVID vaccination. As our understanding of COVID-19 continues to grow, likely so will our knowledge of the various neuro-ophthalmological sequalae of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### EFNS guidelines on diagnosis and management of neuromyelitis optica [^115scPQc]. European Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) or Devic's disease is a rare inflammatory and demyelinating autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by recurrent attacks of optic neuritis (ON) and longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM), which is distinct from multiple sclerosis (MS). The guidelines are designed to provide guidance for best clinical practice based on the current state of clinical and scientific knowledge.

Search Strategy

Evidence for this guideline was collected by searches for original articles, case reports and meta-analyses in the MEDLINE and Cochrane databases. In addition, clinical practice guidelines of professional neurological and rheumatological organizations were studied.

Results

Different diagnostic criteria for NMO diagnosis [Wingerchuk et al. Revised NMO criteria, 2006 and Miller et al. National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS) task force criteria, 2008] and features potentially indicative of NMO facilitate the diagnosis. In addition, guidance for the work-up and diagnosis of spatially limited NMO spectrum disorders is provided by the task force. Due to lack of studies fulfilling requirement for the highest levels of evidence, the task force suggests concepts for treatment of acute exacerbations and attack prevention based on expert opinion.

Conclusions

Studies on diagnosis and management of NMO fulfilling requirements for the highest levels of evidence (class I-III rating) are limited, and diagnostic and therapeutic concepts based on expert opinion and consensus of the task force members were assembled for this guideline.

### Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders: still evolving and broadening [^111DcnCU]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is characterized by optic neuritis and myelitis and was first recognized over a century ago. The relation between NMO and multiple sclerosis had been debated for a long time, but after the discovery of NMO-specific aquaporin 4 (AQP4)-antibody, numerous reports have clarified that NMO has clinical, MRI, laboratory, and immunopathological features distinct from multiple sclerosis. Diagnostic criteria for NMO have been revised multiple times, and AQP4 antibody has definitely played a pivotal role in the evolution of the diagnosis of NMO. As brain syndromes also occur in NMO, the term NMO spectrum disorders (NMOSD) to cover the entire clinical spectrum was proposed in the international consensus diagnostic criteria in 2015. Wide recognition of NMOSD has therapeutic implications as well. Some disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) for multiple sclerosis like interferon-beta, fingolimod, and natalizumab are ineffective or exacerbate NMOSD, which is also a striking difference between the two immune-mediated central nervous system (CNS) disorders and emphasize the importance of early differential diagnosis. More recently, first-ever international, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of three candidate drugs for NMOSD have been done.

After the research of AQP4-antibody-seropositive NMOSD had revealed the characteristic findings of the disease, investigators started to focus on AQP4-antibody-seronegative NMOSD. AQP4-antibody-seronegative NMO had been known to have some clinical features distinct from AQP4-antibody-seropositive NMO, and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-antibody was detected in a fraction of the patients.

In this article, the evolution or broadening of the clinical, immunopathological, and therapeutic concepts of NMOSD are reviewed and the challenges ahead are discussed.

### Diagnostic criteria for optic neuritis in the acute and subacute phase: clinical uses and limitations [^112rMHYU]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

A recent international consensus panel proposed diagnostic criteria for optic neuritis and a new classification. We aimed to investigate the clinical relevance of these diagnostic criteria and classification, in a cohort of patients hospitalized for a suspected diagnosis of optic neuritis.

Methods

We included all patients hospitalized between 2017 and 2022 in our tertiary center for (sub)acute loss of visual acuity suggestive of optic neuritis. Clinical and paraclinical criteria obtained within the first 3 months of symptoms were collected, as well as the final diagnosis which could be optic neuritis or non-optic neuritis. We constructed a contingency table comparing diagnoses based on physician experience to those based on the recently proposed criteria. The subtypes of optic neuritis based on the new classification were compared to subtypes based on the clinician experience.

Results

Two hundred fifty-seven patients were included in this study. Prevalence of optic neuritis in our cohort was 88.3%. Sensitivity and specificity of a correct diagnosis using the new criteria were, respectively, 99.5% and 86.7%. The proposed diagnostic criteria overdiagnosed four patients with optic neuritis and missed the diagnosis in one patient. According to the recent classification, idiopathic optic neuritis and clinical isolated syndrome were reclassified mainly as single isolated optic neuritis.

Conclusion

In our specific cohort of patients hospitalized for acute and subacute optic neuropathy highly suspect of optic neuritis, we found that recently proposed diagnostic criteria and classification of optic neuritis are relevant for our clinical practice. Our interpretation of clinical requirement for definite and possible optic neuritis diagnosis might explain our excellent sensitivity and our high percentage of definite optic neuritis, relative to previous publications. The moderate specificity (86.7%) underlines the importance to include all contextual data in consideration for the diagnosis. The simplification of subgroups is useful, but our study highlights the complexity to find the adequate subgroup for seronegative NMOSD.

### Diagnosis and clinical features of common optic neuropathies [^111pkpD7]. The Lancet: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Disorders of the optic nerves (optic neuropathies) are some of the most common causes of visual loss, and can present in isolation or with associated neurological or systemic symptoms and signs. Several optic neuropathies-especially inflammatory optic neuropathies-are associated with neurological disorders and thus are often diagnosed and treated by neurologists. The mechanisms underlying optic neuropathies are diverse and typically manifest with decreased visual acuity, altered colour vision, and abnormal visual field in the affected eye. Diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical history and clinical examination, of which several aspects are particularly important, including the mode of onset of visual loss, the presence of pain with eye movements, the visual acuity, and the retention of colour vision. Advances in optic nerve imaging-particularly retinal digital photography, optical coherence tomography, and MRI techniques-have revolutionised the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with an optic neuropathy. Furthermore, improvement and generalisation of some ancillary tests, such as diagnostic antibodies for neuromyelitis optica, allows better phenotyping of the heterogeneous inflammatory optic neuropathies.

Eye-irAE consensus definitions

For each section, possible symptoms were proposed followed by supportive examination findings. Ancillary tests including laboratory tests and imaging, were divided into required tests, recommended tests and other suggested workup. Based on the symptoms, physical examination, and required ancillary tests, the definite definition was proposed. Probable and possible disease definitions based on all findings including recommended and suggested tests are provided. The treatment indications and recommendations about holding ICIs are also provided.

Diagnostic and management features for Panel A and B diseases are summarized in tables1 2. The online supplemental tables 2–22 provide the complete Delphi process findings and should be the primary source of reference for investigators and clinicians.

Optic nerve disorders

Immune-related optic neuritis

Common: Patients developing optic neuritis (ON) can present with either unilateral or bilateral findings and symptoms, which generally include an acute loss of vision that is commonly associated with pain with eye movements. Signs of optic neuropathy should be present (diminished visual acuity and color vision, an afferent pupillary defect in unilateral disease, and possibly optic disc abnormalities such as edema and/or pallor). It is recommended to obtain visual field (VF) tests early on to aid with diagnosis and serve as a baseline for comparison post-treatment (online supplemental table 2).

MRI of the brain and orbits with and without contrast is required for diagnosis. T1 post-contrast fat-suppressed sequences and T2/short tau inversion recovery sequences are more sensitive for the detection of ON-related signal changes. An MRI brain assists in detecting a more disseminated CNS process.

### Corticosteroids for treating optic neuritis [^1113ExRM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Optic neuritis is an inflammatory disease of the optic nerve. It occurs more commonly in women than in men. Usually presenting with an abrupt loss of vision, recovery of vision is almost never complete. Closely linked in pathogenesis to multiple sclerosis, it may be the initial manifestation for this condition. In certain patients, no underlying cause can be found.

Objectives

To assess the effects of corticosteroids on visual recovery of patients with acute optic neuritis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1950 to February 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to February 2012), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to February 2012), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). There were no date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. The electronic databases were last searched on 21 February 2012. We also searched reference lists of identified trial reports to find additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized trials that evaluated corticosteroids, in any form, dose or route of administration, in people with acute optic neuritis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted the data on methodological quality and outcomes for analysis.

Main Results

We included six randomized trials which included a total of 750 participants. Two trials evaluated low dose oral corticosteroids while one trial evaluated low dose intravenous corticosteroids across two treatment arms and two trials evaluated a higher dose of intravenous corticosteroids. One three-arm trial evaluated low-dose oral corticosteroids and high-dose intravenous corticosteroids against placebo. Trials evaluating oral corticosteroids compared varying doses of corticosteroids with placebo. Hence, we did not conduct a meta-analysis of such trials. In a meta-analysis of trials evaluating corticosteroids with total dose greater than 3000 mg administered intravenously, the relative risk of normal visual acuity with intravenous corticosteroids compared with placebo was 1.06 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.27) at six months and 1.06 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.22) at one year. The risk ratio of normal contrast sensitivity for the same comparison was 1.10 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.32) at six months follow up. We did not conduct a meta-analysis for this outcome at one year follow up since there was substantial statistical heterogeneity. The risk ratio of normal visual field for this comparison was 1.08 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.22) at six months and 1.02 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.20) at one year. Quality of life was assessed and reported in one trial.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no conclusive evidence of benefit in terms of recovery to normal visual acuity, visual field or contrast sensitivity with either intravenous or oral corticosteroids at the doses evaluated in trials included in this review.

### Is the frequency of abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging in isolated optic neuritis related to the prevalence of multiple sclerosis? A global comparison [^111YbruJ]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

The link between optic neuritis and multiple sclerosis is well established, as is the increased risk of conversion to multiple sclerosis, with lesions seen at presentation on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain. One or more asymptomatic lesions were present in 77% of the optic neuritis cohort from London, UK, a higher proportion than that reported in other large cohorts studied elsewhere, where generally lower prevalence rates for multiple sclerosis are also reported. These observations may support the hypothesis that optic neuritis is more likely to be associated with abnormalities on MRI and to be due to multiple sclerosis in geographical regions where multiple sclerosis is more common.

### The atypical faces of optic neuritis: neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease [^111HAU3o]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this article is to provide a review of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD), with a focus on what renders optic neuritis "atypical" in these two conditions. Clinical features, diagnostic criteria, and epidemiology are outlined. Acute treatments for optic neuritis, as well as immunotherapy for NMOSD and MOGAD are discussed.

Recent Findings

Updates in NMOSD and MOGAD are highlighted, with an emphasis on novel work including the new 2023 MOGAD diagnostic criteria, our evolving understanding on the epidemiology of these conditions, and recently FDA-approved NMOSD treatments. Pipeline therapies are also discussed.

Summary

A thorough history and examination, supported by ancillary testing, continues to be the mainstay of optic neuritis diagnosis. Stratifying typical versus atypical optic neuritis is paramount. Within the atypical category, NMOSD and MOGAD are important considerations. Clues can point towards these diagnoses and guide steps for treatment, which is increasingly becoming targeted to individual diseases, as the pathophysiology is different for these disorders.

### Treatment with erythropoietin for patients with optic neuritis: long-term follow-up [^1116GHTf]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Optic neuritis is the most common optic neuropathy in young adults and leads to retinal nerve fiber and ganglion cell layer thinning. It has a close relationship to multiple sclerosis (MS): It is the presenting symptom of MS in about 25% of patients, 70% of patients with MS will experience optic neuritis within the disease course, and 50% of patients with optic neuritis develop MS within 15 years. Visual recovery in optic neuritis is accelerated by high-dose methylprednisolone, but no therapy has been established to improve long-term outcomes. Thus, as in MS, there remains an unmet need of clinical long-term neuroprotection.

The role of the visual system in treatment assessment of neuroinflammatory diseases has been recently reviewed. One candidate neuroprotective agent gaining interest is the human cytokine erythropoietin (EPO). It crosses the blood-brain barrier, and confers anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and neuroprotective effects in preclinical models of autoimmune neuroinflammation. Following ambiguous results from smaller clinical studies, we conducted the TONE trial (treatment of optic neuritis with erythropoietin) to assess retinal ganglion cell neuroprotection. The primary end point was set at 6 months as most atrophy occurs in the first 4 months, plateauing thereafter. Because conversions to MS occur within years after optic neuritis, we scheduled an additional long-term open-label assessment 2 years after treatment, the results of which are reported herein. The primary research question was to assess the safety and efficacy of erythropoietin in improving visual outcomes 2 years after acute optic neuritis.

### Is optic neuritis more benign than other first attacks in multiple sclerosis? [^112vHGv7]. Annals of Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Optic neuritis presentations are thought to have a better prognosis. The aim of our study was to compare conversion to multiple sclerosis on the different topographies of CISs. We prospectively evaluated 320 patients with CISs (123 with optic neuritis, 78 with brainstem syndromes, 89 with spinal cord syndromes, and 30 with other topographies) who were observed for a median of 39 months. Patients underwent brain MRI within 3 months of their first attack and again 12 months later. Conversion to multiple sclerosis determined either clinically or by MRI was evaluated according to topography. Baseline MRI was normal in 49.2% of patients with optic neuritis compared with 24% in brainstem syndromes, 24% in spinal cord syndromes, and 18.5% in other syndromes. Optic neuritis behaved differently from the other CISs for lower conversion to clinically definite multiple sclerosis and smaller proportion of patients fulfilling MRI dissemination in space, time, or both. Nevertheless, when only patients with abnormal cranial MRI results at baseline were selected, no differences for clinical or MRI conversion were found. Optic neuritis has a smaller risk for conversion to multiple sclerosis. Nevertheless, MRI at baseline, not CIS topography, appears to be the crucial issue at multiple sclerosis presentation.

### The optic neuritis treatment trial… [^116jnNG5]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

For lack of a more precise definition, optic neuritis is an acute, noninfectious inflammatory optic neuropathy that predominantly affects young people. By the end of the 19th century, the clinical profile of this disorder and its relationship to multiple sclerosis were well characterized. 1–3 In the subsequent 100 years, numerous reports identifying erroneous etiologies and seemingly successful treatments were published; however, we still lacked the complete clinical profile and an understanding of its natural history. In a 1988 prospective study, Rizzo and Lessell4 established that patients who appeared to have idiopathic optic neuritis have a very high risk of developing clinical MS. The ONTT was conceived to define precisely the clinical profile of patients with optic neuritis, to determine the value of corticosteroid treatment, and to determine the risk of developing MS.

5 With regard to the impact of treatment on vision, it should be noted that unlike many other clinical trials, there was little at stake because it had long been recognized that the vast majority of patients with optic neuritis would enjoy visual improvement even without treatment. Fellow eye abnormalities and the possibility of simultaneous bilateral or occult demyelinating disease involving the prechiasmatic and retrochiasmatic pathways were confirmed. Contrast sensitivity and vision testing in general became commonplace and important outcome measures in many MS treatment trials. Neurologic disability in patients who developed MS after optic neuritis was determined to be mild. The primary goal was to determine whether oral or intravenous steroids altered the visual outcome in patients with acute optic neuritis. It would seem that ONTT definitively answered the question.

Steroids, if given intravenously, accelerated the recovery of vision, but after 1 month there was no significant difference in visual acuity, visual fields, color vision, or contrast sensitivity. In addition, while more than 97% of patients had some type of central vision loss, only 70% had peripheral defects. 38 These visual field studies confirmed that it is unlikely that a specific group of nerve fiber bundles are vulnerable in optic neuritis patients36 and confirmed that automated perimetry alone cannot be used to reliably distinguish optic neuritis from other acute optic neuropathies. The time course of optic neuritis was characterized, confirming that many patients had abrupt onset of seemingly static vision loss while others progressed throughout days. Nearly all patients began to recover at least 1 line of vision by 3 weeks. 41 If recovery does not begin, then an alternative diagnosis should be sought.

### Incidence and causes of overdiagnosis of optic neuritis [^114tiYgE]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Diagnostic error is an important source of medical error. Overdiagnosis of optic neuritis may prompt unnecessary and costly diagnostic tests, procedures, and treatments.

Objective

To assess the incidence of and characterize factors contributing to overdiagnosis of acute optic neuritis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this retrospective clinic-based cross-sectional study of new patient encounters, 122 patients referred for acute optic neuritis at a university-based Midwestern neuro-ophthalmology clinic between January 2014 and October 2016 were studied. Data were analyzed from September 2016 to July 2017.

Interventions

Definite diagnosis was determined by neuro-ophthalmologists. For patients with alterative diagnoses, the Diagnosis Error Evaluation and Research taxonomy tool was applied to categorize the type of diagnostic error.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the primary type of diagnostic error in patients erroneously diagnosed as having optic neuritis. Secondary outcomes included final diagnosis and interventions undergone prior to referral.

Results

A total of 122 patients were referred with acute optic neuritis during the study period; 88 (72.1%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 42.6 (14.0) years. Of these, 49 patients (40.2%; 95% CI, 31.4–49.4) were confirmed to have optic neuritis, and 73 (59.8%; 95% CI, 50.6–68.6) had an alternative diagnosis. The most common alternative diagnoses were headache and eye pain, functional visual loss, and other optic neuropathies, particularly nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. The most common diagnostic error was eliciting or interpreting critical elements of history, which occurred in 24 of 73 patients (33%) with alternative diagnoses. Other common errors included errors weighing or considering alternative diagnoses (23 patients [32%]), errors weighing or interpreting physical examination findings (15 patients [21%]), and misinterpreting diagnostic test results (11 patients [15%]). In patients with alterative diagnoses, 12 (16%) had normal magnetic resonance imaging findings preceding the referral, 12 (16%) had received a lumbar puncture, and 8 (11%) had received unnecessary treatment with intravenous steroids.

Conclusions and Relevance

These data suggest that nearly 60% (95% CI, 50.6–68.6) of patients referred for optic neuritis have an alternative diagnosis, with the most common errors being overreliance on a single item of history and failure to consider alternative diagnoses. Understanding pitfalls leading to overdiagnosis of optic neuritis may improve clinicians' diagnostic process.

### Case for a new corticosteroid treatment trial in optic neuritis: review of updated evidence [^113vQ55u]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Given these limitations, h it is not surprising that more recent non-inferiority trials have refuted the finding that intravenous corticosteroid treatment is superior to oral administration.

The ONTT leaves unanswered at least two vital questions. If steroids are given within some 'critical window' of symptom onset, are they efficacious, in certain types of ON, or even in patients with demyelinating ON? Also if patients with ON of uncertain aetiology at presentation are given steroids promptly (eg, within 48 hours), can blindness be averted? Persisting uncertainty from this landmark trial has resulted in controversy and ongoing practice variation internationally, and the stakes are high. In this opinion piece, a case is made on the need for a new corticosteroid versus placebo treatment trial in ON.

### Vision and vision-related outcome measures in multiple sclerosis [^117EfuoH]. Brain (2015). Low credibility.

Visual outcomes in optic neuritis and multiple sclerosis clinical trials

Secondary and exploratory outcomes in Phase 3 multiple sclerosis clinical trials and post-marketing studies

Several Phase 3 clinical trials and post-marketing studies in multiple sclerosis included visual outcomes as secondary or exploratory outcomes (Table 1). Many of these trials showed that measures such as LCLA and contrast sensitivity were able to detect treatment benefits with sensitivity similar to that of more traditional efficacy measures (clinical relapse rate and confirmed disability worsening). Addition of LCLA to the MSFC may increase sensitivity to changes in disability that are not detected by the original three-component MSFC. Published studies to date have focused on clinically isolated syndromes or relapsing multiple sclerosis. More comprehensive studies of visual dysfunction as secondary outcomes in Phase 3 trials, particularly for progressive multiple sclerosis, are needed.

Visual outcomes in trials of acute optic neuritis

Early trials aimed at improving visual outcome following acute optic neuritis used HCVA as the primary outcome measure. The Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial was important in establishing the role for other outcome measures. First, the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial demonstrated that visual recovery following acute optic neuritis often is incomplete when assessed by measures of low-contrast vision, with Pelli-Robson contrast sensitivity demonstrating the greatest frequency of persistent abnormalities. Reduction in contrast sensitivity was associated with reduced vision-related quality of life and provided the rationale for considering assessment of low-contrast vision as a sensitive visual outcome in multiple sclerosis clinical trials. Another key outcome measure in the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial was automated (Humphrey) visual field testing. This quantitative method remains an important aspect of visual assessment of optic neuritis and other neuro-ophthalmological disorders affecting the optic nerve.

More recently, visual outcomes have been used as the primary measure in Phase 2 clinical trials of putative neuroprotective or reparative agents designed to improve visual recovery following acute optic neuritis (Table 2). A variation on this design is to enrol patients with multiple sclerosis and a prior history of afferent visual system involvement to determine whether there is evidence of repair manifested as improvement in functional or structural measures. Two recent exploratory trials of autologous mesenchymal stem cell infusion used this approach.

### Current options for the treatment of optic neuritis [^111Gqz5Q]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

Optic neuritis can be defined as typical (associated with multiple sclerosis, improving independent of steroid treatment), or atypical (not associated with multiple sclerosis, steroid-dependent improvement). Causes of atypical optic neuritis include connective tissue diseases (eg, lupus), vasculitis, sarcoidosis, or neuromyelitis optica. In this manuscript, updated treatment options for both typical and atypical optic neuritis are reviewed. Conventional treatments, such as corticosteroids, therapeutic plasma exchange, and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy are all discussed with commentary regarding evidence-based outcomes. Less commonly used treatments and novel purported therapies for optic neuritis are also reviewed. Special scenarios in the treatment of optic neuritis - pediatric optic neuritis, acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis, and optic neuritis occurring during pregnancy - are specifically examined.

### Re-evaluating the treatment of acute optic neuritis [^115saHnK]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Current treatment of acute optic neuritis

Corticosteroids

In 1961, Miller and colleagues demonstrated that patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), who were treated with corticotrophin recovered more quickly and completely from acute relapses than did patients treated with saline. A subsequent study of acute optic neuritis (AON) by Rawson and Liversedgedemonstrated that a similar hastening of visual recovery was noted after acute retrobulbar neuritis; however, no significant difference between visual outcomes could be determined 12 months after the inception of visual symptoms. The emergence of intravenous methylprednisolone for the treatment of a range of immune-mediated disorders prompted its application for the treatment of acute MS exacerbations, including AON, whereby early benefits were noted regarding the course of clinical recovery.

In 1992, the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT) provided the first comprehensive examination of the benefits of steroid therapy for AON in a large and representative patient cohort. In the ONTT, patients were randomised to receive placebo, oral (low-dose) prednisone (1 mg/kg/day for 14 days) or high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (250 mg 4 times daily for 3 days), followed by oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day for 11 days). At 6 months, colour vision and contrast sensitivity significantly improved in the methylprednisolone arm; however, after 1 year, there was no significant difference between treated and untreated patients in any functional outcomes. Intravenous methylprednisolone was found to accelerate the rate of visual recovery over the first 15 days. Objective measures of optic nerve or retinal architecture were not available at the time of the ONTT; however, a subsequent study showed no effect of corticosteroids on optic nerve atrophy.

### How far should I manage acute optic neuritis as an ophthalmologist? A United Kingdom perspective [^114C4rgY]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Optic neuritis (ON) is an inflammation of or around the optic nerve, frequently caused by infectious or immune-mediated inflammatory disorders. In the UK, its strongest association is with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), though the combined prevalence of other associated infectious and immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (I-IMID) is similar to that of MS-ON. Prompt identification and understanding of ON's underlying cause informs tailored management and prognosis. Several IMIDs linked to ON, such as aquaporin-4 antibody-associated optic neuritis (AQP4-ON), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated optic neuritis (MOG-ON), and neuro-sarcoidosis, show remarkable response to corticosteroid treatment. Therefore, urgent investigation and treatment are crucial in cases 'atypical' for MS-ON. Following the 1992 Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial, clinical practice has evolved, with short-course high-dose corticosteroids considered safe and effective for most people. Timely recognition of patients who could benefit is critical to avoid irreversible vision loss. This review provides a practical guide and a summary of evidence on the investigation and management of acute optic neuritis. It reflects the knowledge and limitations of current evidence, framed through the neuro-ophthalmic perspective of clinical practice at multiple UK academic centres.

### Acute optic neuritis: unmet clinical needs and model for new therapies [^114NcD6b]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Although these "nonconventional" MRI techniques hold promise as a tool to investigate underlying processes and assess recovery in ON, there are substantial challenges to widespread use. For example, the acquisition times are frequently longer than is practical for routine human studies, and imaging is complicated by motion artifacts caused by moving the eye or head. In addition, there is no consensus on sequences and protocols for their application in ON. These factors have limited widespread adoption of these approaches and have likely contributed to the inconsistencies in findings. Thus, further technological improvements and standardization of techniques for imaging of ON lesions will be required before they can be considered as reliable measures of outcomes in clinical trials.

### MOG antibody-associated optic neuritis [^114FpPoU]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

MOG-ON is an increasingly recognised condition affecting both children and adults that deserves specific attention because of its distinction from ON associated with MS and NMOSD, and the therapeutic and prognostic implications of an early and accurate diagnosis. Characteristic clinical and radiological features can expedite diagnosis and facilitate initiation of appropriate therapeutic pathways. Confirmation of the diagnosis ideally relies on the detection of specific serum MOG IgG antibodies on a live cell-based assay, in association with a typical clinical phenotype. Although a relapsing disease course is common, and outcomes with treatment can be favourable, residual disability may be present. Future research priorities include better elucidating the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms in this condition, identifying prognostic biomarkers, and establishing optimal and well-tolerated long-term therapeutic strategies.

### Long-term outcomes in patients presenting with optic neuritis: analyses of the MSBase registry [^115sdzMj]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Short-term outcomes of optic neuritis (ON) have been well characterized. Limited data exists on longer-term visual outcomes in patients who present with ON. The large MSBase registry allows for characterization of long-term visual outcomes after ON.

Methods

Via the MSBase Registry, data on patients from 41 centers was collected during routine clinical and research visits. Physical and visual disability were measured using the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and the visual function score (VFS). Inclusion criteria for this analysis included age ≥ 18 years, clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), ON-onset, baseline visit within 6 months of onset, and at least one follow-up visit. Survival analysis was used to evaluate the association of disease-modifying treatment with time to conversion to clinically definite MS or sustained EDSS/VFS progression.

Results

Data from 60,933 patients were obtained from the MSBase registry in July 2019. Of these, 1317 patients met inclusion criteria; 935 were treated at some point in disease course, while 382 were never treated. At baseline, mean age was 32.3 ± 8.8 years, 74% were female, median EDSS was 2 (IQR 1–2), and median VFS was 1 (IQR 0–2). Median follow-up time was 5.2 years (IQR 2.4–9.3). Treatment was associated with reduced risk and delayed conversion to clinically definite MS (HR = 0.70, p < 0.001), sustained EDSS progression (HR = 0.46, p < 0.0001) and sustained VFS (HR = 0.41, p < 0.001) progression.

Conclusions

In the MSBase cohort, treatment after ON was associated with better visual and neurological outcomes compared to no treatment. These results support early treatment for patients presenting with ON as the first manifestation of MS.

### Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders: still evolving and broadening [^115CmneP]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

TIME TO RECONSIDER THE CONCEPT OF NEUROMYELITIS OPTICA SPECTRUM DISORDERS?

As aforementioned, early reports of NMO probably included MOG-antibody-seropositive NMO. As MOG-antibody-associated disease has a unique clinical spectrum, which is somewhat different from that of AQP4-antibody-seropositive NMOSD. More specifically, single site disease like LETM and severe/bilateral/recurrent optic neuritis and multiple site/extensive diseases, such as ADEM/MDEM and cerebral cortical encephalitis (some of them are MOG-antibody-seropositive) do not fit in the 2015 diagnostic criteria of NMOSD. Also, it is indispensable to study the clinical and immunopathological features of double seronegative NMOSD to see if we can extract another unique subgroup of patients defined by a biomarker.

On the basis of current understanding of AQP4-antibody-seronegative and -seronegative NMOSD, now may be the time to reconsider the concept (or definition) of NMOSD from scratch.

### Vision and vision-related outcome measures in multiple sclerosis [^116W8RkR]. Brain (2015). Low credibility.

Optic neuritis associated with multiple sclerosis

In adults, optic neuritis typically is unilateral, with visual loss evolving over several days, reaching a nadir within 2 weeks, and frequently associated with peri-orbital pain exacerbated by eye movements. Reduction in HCVA ranges from minimal to severe, although complete loss (no light perception) is uncommon. In addition to decreased visual acuity resulting from central depression of the visual field, examination characteristically demonstrates a relative afferent pupillary defect in the affected eye or, in the case of bilateral optic neuritis, the more severely affected eye. Typically, colour vision and LCLA are more severely affected than is HCVA. In two-thirds of adult patients with optic neuritis, the optic disc appears normal on direct ophthalmoscopy during the acute phase; however, OCT reveals that many of these affected eyes have subclinical disc oedema. When visible, optic disc swelling typically is mild, without evidence of haemorrhages or macular exudates. Such atypical findings indicate low risk for subsequent development of clinically definite multiple sclerosis, especially if the brain MRI is normal.

Improvement of vision after acute optic neuritis typically begins within 1 month following onset of visual symptoms. While patients with optic neuritis often are said to have 'good recovery', with 95% of eyes achieving 20/40 or better HCVA, more sensitive measures indicate that visual recovery often is incomplete. Most patients have persistent deficits in vision-related quality of life 5–8 years later, likely related to the substantial thinning of RNFL and GCL + IPL detectable by OCT. The median loss of peripapillary RNFL is ∼20–40%, with most thinning occurring by 3 months and the full extent by 6 months. The 10–15% of patients with severe persistent visual deficits tend to have more severe RNFL loss.

Although acute optic neuritis is often treated with a short course of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone, which may speed visual recovery, there are no treatments that improve visual outcomes in general. Two small, uncontrolled studies of patients with optic neuritis and poor vision in spite of steroid therapy reported visual improvement in 70% of cases following a course of plasma exchange. Conflicting outcomes were reported in two trials investigating intravenous immunoglobulin for optic neuritis with poor visual recovery. This unmet need for treatment of optic neuritis itself, the wide range of available functional measures, and the structure-function correlations afforded by OCT make acute optic neuritis an attractive model system to test new therapies for neuroprotection and repair in multiple sclerosis.

### The natural history of recurrent optic neuritis… [^115ia2wB]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Background Optic neuritis may occur in isolation or may herald multiple sclerosis or neuromyelitis optica. Occasionally, ON may recur many times without intervening evidence of dissemination in space. Objective To define the clinical course and prognosis of patients with recurrent ON. Conclusions Patients with rapid succession of severe ON events are more likely to develop a generalized demyelinating disease. Patients with NMO had a worse visual outcome. Optic neuritis is an inflammatory demyelinating syndrome of the central nervous system. It may occur in isolation or as part of multiple sclerosis or neuromyelitis optica. 1 It results in loss of vision and may be associated with eye pain and color vision and visual field deficits and phosphenes. It can affect either or both eyes, sequentially or simultaneously.

Optic neuritis is considered idiopathic when symptoms develop across hours to days and remit spontaneously following corticosteroid therapy and when various toxic, nutritional, metabolic, vascular, hereditary, infectious, infiltrative, autoimmune, or compressive etiologies have been excluded.
2. Some patients experience recurrent ON without events referable to other parts of the central nervous system. Recurrent ON has been classified as MS in some studies3, 4 but not in others. 2 Classification of recurrent ON contributes to the controversy about the risk of developing MS following ON episodes. 3, 4 By strict application of MS criteria, including criteria of McDonald et al, 5 recurrent ON affecting both optic nerves could be considered MS. However, if recurrent ON were not considered to be MS by definition, the frequency with which it would herald MS or NMO is unknown. To characterize the final visual outcome, we added the last known individual visual scores of both eyes.

We collected data about each ON event, including date of onset, laterality, severity, the presence of afferent pupillary defect and eye pain; acute and preventive treatment; and response to treatment. We determined whether the follow-up data satisfied criteria for MS5 or NMO.

1. The severity of the first event was worse in NMO converters, which corresponds with previous observations of more severe visual loss in NMO. 1 In NMO converters, subsequent events tended to occur earlier than in MS converters or nonconverters. The annualized ON event rate underlines that a rapid succession of ON episodes is predictive of NMO conversion.

### Anterior optic pathway pathology in CNS demyelinating diseases [^1111hUMd]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anterior optic pathway involvement is a common feature in inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the CNS, such as multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis spectrum disorders. In multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis is the presenting symptom in 25% and affects up to 70% throughout their disease course. Moreover, subclinical optic nerve demyelination is increasingly frequent with longer disease duration, being invariably present at end-stage disease. In neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, optic neuritis is the presenting symptom in 50% of patients and is typically more severe and longitudinally extensive compared with multiple sclerosis and is rarely subclinical. Extensive anterior optic pathway involvement in neuromyelitis optica has been observed with involvement of the intracranial portion of the optic nerve, the chiasm and the optic tract being seen in the majority.

In the last decade, the introduction of optical coherence tomography into clinical practice has cast light onto the nature of optic pathway involvement in multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders. In multiple sclerosis, progressive neuro-retinal atrophy suggestive of neurodegeneration is a characteristic feature, occurs in the absence of a history or subclinical evidence of optic neuritis and associates with measures of disease activity, physical and cognitive disabilityand atrophy in the brain and spinal cord. Progressive neuro-retinal atrophy and reduced integrity of the optic pathway have also been observed in neuromyelitis optica, even in patients who never experienced optic neuritis. These findings challenge the plaque-centred view of anterior optic pathway degeneration in these inflammatory demyelinating diseases.

### Incidence and causes of overdiagnosis of optic neuritis… [^111QKQjQ]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Optic neuritis is an acute inflammatory demyelinating optic neuropathy that can occur in isolation or herald other underlying diseases, such as multiple sclerosis or neuromyelitis optica. 1–8 Optic neuritis classically presents with acute to subacute central visual loss, pain with eye movements, and dyschromatopsia. Diagnosis is based on presenting symptoms, time course, and examination findings consistent with optic neuropathy, such as abnormal visual acuity, visual fields, color vision, or the presence of a new relative afferent pupillary defect. 1–8 Diagnosis may be supported by neuroimaging studies, such as. Definite diagnosis of optic neuritis was extracted from medical records and had been determined by a neuro-ophthalmologist using history, a structured clinical examination, visual fields, funduscopy, and MRI when available or clinically indicated.

Table 3 details the alternative diagnoses assigned to patients who were not diagnosed as having optic neuritis. The most common alternative diagnosis was primary headache disorder with associated eye pain and/or visual symptoms. Other common alternative diagnoses included functional visual loss; other optic neuropathies, in particular nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy; and retinopathies, such as neuroretinitis, central retinal artery occlusion, or branch retinal artery occlusion. While symptoms of eye pain and pain with eye movements should raise concern for optic neuritis, eye pain, particularly without associated visual loss, may also be caused by a primary headache disorder. 26, 27 Pain with eye movements is one nonspecific clinical feature of optic neuritis and should not be overweighed. The time course of pain and visual loss is particularly important to achieving a correct diagnosis.

Several patients in our study described discrete, stereotyped episodes of visual loss most consistent with migraine aura, a pattern that would be extraordinarily unusual for optic neuritis. Importantly, an APD was one of the more consistent examination findings that correlated with a true diagnosis of optic neuritis. The lack of an APD strongly argues against a diagnosis of acute optic neuritis unless there is bilateral optic nerve involvement.

### Does time equal vision in the acute treatment of a cohort of AQP4 and MOG optic neuritis? [^113hJGat]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Optic neuritis (ON) is a common inflammation of the optic nerve associated with numerous autoimmune conditions, including MS, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSDs), chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuritis (CRION), and autoimmune optic neuritis (AON).NMOSD is further subdivided into aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody–positive disease and a seronegative form. A subset of patients with ON have serum IgG autoantibodies to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). The protein and cellular targets of these 2 antibodies are distinct in that AQP4 is expressed on astrocytes and retinal Müller cells, whereas MOG is expressed by oligodendrocytes. Despite these pathogenic differences, ON attacks in both conditions are treated similarly with high-dose corticosteroids and/or plasma exchange (PE). Although some patients with MOG ab disease meet the 2015 criteria for NMOSD, there is an ongoing debate as to whether MOG ab-positive patients should receive a diagnosis of NMOSD. Although a significant number of MOG ab-positive patients have a relapsing course leading to accumulative disability, others do not relapse; thus, their inclusion together with other AQP4-seronegative patients with NMOSD could compromise the study of therapeutic candidates in NMOSD.

Acute treatment of ON in MS was shaped by the North American Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT), which showed that IV methylprednisolone (IVMP) accelerates recovery but does not affect the final visual outcome.

However, the clinical course of ON in NMOSD and in MOG ab-positive patients differs from MS and is typically steroid responsive or dependent. Disability from both AQP4 and MOG-ON is accumulated by poor recovery from attacks. The recommended acute treatment options in antibody-mediated ON are high-dose IVMP, PE, and immunoadsorption.

Historically, NMOSD-ON has been associated with a poor visual outcome. Studies have correlated the visual outcome of AQP4-ON attacks with the severity of visual loss at presentation, type of antibody, and with the use of additional PE. Visual disability has been shown to be accrued with each attack, resulting in poor quality of life. Three previous studies focused on the effect of timing of IVMP on visual outcome. These studies included several subtypes of ON, with only a few patients with NMOSD and no MOG-positive patients.

### Association of individual-level factors with visual outcomes in optic neuritis: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^112SEUHe]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Using corticosteroids to treat acute demyelinating optic neuritis has been identified as an area for shared decision-making. However, no analysis exists to support personalized shared decision-making that considers long- and short-term treatment benefits.

Objective

To develop models of individual-level visual outcomes for patients with optic neuritis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This secondary analysis of the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT), a randomized clinical trial, was performed at 14 academic eye centers and 1 large community eye center. Adults aged 18 to 46 years with incident acute unilateral optic neuritis within 8 days of vision loss onset were included. Data were collected from July 1988 to June 1991, downloaded on October 15, 2018, and analyzed from January 24, 2019, to February 20, 2020, using multivariable linear regression modeling.

Exposures

Intravenous corticosteroids vs placebo.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Visual acuity (VA) at 1 year. Secondary outcomes were 1-year contrast sensitivity (CS) and VA and CS at 15 and 30 days. Independent variables included age, sex, race, multiple sclerosis status, optic neuritis episodes in the fellow eye, vision symptoms (days), pain, optic disc swelling, viral illness, treatment group, and baseline VA or CS.

Results

Of the 455 participants, median age was 31.8 (interquartile range [IQR], 26.3–37.0) years; 350 (76.9%) were women; and 388 (85.3%) were white. For 410 participants (90.1%) with 1-year outcomes, median VA improved from 20/66 (IQR, 20/28–20/630) at enrollment to 20/17 (IQR, 20/14–20/21) at 1 year. Baseline VA was the primary variable associated with 1-year VA (regression coefficient, 0.056 [95% CI, 0.008–0.103]; p = 0.02) if baseline VA was better than count fingers (CF). At 15 days, baseline VA and treatment status were associated with VA in those participants with baseline VA better than CF (regression coefficient, 0.305 [95% CI, 0.231–0.380]; F = 9.42; P < .001). However, the difference of medians (20/18 [95% CI, 20/17–20/19] with intravenous corticosteroids vs 20/23 [95% CI, 20/21–20/26] with placebo) was small for the median VA (20/66) in the trial. Treatment was not associated with 15-day or 1-year VA in participants with baseline VA of CF or worse.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, long-term VA was associated with severity of baseline vision loss. Early benefits with intravenous corticosteroid treatment were limited to participants with baseline VA better than CF. However, the early, temporary benefit of intravenous corticosteroids is of questionable clinical significance and should be weighed against potential harms.

Aims

The aim of this study is to provide a clinical update on optic neuritis (ON), its association with multiple sclerosis (MS), and neuromyelitis optica (NMO).

Methods

This study included a PubMed review of the literature written in the English language.

Results

ON in adults is typically idiopathic or demyelinating, and is characterised by unilateral, subacute, painful loss of vision that is not associated with any systemic or other neurological symptoms. Demyelinating ON is associated with MS, and we review the key studies of ON including the ON treatment trial and several other MS treatment trials and NMO.

Conclusion

Acute demyelinating ON can occur in isolation or be associated with MS. Typical ON does not require additional evaluation other than cranial magnetic resonance imaging. NMO is likely a separate disorder from MS and the ON in NMO has a different treatment and prognosis.

Methodology

The authors conducted an English language search using Pubmed from the years 1964 to 2010 using the search terms 'ON', 'MS' and 'NMO'. The authors included original articles, review articles, and case reports, which revealed new aspects as far as epidemiology, histopathology, clinical manifestations, imaging, genetics, and treatment of ON. Titles were reviewed for topicality and full references were obtained. Letters to the editor, unpublished work, and abstracts were not included in this review.

### Pediatric optic neuritis [^114K3niq]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Optic neuritis (ON) is a common presenting symptom in pediatric CNS demyelinating disorders and may be associated with dramatic visual loss. Knowledge regarding clinical presentation, associated diseases, therapy, and outcomes in ON in children has grown over the past decade. These studies have shown that younger children (< 10 years of age) are more likely to present with bilateral ON and older children with unilateral ON. Furthermore, studies focusing on visual recovery have shown excellent recovery of high-contrast visual acuity in the majority of children, but functional and structural studies have shown evidence of irreversible injury and functional decline after ON in children. Although randomized controlled treatment trials have not been performed in children and adolescents with ON, standard of care suggests that the use of high-dose pulse steroids is safe and likely effective. This article reviews current knowledge about the clinical presentation and management of pediatric ON, with attention to associated syndromes and evaluative tools that may inform diagnosis and interventions.

### Applying a genetic risk score model to enhance prediction of future multiple sclerosis diagnosis at first presentation with optic neuritis [^113ut1h7]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Optic neuritis (ON) presents most frequently in young adults with subacute uni- or bilateral vision loss. It is a rare but treatable cause of blindness. The incidence of ON has been stable over decades, and varies by latitude, with a population-based incidence of 3.7 to 5.1 per 100k person-years in the United Kingdom (UK) and United States of America (USA), respectively. Approximately two-thirds are undifferentiated at presentation with the remainder having either a prior diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) or preceding infectious or immune-mediated inflammatory disease (I-IMID). By five years of follow-up, approximately 20% of undifferentiated ON cases are diagnosed with MS, compared to 0.1% controls (adjusted Hazard Ratio [aHR] 285, P < 0.001). By 15 years, up to 50% of all ON cases, excluding those with bilateral presentation, are diagnosed with MS.

Importantly, ON ultimately associated with diagnosis of MS (MS-ON), including Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS, consisting of ON plus magnetic resonance imaging features of demyelination at presentation), has different management and prognosis to non-MS-associated ON. In MS-ON, vision usually recovers spontaneously to near-baseline over 3 months. Trial evidence indicates an equivocal role for corticosteroid therapy –, although there may be a role for hyperacute corticosteroid therapy. Non-MS ON may be associated with subsequent diagnosis of corticosteroid-responsive diseases including sarcoidosis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), and vasculitides. In marked contrast to MS-ON, axonal injury can be swift and vision loss irreversible, with significant impacts on patients' lives. Clinicians managing acute undifferentiated ON face a challenging and time-critical decision while awaiting diagnostic investigations: whether or not to initiate potentially sight-saving corticosteroid therapy which risks serious adverse effects. There is an unmet clinical need for a tool to improve acute risk stratification, differentiating those at low future MS risk, who may benefit from urgent corticosteroids, from those at high future MS risk, who may benefit from earlier disease-modifying therapy to reduce long-term neurological disability.

### Association of individual-level factors with visual outcomes in optic neuritis: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^116mVWt1]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT) was a landmark randomized clinical trial showing that treatment with corticosteroids does not improve long-term visual outcomes for patients with acute demyelinating typical optic neuritis but may hasten visual recovery in the first 2 weeks. Given the lack of a robust treatment effect with corticosteroids, the ONTT Study Group and clinical practice guidelines called for shared decision-making between patients and physicians when deciding whether to use corticosteroids for acute neuritis. Since the publication of the ONTT findings, the diagnosis of typical optic neuritis remains unchanged, and no additional short-term treatments have emerged. Therefore, the ONTT provides the only actionable data to date for counseling patients on the benefits of corticosteroids.

Despite the lack of corticosteroid effect on long-term outcomes, more than 90% of neurologists report treating patients with optic neuritis with corticosteroids. Patient preference was the least cited reason for treatment, suggesting shared decision-making is not occurring. One barrier to the application of shared decision-making is that clinicians do not have information that considers individual characteristics, such as severity of the visual deficit, and how those individual characteristics might influence long-term recovery or likelihood to experience a hastened recovery. Personalizing clinical trial information is a strategy used to address this barrier and ultimately promote informed, shared decision-making. Currently, we know of no studies that allow clinicians to provide personalized information regarding visual recovery and short-term benefit with corticosteroids to patients with optic neuritis.

The purpose of our study was to perform a multivariable, risk-stratified analysis of ONTT data to assess visual function over time and at 1 year at the individual level. We hypothesized that several baseline factors would be associated with vision outcomes over time. Ultimately, this information could support shared decision-making.

### Optic neuritis and multiple sclerosis [^116euimx]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To discuss recent neuro-ophthalmic advances relevant to the management of optic neuritis and multiple sclerosis.

Recent Findings

Major advances have occurred in the fields of autoimmunity in optic neuritis, and in imaging the retinal nerve fibre layer in both optic neuritis and multiple sclerosis.

Summary

A proportion of cases of optic neuritis occur in patients who do not develop multiple sclerosis; the optic neuritis may be monophasic illness or recurrent. In many recurrent cases who also have myelitis (neuromyelitis optica) a serum antibody to aquaporin-4 water channels has been detected. It remains to be seen how many cases of recurrent non-multiple sclerosis optic neuritis without myelitis will be shown to be associated with this autoantibody. Optical coherence tomography has been shown to detect axonal loss in the retina in both recovered optic neuritis and in multiple sclerosis without a past history of optic neuritis. This is not a novel observation, but the technique may provide a quantitative measure of the loss of optic nerve axons following the acute insult in optic neuritis, and chronically in primary and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. This is of particular interest in view of the evidence that it is axonal loss, rather than demyelination with preservation of axons, that underlies disability in multiple sclerosis.

### Permeability of the blood-brain barrier predicts conversion from optic neuritis to multiple sclerosis [^113tkRsP]. Brain (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Optic neuritis is an acute multi-aetiological inflammatory condition affecting the optic nerve causing retro-orbital pain and visual loss. Optic neuritis is highly associated with multiple sclerosis, and 50% of cases develop multiple sclerosis after 15 years. MRI currently provides one of the best risk stratification markers for later conversion to multiple sclerosis, as 72% of cases having more than one multiple sclerosis-specific white matter lesion at baseline subsequently develop multiple sclerosis, as opposed to 25% with no multiple sclerosis-specific lesions at baseline. We have recently published data showing that patients with multiple sclerosis have a higher permeability of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) in the normal-appearing white matter when compared to healthy control subjects, and furthermore, when patients had recently experienced a clinical relapse the permeability increased significantly.

The optic nerve is considered a part of the CNS as it is derived from an out-pouching of the diencephalon during embryonic development. As a consequence of this it shares many histological characteristics with the diencephalon, i.e. myelination is produced by oligodendrocytes, it is ensheathed by three meningeal layers and has a BBB, etc. During acute optic neuritis, a common MRI finding is contrast enhancement of the optic nerve, indicative of BBB breakdown. However, little is known of the behaviour of the BBB in the normal-appearing tissue of the telencephalon during the acute stages of optic neuritis. Therefore, we wanted to investigate whether patients with optic neuritis also have changes of the BBB permeability in normal-appearing white matter normal as we have seen in patients with multiple sclerosis. In addition, we wanted to investigate if a leakier BBB in these patients could be related to other measures of neuroinflammation, and whether the degree of leakiness could be related to the likelihood of developing multiple sclerosis within a period of 2 years. The BBB permeability was investigated by use of dynamic contrast-enhanced T 1 -weighted MRI (DCE-MRI).

### Trends in optic neuritis incidence and prevalence in the UK and association with systemic and neurologic disease [^115GQGFa]. JAMA Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Epidemiologic data on optic neuritis (ON) incidence and associations with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) are sparse.

Objective

To estimate 22-year trends in ON prevalence and incidence and association with IMIDs in the United Kingdom.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study analyzed data from The Health Improvement Network from January 1, 1995, to September 1, 2019. The study included 10 937 511 patients 1 year or older with 75.2 million person-years' follow-up. Annual ON incidence rates were estimated yearly (January 1, 1997, to December 31, 2018), and annual ON prevalence was estimated by performing sequential cross-sectional studies on data collected on January 1 each year for the same period. Data for 1995, 1996, and 2019 were excluded as incomplete. Risk factors for ON were explored in a cohort analysis from January 1, 1997, to December 31, 2018. Matched case-control and retrospective cohort studies were performed using data from January 1, 1995, to September 1, 2019, to explore the odds of antecedent diagnosis and hazard of incident diagnosis of 66 IMIDs in patients compared with controls.

Exposures

Optic neuritis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Annual point prevalence and incidence rates of ON, adjusted incident rate ratios (IRRs) for risk factors, and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for 66 IMIDs.

Results

A total of 10 937 511 patients (median [IQR] age at cohort entry, 32.6 [18.0–50.4] years; 5 571 282 [50.9%] female) were studied. A total of 1962 of 2826 patients (69.4%) with incident ON were female and 1192 of 1290 92.4%) were White, with a mean (SD) age of 35.6 (15.6) years. Overall incidence across 22 years was stable at 3.7 (95% CI, 3.6–3.9) per 100 000 person-years. Annual point prevalence (per 100 000 population) increased with database maturity, from 69.3 (95% CI, 57.2–81.3) in 1997 to 114.8 (95% CI, 111.0–118.6) in 2018. The highest risk of incident ON was associated with female sex, obesity, reproductive age, smoking, and residence at higher latitude, with significantly lower risk in South Asian or mixed race/ethnicity compared with White people. Patients with ON had significantly higher odds of prior multiple sclerosis (MS) (OR,98.22; 95% CI, 65.40–147.52), syphilis (OR,5.76; 95% CI, 1.39–23.96), Mycoplasma (OR,3.90; 95% CI, 1.09–13.93), vasculitis (OR,3.70; 95% CI, 1.68–8.15), sarcoidosis (OR,2.50; 95% CI, 1.21–5.18), Epstein-Barr virus (OR,2.29; 95% CI, 1.80–2.92), Crohn disease (OR,1.97; 95% CI, 1.13–3.43), and psoriasis (OR,1.28; 95% CI, 1.03–1.58). Patients with ON had a significantly higher hazard of incident MS (HR,284.97; 95% CI, 167.85–483.81), Behçet disease (HR,17.39; 95% CI, 1.55–195.53), sarcoidosis (HR,14.80; 95% CI, 4.86–45.08), vasculitis (HR,4.89; 95% CI, 1.82–13.10), Sjögren syndrome (HR,3.48; 95% CI, 1.38–8.76), and herpetic infection (HR,1.68; 95% CI, 1.24–2.28).

Conclusions and Relevance

The UK incidence of ON is stable. Even though predominantly associated with MS, ON has numerous other associations with IMIDs. Although individually rare, together these associations outnumber MS-associated ON and typically require urgent management to preserve sight.

### Acute optic neuritis: unmet clinical needs and model for new therapies [^114hLrPn]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

It is now clear that recovery from ON is frequently incomplete, which adversely affects the QOL of patients. In addition, there remain considerable gaps with respect to understanding, assessing, and treating this disease to prevent long-term deficits. Nevertheless, ongoing work holds promise for all of these areas. The application of newer technologies continues to provide new insight into the underlying disease processes and increased appreciation of the injury that occurs following ON. The development of these new tools may increase the ability to detect meaningful changes in vision with therapeutic intervention and study results suggest that timing is critical. Development of guidelines to ensure consistency in their application should also improve interpretation of findings and thereby improve the quality of assessments. Finally, several therapies have shown promise in preclinical and early clinical testing. Therefore, there is reason to be optimistic that strategies may soon be identified to improve the prognosis for patients with ON. Given the relationship between ON and MS, it seems likely that any such developments for ON may have substantial implications for understanding, assessing, and treating MS as well.

### Acute onset blindness: a case of optic neuritis and review of childhood optic neuritis [^111VVPS7]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Optic neuritis (ON) is an acquired disorder of the optic nerve due to inflammation, demyelination or degeneration. We report a child who presented with acute onset bilateral visual loss who, following a diagnosis of ON, was treated and had excellent visual recovery. Paediatric ON is considered to be different clinical entity to adult ON. Although in children ON is usually parainfectious or postinfectious, it can be the first presenting feature of multiple sclerosis or neuromyelitis optica spectrum disease. In this paper, we discuss the literature on treatment of ON and prediction of risk of recurrence.

### Ehrlichiosis optic neuritis [^111fUww4]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe a case of ehrlichiosis optic neuritis.

Design

Single observational case report.

Methods

A 41-year-old woman with symptoms and clinical and imaging signs consistent with optic neuritis presented to a tertiary care academic center for comprehensive neuro-ophthalmic evaluation. Main outcome measures included preoptic and postoptic neuritis polyvalent ehrlichiosis titers and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of orbits with gadolinium.

Results

Ehrlichiosis titers drawn 11 days before onset of eye symptoms were negative. Titers drawn 7 days after symptoms began were positive. The optic nerve enhanced with gadolinium on MRI.

Conclusions

Ehrlichiosis can cause optic neuritis and should be considered in patients with optic neuritis after a febrile, flu-like illness in an endemic area.

### Ophthalmic diagnoses in the ED: optic neuritis [^1123F2y2]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Optic neuritis is the most common cause of decreased vision due to optic nerve dysfunction in patients who are 20 to 40 years of age. Optic neuritis, or inflammation of the optic nerve, is primarily due to idiopathic demyelination. Demyelinative lesions seen in optic neuritis are not unlike those seen in plaque associated with multiple sclerosis. In fact, acute inflammatory demyelination of the optic nerve commonly occurs as an initial manifestation of multiple sclerosis. Key features of optic neuritis include a vision loss occurring over 1 to 10 days, color vision impairment, eye pain with motility, and an afferent pupillary defect. This significant diagnosis can be challenging to an emergency physician as it is relatively infrequently observed.

### Evolving management of optic neuritis and multiple sclerosis [^114BggdG]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To review the relation of optic neuritis to multiple sclerosis (MS) and the indications, modalities, and results of therapy for optic neuritis, for both visual and general neurologic function.

Design

Literature review and author's experience.

Methods

Analysis of both laboratory and clinical evidence supporting the use of corticosteroids, immunomodulation agents, and other modalities in the treatment of optic neuritis and MS.

Results

Although treatment of optic neuritis with corticosteroids may hasten visual recovery to a minor degree, it has no long-term beneficial effect on visual outcome. Optic neuritis is frequently the initial manifestation of multiple sclerosis. The risk of later development of clinically definite MS (CDMS) correlates with white matter demyelinative lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The role of corticosteroid therapy alone in reducing the risk of subsequent MS is unclear, but recent studies suggest that the combination of immunomodulation agents (IMAs) and corticosteroids significantly reduces the later development of MS. Current research indicates that, contrary to previous doctrine, axonal damage is an early finding in MS.

Conclusions

The risk of MS after optic neuritis may be predicted. The use of corticosteroids and IMAs, particularly in those at substantial risk, reduces the frequency and severity of developing CDMS. Earlier, more aggressive therapy in optic neuritis may be proven to reduce permanent axonal injury and progressive disability in MS.

### Management of optic neuritis and impact of clinical trials: an international survey [^1176e56K]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

1) To evaluate the management of acute isolated optic neuritis (ON) by ophthalmologists and neurologists; 2) to evaluate the impact of clinical trials; 3) to compare these practices among 7 countries.

Methods

A survey on diagnosis and treatment of acute isolated ON was sent to 5,443 neurologists and 6,099 ophthalmologists in the southeast-USA, Canada, Australia/New Zealand, Denmark, France, and Thailand. USA data were compared to those of other countries.

Results

We collected 3,142 surveys (1,449 neurologists/1,693 ophthalmologists) (29.8% response rate). In all countries, ON patients more frequently presented to ophthalmologists, and were subsequently referred to neurologists or subspecialists. Evaluation and management of ON varied among countries, mostly because of variations in healthcare systems, imaging access, and local guidelines. A brain MRI was obtained for 70–80% of ON patients; lumbar punctures were obtained mostly in Europe and Thailand. Although most patients received acute treatment with intravenous steroids, between 14% and 65% of neurologists and ophthalmologists still recommended oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day) for the treatment of acute isolated ON. In all countries, steroids were often prescribed to improve visual outcome or to decrease the long-term risk of multiple sclerosis.

Interpretation

Although recent clinical trials have changed the management of acute ON around the world, many neurologists and ophthalmologists do not evaluate and treat acute ON patients according to the best evidence from clinical research. This confirms that evaluation of the impact of major clinical trials ("translational T2 clinical research") is essential when assessing the effects of interventions designed to improve quality of care.

### Autoimmune optic neuropathy | JAMA ophthalmology… [^1167dw5H]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

Optic neuritis is a syndrome of visual loss due to inflammation of the optic nerve. It is usually either idiopathic or associated with multiple sclerosis. Less commonly, it can accompany other systemic inflammatory disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, syphilis, or sarcoidosis. An entity known as autoimmune optic neuropathy, also called autoimmune optic neuritis, appears to be distinct from other forms of optic neuritis because it has a different clinical course with characteristic associated laboratory findings. 1, 2. In addition, IgM and C3 were found at the dermoepidermal junction in a granular to fibrillar staining pattern. No specific staining was seen for IgA. These results indicated the presence of immune complex deposition, and the diagnosis of autoimmune optic neuropathy was made. A 25-year-old woman experienced rapidly progressive visual loss in her right eye approximately 5 months prior to referral.

The visual loss was accompanied by pain with eye movement but no other symptoms. She was diagnosed as having optic neuritis and was treated with the same regimen as patient 1. She experienced recovery of vision to 20/25 OD over the following 7 weeks. She had a mild episode of arthritis as a child and had occasional migraine headaches. She had a brother and paternal aunt with systemic lupus erythematosus. Autoimmune retrobulbar optic neuropathy, now more commonly called autoimmune optic neuropathy, was first described by Dutton et al. 1 They described a disorder characterized by progressive visual loss and serologic evidence of an autoimmune disorder. Long-term corticosteroid or immunosuppressive therapy seemed to promote visual recovery and prevent further attacks. Autoimmune optic neuropathy should be considered whenever a patient with optic neuritis has an atypical recurring course. This usually is seen as recurrent bouts of visual loss as treatment is tapered or stopped.

Our first patient was initially seen at age 17 years, and is to our knowledge the youngest reported patient in the literature with this condition. Our second case is important for 2 reasons. First, it shows the importance of long-term, slow tapering of immunotherapy. Second, this case provides the first histopathologic study of optic nerve tissue affected by autoimmune optic neuropathy. It implies autoimmune optic neuropathy is a disorder characterized by chronic perivascular nongranulomatous inflammation. These cases remind us that autoimmune optic neuropathy can be difficult to diagnose unless it is suspected and it is appropriately evaluated.

### Optic neuritis and autoimmune optic neuropathies: advances in diagnosis and treatment [^112hQ8N2]. The Lancet: Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Optic neuritis is an inflammatory optic neuropathy that is commonly indicative of autoimmune neurological disorders including multiple sclerosis, myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease, and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. Early clinical recognition of optic neuritis is important in determining the potential aetiology, which has bearing on prognosis and treatment. Regaining high-contrast visual acuity is common in people with idiopathic optic neuritis and multiple sclerosis-associated optic neuritis; however, residual deficits in contrast sensitivity, binocular vision, and motion perception might impair vision-specific quality-of-life metrics. In contrast, recovery of visual acuity can be poorer and optic nerve atrophy more severe in individuals who are seropositive for antibodies to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, AQP4, and CRMP5 than in individuals with typical optic neuritis from idiopathic or multiple-sclerosis associated optic neuritis. Key clinical, imaging, and laboratory findings differentiate these disorders, allowing clinicians to focus their diagnostic studies and optimise acute and preventive treatments. Guided by early and accurate diagnosis of optic neuritis subtypes, the timely use of high-dose corticosteroids and, in some instances, plasmapheresis could prevent loss of high-contrast vision, improve contrast sensitivity, and preserve colour vision and visual fields. Advancements in our knowledge, diagnosis, and treatment of optic neuritis will ultimately improve our understanding of autoimmune neurological disorders, improve clinical trial design, and spearhead therapeutic innovation.

### The neuro-ophthalmological manifestations of NMOSD and MOGAD-a comprehensive review [^111gkBci]. Eye (2023). Medium credibility.

Optic neuritis (ON) is one of the most frequently seen neuro-ophthalmic causes of vision loss worldwide. Typical ON is often idiopathic or seen in patients with multiple sclerosis, which is well described in the landmark clinical trial, the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT). However, since the completion of the ONTT, there has been the discovery of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibodies, which are biomarkers for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and MOG antibody-associated disease (MOGAD), respectively. These disorders are associated with atypical ON that was not well characterised in the ONTT. The severity, rate of recurrence and overall outcome differs in these two entities requiring prompt and accurate diagnosis and management. This review will summarise the characteristic neuro-ophthalmological signs in NMOSD and MOGAD, serological markers and radiographic findings, as well as acute and long-term therapies used for these disorders.

### MOG antibody-associated optic neuritis [^1126UjvS]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) is a demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) distinct from multiple sclerosis (MS) and aquaporin 4 (AQP4) immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody-associated neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). MOGAD refers to a demyelinating syndrome in association with IgG autoantibodies targeting myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), a minor transmembrane surface protein found on the outermost lamellae of CNS myelin and oligodendrocytes. The annual incidence of MOGAD worldwide is approximately 1.6–4.8 per million people, with a prevalence estimated at 1.3–2.5 per 100,000 people. There is a biphasic distribution of the age of onset, peaking in children aged 5–10 years as well as in adults aged 20–45 years. The median age of onset overall is 20–30 years. MOGAD accounts for nearly 50% of acute demyelinating syndromes in children under 11 years of age. Optic neuritis (ON) is the most common initial manifestation of MOGAD in adults (~30–60%), followed by transverse myelitis (~10–25%), and is the second most common manifestation in children, after acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM; ~45% in children < 11 years of age vs. < 5% in adults). This review aims to summarise current knowledge on MOG antibody-associated optic neuritis (MOG-ON), from presentation to diagnosis and treatment, in order to assist clinicians in managing this increasingly recognised condition.
