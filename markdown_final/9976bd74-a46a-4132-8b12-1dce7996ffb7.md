## Question

best medication for diabetic infected wound'

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best medication for a diabetic infected wound. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the wound is truly infected and how to classify severity. Then, I should verify likely pathogens and local epidemiology to guide empiric therapy. Next, I will consider the route and duration of antibiotics, and ensure cultures are obtained to enable de-escalation. After that, I need to check for special circumstances such as MRSA risk, Pseudomonas risk, or osteomyelitis. Finally, I must integrate essential non-antibiotic measures like debridement, offloading, vascular optimization, and glycemic control before concluding with a practical summary based on current guidelines and evidence [^112swx9V].

> Let me first anchor the core answer so I don't overpromise a single drug. There is no single best antibiotic for diabetic foot infection; outcomes across various systemic regimens are broadly equivalent when therapy is matched to infection severity, likely pathogens, and patient factors, and current guidelines explicitly endorse selecting any effective systemic regimen at standard dosing tailored to these elements [^112swx9V] [^111vEvsQ] [^112brUtv].

> Wait, let me verify that we should even be prescribing antibiotics. Antibiotics are indicated only for clinically infected wounds, defined by at least two classic signs of inflammation or purulence; for uninfected ulcers, antibiotics do not improve healing and should be avoided, and in diagnostically equivocal cases, inflammatory markers like CRP, ESR, or procalcitonin may help decide if infection is present [^112Z2QCH] [^113CkSYW] [^116AvQ5r].

> Next, I should review severity classification because it drives spectrum and route. Using the IWGDF/IDSA scheme, mild infection is superficial and limited, moderate is deeper or more extensive without systemic instability, and severe has systemic toxicity or metabolic derangement; early infections in temperate climates are usually due to aerobic gram-positive cocci, with gram-negatives and anaerobes more common in chronic, previously treated, ischemic, or necrotic wounds [^114Tk4Vi] [^113Xicrm].

> I will now examine empiric therapy for mild infection. In temperate climates with no recent antibiotics, target aerobic gram-positive pathogens only (beta-hemolytic streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus), adding MRSA coverage only if risk factors are present such as prior MRSA, high local prevalence, or severe presentation; avoid empiric gram-negative or anaerobic coverage for uncomplicated mild infection [^111bZUfh] [^114wmA3s].

> Hold on, I should verify broad-spectrum indications for moderate to severe infection. For deeper or extensive infection, start broad-spectrum therapy covering staphylococci, streptococci, and common gram-negatives, add anaerobic coverage if there is ischemic or necrotic tissue, include MRSA agents when risk is nontrivial, and reserve empiric antipseudomonal coverage for patients with specific risk factors or those in tropical/subtropical settings or with recent Pseudomonas isolation [^113C1iip] [^113UaZyo].

> Let me consider the route because that often gets overlooked. For mild infections, highly bioavailable oral agents usually suffice; for severe, and some moderate, start parenteral therapy and transition to oral when the patient is clinically stable and culture data allow streamlining, which improves safety and stewardship without compromising outcomes [^115MRB6P] [^114vKkeL].

> I should double-check culture guidance before antibiotics. Obtain deep tissue specimens after cleansing and debridement, preferably by biopsy or curettage, and avoid superficial swabs that mislead; use conventional culture techniques for pathogen identification rather than molecular methods for routine care, to support precise de-escalation [^117R9dds] [^113JWYQK] [^112couNP].

> Next, I should review surgical source control because antibiotics alone are not enough. Prompt and repeated debridement to remove nonviable tissue and drain abscesses is essential, with early surgical consultation for severe infection or moderate infection with deep abscess, necrosis, compartment syndrome, or critical limb ischemia, and early surgery within 24–48 hours when indicated improves outcomes [^111t7UWX] [^115JWVY8] [^111vEvsQ].

> I need to ensure we address biomechanics, perfusion, and glucose since they modify antibiotic success. Offloading with total contact casting or equivalent redistributes pressure and aids healing, vascular assessment with ABI/toe pressures and revascularization when indicated restores antibiotic delivery and oxygenation, and tight but safe glycemic control improves infection resolution and wound healing [^116R62yd] [^115sLdSF] [^114VByws].

> Now, let me think about narrowing therapy and duration. Once cultures return and the patient improves, de-escalate to the narrowest effective agent; typical durations are 1–2 weeks for mild soft-tissue infection, 2–3 weeks for moderate infection, and at least 4–6 weeks for osteomyelitis, and after adequate debridement of moderate–severe soft-tissue infection, 10 days may be noninferior to 20 days, which supports shorter effective courses when source control is achieved [^112swx9V] [^1151uxvC] [^115NhxW9].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I recall a trial text suggesting that mild DFIs could be treated by local antibiotics and debridement alone; hold on, I should verify consistency with guidelines. While that statement appears in a study context, current IWGDF/IDSA guidance advises against using topical antibiotics, either as adjuncts to systemic therapy for soft-tissue infection or osteomyelitis, or for uninfected ulcers to promote healing or prevent infection, so I should correct any inclination to use topical antibiotics routinely in DFI [^112zPopd] [^113XMgvb] [^112d8zE8].

> I will now examine special situations. For suspected osteomyelitis, obtain imaging with MRI when feasible and consider surgical resection of infected bone combined with systemic antibiotics because medical therapy alone often fails without adequate source control; bone culture improves targeted therapy and should be pursued when possible [^115ajuxc] [^116rCSJk].

> Let me not forget team-based care and follow-up because single-visit decisions are risky. Multidisciplinary management involving infectious diseases, podiatry, vascular surgery, wound care, and endocrinology with frequent reassessment in the first days allows timely debridement, optimization of offloading and perfusion, and antibiotic adjustment, which correlates with better limb salvage and outcomes [^112swx9V] [^111zPCXb].

> To synthesize, I should confirm there is true infection, classify severity, start empiric therapy aligned with severity and epidemiology, obtain deep cultures, promptly debride and offload, optimize perfusion and glycemia, then narrow and right-size duration based on culture and response; there is no single best medication, only the best-matched regimen for the specific clinical scenario under these evidence-based principles [^112swx9V] [^111vEvsQ].

---

The best medication for diabetic infected wounds is **systemic antibiotics tailored to culture results and infection severity** [^112MQFYo] [^116H4Lw4], with mild infections treated using oral agents targeting gram-positive cocci (e.g. amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalexin, clindamycin, or doxycycline) [^111bZUfh] [^1159stjW], moderate infections requiring broader oral or IV coverage (e.g. amoxicillin-clavulanate, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus clindamycin) [^112swx9V] [^112VzzR1], and severe infections needing IV broad-spectrum therapy (e.g. piperacillin-tazobactam, ertapenem, or vancomycin plus cefepime) [^112swx9V] [^115MRB6P] [^113C1iip]; **topical antibiotics are not recommended** for infected diabetic wounds [^112zPopd] [^112d8zE8], and antibiotics should always be combined with debridement, offloading, and glycemic control [^116R62yd] [^111t7UWX].

---

## Clinical assessment and severity classification

Accurate clinical assessment and severity classification are essential for guiding **antibiotic selection and management strategies** [^112LehaU]. The IDSA/IWGDF 2024 guidelines recommend using the IWGDF/IDSA classification scheme [^114Tk4Vi], which categorizes infections as mild, moderate, or severe based on clinical signs [^112Z2QCH], extent of infection, and systemic symptoms.

---

## Microbiological evaluation

Obtaining appropriate microbiological specimens is critical for identifying causative pathogens and guiding **targeted antibiotic therapy** [^113JWYQK]. The IDSA/IWGDF 2024 guidelines recommend aseptically collecting tissue specimens (curettage or biopsy) from the wound for culture and susceptibility testing [^117R9dds]. Superficial swab cultures are discouraged because of contamination and limited diagnostic value [^113Xicrm] [^112VzzR1].

---

## Empiric antibiotic therapy

Empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated promptly [^114sFSjX] based on **infection severity, likely pathogens, and local resistance patterns** [^116H4Lw4]. The IDSA/IWGDF 2024 guidelines provide clear recommendations for empiric antibiotic selection [^112swx9V]:

| **Infection severity** | **Recommended empiric antibiotic therapy** |
|-|-|
| Mild | Oral antibiotics targeting aerobic gram-positive cocci (e.g. amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalexin, clindamycin, doxycycline) [^111bZUfh] [^1159stjW] |
| Moderate | Broader-spectrum oral or intravenous antibiotics covering gram-positive cocci, gram-negative bacilli, and anaerobes (e.g. amoxicillin-clavulanate, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus clindamycin) [^112swx9V] [^115MRB6P] |
| Severe | Intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics covering MRSA, gram-negative bacilli, and anaerobes (e.g. piperacillin-tazobactam, ertapenem, vancomycin plus cefepime) [^112swx9V] [^113C1iip] [^115MRB6P] |

---

Empiric therapy should be adjusted based on **culture results and clinical response** [^112MQFYo].

---

## Definitive antibiotic therapy

Definitive antibiotic therapy should be guided by **culture and susceptibility results**, clinical response, and patient-specific factors [^115MRB6P]. The IDSA/IWGDF 2024 guidelines emphasize tailoring antibiotic therapy to the identified pathogens and their susceptibilities [^112MQFYo]. The duration of antibiotic therapy depends on **infection severity and clinical response**:

- **Mild infections**: 1–2 weeks [^112swx9V]
- **Moderate infections**: 2–3 weeks [^115NhxW9]
- **Severe infections or osteomyelitis**: 4–6 weeks or longer, depending on clinical response and presence of necrotic bone [^1151uxvC] [^1125G4RH]

---

## Topical antibiotic therapy

Topical antibiotics are generally **not recommended** for treating infected diabetic wounds. The IDSA/IWGDF 2024 guidelines specifically advise against combining topical and systemic antibiotics for diabetic soft tissue infections or foot osteomyelitis [^112zPopd]. They may be considered only in selected mild superficial infections, but overall efficacy is limited [^114vKkeL] [^1135MiKH].

---

## Adjunctive therapies

Adjunctive therapies, such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy, negative pressure wound therapy, and bioengineered skin equivalents, **may be considered in selected cases** of slow-healing diabetic foot wounds [^115VjqUU]. However, they should not replace systemic antibiotic therapy and are generally reserved for specific clinical scenarios [^112d8zE8].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing antibiotic selection

Several **patient-specific factors must be considered** when selecting antibiotic therapy for diabetic infected wounds [^112MQFYo]:

- **Severity of infection** [^112LehaU]
- **Presence of antibiotic-resistant organisms (e.g. MRSA)** [^114wmA3s]
- **Patient allergies and comorbidities**
- **Renal and hepatic function** [^115MRB6P]
- **Drug interactions and potential adverse effects**
- **Availability and cost of antibiotics** [^112MQFYo]

---

## Clinical outcomes and prognosis

Clinical outcomes in diabetic infected wounds depend on infection severity, patient comorbidities, and adherence to treatment guidelines. Severe infections are associated with **higher risks** of amputation, prolonged hospitalization, and increased mortality [^1145ubH7]. Adherence to guidelines and multidisciplinary care improves outcomes and reduces complications [^115ZPoUQ].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Obtain deep tissue specimens for culture and susceptibility testing** before initiating antibiotics [^117R9dds].
- **Initiate empiric antibiotic therapy** based on infection severity, likely pathogens, and local resistance patterns [^116H4Lw4].
- **Adjust antibiotic therapy** based on culture results and clinical response [^115MRB6P].
- **Avoid topical antibiotics** for infected diabetic wounds.
- **Consider adjunctive therapies** only in selected cases [^115VjqUU].
- **Address patient-specific factors** when selecting antibiotics [^112MQFYo].

---

Systemic antibiotics tailored to **culture results and infection severity** are the best medication for diabetic infected wounds [^112swx9V]. Topical antibiotics are not recommended, and adjunctive therapies should only be considered in selected cases [^112zPopd] [^115VjqUU].

### New horizons in the understanding of the causes and management of diabetic foot disease: Report from the 2017 Diabetes UK Annual Professional Conference Symposium [^114qwUAA]. Diabetic Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Diabetes-related foot disease remains a common problem. Classic teaching for wounds recommends treating any infection, offloading the wound, and ensuring a good blood supply, as well as addressing and optimizing other modifiable risk factors. However, there remain several questions about these and other aspects of diabetes-related foot disease care. Some of these questions are addressed in the present report, particularly the impact of newer technologies in identifying any organisms present in a wound, as well as novel approaches to treat infections.

Use of new remote sensing technology to identify people at risk of developing foot ulceration is also considered, in an attempt to allow early intervention and prevention of foot ulcers. The psychological impact of foot disease is often overlooked, but with an increasing number of publications on the subject, the cause-and-effect role that psychology plays in foot disease, such as ulcers and Charcot neuroarthropathy, is considered. Finally, because of heterogeneity in diabetic foot studies, comparing results is difficult. A recently published document focusing on ensuring a standardized way of reporting foot disease trials is discussed.

### Inpatient management of diabetic foot disorders: A clinical guide [^116uc8L9]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Infected wounds should be cultured, preferably by obtaining tissue samples during any surgical procedure or by tissue biopsy or wound base curettage. Bone cultures are optimal for detecting the pathogen in osteomyelitis, but blood cultures are only necessary for those with a severe infection as defined by the IDSA/International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (PEDIS) classification scheme. An appropriate deep culture technique is important because the results direct antibiotic therapy, enabling clinicians to alter their initial broad-spectrum empiric regimen to more narrow-spectrum antibiotic coverage.

Initial therapy must usually be parenteral and empiric, based on the likeliest pathogens and their probable antibiotic susceptibility patterns. A broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen is recommended for severe infections, covering staphylococci, streptococci, and commonly reported gram-negative pathogens. Where the likelihood is more than minimal of infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing gram-negatives, or obligately anaerobic bacteria, antibiotics effective against these organisms should be considered.

No one agent or regimen has shown superiority in treating diabetic foot infections, but those with demonstrated efficacy include β-lactams (penicillins and cephalosporins), glycopeptides (e.g. vancomycin), carbapenems, linezolid, clindamycin, and fluoroquinolones. The ability to appropriately initiate and then modify antibiotic therapy, based on culture results and clinical response, is important.

### The role of novel antibiotics in the management of diabetic foot infection [^114ULYhb]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Low credibility.

Diabetic foot infection is a frequent and potentially life-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus. Antibiotic treatment is the cornerstone of managing diabetic foot infections, but the rising prevalence of antibiotic resistance has resulted in increasing rates of treatment failure. In this context, the development of several novel antibiotics may represent a useful tool in severe diabetic foot infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria. This review summarizes the safety and efficacy of novel antibiotics in patients with diabetic foot infection. Relevant data are limited, and randomized controlled studies evaluating these agents' role are lacking. Until more robust data are available, cefiderocol and dalbavancin, which have been studied more extensively in patients with bone infections, might be attractive options in carefully selected patients with severe diabetic foot infections.

### Medical therapy of diabetic foot infections [^116Ajmuo]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Diabetic foot infections are a common and often serious problem, accounting for a greater number of hospital bed days than any other complication of diabetes. Despite advances in both antibiotic therapy and surgical management, these infections continue to be a major risk factor for amputations of the lower extremity. Although a number of wound size and depth classification systems have been adapted for use in codifying diabetic foot ulcerations, none are specific for infection.

In 2003, the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot developed guidelines for managing diabetic foot infections, including the first severity scale specific for these infections. The following year, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) published their Diabetic Foot Infection Guidelines.

In this article, we review some of the critical points from the Executive Summary of the IDSA document and provide a commentary following each issue to update the reader on any pertinent changes that have occurred since the publication of the original document in 2004. The importance of a multidisciplinary limb salvage team, apropos this special joint issue of the American Podiatric Medical Association and the Society for Vascular Surgery, cannot be overstated.

### Systemic antibiotics for treating diabetic foot infections [^112brUtv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Foot infection is the most common cause of non-traumatic amputation in people with diabetes. Most diabetic foot infections (DFIs) require systemic antibiotic therapy, and the initial choice is usually empirical. Although there are many antibiotics available, uncertainty exists about which is the best for treating DFIs.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effects and safety of systemic antibiotics in the treatment of DFIs compared with other systemic antibiotics, topical foot care, or placebo.

- **Search methods**: In April 2015, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE, and EBSCO CINAHL. We also searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE; The Cochrane Library), the Health Technology Assessment database (HTA; The Cochrane Library), the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS-EED; The Cochrane Library), unpublished literature in OpenSIGLE, ProQuest Dissertations, and on-going trials registers.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of systemic antibiotics (oral or parenteral) in people with a DFI. Primary outcomes were clinical resolution of the infection, time to its resolution, complications, and adverse effects.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted data. Risk ratios (RR) were estimated for dichotomous data.

### Update on the role of infection and biofilms in wound healing: Pathophysiology and treatment [^111veSkp]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic wounds, particularly infected diabetic foot ulcers, are a worldwide problem. The poor treatment outcomes result in high healthcare costs, amputations, decreased quality of life, and increased mortality. These outcomes are influenced by several factors, including biofilm formation. A biofilm consists of pathogenic bacteria encased in an exopolysaccharide layer, communicating through the secretion of signaling molecules. Bacteria living in a biofilm are refractory to host responses and treatment.

- **Methods**: We conducted a nonsystematic review of currently published medical biofilm literature. The review summarizes evidence on biofilm in chronic wounds, its role in wound healing, detection methods, and available antibiofilm treatments. The articles include basic science and clinical research, as well as systematic reviews, and are described and evaluated with variable levels of evidence. All articles have been peer-reviewed, meeting the standards of evidence-based medicine.

- **Results**: Both animal and human studies have identified biofilm in chronic wounds, suggesting that healing might be influenced by its presence. A promising development in biofilm detection is rapid molecular diagnostics combined with direct microscopy, which may support individualized treatment in the near future. A wide range of treatments for chronic wounds also affects biofilm formation, and several agents specifically targeting biofilm are currently being researched.

### Interventions in the management of diabetes-related foot infections: A systematic review [^113JuyUE]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

The optimal approaches to managing diabetic foot infections remain a challenge for clinicians. Despite an exponential rise in publications investigating different treatment strategies, the various agents studied generally produce comparable results, and high-quality data are scarce. In this systematic review, we searched the medical literature using the PubMed and Embase databases for published studies on the treatment of diabetic foot infections from 30 June 2018 to 30 June 2022. We combined this search with our previous literature search of a systematic review performed in 2020, in which the infection committee of the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot searched the literature until June 2018.

We defined the context of the literature by formulating clinical questions of interest, then developing structured clinical questions (Patients-Intervention-Control-Outcomes) to address these. We only included data from controlled studies of an intervention to prevent or cure a diabetic foot infection. Two independent reviewers selected articles for inclusion and then assessed their relevant outcomes and methodological quality. Our literature search identified a total of 5,418 articles, of which we selected 32 for full-text review. Overall, the newly available studies we identified since 2018 do not significantly modify the body of the 2020 statements for the interventions in the management of diabetes-related foot infections. The recent data confirm that outcomes in patients treated with the different antibiotic regimens for both skin and soft tissue infection and oste.

### Moderate to severe soft tissue diabetic foot infections: A randomized, controlled, pilot trial of post-debridement antibiotic treatment for 10 versus 20 days [^115NhxW9]. Annals of Surgery (2022). High credibility.

- **Study conduct**: Participation started at enrollment, which included a history, physical examination, and standard X-rays of the foot. A given patient could be included as many times as he or she had a new ST-DFI episode in another location. The treatment period included the following (inpatient or outpatient) visits: visit 1 – Enrollment (Day 1); visit 2 – Day 10 (± 2 days); visit 3 – Day 20 (± 2 days; only if still receiving treatment after visit 2). The Test-of-Cure visit occurred at approximately 60 days (± 10 days) after the End-of-Treatment.

Treating clinicians determined the frequency of wound debridement required, the method of pressure off-loading, and whether or not to perform angioplasty, use negative-pressure vacuum therapy, or use hyperbaric oxygen. To limit the number of antibiotic agents selected, we provided the treating clinicians a list of permitted regimens. Treatment with any topical antibiotics, silver dressings, or antiseptics was prohibited for the following reasons: we focused on moderate to severe ST-DFI. In contrast, mild DFIs could be treated by local antibiotics and debridement alone. Furthermore, even if present, the ulcers usually comprise only 10%–20% of all infected soft tissues, so superficial topical antimicrobials would not be active against the majority of microorganisms.

We also required that any debridement be performed by healthcare workers with at least 2 years' clinical and academic experience in diabetic foot care. Specialists in diabetology treated and monitored the glycemic control of the patients.

### Diabetic foot infections: Current treatment and delaying the 'post-antibiotic era' [^113UTJvi]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment for diabetic foot infections requires properly diagnosing infection, obtaining an appropriate specimen for culture, assessing for any needed surgical procedures, and selecting an empiric antibiotic regimen. Therapy will often need to be modified based on results of culture and sensitivity testing. Because of excessive and inappropriate use of antibiotics for treating diabetic foot infections, resistance to the usually employed bacteria has been increasing to alarming levels.

- **Review**: This article reviews recommendations from evidence-based guidelines, informed by results of systematic reviews, on treating diabetic foot infections. Data from the pre-antibiotic era reported rates of mortality of about 9% and of high-level leg amputations of about 70%. Outcomes have greatly improved with appropriate antibiotic therapy. While there are now many oral and parenteral antibiotic agents that have demonstrated efficacy in treating diabetic foot infections, the rate of infection with multidrug-resistant pathogens is growing. This problem requires a multi-focal approach, including providing education to both clinicians and patients, developing robust antimicrobial stewardship programmes, and using new diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. Recently, new methods have been developed to find novel antibiotic agents and to resurrect old treatments, like bacteriophages, for treating these difficult infections.

Conclusion: Medical and political leaders have recognized the serious global threat posed by the growing problem of antibiotic resistance. By a multipronged app

### IWGDF/IDSA guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes-related foot infections (IWGDF/IDSA 2023) [^111yj4K5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) has published evidence-based guidelines on the management and prevention of diabetes-related foot diseases since 1999. The present guideline is an update of the 2019 IWGDF guideline on the diagnosis and management of foot infections in persons with diabetes mellitus. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was used for the development of this guideline. This was structured around identifying clinically relevant questions in the P(A)ICO format, determining patient-important outcomes, systematically reviewing the evidence, assessing the certainty of the evidence, and finally moving from evidence to the recommendation.

This guideline was developed for healthcare professionals involved in diabetes-related foot care to inform clinical care around patient-important outcomes. Two systematic reviews from 2019 were updated to inform this guideline, and a total of 149 studies (62 new) meeting inclusion criteria were identified from the updated search and incorporated in this guideline. Updated recommendations are derived from these systematic reviews, and best practice statements are made where evidence was not available. Evidence was weighed in light of benefits and harms to arrive at a recommendation. The certainty of the evidence for some recommendations was modified in this update with a more refined application of the GRADE framework centered around patient-important outcomes. This is highlighted in the rationale section of this update.

### Diabetic foot infections: Questions for an infectious disease consultant [^112F65Cp]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Diabetic foot infection can lead to limb amputation in approximately 17% of affected patients. Given the complex pathophysiology associated with diabetic foot infection, the goal of limb preservation is best achieved with a multidisciplinary approach and a team of providers including infectious disease consultants. However, these infections often affect populations living in nonmetropolitan areas, where access to an infectious disease physician may be limited. It may fall on the surgeons and primary care providers to not only diagnose infections early, including osteomyelitis, but also facilitate prompt, appropriate antibiotic management.

- **Antibiotic management**: The decision to treat with antibiotics alone versus surgery, choice of antibiotic, route of administration, and duration of treatment are complicated concepts that require a patient-specific approach. In addition, the use of oral antibiotics and long-acting lipoglycopeptides has gained prominence and offers an alternate solution to the tedious, resource-intense process of outpatient intravenous antibiotic treatment.

The goal of this article is to outline and address diagnostic and management questions that would be posed to an infectious disease consultant. The responses would include a literature review of management concepts and highlights from the 2023 Infectious Disease Society of America and International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot guidelines.

### Concordance of molecular microbiology and conventional culture techniques for infected diabetic foot ulcer management [^115LSoWX]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

For individuals living with diabetes, foot ulcers are a major complication, affecting 2%–10% of this population annually. The delayed healing of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) increases their susceptibility to new and recurrent infections. Without timely and effective treatment, these infections can lead to severe morbidity, including lower extremity amputation and mortality. Clinically, about 40% of DFUs are infected at the patient's initial presentation, underscoring the need for prompt and accurate diagnostic processes and appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Optimal management of DFU infections hinges on the rapid clinical identification of infection and its severity, followed by microbiological investigations to determine the causative organisms and their antibiotic sensitivities.

The diagnosis of infection in DFUs is primarily based on clinical signs, such as erythema, warmth, induration, pain or tenderness, purulence, or fever. Empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated promptly in clinically infected DFUs. In the absence of microbiological data, initial antibiotic selection is guided by clinical presentation, history of infection, recent antimicrobial use, and relevant prescribing guidelines. The escalating global challenge of antibiotic resistance has led to the development of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) principles, which emphasize the judicious use of antibiotics. Prescribing the most appropriate, targeted antibiotic agents depends on refining therapy based upon identified pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibilities. Empiric therapy plays a crucial role in this process.

### Levels of wound calprotectin and other inflammatory biomarkers aid in deciding which patients with a diabetic foot ulcer need antibiotic therapy (INDUCE study) [^1128TyZ6]. Diabetic Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Deciding if a diabetic foot ulcer is infected in a community setting is challenging without validated point-of-care tests. Four inflammatory biomarkers were investigated to develop a composite algorithm for mildly infected diabetic foot ulcers: venous white cell count, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, and a novel wound exudate calprotectin assay. Calprotectin is a marker of neutrophilic inflammation.

In a prospective study, people with uninfected or mildly infected diabetic foot ulcers who had not received oral antibiotics in the preceding 2 weeks were recruited from community podiatry clinics for measurement of inflammatory biomarkers. Antibiotic prescribing decisions were based on clinicians' baseline assessments, and participants were reviewed 1 week later; ulcer infection was defined by clinicians' overall impression from their two assessments.

Some 363 potential participants were screened, of whom 67 were recruited, 29 with mildly infected diabetic foot ulcers and 38 with no infection. One participant withdrew early in each group. Ulcer area was 1.32 cm² [interquartile range (IQR) 0.32–3.61 cm²] in infected ulcers and 0.22 cm² (IQR 0.09–1.46 cm²) in uninfected ulcers. Baseline CRP for mild infection was 9.00 mg/ml and 6.00 mg/ml for uninfected ulcers; most procalcitonin levels were undetectable. The median calprotectin level in infected diabetic foot ulcers was 1437 ng/ml and 879 ng/ml in uninfected diabetic foot ulcers. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for a composite algorithm incorporating calprotectin, CRP, and other markers is suggested to aid in distinguishing infection levels.

### Prognosis of the infected diabetic foot ulcer: A 12-month prospective observational study [^1145ubH7]. Diabetic Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Aims: To determine clinical outcomes and explore prognostic factors related to ulcer healing in people with a clinically infected diabetic foot ulcer.

Methods: This multicenter, prospective, observational study reviewed participants' data at 12 months after culture of a diabetic foot ulcer requiring antibiotic therapy. From participants' notes, we obtained information on the incidence of wound healing, ulcer recurrence, lower extremity amputation, lower extremity revascularization, and death. We estimated the cumulative incidence of healing at 6 and 12 months, adjusted for lower extremity amputation and death using a competing risk analysis, and explored the relationship between baseline factors and healing incidence.

Results: In the first year after culture of the index ulcer, 45 of 299 participants (15.1%) had died. The ulcer had healed in 136 participants (45.5%), but recurred in 13 participants (9.6%). An ipsilateral lower extremity amputation was recorded in 52 participants (17.4%) and revascularization surgery in 18 participants (6.0%). Participants with an ulcer present for approximately 2 months or more had a lower incidence of healing (hazard ratio 0.55, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.77), as did those with a perfusion grade of ≥ 2 (hazard ratio 0.37, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.55). Participants with a single ulcer on their index foot had a higher incidence of healing than those with multiple ulcers (hazard ratio 1.90, 95% CI 1.18 to 3.06).

Conclusions: Clinical outcomes at 12 months for people with an infected diabetic foot ulcer are generally poor. Our data confirm the adverse prognosis associated with these ulcers.

### Medical treatment of diabetic foot infections [^111KpVZU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Diabetic foot infections frequently cause morbidity, hospitalization, and amputations. Gram-positive cocci, especially staphylococci and streptococci, are the predominant pathogens. Chronic or previously treated wounds often yield several microbes on culture, including gram-negative bacilli and anaerobes. Optimal culture specimens are wound tissue taken after debridement. Infection of a wound is defined clinically by the presence of purulent discharge or inflammation; systemic signs and symptoms are often lacking.

Only infected wounds require antibiotic therapy, and the agents, route, and duration are predicated on the severity of infection. Mild to moderate infections can usually be treated in the outpatient setting with oral agents; severe infections require hospitalization and parenteral therapy. Empirical therapy must cover gram-positive cocci and should be broad spectrum for severe infections. Definitive therapy depends on culture results and the clinical response. Bone infection is particularly difficult to treat and often requires surgery. Several adjuvant agents may be beneficial in some cases.

### Systematic review of antimicrobial treatments for diabetic foot ulcers [^112okBZc]. Diabetic Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Foot ulcers in diabetes are associated with increased mortality, illness, and reduced quality of life. Ulcer infection impairs healing, and antimicrobial interventions may cure infection, aid healing, and reduce amputation rates.

- **Objectives**: To systematically review the evidence for antimicrobial interventions for foot ulcers in diabetes.

- **Methods**: We searched 16 databases, 11 internet sites, three books, conference proceedings, a journal, and bibliographies in November 2002. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs).

- **Results**: Twenty-three studies investigated the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of antimicrobial agents: intravenous antibiotics (n = 8), oral antibiotics (n = 5), topical antimicrobials (n = 4), subcutaneous granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (n = 4), Ayurvedic preparations (n = 1), and sugar vs. antibiotics vs. standard care (n = 1). The trials were small and too dissimilar to be pooled. There is no strong evidence for any particular antimicrobial agent for the prevention of amputation, resolution of infection, or ulcer healing. Pexiganan cream may be as effective as oral ofloxacin for resolution of infection. Ampicillin and sulbactam cost less than imipenem/cilastatin. G-CSF cost less than standard care, and cadexomer iodine dressings may cost less than daily dressings.

- **Conclusions**: The evidence is too weak to recommend any particular antimicrobial agent. Large studies are needed to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of antimicrobial interventions.

### Expert opinion on the management of infections in the diabetic foot [^112Gwk8h]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

This update from the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot includes information from a related review on diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO) and a systematic review on managing infections in the diabetic foot. The pathophysiology of these infections is well understood, and there is a validated system for classifying the severity based on clinical findings. Diagnosing osteomyelitis remains challenging, although recent publications have clarified the roles of clinical, laboratory, and imaging tests. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is now recognized as the most accurate method for diagnosing bone infection, but bone biopsy for culture and histopathology remains the criterion standard. Determining the organisms causing a diabetic foot infection through cultured, appropriately collected tissue specimens allows clinicians to select optimal antibiotics based on culture and sensitivity results.

In addition to culture-directed antibiotic therapy, most infections require surgical intervention, ranging from minor debridement to major resection, amputation, or revascularization. Providing proper wound care is essential to ensure healing. While various adjunctive therapies may benefit some patients, the supporting data are weak. If treated appropriately, most diabetic foot infections can be cured. However, providers and patients in developing countries face especially challenging situations.

### Management of diabetic wounds: Expert panel consensus statement [^115sLdSF]. Advances in Wound Care (2025). High credibility.

The Wound Healing Foundation recognized the need for consensus-based, unbiased recommendations for the treatment of wounds. Consensus statements on the treatment of chronic and acute wounds have been developed and published previously. The publication on diabetic wounds represents the next step in this process. Diabetic wounds constitute a major problem; population-based and meta-analytic studies indicate that the presence of foot wounds in patients with diabetes increases their mortality risk by more than twofold. The management of diabetic wounds requires consistent and evidence-driven intervention to achieve optimal clinical outcomes. This consensus statement provides clinicians with the necessary foundational approaches to the causes, diagnosis, and therapeutic management of diabetic wounds. Presented in a structured format, it serves as a useful guide for clinicians and learners across all patient care settings.

- **Recent advances**: Continuous glucose monitoring and other new tools have facilitated better diabetes management and the management of associated wounds. Diabetic limb salvage should focus on achieving and optimizing function for the patient with diabetes rather than preserving limb tissue at all costs.

- **Critical issues**: Successful management of diabetic wounds requires a multidisciplinary approach encompassing comprehensive assessment, timely intervention, and collaborative care by the wound clinician with providers who can address critical aspects to achieve healing, including careful management of blood glucose levels and optimization of off-loading strategies.

- **Growth factors, G-CSFs**: These factors can be instrumental in promoting healing in such cases.

- **Hyperbaric oxygen therapy**: This therapy is recommended for certain slow-healing wounds to enhance recovery.

- **Negative pressure wound therapy**: This approach can be considered to aid in the treatment process.

### Interventions in the management of infection in the foot in diabetes: a systematic review [^111vJ5qQ]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2020). High credibility.

The optimal approaches to managing diabetic foot infections remain a challenge for clinicians. Despite an exponential rise in publications investigating different treatment strategies, the various agents studied generally produce comparable results, and high-quality data are scarce. In this systematic review, we searched the medical literature using the PubMed and Embase databases for published studies on the treatment of diabetic foot infections as of June 2018. This systematic review is an update of previous reviews, the first of which was undertaken in 2010 and the most recent in 2014, by the Infection Committee of the International Working Group of the Diabetic Foot. We defined the context of literature by formulating clinical questions of interest and then developing structured clinical questions (PICOs) to address these. We only included data from controlled studies of an intervention to prevent or cure a diabetic foot infection. Two independent reviewers selected articles for inclusion and then assessed their relevant outcomes and the methodological quality.

Our literature search identified a total of 15,327 articles, of which we selected 48 for full-text review; we added five more studies discovered by means other than the systematic literature search. Among these selected articles were 11 high-quality studies published in the last four years and two Cochrane systematic reviews. Overall, the outcomes in patients treated with the different antibiotic regimens for both skin and soft tissue infection and osteomyelitis of the diabetic foot were broadly equivalent across studies.

- **G-CSFs**: Avoid using granulocyte-colony stimulating factors.

- **Topical antiseptics or silver preparations**: These are not recommended for treatment.

- **Honey**: Usage is not advised.

- **Bacteriophage therapy**: Should be avoided in DFI management.

- **Negative pressure wound therapy (with or without instillation)**: This therapy is not recommended.

### Debridement of diabetic foot ulcers [^111MUCaP]. Advances in Wound Care (2022). Low credibility.

Debridement is currently considered a central component of conventional wound care. It is used to remove nonviable tissue, which may pose a risk of colonization and infection. Nonviable (necrotic) tissue can impede wound healing by obstructing cellular migration across the wound, inhibiting the normal development of the wound bed, and preventing granulation tissue formation.

Debridement enables the clinician to better gauge the size of the wound and may facilitate drainage. If a wound culture is clinically indicated, it should be obtained post-debridement. If cleansing of the wound is required before obtaining cultures, saline — not antiseptic solution — should be utilized to reduce false negative results for cultures taken from the wound.

The editorial board of the journal Wound Source reported on 12/31/2018 that critical colonization is defined as proliferating organisms with a host response but without invasion, and ≤ 105 organisms/gram of tissue. Critical colonization may present with subtle findings.

Treatment focuses on closing the wounds within the first 4–6 weeks of their development. Wounds that decrease their surface area by 20–40% within the first 4 weeks are considered to have a higher likelihood of closing. Desirable goals include reducing the time to complete healing, accelerating healing rates, and reducing the rates of wound recurrence.

If the wound is closed in a timely manner, the risks of complicating infections and amputation may be prevented.

### Can molecular DNA-based techniques unravel the truth about diabetic foot infections [^114cQ9dV]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Diabetic foot infections are a common condition and a major causal pathway to lower extremity amputation. Identification of causative pathogens is vital in directing antimicrobial therapy. Historically, clinicians have relied upon culture-dependent techniques that are acknowledged as being selective for microorganisms that thrive under the physiological and nutritional constraints of the microbiology laboratory. These techniques tend to grossly underestimate the microbial diversity of a sample. The amplification and sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene has revealed a diversity of microorganisms in diabetic foot infections, extending the view of the diabetic foot microbiome. The interpretation of these findings and their relevance to clinical care remains largely unexplored.

The advent of molecular methods that are culture-independent and employ massively parallel DNA sequencing technology represents a potential 'game changer'. Metagenomics, with its shotgun approach to surveying all DNA within a sample (whole genome sequencing), affords the possibility to characterize not only the microbial diversity within a diabetic foot infection (i.e. 'which microorganisms are present') but also the biological functions of the community, such as virulence and pathogenicity (i.e. 'what are the microorganisms capable of doing'), moving the focus from single species as pathogens to groups of species.

This review examines new molecular techniques for the exploration of the microbiome of infected and uninfected diabetic foot ulcers, exploring the potential of these new technologies and speculating on how they might advance clinical practice.

### Diabetic foot infections: State-of-the-art [^1131PbzH]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Foot infections are frequent and potentially devastating complications of diabetes. Unchecked, infection can progress contiguously to involve the deeper soft tissues and ultimately the bone. Foot ulcers in people with diabetes are most often the consequence of one or more of the following: peripheral sensory neuropathy, motor neuropathy and gait disorders, peripheral arterial insufficiency, or immunological impairments. Infection develops in over half of foot ulcers and is the factor that most often leads to lower extremity amputation. These amputations are associated with substantial morbidity, reduced quality of life, and major financial costs.

Most infections can be successfully treated with optimal wound care, antibiotic therapy, and surgical procedures. Employing evidence-based guidelines, multidisciplinary teams, and institution-specific clinical pathways provides the best approach to guide clinicians through this multifaceted problem. All clinicians regularly seeing people with diabetes should have an understanding of how to prevent, diagnose, and treat foot infections. This requires familiarity with the pathophysiology of the problem and the literature supporting currently recommended care.

### Moderate to severe soft tissue diabetic foot infections: A randomized, controlled, pilot trial of post-debridement antibiotic treatment for 10 versus 20 days [^115BDN74]. Annals of Surgery (2022). High credibility.

The primary outcome was the rate of clinical remission in patients with short course versus long course antibiotic therapy, assessed at a minimum follow-up of 2 months after the end of treatment. The secondary outcome was the incidence of adverse events (AEs) in these two groups. We pre-estimated an incidence of 80% of remission and an incidence of 20% of AEs, respectively, based on prior publications. Using a binomial, categorical, non-inferiority design with an alpha level of 5% and a statistical power of 80%, we required 2x32 (64) episodes for each antibiotic duration group to achieve a non-inferiority margin of 25%.

For the formal non-inferiority assessment, we used the t-test with a unidirectional confidence interval of 90%. To adjust for the case-mix, we planned a multivariate cluster-controlled Cox regression analysis with the outcome "clinical remission" (clustering at the individual patient level). As this was a randomized controlled trial (RCT), the use of a propensity score or any other matching was unnecessary. The intention-to-treat (ITT) population consisted of all randomized and enrolled episodes, while the per-protocol (PP) population included all participants who completed the study and whose treatment did not substantially deviate from the protocol. For statistical analysis, we used STATA software (Version 15.0; College Station, TX).

### Diabetes-related foot infections: Diagnosis and treatment [^1128w9RX]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Diabetes-related foot infections occur in approximately 40% of diabetes-related foot ulcers and cause significant morbidity. Clinicians should consider patient risk factors, such as the presence of foot ulcers greater than 2 cm, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, poor vascular perfusion, and comorbid illnesses when evaluating for a foot infection or osteomyelitis.

Indicators of infection include erythema, induration, tenderness, warmth, and drainage. Superficial wound cultures should be avoided due to the high rate of contamination. Deep cultures obtained through aseptic procedures, such as incision and drainage, debridement, or bone culture, help guide treatment.

Plain radiography is used for initial imaging if osteomyelitis is suspected. However, magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography may be helpful if radiography is inconclusive, the extent of infection is unknown, or if the infection's orientation needs to be determined for surgical planning.

Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae are the most commonly isolated pathogens, although polymicrobial infections are common. Antibiotic therapy should cover commonly isolated organisms and reflect local resistance patterns, patient preference, and the severity of the infection. Mild and some moderate infections may be treated with oral antibiotics, while severe infections require intravenous antibiotics. Treatment typically lasts one to two weeks and is longer for slowly resolving infections or osteomyelitis. Severe or persistent infections may require surgery and specialized team-based wound care.

### Predictors of lower-extremity amputation in patients with an infected diabetic foot ulcer [^115AJGma]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

Infection frequently complicates diabetic foot ulcers and is associated with a poor outcome. In a cohort of individuals with an infected diabetic foot ulcer, we aimed to determine independent predictors of lower-extremity amputation and the predictive value for amputation of the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) classification system. We also sought to develop a risk score for predicting amputation.

We prospectively studied 575 patients with an infected diabetic foot ulcer presenting to 1 of 14 diabetic foot clinics across 10 European countries. Among these patients, 159 (28%) underwent an amputation. Independent risk factors for amputation were periwound edema, foul smell, (non)purulent exudate, deep ulcer, positive probe-to-bone test, pretibial edema, fever, and elevated C-reactive protein. Increasing IWGDF severity of infection also independently predicted amputation. We developed a risk score for any amputation and for amputations excluding the lesser toes, which included variables such as sex, pain on palpation, periwound edema, ulcer size, ulcer depth, and peripheral arterial disease. This risk score predicted amputation better than the IWGDF system (area under the ROC curves 0.80, 0.78, and 0.67, respectively).

For individuals with an infected diabetic foot ulcer, we identified independent predictors of amputation, validated the prognostic value of the IWGDF classification system, and developed a new risk score for amputation that can be readily used in daily clinical practice. Our risk score may have better predictive accuracy than existing methods.

### Executive summary: 2012 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of diabetic foot infections [^112VzzR1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Foot infections are a common and serious problem in persons with diabetes. Diabetic foot infections (DFIs) typically begin in a wound, most often a neuropathic ulceration. While all wounds are colonized with microorganisms, the presence of infection is defined by ≥ 2 classic findings of inflammation or purulence. Infections are then classified into mild (superficial and limited in size and depth), moderate (deeper or more extensive), or severe (accompanied by systemic signs or metabolic perturbations).

This classification system, along with a vascular assessment, helps determine which patients should be hospitalized, which may require special imaging procedures or surgical interventions, and which will require amputation. Most DFIs are polymicrobial, with aerobic gram-positive cocci (GPC) and especially staphylococci being the most common causative organisms. Aerobic gram-negative bacilli are frequently copathogens in infections that are chronic or follow antibiotic treatment, and obligate anaerobes may be copathogens in ischemic or necrotic wounds.

Wounds without evidence of soft tissue or bone infection do not require antibiotic therapy. For infected wounds, obtain a post-debridement specimen (preferably of tissue) for aerobic and anaerobic culture. Empiric antibiotic therapy can be narrowly targeted at GPC in many acutely infected patients, but those at risk for infection with antibiotic-resistant organisms or with chronic, previously treated, or severe infections usually require broader spectrum regimens. Imaging is helpful in most DFIs; plain radiographs may be sufficient.

### Prognosis of the infected diabetic foot ulcer: A 12-month prospective observational study [^115UDqBq]. Diabetic Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

This is the first prospective study to estimate the incidence of healing and prognostic factors associated with healing in people with a clinically infected diabetic foot ulcer, specifically in the presence of competing risks of amputation and death. Outcomes for people with a clinically infected diabetic foot ulcer are poorer than previously thought; in the first year after presentation with an infected ulcer, 15.1% of our participants had died and 17.4% underwent at least partial lower extremity amputation. Healing incidence within 1 year was 44.5% (95% CI 38.9 to 50.1).

Three key factors served as the best independent predictors of healing:

- **PEDIS perfusion grade**: The perfusion aspect of the PEDIS classification is a significant predictor.
- **Absence of multiple foot ulcers**: Single ulcers had better healing outcomes.
- **Shorter ulcer duration**: Ulcers of shorter duration were more likely to heal.

The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) has published evidence-based guidelines on the prevention and management of diabetic foot disease since 1999. This guideline addresses the diagnosis and treatment of foot infection in persons with diabetes and updates the 2015 IWGDF infection guideline. Based on patient, intervention, comparison, and outcomes (PICOs) developed by the infection committee, along with contributions from internal and external reviewers and consultants, as well as systematic reviews conducted by the committee on the diagnosis of infection (new) and treatment of infection (updated from 2015), we present 27 recommendations.

- **Diagnosis and classification**: These recommendations cover various aspects of diagnosing soft tissue and bone infections, including a classification scheme for diagnosing infection and its severity. Notably, we have updated this scheme for the first time since its development 15 years ago.

- **Microbiology of infections**: We review the microbiology of diabetic foot infections, including methods for collecting samples and processing them to identify causative pathogens.

- **Treatment approach**: The guideline discusses the approach to treating diabetic foot infections, focusing on selecting appropriate empiric and definitive antimicrobial therapy for soft tissue and bone infections. Additionally, it outlines when and how to approach surgical treatment and evaluates which adjunctive treatments are considered useful for the infectious aspects of diabetic foot problems.

For this version of the guideline, we also updated four tables and one figure from the 2016 guideline. We believe that adhering to the principles of diagnosing and treating diabetic foot infections outlined in this guideline will enhance patient care.

### Topical antimicrobial agents for treating foot ulcers in people with diabetes [^1135MiKH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

People with diabetes are at high risk for developing foot ulcers, which often become infected. These wounds, especially when infected, cause substantial morbidity. Wound treatments should aim to alleviate symptoms, promote healing, and avoid adverse outcomes, especially lower extremity amputation. Topical antimicrobial therapy has been used on diabetic foot ulcers, either as a treatment for clinically infected wounds or to prevent infection in clinically uninfected wounds.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of treatment with topical antimicrobial agents on: the resolution of signs and symptoms of infection; the healing of infected diabetic foot ulcers; and preventing infection and improving healing in clinically uninfected diabetic foot ulcers.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations), Ovid Embase, and EBSCO CINAHL Plus in August 2016. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies and checked reference lists to identify additional studies. We used no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication, or study setting.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials conducted in any setting (inpatient or outpatient) that evaluated topical treatment with any type of solid or liquid (e.g. cream, gel, ointment) antimicrobial agent, including antiseptics, antibiotics, and antimicrobial dressings, in people with diabetes mellitus who were diagnosed with an ulcer or open wound of the foot.

Surgical management of infections

Some patients with moderate infections, and virtually all patients with severe infections, will require some type of surgical intervention. A limb preservation team must be able to perform bedside and intraoperative incision and debridement to decompress limb-threatening abscesses and debride nonviable tissue. Surgeons involved in this care should have knowledge and interest in this aspect of limb preservation. If insufficient blood flow to the extremities impairs delivery of antibiotics or oxygen, revascularization should be done as soon as the major infection has been adequately addressed. In this regard, prompt drainage of infection with or without partial foot amputation takes priority over revascularization.

With the exception of a limb or life-threatening infection, it is best to optimize the patient's medical condition prior to surgical intervention. It is usually best not to delay needed surgery while monitoring the response to antibiotic therapy. If a delay in operative intervention is likely, appropriate deep cultures should be obtained before starting broad-spectrum antibiotics. Although surgery for soft tissue infections may need to be done urgently or emergently (especially for necrotizing or gas-forming infections), resection of infected bone (if needed) can usually be undertaken electively. Available evidence does not support the benefits of most available adjunctive treatments, although some patients may benefit from treatment with negative pressure wound therapy, granulocyte colony-stimulating factors, or hyperbaric oxygen.

### The role of novel antibiotics in the management of diabetic foot infection [^112vZ79d]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Diabetic foot infection is a frequent and potentially life-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus. Antibiotic treatment is the cornerstone of management for diabetic foot infection, but the rising prevalence of antibiotic resistance has resulted in increasing rates of treatment failure. In this context, the development of several novel antibiotics might represent a useful tool in severe diabetic foot infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria. In the present review, we summarize the safety and efficacy of novel antibiotics in patients with diabetic foot infection. Relevant data are limited, and randomized controlled studies that evaluated the role of these agents in this field are lacking. Until more robust data are available, cefiderocol and dalbavancin, which have been studied more extensively in patients with bone infections, might be attractive options in carefully selected patients with severe diabetic foot infection.

Regarding medical management for diabetic foot infection, particularly concerning definitive antibiotic therapy, the IDSA 2012 guidelines recommend choosing the route of therapy primarily based on infection severity. Parenteral therapy is preferred for all severe and some moderate infections, at least initially. A switch to oral agents is advised when the patient is systemically well and culture results are available.

### The role of novel antibiotics in the management of diabetic foot infection [^114Tu1q6]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Several antibiotics have been developed in the last decade, and some of them appear to hold promise as therapeutic options in patients with diabetic foot infection. However, there are very limited data regarding the safety of these novel antibiotics in patients with diabetic foot infection, and randomized controlled studies in this field are lacking. Until more robust data are available, cefiderocol and dalbavancin, which have been studied more extensively in patients with bone infections, might be attractive options in carefully selected patients with severe diabetic foot infection. To avoid the emergence of resistance to these novel antibiotics, their use should be limited to patients with severe diabetic foot infection caused by bacteria susceptible only to these antibiotics and no other treatment options.

Regarding the diagnostic investigations for diabetic foot infections, particularly in relation to physical examination, the IDSA 2012 guidelines recommend assessing for classic signs of inflammation, such as redness, warmth, swelling, tenderness, or pain, as well as purulent secretions. It is also important to evaluate for additional or secondary signs, including non-purulent secretions, friable or discolored granulation tissue, undermining of wound edges, and foul odor. These assessments are crucial for the accurate evaluation of diabetic foot infections.

### IWGDF/IDSA guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes-related foot infections (IWGDF/IDSA 2023) [^114Sk8Wd]. Diabetes/metabolism research and reviews (2024). High credibility.

The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) has published evidence-based guidelines on the management and prevention of diabetes-related foot diseases since 1999. The present guideline is an update of the 2019 IWGDF guideline on the diagnosis and management of foot infections in persons with diabetes mellitus. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was used for the development of this guideline. This framework was structured around identifying clinically relevant questions in the P(A)ICO format, determining patient-important outcomes, systematically reviewing the evidence, assessing the certainty of the evidence, and finally moving from evidence to the recommendation.

This guideline was developed for healthcare professionals involved in diabetes-related foot care to inform clinical care around patient-important outcomes. Two systematic reviews from 2019 were updated to inform this guideline, and a total of 149 studies (62 new) meeting inclusion criteria were identified from the updated search and incorporated in this guideline. Updated recommendations are derived from these systematic reviews, and best practice statements were made where evidence was not available. Evidence was weighed in light of benefits and harms to arrive at a recommendation. The certainty of the evidence for some recommendations was modified in this update with a more refined application of the GRADE framework centred around patient-important outcomes. This is highlighted in the rationale section of this update. A note is also made where the newly id

Foot infections are a common and serious problem in persons with diabetes. Diabetic foot infections (DFIs) typically begin in a wound, most often a neuropathic ulceration. While all wounds are colonized with microorganisms, the presence of infection is defined by exhibiting two or more classic findings of inflammation or purulence. Infections are then classified into mild (superficial and limited in size and depth), moderate (deeper or more extensive), or severe (accompanied by systemic signs or metabolic perturbations). This classification system, along with a vascular assessment, helps determine:

- **Patient management**: Which patients should be hospitalized, which may require special imaging procedures or surgical interventions, and which will require amputation.

Most DFIs are polymicrobial, with aerobic gram-positive cocci (GPC), and especially staphylococci, being the most common causative organisms. Aerobic gram-negative bacilli are frequently copathogens in infections that are chronic or follow antibiotic treatment, and obligate anaerobes may be copathogens in ischemic or necrotic wounds. Wounds without evidence of soft tissue or bone infection do not require antibiotic therapy.

For infected wounds:

- **Specimen collection**: Obtain a post-debridement specimen (preferably of tissue) for aerobic and anaerobic culture.

- **Antibiotic therapy**: Empiric antibiotic therapy can be narrowly targeted at GPC in many acutely infected patients, but those at risk for infection with antibiotic-resistant organisms or with chronic, previously treated, or severe infections usually require broader-spectrum regimens.

Imaging is helpful in most DFIs; plain radiographs may be sufficient.

### A report from the International Consensus on Diagnosing and Treating the Infected Diabetic Foot [^112pcKEh]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

In persons with diabetes, foot infection — characterized as the invasion and multiplication of microorganisms in tissues, accompanied by tissue destruction or a host inflammatory response — usually begins with skin trauma or ulceration. While most foot infections remain superficial, they can spread to subcutaneous tissues, including muscle, joints, and bone. Many diabetic foot ulcers eventually lead to an amputation, with infection playing a role in approximately 60% of cases. Neuropathy is the main factor leading to skin breaks, while arterial perfusion largely affects infection outcome. Among the factors predisposing diabetic patients to foot infections are ill-defined immunological perturbations. Additionally, foot anatomy may foster the proximal spread of infection and ischemic necrosis.

### Correlation of adherence to the 2012 Infectious Diseases Society of America practice guidelines with patient outcomes in the treatment of diabetic foot infections in an outpatient parenteral antimicrobial programme [^112v9Das]. Diabetic Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate adherence to the 2012 Infectious Diseases Society of America practice guidelines for managing patients with diabetic foot infections and to determine an association between adherence and clinical outcomes.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review was performed to evaluate the management and clinical outcomes of patients with diabetic foot infections treated with outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy between January 1, 2011, and June 30, 2012, at Wishard Health Services/Eskenazi Health. Adherence to individual Infectious Diseases Society of America diabetic foot infection treatment guideline recommendations was measured and then assessed in relation to clinical outcomes.

- **Results**: A total of 57 patients (61% male, mean age 54 years) with moderate to severe diabetic foot infections met the inclusion criteria. None of the treatment courses of these patients adhered to all the Infectious Diseases Society of America guideline recommendations. The recommendations most frequently adhered to were the consultation of appropriate multidisciplinary teams (n = 54, 94.7%) and the performance of diagnostic imaging (n = 52, 89.5%). The recommendations least frequently adhered to were diabetic foot wound classification scoring on admission (n = 0, 0%), appropriate culture acquisition (n = 12, 21.2%), surgical intervention when indicated (n = 32, 46.2%), and appropriate empiric antibiotic selection (n = 34, 59.7%). Of the 56 patients, 52 (92.9%) experienced clinical cure at the end of outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy compared with 34 of 53 patients (64%) at 6 months after the completion.

### Wound healing — a practical algorithm [^115ZPoUQ]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

The decision-making process involved in the management of diabetic foot wounds is complex but hinges on certain simple principles. The first principle is to agree on the actual aim of management with the patient or their representative — healing of an open wound may only be a part of this. The agreed plan should be discussed and reviewed if the wound is unresponsive to intervention.

Management depends on regular debridement and cleansing, treatment of any infection, consideration of revascularization, and protection of the wound by dressings and off-loading. The evidence to justify the use of advanced wound care therapies is not strong, and outcome depends more on the organization of the wound care process than on the choice of a particular wound care product.

The introduction of an expert multidisciplinary team has been shown to lead to a very significant reduction in the incidence of major amputation. It is likely that the availability or otherwise of prompt expert advice is the principal explanation of the major variations that are known to exist in the incidence of amputation, even within single countries.
