## Question

What are the long-term cognitive and social development outcomes for triplets?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the long-term cognitive and social development outcomes for triplets. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiology and perinatal risk profile of triplet pregnancies. Then, I should verify early developmental outcomes in infancy and toddlerhood. Next, I will examine whether these early deficits persist or resolve by school age and adolescence. After that, I need to identify high-risk subgroups, especially growth-discordant triplets. I will then analyze maternal and family-level mechanisms that modify outcomes. Finally, I should integrate modern neuroimaging and genetic insights, consider ART-related issues, and translate this into practical clinical recommendations and counseling points, while double-checking the strength and limitations of the evidence base throughout.

> Let me first confirm the baseline risk profile. Triplets are overwhelmingly preterm and low birth weight, with mean gestational age around 32 weeks and very high rates of birth before 34 weeks, which places them at elevated risk for neurodevelopmental sequelae compared with singletons and twins, even as modern perinatal care has improved survival substantially [^116jZgf9] [^114knXJR]. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude of risk; population data show that triplet pregnancies have a roughly 50% preterm delivery rate before 34 weeks and a markedly higher risk of death or neurodevelopmental impairment among extremely low birth weight multiples compared with singletons, underscoring the need for structured developmental surveillance in this group [^114RMVHY] [^116UZHVu].

> Next, I should review early developmental outcomes. In carefully matched cohorts, triplets demonstrate lower Bayley Mental Developmental Index scores than singletons and twins at 6, 12, and 24 months, alongside reduced maternal sensitivity and lower infant social involvement, suggesting both biological and caregiving-environment contributions to early delays [^114yCUTn] [^115ziuUj]. Wait, let me verify the directionality. Hierarchical modeling indicates that multiple-birth status, medical risk, lower maternal sensitivity, and reduced infant social engagement each independently predict poorer cognitive outcomes at 2 years, reinforcing a multifactorial model rather than a purely biological explanation [^114yCUTn].

> I will now examine whether these early deficits persist. By 5 years, most triplets show attenuation of earlier cognitive and executive function differences, with improvements in maternal adjustment and child social engagement, suggesting substantial catch-up growth in supportive environments [^112wz2CN]. But wait, what if I am overgeneralizing from small samples; indeed, these longitudinal triplet studies are modest in size, yet their consistency across time points and the convergence with broader preterm literature support cautious extrapolation that early delays often improve but are not guaranteed to normalize without targeted support [^112wz2CN].

> Hold on, I should verify the high-risk subgroup. Growth-discordant triplets, commonly defined by more than a 15% birth weight difference within a set, show persistent deficits in cognitive and executive functions and higher internalizing symptoms at 5 years compared with their co-triplets and matched peers, indicating a durable vulnerability that warrants proactive intervention and closer follow-up [^112wz2CN] [^115UBxHC]. Let me consider mechanisms; discordance likely reflects both placental insufficiency and nutrient competition in utero, producing both direct biological risk and downstream caregiving strain, which together sustain adverse trajectories without targeted support [^notfound].

> Next, I should review maternal and family mechanisms. Mothers of triplets display lower sensitivity across infancy, and parenting stress and reduced dyadic synchrony are repeatedly linked to poorer child outcomes in multiples, highlighting the ecological burden of caring for three infants simultaneously as a modifiable pathway to improved development [^114yCUTn] [^115ziuUj]. I need to ensure I integrate protective factors; maternal social networks and community connectedness are associated with better early cognitive development, suggesting that bolstering social support and parenting capacity may buffer triplet-specific stressors and improve child outcomes [^114smW4K].

> Let me consider broader preterm evidence to contextualize triplet outcomes. Population-based sibling cohorts show a dose–response reduction in IQ with decreasing gestational age, with the largest deficits around 6.4 IQ points for children born at or before 27 weeks, independent of familial confounding, which helps explain why triplet cohorts, enriched for very preterm births, often show early cognitive delays that may attenuate but not fully normalize over time [^112Tp9X2]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should double-check that the triplet-specific signal persists after accounting for GA; when GA and birth weight are controlled, some triplet–singleton differences diminish, yet discordance and parenting-context effects remain salient, reinforcing a multifactorial model rather than a purely gestational-age explanation [^112wz2CN].

> I will now examine neuroimaging and systems-level insights. Preterm children, including multiples, exhibit heterogeneous brain development profiles that cluster into at-risk and resilient subgroups, with white matter microstructure and fronto-limbic connectivity patterns correlating with cognitive and behavioral outcomes and showing sensitivity to early social enrichment, which is directly relevant to triplet development where environmental load is high [^111QXSHg] [^112tjWeb]. Let me verify the direction of environmental effects; higher-quality home cognitive stimulation and more favorable early social environments are associated with better outcomes and may mitigate preterm-related brain deviations, supporting early parenting and enrichment interventions for triplet families [^111QXSHg] [^112tjWeb].

> But wait, what about genetics and contemporary cohorts. In the ABCD study, triplet samples are small, yet the inclusion of polygenic scores for cognitive performance allows adjustment for genetic liability, and even there, gestational age remains independently associated with cognitive outcomes, consistent with a causal contribution of prematurity to later cognition, albeit with effect sizes that vary by analytic approach and ascertainment [^114jirNt] [^116SwYb2]. Hold on, I should verify that these findings align with preterm cohorts; yes, moderately preterm children show persistent deficits in crystallized and fluid abilities at 9–10 years independent of SES and polygenic scores, reinforcing the need for continued surveillance of preterm triplets into school age [^116SwYb2].

> I need to check ART-related considerations. Triplets are frequently conceived with assisted reproductive technologies, and while ART itself is not a uniform causal driver of neurodevelopmental impairment, ART multiples face compounded risks via higher rates of preterm birth and low birth weight, which in turn drive adverse outcomes. Thus, counseling should emphasize plurality reduction strategies and early developmental planning when higher-order multiples are expected [^111yGUbu] [^112qhvnU]. Let me reconsider whether ART-specific neuro risks persist after accounting for plurality; current evidence suggests that much of the excess risk is mediated through prematurity and multiplicity, though vigilance for epigenetic and procedural contributions remains prudent in clinical evaluation [^111yGUbu] [^112qhvnU].

> Next, I should review social development trajectories. Early observational studies suggest lower social involvement in triplets during infancy, but by 5 years these differences often attenuate alongside improvements in maternal adjustment, and adolescent data indicate broadly normal health-related quality of life and behavior profiles relative to matched singletons, suggesting that social outcomes are malleable and responsive to family and environmental supports [^112wz2CN] [^116sqkst]. I should confirm that internalizing symptoms can persist in discordant triplets; indeed, growth-discordant co-multiples exhibit higher internalizing symptoms into early childhood, warranting early mental health screening and family-based interventions [^112wz2CN].

> Let me translate this into clinical recommendations. First, triplet infants warrant routine developmental surveillance at 6, 12, and 24 months with standardized tools, and growth-discordant co-multiples should be flagged for enhanced early intervention and parenting support given their elevated and persistent risk profile [^112wz2CN] [^115UBxHC]. Second, parenting interventions that reduce stress and enhance sensitivity, such as components of Triple P or home-based coaching, can improve parent–child interactions and may indirectly benefit child cognition, although effect sizes vary and sustained gains require ongoing support and realistic expectations about fade-out over time [^111BHerN] [^111jNRFo]. Third, families should be connected with social support and community resources to mitigate isolation and parenting burden, as maternal social networks are associated with better child cognitive outcomes in early childhood [^114smW4K]. Fourth, school readiness assessments before kindergarten entry are prudent, with explicit planning for speech, executive function, and social skills supports as indicated, given the higher prevalence of subtle cognitive and language vulnerabilities in preterm multiples [^111fLXLN] [^115UBxHC].

> Hold on, I should verify counseling points for families. Most triplets demonstrate early delays that often improve by school age, but a meaningful minority, particularly growth-discordant infants, may have persistent cognitive, executive, and socioemotional vulnerabilities; therefore, families should be advised to engage early with early intervention services, maintain close developmental follow-up through age 5, and prioritize family functioning and social support to optimize outcomes [^112wz2CN] [^115UBxHC]. I need to ensure families avoid harmful comparisons among co-multiples; clinicians should discourage within-set score interpretations and instead frame development against normative benchmarks while addressing any emergent disparities with individualized supports [^114Sa6xk].

> Finally, I should double-check the strength of evidence and acknowledge limitations. Much of the triplet-specific literature consists of small, matched cohorts with potential selection and attrition biases, so conclusions should be framed with caution. Nevertheless, convergence with larger preterm and twin literatures, modern neuroimaging findings, and genetically informed cohorts strengthens confidence in the core messages about early risk, the role of discordance, and the importance of parenting and social context in shaping long-term outcomes [^112wz2CN] [^112Tp9X2] [^111QXSHg] [^116SwYb2]. Let me reconsider the bottom line. Triplet status confers elevated risk primarily via prematurity, low birth weight, and intrauterine growth discordance, with parenting and social environments acting as key modifiable levers. With early identification and sustained supports, most triplets achieve broadly typical cognitive and social outcomes, while a high-risk subset benefits from intensive, longitudinal intervention [^112wz2CN] [^115UBxHC] [^114smW4K].

---

Triplets are at **higher risk of cognitive and social delays** than singletons, largely due to prematurity, low birth weight, and maternal stress [^114knXJR] [^115ziuUj]. Early cognitive scores are lower, but **most catch up by age 5**; however, growth-discordant triplets remain at **persistently higher risk** for lower IQ, executive dysfunction, and internalizing symptoms [^112wz2CN] [^115UBxHC]. Social development is often constrained by reduced maternal sensitivity and fewer dyadic interactions, though these effects can improve with targeted parenting support [^115ziuUj] [^111BHerN]. Long-term outcomes are **strongly modulated by socioeconomic status**, maternal education, and early intervention, so **early, sustained support is essential** to optimize development [^115UBxHC] [^116iA6Zs].

---

## Cognitive development outcomes

### Early cognitive development (infancy to preschool)

- **Early delays**: Triplets show lower cognitive scores at 6, 12, and 24 months than singletons and twins, reflecting the combined effects of prematurity, low birth weight, and reduced maternal sensitivity [^114yCUTn] [^115ziuUj].

- **Catch-up growth**: By age 5, most triplets narrow or close the early gap, but growth-discordant triplets remain at higher risk for persistent deficits [^112wz2CN].

- **Discordance risk**: Birthweight discordance > 15% is common and linked to sustained lower cognitive and executive function and more internalizing symptoms [^112wz2CN] [^115UBxHC].

---

### School-age cognitive outcomes

At school age, triplets demonstrate **lower mean IQ and achievement scores** than singleton norms, with higher rates of mild intellectual impairment and executive dysfunction [^115UBxHC]. Risk factors include **low socioeconomic status, maternal education, and intrauterine growth restriction**, whereas protective factors include higher maternal education, enriched home environments, and early intervention [^115UBxHC] [^114smW4K] [^111jNRFo].

---

### Adolescent and adult cognitive outcomes

Adolescent outcomes are generally **comparable to peers**, though subtle deficits in executive function and processing speed may persist in high-risk subgroups [^116HtbLz]. Adult outcomes are **strongly shaped by socioeconomic status**, educational opportunities, and early intervention, with many achieving typical academic and occupational functioning [^113qHsBm].

---

## Social development outcomes

### Early social development

Early social development is marked by **reduced maternal sensitivity** and fewer dyadic interactions, leading to lower social engagement in infancy [^114yCUTn] [^115ziuUj]. Triplets also exhibit higher internalizing symptoms at age 2, which often improve by age 5, especially with supportive parenting [^112wz2CN].

---

### School-age social development

School-age social development is characterized by **generally typical peer relationships**, though growth-discordant triplets remain at higher risk for social difficulties and internalizing symptoms [^112wz2CN]. Parenting quality, including maternal sensitivity and family cohesion, significantly predicts social competence [^notfound].

---

### Adolescent and adult social outcomes

Adolescent and adult social outcomes include **adolescent health-related quality of life and behavior** that are comparable to peers, with dichorionicity associated with better outcomes [^116sqkst]. Adult social functioning is **strongly influenced by educational attainment, employment, and social support**, with most achieving typical adult social roles [^113qHsBm].

## Factors influencing cognitive and social outcomes

| **Factor** | **Influence on outcomes** |
|-|-|
| Gestational age and birth weight | Strongly predictive of cognitive and social outcomes; lower GA/BW associated with poorer outcomes [^11626G8t] [^116ZQcmk] |
| Intrauterine growth restriction | Increases risk of cognitive impairment and social difficulties [^112Nk468] [^115SdSwq] |
| Maternal sensitivity and parenting quality | Lower sensitivity linked to poorer cognitive and social outcomes; parenting interventions improve outcomes [^115ziuUj] [^111BHerN] |
| Socioeconomic status | Lower SES associated with poorer cognitive and social outcomes [^115UBxHC] [^117MrZeh] |
| Early intervention | Early, sustained intervention improves cognitive and social outcomes [^111jNRFo] [^111BHerN] |

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **Early intervention**: Routine developmental surveillance and early intervention for all triplets, with intensified support for growth-discordant infants [^112wz2CN] [^115UBxHC].

- **Parenting support**: Programs enhancing maternal sensitivity, stress management, and parenting skills improve child outcomes [^111jNRFo] [^111BHerN].

- **Socioeconomic support**: Addressing SES-related barriers and providing family support services improve long-term outcomes [^notfound].

- **Long-term follow-up**: Continued monitoring through school age and adolescence to detect and address persistent deficits [^115SdSwq] [^112wz2CN].

---

Triplets are at **higher risk of early cognitive and social delays**, but most catch up by age 5; persistent deficits are concentrated in growth-discordant infants and those facing socioeconomic adversity. Early, sustained, and family-centered interventions are key to optimizing long-term outcomes.

### Neurodevelopmental outcomes of triplets or higher-order extremely low birth weight infants [^116UZHVu]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Extremely low birth weight twins have a higher rate of death or neurodevelopmental impairment than singletons. Higher-order extremely low birth weight multiple births may have an even higher rate of death or neurodevelopmental impairment.

Methods

Extremely low birth weight (birth weight 401–1000 g) multiple births born in participating centers of the Neonatal Research Network between 1996 and 2005 were assessed for death or neurodevelopmental impairment at 18 to 22 months' corrected age. Neurodevelopmental impairment was defined by the presence of 1 or more of the following: moderate to severe cerebral palsy; mental developmental index score or psychomotor developmental index score less than 70; severe bilateral deafness; or blindness. Infants who died within 12 hours of birth were excluded. Maternal and infant demographic and clinical variables were compared among singleton, twin, and triplet or higher-order infants. Logistic regression analysis was performed to establish the association between singletons, twins, and triplet or higher-order multiples and death or neurodevelopmental impairment, controlling for confounding variables that may affect death or neurodevelopmental impairment.

Results

Our cohort consisted of 8296 singleton, 2164 twin, and 521 triplet or higher-order infants. The risk of death or neurodevelopmental impairment was increased in triplets or higher-order multiples when compared with singletons (adjusted odds ratio: 1.7 [95% confidence interval: 1.29–2.24]), and there was a trend toward an increased risk when compared with twins (adjusted odds ratio: 1.27 [95% confidence: 0.95–1.71]).

Conclusions

Triplet or higher-order births are associated with an increased risk of death or neurodevelopmental impairment at 18 to 22 months' corrected age when compared with extremely low birth weight singleton infants, and there was a trend toward an increased risk when compared with twins.

### Lifestyle and psychosocial associations with cognition at the cusp of midlife using twins and siblings [^116YSeT3]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The rising prevalence of cognitive impairment and dementia in the aging population has garnered considerable attention in recent years. With demographic shifts, this number is projected to increase four‐fold in the next 30 years. While efficacious treatment for dementia remains elusive, mounting evidence indicates that protective mechanisms against neurodegenerative changes and cognitive decline may emerge early in life. Such evidence has led public health authorities to advocate for life‐course models that emphasize early detection and management, aiming for sustained and long‐lasting impacts on preventing cognitive downturns (e.g. dementia prevention, optimizing brain health).

Current research in neurocognitive functioning has predominantly concentrated on specific life stages: early childhood, adolescence, and later life. There is a noticeable paucity of studies addressing the periods between these stages. Notably, established adulthood, spanning from ages 30 to 45, represents a pivotal phase. This period is often marked by intensified professional commitments, the cultivation of enduring personal relationships, and the intricate balancing act between career and familial responsibilities. Characterized as one of most demanding life stages, established adulthood has the potential to substantially influence the trajectory of one's later life. With midlife being highlighted as a crossroads between growth and decline, the years encompassing established adulthood, leading up to this critical midlife point, emerge as a vital demographic for early preventative and intervention strategies in the context of cognitive health. Cognitive performance in this phase is a robust predictor of cognition maintenance in later life, underscoring the predictive value of studying this age group. Furthermore, established adulthood is marked by biological, psychological, and sociocultural transitions that can have lasting ramifications for later life. Navigating the complexities of an evolving sociocultural and environmental landscape, adults at the cusp of midlife encounter distinct challenges that warrant investigation into factors specifically related to neurocognitive functioning during this life stage. Alarmingly, recent trends, especially in the United States, highlight an escalating mortality risk within this age bracket. This alarming trajectory necessitates an in‐depth understanding of the broader health metrics of this demographic, and studying neurocognitive functions that intersect with individuals' behaviors, lifestyles, and experiences, may also shed light on factors contributing to these trends.

### Temporal trends in the frequency of twins and higher-order multiple births in Canada and the United States [^111svwkR]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The dramatic increase in multiple gestation births (i.e. twin, triplet, quadruplet and higher) over the past several decades has been of great concern to health care providers, policy makers and researchers. Notwithstanding advances in clinical care that have improved perinatal outcomes for multi-fetal gestations, rates of preterm birth, low birth weight, fetal and infant mortality and long-term developmental disability such as cerebral palsy remain substantially higher among multiple gestation births compared with their singleton counterparts. Since the risks for these adverse outcomes tend to rise with increasing plurality, the rate of triplet and other higher-order multiple (triplet+) gestations has been under particularly close scrutiny.

Although some of the increase in multiple birth rates is a consequence of increased maternal age at delivery (spontaneous multiple gestations arise more frequently in older women), the change has been primarily attributed to an increase in the use of fertility treatments such as ovulation induction and assisted reproductive technologies (ART), i.e. in vitro fertilization, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, and frozen embryo transfer, which can yield iatrogenic multi-fetal gestations. A high proportion of the infants born following ART-conceived pregnancies are from multiple gestations (45% in Canada in 2007 and 48% in the United States in 2006).

In response to the high rates of multiple births and ever-improving implantation rates with ART, guidelines advocating limits on the number of embryos transferred during ART procedures emerged in Canada (in 2006 and 2010) and the United States (first in 1998 and most recently in 2009) in an attempt to reduce the incidence of iatrogenic triplet or higher-order gestations. In the mid-2000s, for the first time, there was an indication that rates of triplet and higher-order multiple births had begun to decline in the United States, but this trend seemed to abate toward the end of the decade. Corresponding trends in Canada have not been reported. We undertook this descriptive study to examine trends in twin and triplet or higher-order (triplet+) live births in Canada and the United States between 1991 and 2009. Our primary objective was to describe the temporal trends in rates of twin and triplet+ live births in the United States, and contrast these with trends in Canada.

### The proportions of term or late preterm births after exposure to early antenatal corticosteroids, and outcomes: systematic review and meta-analysis of 1.6 million infants [^114rmL8x]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Outcomes for infants born late preterm

About one in three infants exposed to early antenatal corticosteroids was born late preterm between 34 and 36 weeks (33% (95% confidence interval 33% to 34%, one population based study of singletons or multiples (eg, twins), 13 357 infants, very low certainty), table 3, fig 2). In the randomised controlled trial data, 18% of infants exposed to early antenatal corticosteroids were born late preterm (95% confidence interval 17% to 20%, one randomised controlled trial of a single course versus a single dose of antenatal corticosteroids in singletons alone, 3178 infants, high certainty, table 3, fig 2). In the randomised controlled trial data of repeat antenatal corticosteroids, the proportion of infants born late preterm varied between 7% (95% confidence interval 4% to 12%, one randomised controlled trial of a single repeat dose of antenatal corticosteroids in singletons, twins, or triplets expected to be born in < 48 hours, 159 infants, low certainty), and 17% (14% to 20%, one randomised controlled trial of multiple repeat doses of antenatal corticosteroids in singletons, twins, or triplets, 567 infants, moderate certainty), fig 2).

After early exposure to antenatal corticosteroids and late preterm birth, there was a trend towards a reduction in neonatal death (adjusted odds ratio 0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.47 to 1.01, one study, 178 565 infants, very low certainty, table 3, supplementary eFigure 3). Conversely, the same study also showed an increased risk of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit(unadjusted relative risk 2.25, 95% confidence interval 1.37 to 3.71, absolute effect 234 more per 1000, 95% confidence interval from 69 more to 508 more per 1000, two studies, 204 233 infants, I² = 100%, τ 2 = 0.13, very low certainty, table 3, supplementary eFigure 4; no adjusted data available).

For children born late preterm (34–36 weeks), early exposure to antenatal corticosteroids was associated with adverse long term outcomes (neurocognitive disorders, adjusted hazard ratio 1.12, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.20, 25 668 children, low certainty, as well as visual or audiometry testing, table 3, supplementary eFigure 3).

### Impact of child socioemotional and cognitive development on exam results in adolescence: findings from the UK millennium cohort study [^111h5VeB]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In a representative UK cohort, adverse development of cognitive and socioemotional behaviour in childhood was associated with a negative impact on exam results in adolescence. Cross sector health and education policy which focuses on reducing cognitive and socioemotional behaviour problems in children, particularly when they co-emerge early or are persistent, has the potential to improve educational outcomes in adolescence.

### Within-and between-twin comparisons of risk for childhood behavioral difficulties after preterm birth [^114LmUze]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Preterm birth (< 37 weeks gestation) is associated with an elevated risk for a range of behavioral and socioemotional difficulties from childhood through to young adulthood, compared with healthy term birth. This risk is greatest for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and anxiety disorders. Recent meta-analyses show that children born preterm are two-to-four times more likely than term-born peers to meet full diagnostic criteria for these conditions, with risk increasing with lower gestational age.–

Worldwide, the number of survivors after preterm birth continues to rise, attributable to improvements in perinatal and neonatal care. This has resulted in increased survival of infants born extremely preterm at progressively earlier weeks of gestation. – Furthermore, in some countries, there has been substantial growth in the range, accessibility, and use of assisted reproductive technologies, in addition to increasing maternal age at childbearing, both of which are associated with higher rates of preterm birth and multiple gestation. – Increased uptake of reproductive technologies has seen a two-fold increase in the incidence of multiple birth, which now accounts for approximately 20% of all preterm births.

Multiple gestation pregnancies have implications for economic and parenting outcomes. For example, the cost associated with multiple birth is almost three times that for singleton birth over the first postnatal year, with further costs incurred for the use of reproductive technologies. – Furthermore, it is established that preterm birth is associated with increased risk for maternal psychopathology, and maladaptive parenting behavior, which are known risk factors for suboptimal child development. Research shows that these adverse experiences are exacerbated for mothers who deliver multiple birth neonates preterm, compared with singleton neonates preterm. Specifically, parents of preterm-born twins exhibit increased parenting stress, – reduced responsiveness to the child, and disrupted mother-infant interactions, compared with parents of preterm-born singletons. These disruptions have been shown to impact the development of children at 18 months of age. Nevertheless, when evaluating early child neurodevelopment, few or no significant differences in sequelae have been found between preterm-born multiples and singletons. –

### Limitations on the developing preterm brain: impact of periventricular white matter lesions on brain connectivity and cognition [^111qkdfE]. Brain (2013). Low credibility.

Brain lesions to the white matter in peritrigonal regions, periventricular leukomalacia, in children who were born prematurely represent an important model for studying limitations on brain development. The lesional pattern is of early origin and bilateral, that constrains the compensatory potential of the brain. We suggest that (i) topography and severity of periventricular lesions may have a long-term predictive value for cognitive and social capabilities in preterm birth survivors; and (ii) periventricular lesions may impact cognitive and social functions by affecting brain connectivity, and thereby, the dissociable neural networks underpinning these functions. A further pathway to explore is the relationship between cerebral palsy and cognitive outcome. Restrictions caused by motor disability may affect active exploration of surrounding and social participation that may in turn differentially impinge on cognitive development and social cognition. As an outline for future research, we underscore sex differences, as the sex of a preterm newborn may shape the mechanisms by which the developing brain is affected.

### Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome neurodevelopmental follow-up study (neurodevelopmental outcomes for children whose twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome was treated with placental laser photocoagulation) [^113fajQh]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is a serious complication of 10–15% of twin or triplet pregnancies in which multiple fetuses share a single placenta. Communicating placental vessels allow one fetus (the donor) to pump blood to the other (the recipient). Mortality rates without intervention are high, approaching 100% in some series, with fetal deaths usually due to cardiac failure. Surgical correction using laser photocoagulation of communicating placental vessels was developed in the 1980s and refined in the 1990s. Since it was introduced in Victoria in 2006, laser surgery has been performed in approximately 120 pregnancies. Survival of one or more fetuses following laser surgery is currently > 90%, however the neurodevelopmental outcomes for survivors remain incompletely understood. Prior to laser therapy, at least one in five survivors of TTTS had serious adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes (usually cerebral palsy). Current estimates of neurological impairment among survivors following laser surgery vary from 4 to 31% and long-term follow-up data are limited.

Methods

This paper describes the methodology for a retrospective cohort study in which children aged 24 months and over (corrected for prematurity), who were treated with laser placental photocoagulation for TTTS at Monash Health in Victoria, Australia, will undergo comprehensive neurodevelopmental assessment by a multidisciplinary team. Evaluation will include parental completion of pre-assessment questionnaires of social and behavioural development, a standardised medical assessment by a developmental paediatrician or paediatric neurologist, and age-appropriate cognitive and academic, speech and fine and gross motor assessments by psychologists, speech and occupational therapists or physiotherapists. Assessments will be undertaken at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute/Royal Children's Hospital, at Monash Health or at another mutually agreed location. Results will be recorded in a secure online database which will facilitate future related research.

Discussion

This will be the first study to report and evaluate neurodevelopmental outcomes following laser surgery for twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome in Victoria, and will inform clinical practice regarding follow-up of children at risk of adverse outcomes.

### Management of monochorionic twin pregnancy green-top guideline no. 51 (2024 partial update) [^114v9ySw]. BJOG (2025). High credibility.

Regarding patient education for multiple gestation, more specifically with respect to general counseling, RCOG 2025 guidelines recommend to inform patients with monochorionic twin pregnancies that they have higher fetal loss rates (miscarriage, stillbirth, and neonatal death) compared with dichorionic twin pregnancies and, overall, may have a higher risk of associated neurodevelopmental morbidity.

### Triplets across the first 5 years: the discordant infant at birth remains at developmental risk [^112wz2CN]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine whether the risk posed to infant development by triplet birth persists into childhood and whether growth-discordant triplets are at a particularly high developmental risk.

Methods

Twenty-one sets of triplets were matched with 21 sets of twins and 21 singletons (N = 126) for medical and demographic conditions and were followed from birth to 5 years. At 6, 12, and 24 months, cognitive development was assessed and mother-infant interactions were coded for maternal sensitivity and child social engagement. At 5 years, the children's cognitive development and neuropsychological skills were tested, social engagement was coded from mother-child interactions, and behavior problems were examined. Maternal adjustment was assessed during interviews at 1 and 5 years.

Results

Although triplets showed lower cognitive performance at 6, 12, and 24 months as compared with singletons and twins, differences were attenuated by 5 years in both global IQ and executive functions. Similarly, the lower social engagement observed across infancy and the higher internalizing symptoms reported at 2 years for those in the triplet group were no longer found at 5 years. Difficulties in maternal adjustment among mothers of triplets decreased from 1 to 5 years. However, in 65.2% of the initial sample there was a weight discordance of > 15% at birth, and the discordant triplets showed poorer cognitive and social development as compared with their siblings across infancy. At 5 years, the discordant children demonstrated lower cognitive and executive functions performance, decreased social engagement, and higher internalizing symptoms as compared with both siblings and peers.

Conclusions

Whereas most triplets catch up after an early developmental delay, the risk for discordant triplets seems to persist into childhood. Such infants, who are at both biological and environmental risk, should receive special and consistent professional care.

The ongoing Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development SM (ABCD) Study ® is a longitudinal study following 11 879 children (ages 8.9–11 at baseline; born between 2005 and 2009) recruited from 21 research sites across the United States to study the development of complex behavior and biology from late childhood to late adolescence/young adulthood in the context of experience and genetic background (Volkow et al.). It includes a family-based component in which twin (n = 2108), triplet (n = 30), non-twin siblings (n = 1589), and singletons (n = 8148) were recruited. Caregivers provided written informed consent and their children provided verbal assent. For the present study, we used data from the baseline visit (2016–2018; ages: 9–11). Analyses were only conducted in individuals with genetic ancestry most similar to those of European ancestry reference populations (see Polygenic Scores section below), due to the lack of relevant well-powered discovery GWAS in other ancestries and the low predictive utility of PGS when applied across ancestries (Martin et al.). After excluding individuals with missing outcome or covariate data, described below, analytic Ns ranged from 4688 to 5517 (see online Supplemental Fig. S1 for analytic sample size flow chart).

Measures

Cognition, risk tolerance, personality & decision-making, substance initiation, psychopathology, and neuroimaging data were drawn from the baseline assessments from the National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive (NDA) data release 4.0 and 5.1, see online Supplemental Table S1 for details). Socioeconomic status and genomic data (release 3.0) were also derived from the baseline session.

Cognition

Crystallized and fluid intelligence as well as their total composite were estimated from the NIH Toolbox assessment (Luciana et al.).

### Multiple adverse experiences and child cognitive development [^111fH3PY]. Pediatric Research (2016). Low credibility.

During childhood and adolescence, children's social environments shape their cognitive development. Children exposed to multiple adversities in their social environment are more likely to have poorer cognitive outcomes. These findings have prompted interest among pediatric and public health communities to screen and connect youth to appropriate interventions that ameliorate the detrimental effects of adverse exposures. Such intervention efforts can be improved with a stronger conceptual understanding of the relationship between multiple adverse exposures and child cognitive development. This includes disentangling adverse exposures from other risk factors or underlying mechanisms, specifying mechanisms of action, and determining when adverse exposures are most detrimental. This review summarizes findings from the literature on each of these areas and proposes a conceptual model to guide further research and intervention.

### Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome neurodevelopmental follow-up study (neurodevelopmental outcomes for children whose twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome was treated with placental laser photocoagulation) [^114Sa6xk]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Potential biases and limitations to feedback

A problem which is unique to the twin / triplet situation is the possibility of parents or clinicians comparing a child's development with his/her co-multiple/s, rather than with the wider population of children (as is more appropriate). This can lead to false inflation of differences which are, in fact, very minor. The ability levels of children within intact sets will not be compared (unless parents explicitly request this information). Comparisons with "children in general" may be made, as is standard practice when discussing assessment findings. This will minimise risk of distress to children due to participation in the study.

Test scores will not be released to participating families. As an example of potential damage caused by releasing scores in this context, one child may receive a full-scale IQ score of 92. His twin may receive a score of 89. The difference between these test scores is clinically meaningless (and is likely to reflect an approximately equal "true" score), however this can be a difficult concept to convey to a lay audience. If these numbers were provided to the parents, they may interpret them to mean that the first twin was "smarter" than the second. This could influence the way in which they subsequently interact with their children, to the detriment of one or both.

The exception to the default position (non-provision of scores) is when a child's assessment indicates an ability level likely to result in significant functional difficulties that could benefit from interventions or supports. In these instances, scores will be conveyed to parents. For example, a child whose full-scale IQ falls below 70 is likely to have trouble functioning in a standard classroom without modifications. If the children within a set operate at substantially different levels, it may be unavoidable that a distinction between their levels of function will be drawn, but this is likely to already be evident to their parents or guardians and will not be deliberately emphasised.

Implications of study findings

The study will fill a significant knowledge gap regarding outcomes for Victorian children with TTTS undergoing SFLP, and contribute to international knowledge about prevalence and severity of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. It has implications for service delivery, as it may help clarify whether universal follow-up of survivors is warranted, or whether a subgroup of children should be assessed at routine intervals to allow timely identification of neurodevelopmental problems. In addition, the study will inform future research into factors on the pathway to neurodevelopmental disability for children treated with SFLP.

### Management of monochorionic twin pregnancy green-top guideline no. 51 (2024 partial update) [^116CZYcr]. BJOG (2025). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for multiple gestation, more specifically with respect to maternal and perinatal risks, RCOG 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that patients with monochorionic twin pregnancies have higher fetal loss (miscarriage, stillbirth, and neonatal death) rates compared with dichorionic twin pregnancies and overall may have a higher risk of associated neurodevelopmental morbidity.

### A commentary on evidenced-based parenting programs: redressing misconceptions of the empirical support for triple P [^112Powt9]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Selective reporting

The multilevel nature of the Triple P system also influences the selection of outcome variables that are reported in different studies. Many studies included in the meta-analysis had a specific aim of examining the effects of Triple P on aspects of parenting and family functioning, including parental cognition, parental stress, parental depression, work-family conflict and couples' relationships. These variables speak to a broader range of potentially modifiable risk and protective factors in a child's family, and are critically important to determining children's developmental outcomes and the effectiveness of a parenting program. Wilson et al. have not taken into account the different aims of the various studies and the hypothesis-driven nature of the reporting of findings in individual studies included in their analysis.

Conflict of interest

Triple P is not owned by its authors, but by The University of Queensland. Royalty payments from dissemination activities, principally the sale of books, are paid by the publisher (Triple P International) to the University of Queensland's technology transfer company (UniQuest), and distributed to the university's Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences, School of Psychology, Parenting and Family Support Centre and contributory authors in accordance with the university's intellectual property policy. None of the program authors own shares in Triple P International, the company licensed by the University of Queensland to disseminate the program worldwide. The Parenting and Family Support Centre has a formal policy of not disseminating any Triple P intervention that has not established an evidence-base sufficient to justify inclusion in the system. The research team has published trials showing minimal effects for specific parenting interventions which have not been disseminated [for example,]. An international research network has been established to promote high quality developer-led and independent evaluations of Triple P.

### Association of maternal social relationships with cognitive development in early childhood… [^114smW4K]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

The findings suggest that maternal social relationships are associated with cognitive development in children and that social relationships beyond the mother-child-father triad are significantly associated with cognitive development. Importance This study examines how different types of social network structures are associated with early cognitive development in children. Objectives To assess how social relationships and structures are associated with early cognitive development and to elucidate whether variations in the mother's social networks alter a child's early cognitive development patterns. Conclusions and Relevance The findings suggest that maternal social relationships are associated with cognitive development in children and that social relationships beyond the mother-child-father triad are significantly associated with children's cognitive development.

This study investigates the environmental influences on child health outcomes and, specifically, how early cognitive development is associated with social networks for the primary caregiver. Little is known about how different types of relationships, especially the multiple social networks of the mother, are associated with children's cognitive development. Only a few studies8, 43 have characterized a range of maternal social networks and examined their association with early childhood cognitive development. In this study, we examined the associations of multiple types of social relationships and structures, including the child-mother-father triad, family setting, and larger neighborhood network conditions, with early cognitive development. Within a large group of white and African American families in Memphis and Shelby County, Tennessee, we examined how social relationships and networks were associated with children's cognitive development.

Many of our findings are consistent with previous studies36, 37, 59 of early cognitive development and add important evidence that social networks across several levels may be significantly associated with cognitive development in early childhood. We also reported results that large maternal social networks were positively associated with the cognitive development of children. Children of mothers who knew many people in the neighborhood had better cognitive development. It is possible that mothers who socialized locally provided children with more opportunities for playdates with other children or stimulation through more social activities. In addition, the primary caregiver's social networks within the neighborhood may have buffered the association between reduced economic resources and child outcomes. 60 Our results captured the importance of a community-based social life.

The findings suggest that social relationships beyond the mother-child-father triad are significantly associated with children's cognitive development and that maternal social relationships may be associated with the cognitive development of children.

### Multigenerational households during childhood and trajectories of cognitive functioning among U.S. older adults [^111L7Pss]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2021). Medium credibility.

Long-Term Effects of Family Structure on Cognitive Functioning Across the Life Span

Conceptually, there are two mechanisms that could explain how early-life family structure contributes to cognitive aging processes. One mechanism posits that childhood family structure may have a long-term impact on cognitive functioning in later life as a result of (under)development of the brain structure and regions. The argument is that exposure to socially enriched environments particularly in early life can enhance the development of the brain structure, while exposure to stressful environments may permanently alter regulatory set points and compromise the development. For example, evidence based on the socialization perspective suggests that responsive parenting, verbal openness, and emotional support in two-parent households are associated with greater levels of cognitive development as such environments may cultivate stimulating learning and socialization processes. In single-parent households, however, the residential parent becomes the primary provider of not only material but also social resources, entailing less investment in monitoring and interactions for children due to time demands of the residential parent. For example, individuals from single-parent households had poorer executive function in childhood relative to those from two-parent households with a similar low SES background. The stress theory emphasizes that changes in family structure may trigger stress in a child's life by disrupting his or her family relationships and emotional security, which may weaken the foundation of early-life brain to serve as a base for later-life brain health. Smaller brain regions involved in socioemotional and memory function were found among people who are exposed to stress in early life.

### Predictors of long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of children born extremely preterm [^116ZQcmk]. Seminars in Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Children born extremely preterm (< 28 weeks' gestation) are at high risk of a range of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in later childhood compared with their peers born at term, including cognitive, motor, and behavioral difficulties. These difficulties can be associated with poorer academic achievement and health outcomes at school age. In this review, we discuss several predictors in the newborn period of early childhood neurodevelopmental outcomes including perinatal risk factors, neuroimaging findings and neurobehavioral assessments, along with social and environmental influences for children born extremely preterm. Given the complexity of predicting long-term outcomes in children born extremely preterm, we recommend multi-disciplinary teams in clinical practice to assist in determining an individual child's risk for adverse long-term outcomes and need for referral to targeted intervention, based upon their risk.

### Co-recovery of physical size and cognitive ability from infancy to adolescence: a twin study [^111zCEB6]. Child Development (2024). Medium credibility.

This study tested phenotypic and biometric associations between physical and cognitive catch-up growth in a community sample of twins (n = 1285, 51.8% female, 89.3% White). Height and weight were measured at up to 17 time points between birth and 15years, and cognitive ability was assessed at up to 16 time points between 3months and 15years. Weight and length at birth were positively associated with cognitive abilities in infancy and adolescence (r's = .16-.51). More rapid weight catch-up growth was associated with slower, steadier cognitive catch-up growth. Shared and nonshared environmental factors accounted for positive associations between physical size at birth and cognitive outcomes. Findings highlight the role of prenatal environmental experiences in physical and cognitive co-development.

### Does a triplet birth pose a special risk for infant development? Assessing cognitive development in relation to intrauterine growth and mother-infant interaction across the first 2 years [^114yCUTn]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine whether a triplet birth per se poses a risk to the development of infants' cognitive competencies and to the mother-infant relationship.

Methods

Twenty-three sets of triplets were matched with 23 sets of twins and 23 singleton infants (n = 138) with respect to gestational age, birth weight, and medical and demographic features. Infants with perinatal asphyxia, intraventricular hemorrhage of grade 3 or 4, periventricular leukomalacia, or central nervous system infection were excluded from the study. At 6, 12, and 24 months of age, mother-infant interaction was observed and infants' cognitive development was tested with the Bayley II test.

Results

Mothers of triplets displayed lower levels of sensitivity at 6, 12, and 24 months and infants were less socially involved at 6 and 24 months, compared with singletons and twins. Triplets scored lower than singletons and twins on the Bayley Mental Developmental Index at 6, 12, and 24 months. A weight discordance of > 15% was found for 15 triplet sets (65.2%). The discordant triplets showed decreased cognitive skills at 12 and 24 months, compared with their siblings, and received the lowest scores for maternal sensitivity. Hierarchical multivariate regression analysis revealed that greater medical risk at birth, multiple-birth status, lower maternal sensitivity, and reduced infant social involvement in the first 2 years were each predictive of lower cognitive outcomes at 2 years (R2 = 0.33).

Conclusions

Triplets appear to be at higher risk for cognitive delays in the first 2 years of life, and discordant infants are at especially high risk. This delay is related in part to the difficulty of providing sensitive mothering to 3 infants at the same time. The findings may assist practitioners in guiding prenatal and postpartum parental care and management.

### Association between skin-to-skin contact and cognition and behaviour at 5 years in children born at 24–31 weeks' gestation: a secondary analysis of a national population-based prospective cohort study [^113BWoov]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

In the overall cohort, to ensure representativeness, percentages were weighted to consider the differences in the recruitment times for the children born at 24–26 weeks and those born at 27–31 weeks and associations between the exposure and outcomes were adjusted for gestational age. To control for the non-random assignment of children in exposure groups and adjust for confounding, we conducted a propensity score analysis with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPWT) approach. The propensity score was defined as the children's probability of being exposed to SSC, based on maternal, pregnancy-related, neonatal and unit characteristics, estimated with a logistic regression model. The following variables were included in the model, maternal and pregnancy characteristics: maternal age (< 25, 25–35, or > 35 years), primiparity (yes, no), mother country of birth (France, foreign-born), maternal education (less than high school, high school, 1–2 years of graduate studies, ≥ 3 years of graduate studies), parents' socio-economic status (based on parental occupation, classified into five categories), living in couple relationship (yes, no), cause of preterm birth categorized in five classes: (preterm labour, preterm premature rupture of membranes, hypertensive disorders, isolated foetal growth restriction, and other causes including triplet or quadruplet births and undefined), antenatal corticosteroids administration (yes, no), tocolysis use (yes, no), mode of delivery (vaginal, caesarean), maternal anaesthesia (general anaesthesia: yes, no) and multiple pregnancy (yes, no); neonatal characteristics at birth: gestational age (in completed weeks), sex, small-for-gestational age (defined as a birth weight < 10th centile for gestational age and sex based on French intrauterine growth curves), Apgar score < 7 at 5 min, surfactant administration (yes, no), hemodynamic treatment during the first 72 h of life (yes, no), initiation of lactation the first week of life (yes, no); unit characteristics: neonatal unit volume of activity (number of preterm infants born < 32 weeks admitted in 2011, categorized in four groups) and implementation of a developmental care program (Newborn Individualised Developmental Care and Assessment Program (NIDCAP)) (yes, no). Average treatment effect (ATE) weights were used to estimate the treatment effects in the whole population. Balance statistics were graphically assessed by convergence of the balance measures after iterations of the model and by standardised difference. A standardised difference of 10% or more is generally considered meaningful. The reported measures of association are odds ratio (OR) and risk difference for categorical variables and mean difference for continuous variables with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Generalised estimating equation (GEE) regression analysis with an exchangeable correlation structure and robust standard error was used to account for the non-independence of outcomes within neonatal units. Missing baseline and outcomes variables were handled by multiple imputations by chained equations with the R package 'mice' using variables that were included in the propensity score and outcomes. A large number of predictors was included to ensure the "missing at random" assumption during imputation and for the reliability of the imputed results. Missing data for baseline characteristics ranged from 0% to 9.0%, exceeding 5.0% only for data on living in a couple relationship and maternal educational. Missing data for 5 ½ years FSIQ and behavioural scores were 38% and 40% respectively. We generated fifty independent imputed datasets with thirty iterations each. Estimates were pooled according to Rubin's rule. Propensity score analysis was performed for each imputed dataset to estimate the exposition effect. Subgroup analyses were performed by gestational age group 24–27 and 28–31 weeks, with interaction p-values to test whether the effect differs significantly between subgroups.

### Gross motor milestones and subsequent development [^112K6jzk]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

We examined the longitudinal associations of age at achieving gross motor milestones and children's development in a US cohort of singletons and twins.

Methods

In the Upstate KIDS study, a population-based study of children born between 2008 and 2010, information on age at achievement of motor milestones and developmental skills was available in 599 children (314 singletons, 259 twins, and 26 triplets). Mothers reported their children's major motor milestones at ∼4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 months. At age 4 years, children's development was clinically assessed by using the Battelle Developmental Inventory, Second Edition (BDI-2). Primary analyses by using multivariate linear regressions were conducted in singletons. We also examined the associations in twins.

Results

Later achievement of standing with assistance predicted lower BDI-2 scores in singletons in adjusted models (B per SD of age at achievement, -21.9 [95% confidence interval (CI), -41.5 to -2.2]). Post hoc analysis on age of standing with assistance showed that associations were driven by differences in adaptive skills (B = -5.3 [95% CI, -9.0 to -1.6]) and cognitive skills (B = -5.9 [95% CI, -11.5 to -0.4]). Analyses restricted to twins suggested no association between the age at achievement of milestones and total BDI-2 score after adjustment for gestational age and birth weight.

Conclusions

This study provides evidence that the age of achieving motor milestones may be an important basis for various aspects of later child development. In twins, key predictors of later development (eg, perinatal factors) overshadow the predictive role of milestones in infancy.

### Academic achievement of twins and singletons in early adulthood: Taiwanese cohort study [^115iePGr]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

Statistical methods

We used the univariate comparison method to compare academic performance of twins and singletons. To account for potential confounding factors, we then used logistic regression analysis to determine the probability of college attendance (dichotomous outcome) and multiple linear regression analysis for the test scores (continuous outcomes), with adjustment for sex, gestational age, birth weight, and birth order and socioeconomic characteristics of the parents. We examined the impact of low birth weight on long term academic outcomes by estimating the regressions separately for twins and singletons. Finally, focusing on the twin pair sample, we used the twin fixed effect approach to examine the effect of birth weight on academic achievement to provide further control of unobserved parental and environmental factors across families.

Potential confounders in the comparison of academic outcomes between twins and singletons included low birth weight, gestational age, birth order, and sex and the parents' socioeconomic status. Low birth weight is a recognised and well documented predictor of childhood cognition and educational attainment. Another important confounder is gestational age, which enables us to distinguish between low birth weight caused by preterm delivery and that resulting from intrauterine growth restriction.

While the preferences of the parents between sons or daughters might affect parental investment in the children, children born later were generally found to have poorer educational outcomes than those born earlier. The socioeconomic environment in which a child is reared will also affect the child's developmental and educational attainment — for example, highly educated parents might invest more in the development and education of their children than parents with lower levels of education, while parental education itself can also reflect effects of unobserved genetic factors on the academic performance of their children. Families in which parents are better educated or employed within the public sector, or both, might also be less financially constrained than those with lower education levels or those employed within the private sector.

### 20-year neurocognitive development following a schizophrenia spectrum disorder and associations with symptom severity and functional outcomes [^1147ztvp]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The current literature on long-term changes in neurocognition and its association with clinical and functional outcomes is scarce and predominantly comprises small study populations. This study aimed to extend the evidence on the long-term development of cognition in schizophrenia.

The aim of our study was to (1) determine changes in neurocognitive function over a ten-year period after initial diagnosis and to examine possible correlations with changes in symptom severity and social functioning, (2) to investigate 20-year cognitive outcomes and to determine associations with other long-term outcomes, and (3) to examine if specific baseline characteristics would predict changes in neurocognition over ten years.

### Neurodevelopmental outcome at 2 years in twin-twin transfusion syndrome survivors randomized for the solomon trial [^116crWhG]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The preferred treatment for twin-twin transfusion syndrome is fetoscopic laser coagulation of inter-twin vascular anastomoses on the monochorionic placenta. Severe postoperative complications can occur when inter-twin vascular anastomoses remain patent including twin-anemia polycythemia sequence or recurrent twin-twin transfusion syndrome. To minimize the occurrence of residual anastomoses, a modified laser surgery technique, the Solomon technique, was developed in which the entire vascular equator is coagulated. In the Solomon randomized controlled trial (NTR1245), the Solomon technique was associated with a significant reduction in twin-anemia polycythemia sequence and recurrence of twin-twin transfusion syndrome when compared with the standard laser surgery technique. Although a significant improvement in perinatal outcome was shown after the Solomon technique, the clinical importance should also be ascertained with long-term follow-up evaluation of the surviving children.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare the long-term neurodevelopmental outcome in surviving children with twin-twin transfusion syndrome who were included in the Solomon randomized trial and treated with either the Solomon technique or standard laser surgery technique.

Study Design

Routine standardized follow-up evaluation in survivors, at least 2 years after the estimated date of delivery, was performed at 2 of the 5 centers that participated in the Solomon trial: Buzzi Hospital Milan (Italy) and Leiden University Medical Center (The Netherlands). The primary outcome of this follow-up study was survival without long-term neurodevelopmental impairment at age 2 years. Neurodevelopmental impairment was defined as cerebral palsy, cognitive and/or motor development score of < 85, bilateral blindness, or deafness. Cognitive and motor development was evaluated with the use of Bayley-III. All analyses per fetus, neonate, or child were conducted with the generalized estimated equation module to account for the effect that observations between co-twins are not independent.

Results

The primary outcome (survival without neurodevelopmental impairment) was detected in 95 of 141 cases (67%) in the Solomon group and in 99 of 146 cases (68%) in the standard group (P = 0.92). Neurodevelopmental impairment in long-term survivors who were included for follow-up evaluation was detected in 12 of 107 cases (11%) in the Solomon and in 10 of 109 cases (9%) in the standard group (P = 0.61). Neurodevelopmental impairment was due to cerebral palsy in 1 case (1%; spastic unilateral) in the Solomon group and in 2 cases (2%; spastic unilateral and spastic bilateral) in the standard group (P = 0.58). Cognitive development < 85 cases was detected in 2 of 105 children (2%) in the Solomon group and in 6 of 106 children (6%) in the standard group (P = 0.23). Motor development < 85 occurred in 8 of 103 children (8%) in the Solomon group and 3 of 104 children (3%) in the standard group (P = 0.23).

Conclusion

We found no difference in survival without neurodevelopmental impairment between the Solomon and standard laser techniques. In view of the reduction of short-term complications and the absence of increased adverse long-term effects, these data support the use of the Solomon technique in the treatment of twin-twin transfusion syndrome.

### Practice guidelines for communicating a prenatal or postnatal diagnosis of down syndrome: recommendations of the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^114rJE6i]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2011). Medium credibility.

Down syndrome — developmental management, education, and adult functioning state that individuals often experience delays in reaching developmental milestones and early intervention with speech therapy, occupational therapy, and physical therapy are recommended as it maximizes long-term outcomes; after age three, children have individualized education plans tailored to their needs, typically in a special education classroom setting; inclusion is encouraged whenever possible as there is evidence of progress in speech and language, literacy, socialization, daily living skills and behavior; there is a lack of published data on the long-term natural history for adults; abilities range from nonverbal individuals requiring fulltime supervision to high-functioning individuals living semi-independently; most individuals will require some supervision as adults, particularly for finances and emergency situations; and higher-functioning adults can successfully participate in social, physical, educational, and vocational activities.

### Developmental trajectories of infants with multiplex family risk for autism: a baby siblings research consortium study [^114Y1Wrw]. JAMA Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with different genetic etiologies. Prospective examination of familial-risk infants informs understanding of developmental trajectories preceding ASD diagnosis, potentially improving early detection.

Objective

To compare outcomes and trajectories associated with varying familial risk for ASD across the first 3 years of life.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This longitudinal, prospective cohort study used data from 11 sites in the Baby Siblings Research Consortium database. Data were collected between 2003 and 2015. Infants who were younger siblings of children with ASD were followed up for 3 years. Analyses were conducted in April 2018. Of the initial 1008 infants from the database, 573 were removed owing to missing necessary data, diagnostic discrepancies, or only having 1 older sibling.

Exposures

Number of siblings with ASD.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Outcomes included ASD symptoms, cognitive abilities, and adaptive skills. Diagnosis (ASD or no ASD) was given at 36-month outcome. The no-ASD group was classified as atypical (developmental delays and/or social-communication concerns) or typical for some analyses. Generalized linear mixed models examined developmental trajectories by ASD outcome and familial-risk group.

Results

In the 435 analyzed participants (age range at outcome, 32–43 months; 246 male [57%]), 355 (82%) were from single-incidence families (1 sibling with ASD and ≥ 1 sibling without ASD) and 80 (18%) were from multiplex families (≥ 2 siblings with ASD). There were no significant group differences in major demographics. Children from multiplex families were more likely than those from single-incidence families to be classified as having ASD (29 of 80 [36%] vs 57 of 355 [16%]; 95% CI, 9%-31%; P < .001) and less likely as typical (26 of 80 [33%] vs 201 of 355 [57%]; 95% CI, -36% to -13%; P < .001), with similar rates of atypical classifications (25 of 80 [31%] vs 97 of 355 [27%]; 95% CI, -7% to 15%; p = 0.49). There were no differences in ASD symptoms between multiplex and single-incidence groups after controlling for ASD outcome (95% CI, -0.02 to 0.20; p = 0.18). During infancy, differences in cognitive and adaptive abilities were observed based on ASD outcome in the single-incidence group only. At 36 months, the multiplex/no-ASD group had lower cognitive abilities than the single-incidence/no-ASD group (95% CI, -11.89 to -2.20; p = 0.02), and the multiplex group had lower adaptive abilities than individuals in the single-incidence group after controlling for ASD outcome (95% CI, -9.01 to -1.48; p = 0.02).

Conclusions and Relevance

Infants with a multiplex family history of ASD should be monitored early and often and referred for early intervention at the first sign of concern. Direct examination of genetic contributions to neurodevelopmental phenotypes in infants with familial risk for ASD is needed.

### Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome neurodevelopmental follow-up study (neurodevelopmental outcomes for children whose twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome was treated with placental laser photocoagulation) [^116ZfQ7H]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Table 1
Developmental Outcomes following laser for TTTS (subset of published studies)

Characterisations of neurodevelopmental outcomes in the literature have been problematic and managed inconsistently, for several reasons. First, developmental status is often reported as a categorical variable ("impaired" vs "unimpaired"), whereas a more conceptually sound framework sees neurodevelopment on a continuum of ability. Further, neurodevelopment is not a single entity, but is conceptualised as comprising a number of domains, any one of which may be impaired either in isolation or in combination. Assigning a child to an "outcome" implies that this outcome is fixed, and ignores that change is fundamental to the construct of neurodevelopment.

Thus far, reports of measures of social or emotional development, or academic achievement, have been lacking. Findings regarding language have relied on subscales of global measures of intelligence, rather than specific measures of speech and language. This is a considerable oversight, given the documented high prevalence of language disorders among children of multiple birth. Consideration of lesser degrees of neurodevelopmental impairment has also been overlooked. Severe outcomes such as cerebral palsy have been reported, but prevalence estimates of relatively minor morbidities (such as specific learning impairments) that may nonetheless have significant impacts on the lives of survivors and their families are not available. The most common approach in reporting of outcomes has been a three-tier categorisation of "Normal", "Mild impairment", and "Severe impairment". Children involved in this study will be similarly grouped allowing comparison with previous reports, but due to the limitations of this approach, alternative outcomes, described in the methods, will also be reported.

Study aims

The study will assess child survivors of TTTS-affected multiple pregnancies managed by fetal laser surgery in Victoria for the presence of neurodevelopmental disabilities, and will establish a database of obstetric, neonatal and paediatric data relating to this disorder. The database will serve as a model for future, prospective research involving children at risk of developmental disabilities.

### The role of birthweight discordance in the intellectual and motor outcome for triplets at early school age [^115UBxHC]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Aim

We assessed motor and intellectual outcome in triplets at school age and investigated the predictive value of perinatal and demographic factors.

Methods

Seventy-one live-born newborn infants (24 triplet pregnancies) were prospectively enrolled at birth. At the age of 6 years, 58 children (31 males, 27 females; mean gestational age 31.2 wks [SD 2.2 wks]; mean birthweight 1622 g [SD 440 g]) returned for a neurodevelopmental examination. A comparison group for triplets born before 32 gestational weeks comprising 26 gestational age-, birthweight-, and sex-matched singletons was also recruited (mean gestational age 30.1 wk [SD 1.5 wk]; mean birthweight 1142 g [SD 210 g]; 12 males, 14 females). The Zurich Neuromotor Assessment was used to examine motor performance, and intellectual abilities were assessed with the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (K-ABC).

Results

Motor performance and movement quality in these individuals was significantly reduced compared with the test norms for all motor tasks (p < 0.001) other than static balance. The mean values on the Mental Processing Composite (95.3, SD 8.4) and the Achievement Scale (90.1, SD 13.8) of the K-ABC were also lower than those in the test reference (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 respectively). Triplets born at less than 32 weeks' gestation showed poorer pure motor and adaptive gross motor performance (both p < 0.05) than, but similar intellectual performance to, the gestational age-, birthweight- and sex-matched singletons. Poor outcome was predicted by low socio-economic status and by intertriplet birthweight discordance (both p < 0.01).

Interpretation

Triplets were at an increased risk of mild motor and intellectual impairments. This finding is important for tailoring therapeutic interventions for these children and for parental counselling. Very preterm triplets showed similar outcomes to the singleton comparison children, except that they had poorer motor performance. Low socio-economic status was a major risk factor for impaired intellectual development. In addition, birthweight discordance may also be considered a predictor for poor long-term motor and intellectual outcome in triplets.

Learning and cognition

i. Cognitive development Regardless of the age of the child a major part of any assessment, whether for clinical or research purposes, will involve an evaluation of a child's cognitive development. Cognitive development varies widely, and not all children develop specific skills at the same rate. There are numerous methods for assessing cognitive development more formally in early childhood, which will be discussed later. In infancy and toddlerhood assessment tools tend to focus on detecting those children who are delayed, and in preschoolers and beyond assessment tools are more specific and focus on identifying strengths and vulnerabilities across different cognitive domains. As children approach school age, it is usually possible to move from tests of global development to more in-depth assessments of cognitive function, including measures of intelligence quotient (IQ), executive function, memory and attention.
ii. Language Adequate language development is fundamental to communication and normal social interaction. Language development is complex, beginning from birth and evolving rapidly. In early life children's language skills are typically divided into expressive (what the child says) and receptive skills (what the child understands), with children typically understanding more than they can say in the early years. As they grow older, language abilities become more differentiated – a recent systematic review of language functioning summarises the various aspects of language and the results of language studies from very preterm or very low birth weight children. In some extremely preterm children voice abnormalities can occur post-intubation, and be associated with poor self-esteem, if not proactively managed.
iii. Pre-academic skills As children approach school-age it is appropriate to ask if they are ready for school and whether additional support might be warranted to support this important life transition. An assessment of school readiness should include consideration of a child's health and physical development, emotional well-being and self-regulation, social competence, approaches to learning, communication skills, and cognitive ability. As can be seen, these cut across other areas listed in this section. However, there is merit, both clinically and from a research viewpoint, in undertaking a developmental check-up of a child's strengths and vulnerabilities to enable the early identification of those at high risk of later learning problems who would benefit from closer educational surveillance and/or proactive support. Depending on the resources available, educational referral for very preterm children with problems in either one or multiple school readiness domains may be warranted. In addition to assessing the child's developmental needs it will also be important as part of this check-up to consider wider ecological factors such as the readiness of the school for the child and the extent of family/community psychosocial adversity since these factors will also affect a child's educational potential.
iv. Academic progress At school age, numeracy and literacy should be assessed at regular intervals to ensure adequate progress in these areas. Some countries, such as Australia, have introduced standardised testing of academic skills at several points during the school years. In children with significant cognitive or learning disorders, individualised educational programming is essential so that they can achieve their 'personal best' rather than constantly comparing their progress with their peers.

### Short-term, medium-term and long-term effects of early parenting interventions in low-and middle-income countries: a systematic review [^111jNRFo]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Figure 2
Parenting intervention effects on cognitive development outcomes for each trial across follow-up studies. Note: markers with black dots represent immediate postintervention trial results. For Cooper et al, there was no postintervention assessment of cognitive development.

Exploratory meta-analyses — stratified by follow-up period (ie, postintervention, short-term, medium-term and long-term effects) — are presented for cognitive and behavioural development outcomes in figures 3 and 4, respectively. See online supplemental table S3 for specific outcome measures used from each study. Results indicated a robust positive postintervention effect for cognitive development (SMD = 0.46) that generally faded out over time, with the magnitude of the pooled effect reduced by 41% to 52% of the postintervention pooled effect size (figure 3). Although there was a small pooled effect on cognitive development in the short-term (SMD = 0.21), the pooled effects were not significant in medium-term or long-term. For child behaviour, results revealed no detectable pooled effects postintervention or in the short-term, medium-term, or long-term. Although the magnitude of the pooled effects appears to increase for medium-term and long-term results, the individual trials that measured child behaviour in longer-term follow-ups did not also measure postintervention effects on behaviour, which precludes assessment of the magnitude of fade-out effects for this outcome over time.

### Is association of preterm birth with cognitive-neurophysiological impairments and ADHD symptoms consistent with a causal inference or due to familial confounds? [^117M7WBK]. Psychological Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Preterm birth occurs in 8.6% of births in developed countries (Blencowe et al.), and has many known risk factors such as low socio-economic status, low maternal educational status, maternal pre-existing health problems and maternal genetic risk (Goldenberg et al; Plunkett and Muglia; Blencowe et al.). Whilst survival rates of preterm-born children are improving, many negative long-term outcomes have been implicated, including academic difficulties (Moster et al.), cognitive-neurophysiological impairments (Potgieter et al; Johnson et al; Lee et al; Rommel et al.) and an increased risk for neurodevelopmental disorders (D'Onofrio et al.), in particular attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Bhutta et al.).

Whether the association between preterm birth and the negative outcomes is due to the preterm birth insult per se, or due to other environmental or genetic risk factors that characterise families with preterm-born children (including individuals born at term), is difficult to disentangle as preterm-born children have often been compared to unrelated controls who may have differed on unmeasured risk factors (Thapar and Rutter). While twin study designs are not well suited to address this issue given that twins are typically exposed to the same birth event, using non-twin siblings in a sibling-comparison design allows the comparison of preterm birth outcomes whilst controlling for all familial risk factors shared by siblings, such as socio-economic status and maternal genetic risk (Donovan and Susser; D'Onofrio et al; Skoglund et al.). If there are within-sibling associations between preterm birth and specific outcomes, which controls for unmeasured familial confounding factors, this is consistent with a causal effect of preterm birth. Using this approach, a large Swedish epidemiological study found a dose-response relationship between earlier gestational age (GA) and increased likelihood of an ADHD diagnosis, independent of familial confounds, in line with a causal inference (D'Onofrio et al.). However, no study, to our knowledge, has applied the sibling-comparison approach to investigate cognitive and neurophysiological impairments associated with preterm birth.

### Neurodevelopmental outcomes of twins [^114ux6Rx]. Seminars in Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

In population-based studies, the prevalence of neurodevelopmental disability is consistently higher in twins than singletons. This is largely because birth weight and gestational age (GA) distributions of twin births are shifted to the left when compared with singleton births, and lower birth weight and lower GA are associated with increased risk of neurodevelopmental disability. From a pathophysiologic perspective, a question of interest is whether neurodevelopmental outcomes of twins differ from singletons after controlling for covariates. If significant differences in outcomes persist, this would suggest that the twining process itself or something intrinsic to shared life in the womb may be responsible for observed differences. From a clinical perspective, when counseling parents at risk for preterm delivery of twins, it is useful to understand how twin outcomes compare relative to singleton outcomes at the same birth weight or GA. The purpose of this review is to examine the long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of twins compared with singletons with control for important covariates.

### Impact of child socioemotional and cognitive development on exam results in adolescence: findings from the UK millennium cohort study [^114BwHC4]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2025). Medium credibility.

There is evidence from the UK Millennium Cohort Study that cognitive and socioemotional behaviour co-occur or cluster together negatively impacting later health, but impacts on education are unclear. We found that trajectories of persistent cognitive and socioemotional problems and late-onset socioemotional problems in childhood were strongly associated with overweight and mental ill-health in adolescence, with socioemotional development an important driver of adverse health. Indeed, prior longitudinal cohort studies have shown that cognitive ability and socioemotional well-being, as separate attributes, may impact educational and school outcomes. However, the extent to which their co-development predicts educational outcomes needs further investigation.

Understanding the impact of the co-occurrence of cognitive and socioemotional development across the childhood developmental stages on later educational outcomes could help inform both health and educational sectors to reduce inequity by targeting policy at different stages and levels of children's development. Therefore, this study aimed to build on our previous work by assessing the impact of concurrent cognitive and socioemotional development trajectories in childhood on exam results at age 16 years in a UK cohort.

### Sharper minds: cognitive recovery after epilepsy surgery in children [^113kskCb]. Epilepsy Currents (2024). Medium credibility.

Commentary

People with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) experience numerous deleterious effects of recurrent seizures, including risk of injury, social stigma, antiseizure medication (ASM) side effects, and higher rates of premature death. The harmful effects of DRE also include neuropsychological deficits that interfere with an individual's school or work, as well as general activities of daily living. Neurocognitive deficits often colocalize with regions of seizure onset, but distal brain network disruption and associated cognitive impairments are also common. We now have class I evidence that temporal lobe and extratemporal epilepsy surgery leads to substantially improved seizure outcomes compared to ASMs alone, with many patients achieving complete seizure freedom. However, this level of evidence does not exist for postoperative neuropsychological outcomes. It may seem intuitive that seizure cessation after surgery would halt the neurocognitive decline, however, the intervention itself may cause network disruptions. Overall, what is the likelihood that successful surgery halts or even reverses cognitive decline in DRE, and what are the contributions of seizure cessation versus ASM discontinuation in determining neuropsychological outcomes? These questions are particularly important in the pediatric population, where neurocognitive development is still underway, and they are explored in the presently highlighted study.

### Gestational age at birth and cognitive outcomes in adolescence: population based full sibling cohort study [^112Tp9X2]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Policy implications

We estimated a significant reduction of 2.4 to 4.6 IQ points associated with being born from 32–33 to ≤ 27 gestational weeks, relative to birth at term. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis suggested that the reduction could be as low as 6.4 IQ points for children born at ≤ 27 gestational weeks, if the disproportionately high proportion of children born preterm who did not take the intelligence test was considered — although the uncertainty is large for this group. A previous highly detailed study of IQ in children born at ≤ 27 gestational weeks suggested even larger reductions in IQ compared with children born at term, but this study was limited to follow-up at 6.5 years and did not take confounding by shared family factors into account. Nevertheless, these findings underline a considerable negative impact on long term cognitive abilities in children born at < 34 gestational weeks. Given that low cognitive ability in itself is linked to decreased lifelong quality of lifeand early death, our findings stress the need for more research into how these adverse outcomes can be prevented. Cognitive outcomes are not, however, predetermined at birth but are heavily influenced by social circumstancesand nurturing, and this is why early intervention is warranted for children born early preterm.

Evaluation of post-term births

In supplementary analyses with differentiation of post-term births, we did not find any consistent reduction in cognitive outcomes from being born post term. For both mathematics and intelligence, however, we found a pattern suggestive of lower scores by higher post-term gestational age. Nevertheless, an even larger sample of post-term births is needed to investigate this association.

### Triplet pregnancy: what do we tell the prospective parents [^116w3tua]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2021). Medium credibility.

Experience managing triplet pregnancies has increased over the past few decades as the incidence has changed related to assisted reproductive practices. Physicians caring for women carrying triplets cannot predict an individual outcome or pregnancy course but must educate patients about the challenges related to these high risk pregnancies. Obstetric providers can describe the wide range of risks associated with triplet gestations, and the general plan for management, but ultimately parents must make decisions with potentially lifelong consequences. Here, we present the diagnostic criteria, common complications, and management options for triplet pregnancies, to help obstetricians counsel patients on the medical and psychosocial consequences of triplet pregnancy, potential complications, and multifetal reduction.

### Parenting stress, infant emotion regulation, maternal sensitivity, and the cognitive development of triplets: a model for parent and child influences in a unique ecology [^115ziuUj]. Child Development (2004). Low credibility.

To examine the development of triplets, 23 sets of triplets were matched with 23 sets of twins and 23 singletons (N = 138). Maternal sensitivity was observed at newborn, 3, 6, and 12 months, and infants' cognitive and symbolic skills at 1 year. Triplets received lower maternal sensitivity across infancy and exhibited poorer cognitive competencies compared with singletons and twins. The most medically compromised triplet showed the lowest regulation, received lower maternal sensitivity, and demonstrated the weakest outcomes compared with siblings. Structural modeling charted three levels of influence on cognitive outcomes: direct, indirect, and contextual. The triplet ecology provides a context for assessing the relations among infant inborn dispositions, the rearing environment, and the role of exclusive parenting in development.

### Late-preterm birth and its association with cognitive and socioemotional outcomes at 6 years of age [^11626G8t]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Late-preterm birth (34–36 weeks' gestation) has been associated with a risk for long-term cognitive and socioemotional problems. However, many studies have not incorporated measures of important contributors to these outcomes, and it is unclear whether effects attributed to gestational age are separate from fetal growth or its proxy, birth weight for gestational age.

Method

Data came from a study of low- and normal-weight births sampled from urban and suburban settings between 1983 and 1985 (low birth weight, n = 473; normal birth weight; n = 350). Random sampling was used to pair singletons born late-preterm with a term counterpart whose birth weight z score was within 0.1 SD of his or her match (n = 168 pairs). With random-effects models, we evaluated whether pairs differed in their IQ scores and teacher-reported behavioral problems at the age of 6 years.

Results

In adjusted models, late-preterm birth was associated with an increased risk of full-scale (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.35 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20–4.61]) and performance (aOR: 2.04 [95% CI: 1.09–3.82]) IQ scores below 85. Late-preterm birth was associated with higher levels of internalizing and attention problems, findings that were replicated in models that used thresholds marking borderline or clinically significant problems (aOR: 2.35 [95% CI: 1.28–4.32] and 1.76 [95% CI: 1.04–3.0], respectively).

Conclusions

Late-preterm birth is associated with behavioral problems and lower IQ at the age of 6, independent of maternal IQ, residential setting, and sociodemographics. Future research is needed to investigate whether these findings result from a reduction in gestational length, in utero (eg, obstetric complications) or ex-utero (eg, neonatal complications) factors marked by late-preterm birth, or some combination of these factors.

### Conjoined twins in dichorionic diamniotic triplet pregnancy: a report of three cases and literature review [^114RMVHY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

In clinical management, excluding the severity of the case, parents' social situation, religious, and psychological beliefs should be considered.

In triplet pregnancies, one should be aware about the possibility of conjoined twins. Triplet pregnancies contribute significantly to maternal complications, including spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, antepartum bleeding, anemia, hyperemesis gravidarum, cesarean section, and postpartum hemorrhage. In addition, women delivering triplets have a significantly higher risk of cardiac disease and acute or chronic lung disease compared to women who give birth to twins. Compared with singletons and twins, triplets have a higher risk of adverse perinatal outcomes due to higher rates of preterm birth, low birth weight, and congenital anomalies. Therefore, neonatal morbidity and mortality rates may also increase. The risk of spontaneous loss of the pregnancy prior to 24 weeks is 15–18% for triplets and 8% for twins and preterm delivery prior to 34 weeks is 50%, while approximately 8–17% of triplets are delivered between 24 and 28 weeks. In triplets, the rate of cerebral palsy is 28 per 1000 live births, compared to 1.6 per 1000 live births in singletons and 7 per 1000 live births in twin pregnancies. The infant mortality rate in triplets is 52.5 per 1000 live births, compared to 5.4 per 1000 live births in singletons and 23.6 per 1000 live births in twins.

### Long-term cognitive and health outcomes of school-aged children who were born late-term vs full-term [^111Xf6Ei]. JAMA Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Late-term gestation (defined as the 41st week of pregnancy) is associated with increased risk of perinatal health complications. It is not known to what extent late-term gestation is associated with long-term cognitive and physical outcomes. Information about long-term outcomes may influence physician and patient decisions regarding optimal pregnancy length.

Objective

To compare the cognitive and physical outcomes of school-aged children who were born full term or late term.

Design, Setting, and Participants

We analyzed Florida birth certificates from 1994 to 2002 linked to Florida public school records from 1998 to 2013 and found 1 442 590 singleton births with 37 to 41 weeks' gestation in the Florida Bureau of Vital Statistics. Of these, 1 153 716 children (80.0%) were subsequently located in Florida public schools. Linear and logistic regression models were used to assess the association of gestational age with cognitive and physical outcomes at school age. Data analysis took place between April 2013 and January 2016.

Exposures

Late-term (born at 41 weeks) vs full-term (born at 39 or 40 weeks) gestation.

Main Outcomes and Measures

There were a number of measures used, including the average Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test mathematics and reading scores at ages 8 through 15 years; whether a child was classified as gifted, defined as a student with superior intellectual development and capable of high performance; poor cognitive outcome, defined as a child scoring in the fifth percentile of test takers or having a disability that exempted him or her from taking the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test; and Exceptional Student Education placement owing to orthopedic, speech, or sensory impairment or being hospitalbound or homebound.

Results

Of 1 536 482 children born in Florida from singleton births from 1994 to 2002 with complete demographic information, 787 105 (51.2%) were male; 338 894 (22.1%) of mothers were black and 999 684 (65.1%) were married at time of birth, and the mean (SD) age for mothers at time of birth was 27.2 (6.2) years. Late-term infants had 0.7% of an SD (95% CI, 0.001–0.013; p = 0.02) higher average test scores in elementary and middle school, 2.8% (95% CI, 0.4–5.2; p = 0.02) higher probability of being gifted, and 3.1% (95% CI, 0.0–6.1; p = 0.05) reduced probability of poor cognitive outcomes compared with full-term infants. These cognitive benefits appeared strongest for children with disadvantaged family background characteristics. Late-term infants were also 2.1% (95% CI, -0.3 to 4.5; p = 0.08) more likely to be physically impaired.

Conclusions and Relevance

There appears to be a tradeoff between cognitive and physical outcomes associated with late-term gestation. Children born late-term performed better on 3 measures of school-based cognitive functioning but worse on 1 measure of physical functioning relative to children born full term. Our findings provide longer-run information for expectant parents and physicians who are considering delivery at full term vs late term. These findings are most relevant to uncomplicated, low-risk pregnancies.

### Longitudinal neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm twins [^113GWvnf]. Pediatric Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Several factors contribute to neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants. The aim of this study was to examine the genetic and environmental influences on long-term outcomes in preterm twins.

Methods

From a prospective cohort of 225 preterm neonates studied with MRI, 24 monozygotic and 52 dizygotic twins were included. Neurodevelopmental outcomes at 1.5 and 3 years were assessed with the Bayley-III and at 4.5 years with The Movement Assessment Battery for Children and The Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-III.

Results

Preterm monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs (N = 76 neonates) had similar neurodevelopmental outcomes at all time points. Monozygotic twins (N = 24) did not show greater agreement for outcomes relative to dizygotic twins (N = 52). Twin pairs who were discordant in development (N = 12) were born at a lower gestational age and had a higher incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retinopathy of prematurity. Discordant twins become more similar in cognitive and language outcomes over time.

Conclusions

Neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm twins may relate more strongly to environmental factors than genetics. Discordant twins were born earlier and had more perinatal morbidities. Despite the initial discordance, these twin pairs become similar in outcomes over time, which may reflect the positive impact of home environment or early intervention programs.

Impact

Neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm twins relate more strongly to environmental factors than genetics. Monozygotic twins did not show greater agreement in outcomes relative to dizygotic twins suggesting a stronger environmental, rather than genetic, influence on development. Twin pairs who were discordant in development were born at a lower gestational age and had a higher incidence of perinatal morbidities. Despite the initial discordance, these twin pairs become more similar in cognitive and language outcomes over time, which may reflect the positive impact of early intervention programs or home environment. Neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm twins are influenced by exposure to early-life insults or environmental stressors. The initial variability in outcomes among preterm infants is not fixed, and efforts made post-discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit can have a substantial impact on long-term outcomes.

### Implications of racial / ethnic perinatal health inequities on long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes and health services utilization [^111K1iQ2]. Seminars in Perinatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Infants born preterm and with low birth weight have increased risk for neurodevelopmental challenges later in life compared to term-born peers. These include functional motor impairment, cognitive and speech delays, neurobehavioral disorders, and atypical social development. There are well-documented inequities in the population distributions of preterm birth and associated short-term morbidities by race, ethnicity, language, and nativity. Far less is known about how these inequities affect long-term outcomes, though the impact of unequal access to post-discharge support services for preterm infants raises concerns about widening gaps in health, development, and functioning. In this review, we describe what is currently known about the impact of race, ethnicity, nativity, and language on long-term outcomes. We provide a framework for understanding inequities in social, political, and historical context. And we offer guidance for next steps to delineate mechanistic pathways and to identify interventions to eliminate inequities in long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes through research, intervention, and advocacy.

### Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome neurodevelopmental follow-up study (neurodevelopmental outcomes for children whose twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome was treated with placental laser photocoagulation) [^115xaVvn]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Multiple pregnancy and types of twinning

When a single fertilised egg (zygote) splits into two embryos, a monozygotic twin pregnancy results. This occurs spontaneously in 1 in 250 pregnancies. When a single embryo splits, in ¾ of cases, the developing genetically identical fetuses share a single placenta and are described as "monochorionic". For monozygotic twins (and more rarely, triplets) who share a placenta, there are significant associated risks, with a 3 and 7-fold increased risk of perinatal illness and death respectively, compared with singletons. They are 9 times more likely to die in utero than identical twins who do not share a placenta, with a perinatal mortality rate of 12% when born at or after 32 weeks. Premature birth is a significant risk for monozygotic multiples, with 63% of twins and all triplets born prior to 37 weeks.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder [^114veEXG]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2014). Medium credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) familial and genetic factors — The high recurrence risk for autism in siblings and even higher concordance for autism in identical twins support genetic factors. Recurrence risk has typically been cited at 2% to 10%, but a recent prospective longitudinal study reported 18.7% when the broad autism spectrum is considered. Identified risk factors include close spacing of pregnancies, advanced maternal or paternal age, and extremely premature birth (< 26 weeks' gestational age). Studies support roles for common (present in > 5% of the general population) and rare genetic variations contributing to autism, and progress in gene discovery is already beginning to influence clinical practice with regard to genetic testing.

### Triplets across the first 5 years: the discordant infant at birth remains at developmental risk… [^113FDaRA]. publications.aap.org (2009). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVES: To examine whether the risk posed to infant development by triplet birth persists into childhood and whether growth-discordant triplets are at a particularly high developmental risk. METHODS: Twenty-one sets of triplets were matched with 21 sets of twins and 21 singletons for medical and demographic conditions and were followed from birth to 5 years. At 6, 12, and 24 months, cognitive development was assessed and mother-infant interactions were coded for maternal sensitivity and child social engagement. At 5 years, the children's cognitive development and neuropsychological skills were tested, social engagement was coded from mother-child interactions, and behavior problems were examined. Maternal adjustment was assessed during interviews at 1 and 5 years.

RESULTS: Although triplets showed lower cognitive performance at 6, 12, and 24 months as compared with singletons and twins, differences were attenuated by 5 years in both global IQ and executive functions. Similarly, the lower social engagement observed across infancy and the higher internalizing symptoms reported at 2 years for those in the triplet group were no longer found at 5 years. Difficulties in maternal adjustment among mothers of triplets decreased from 1 to 5 years. However, in 65. 2% of the initial sample there was a weight discordance of > 15% at birth, and the discordant triplets showed poorer cognitive and social development as compared with their siblings across infancy. At 5 years, the discordant children demonstrated lower cognitive and executive functions performance, decreased social engagement, and higher internalizing symptoms as compared with both siblings and peers.

CONCLUSIONS: Whereas most triplets catch up after an early developmental delay, the risk for discordant triplets seems to persist into childhood. Such infants, who are at both biological and environmental risk, should receive special and consistent professional care. Comments.

### Lifestyle and psychosocial associations with cognition at the cusp of midlife using twins and siblings [^116SRbbf]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

Our findings suggest significant unique associations of cognitive complexity, purpose‐in‐life, and smoking status with cognitive functioning during established adulthood. Leveraging the strength of co‐twin control analyses, these associations persist after accounting for environmental and partial genetic predispositions common to families. Nonetheless, we note the potential for genetic confounding when extrapolating these findings to the broader population. Given the dynamic challenges and distinct experiences that established adults endure, it is of pivotal importance to continue identifying factors that contribute to cognitive functioning during this period.

### A global multicohort study to map subcortical brain development and cognition in infancy and early childhood [^114ohBue]. Nature Neuroscience (2024). High credibility.

In conclusion, our study contributes to the better understanding of the effects of sex, adverse birth outcomes and SES on neurodevelopment and cognitive outcomes in socially and ethnically diverse cohorts. Our approach could be expanded to address other environmental and contextual factors that shape early brain development and, in the long term, inform public health policy and interventions. Furthermore, by defining trajectories of ICV and subcortical volume development in infancy and early childhood, we lay the foundation for large-scale imaging–genetics studies of this critical developmental period.

### Heterogeneous, temporally consistent, and plastic brain development after preterm birth [^112tjWeb]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Furthermore, we present evidence that IBAPs after preterm birth are modifiable by the early social environment and relevant for cognitive outcome variability, demonstrating an interplay between environment, brain development, and eventually long-term cognitive outcomes. By applying PCA, we captured global CTh and SA deviation as PC1. Individual child and adult CTh PC1 scores were significantly influenced by a subject's social environment during early development (Fig. 8), with medium or low SES moderating the association between GA and CTh PC1 scores in adults. Importantly, this suggests that a more favorable early social environment could mitigate the adverse effects of preterm birth on the brain. As social influences continue throughout childhood including parenting, peer and neighborhood influences, further investigation of childhood social influences is warranted. Taken together, we show that individual heterogeneous brain aberrations after preterm birth are not only modulated by common perinatal and social factors but also underpin cognitive outcome variability.

### Do very preterm twins and singletons differ in their neurodevelopment at 5 years of age? [^115q4EZr]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Twins have inconsistently shown poorer outcomes than singletons. Although a high proportion of twins are born very preterm, data are sparse on the long-term outcomes in very preterm twins. The objective of this study was to compare mortality and neurodevelopmental outcomes of very preterm singletons and twins and to study outcomes in relation to factors specific to twins.

Design

Birth cohort study Etude Epidemiologique sur les Petits Ages Gestationnels (EPIPAGE).

Setting

Nine regions in France.

Patients

All very preterm live births occurring from 22 to 32 weeks of gestation in all maternity wards of nine French regions in 1997 (n = 2773).

Main Outcomes Measures

Neurodevelopmental status, including cerebral palsy, and a cognitive assessment with the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, with scores on the Mental Processing Composite (MPC) scale, was available for 1732 and 1473 children at 5 years of age, respectively.

Results

Among live births, twins had higher hospital mortality than singletons (adjusted (a)OR: 1.4 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.9)). Among survivors, there was no crude difference at 5 years between twins and singletons in the prevalence of cerebral palsy (8.0% vs 9.1%, respectively), MPC < 70 (9.5% vs 11.1%) and mean MPC (94.6 vs 94.4). However, after adjustment for sex, gestational age, intrauterine growth restriction and social factors, twins were more likely to have lower MPC scores (mean difference: -2.4 (95% CI-4.8 to 0.01)). Live born twins had a higher risk of mortality when birth weight discordance was present (aOR:2.9 (95% CI 1.7 to 4.8)), but there were no differences in long-term outcomes.

Conclusions

Compared with very preterm singletons, twins had higher mortality, no difference with respect to severe deficiencies, but slightly lower MPC scores at 5 years.

### Neurodevelopmental outcomes of preterm singletons, twins and higher-order gestations: a population-based cohort study [^1161h7e4]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the neurodevelopmental outcomes of multiple (twins, triplets, quads) compared with singleton extremely preterm infants < 29weeks gestation.

Design

Population-based retrospective cohort study.

Setting

A network of 10 neonatal intensive care units in a geographically defined area of New South Wales and the Australian Capital territory.

Patients

1473 infants < 29weeks gestation born between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2004.

Intervention

At 2–3years of corrected age, a neurodevelopmental assessment was conducted using either the Griffiths Mental Developmental Scales or the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II.

Main Outcome Measure

Moderate-severe functional disability was defined as developmental delay (Griffiths Mental Developmental Scales General Quotient or Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II Mental Development Index > 2 SDs below the mean), moderate cerebral palsy (unable to walk without aids), sensorineural or conductive deafness (requiring amplification) or bilateral blindness (visual acuity < 6/60 in the better eye).

Results

Of the 1081 singletons and 392 multiples followed-up, singletons demonstrated higher rates of systemic infections, steroid treatment for chronic lung disease and birth weight < 10th percentile. Moderate-severe functional disability did not differ significantly between singletons and multiples (15.8% vs 17.6%, OR 1.14; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.54; p = 0.464). Further subgroup analysis of twins, higher-order gestations, 1st-born multiples, 2nd or higher-born multiples, same and unlike gender multiples, did not demonstrate statistically higher rates of functional disability compared with singletons.

Conclusions

Premature infants from multiple gestation pregnancies appear to have comparable neurodevelopmental outcomes to singletons.

### The pregnancy and long-term neurodevelopmental outcome of monochorionic diamniotic twin gestations: a multicenter prospective cohort study from the first trimester onward [^1123QCwy]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to document the pregnancy and neurodevelopmental outcome in monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies and to identify risk factors for death and impairment.

Study Design

We conducted a prospective cohort study of 136 monochorionic twins followed up from the first trimester until infancy.

Results

A total of 122 (90%) pregnancies resulted in 2 survivors, 6 (4%) in 1 survivor and 8 (6%) in no survivor. In all, 230 (92%) of 250 surviving infants were assessed at a mean age of 24 months. Neurodevelopmental impairment was present in 22 (10%) infants. Death or impairment of 1 or both infants occurred in 28 (22%) of 126 pregnancies. Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome and assisted conception increased the risk of both death and impairment, whereas early-onset discordant growth only increased the risk of death.

Conclusion

The mortality in this prospective series was 8% and neurodevelopmental impairment occurred in 10% of infants.

### Birth weight in a large series of triplets [^116jZgf9]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of triplet births is rare. In the Netherlands, up to 1980, a triplet birth occurred once per 10 thousand births. The number of triplet births increased after the introduction of assisted reproductive technologies (ART). In 1990, the number of triplet births had increased up to 6 per 10 thousand. From 2000 onwards, triplet birth rates decline again, mainly because of a change in policy of fertility clinics. The Central Bureau of Statistics of the Netherlands has monitored triplet birth rates at 2 per 10 thousand births since 2005.

The prevalence of low birth weight (BW) and preterm deliveries is high in triplet births. Both low BW and prematurity are risk factors for adverse health, cognitive and behavioral outcomes later in life, e.g. see Arnoudse-Moens et al. (2009) and Bhutta et al. (2002). Among the factors that influence birth weight gestational age (GA) is the most important factor. Alexander et al. described how fetal growth in triplets does not follow the growth curves of singletons or twins. Triplet growth is characterized by different phases. In phase A, up to 26 weeks, triplet fetal growth is comparable to that of singletons. Phase B is roughly between 26 and 30 weeks. During phase B, there is a steady decrease in triplet growth relative to singletons, up to a difference of 20%. This is hypothesized to be due to the restricted intrauterine space. During phase C, 30 to 35 weeks, there is no further decrease relative to singletons. Triplet weight during that period is about 20% less than that of singletons. These three phases are also seen in twins, though later in time and to a lesser extent. Phase D is only seen in triplets and starts from a GA of about 35 weeks. In this phase, a marked decrease in triplet weight compared to that of singletons is seen. However only 10–13% of the triplets reach a GA of more than 35 weeks.

### Assisted reproductive technology: short-and long-term outcomes [^112qhvnU]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

CHILDHOOD OUTCOME

With regard to intellectual disability, conclusions are likewise tentative given differences in study methodologies, population differences, and follow‐up periods. Some studies suggest increased rates of intellectual disability, while a recent meta‐analysis reported similar cognitive outcomes. Current evidence suggests that ICSI may be associated with an increased incidence of intellectual disability compared with IVF, but again there is variability.

In the past, outcome studies about the development of cerebral palsy have shown an increased risk with ART. In a recent study from Western Australia using high‐quality registry data, a high proportion of multiple embryo transfers showed a twofold increase in the prevalence of cerebral palsy. While these and other outcome studies have shown an increased risk for the development of cerebral palsy, multiple births and the increased risk of preterm birth are confounding factors. A recent meta‐analysis reported a greater than twofold increase in cerebral palsy, but the risk is largely due to increased rates of multiple births and preterm birth. In support of this, there has been a substantial decrease in cerebral palsy in Nordic countries over the period 1990 to 2014 in parallel with increased single embryo transfer and decreased multiple births, in support of the ongoing trend to single embryo transfer.

While the incidence of autism spectrum disorder and the use of ART have increased in parallel, whether there is an association remains unclear. As with potential risks associated with other outcomes, risk factors associated with infertility include older paternal age, sperm quality, and maternal infertility. In a large longitudinal cohort study from a database linked to early‐intervention participation data, there was no increase in autism spectrum disorder in IVF, ICSI, or in subfertile females. Conversely, in a cohort study from a national registry, progesterone exposure during a specific time in fetal development increased the risk of autism spectrum disorder, with a postulated causal effect secondary to epigenetic modifications. In a recent meta‐analysis there was an increased overall risk of autism spectrum disorder, but this risk was not seen in singletons, again highlighting the additional risks associated with multiple births. While some groups have provided data suggesting that the risk of autism spectrum disorder is greater with ICSI than with IVF, conclusive evidence has not been established.

✱ p < 0.05; ✱✱ p < 0.002.

a Data were analyzed by two-tailed t -test with a Bonferroni post hoc test for P value significance. Exact P values are provided in Extended Data Table 2.

Correlations between brain volumes and cognitive scores

To assess brain–cognition correlations, we used Pearson's correlations between predicted brain volumes (ICV and subcortical structures) and cognitive scores at 2 years of age. In the full sample, volumes and cognitive scores showed a slight overall positive correlation. But the direction of effects varied across individual cohorts. Individual cohorts showing positive correlations had a greater representation of children born preterm, whereas those showing negative correlations included few or no children born preterm (Supplementary Table 8). Correlations were then analyzed separately for two subgroups, full-term children and preterm children. For full-term children (Fig. 2a), several brain volumes were significantly correlated with cognitive scores (Supplementary Table 9). ICV was negatively correlated with gross motor and fine motor scores. Amygdala volume was negatively correlated with gross motor scores. Globus pallidus and caudate volumes were positively correlated with visual reception scores. Results were similar when excluding one twin/sibling from each pair (Supplementary Table 10). Split-sample replication analyses revealed that the direction of effect was highly consistent for these associations but seldom met the criteria for significance in both folds (Supplementary Table 11).

### Heritability of psychological traits and developmental milestones in infancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111hZH4Y]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Infancy represents the most rapid period of postnatal growth and development, and research suggests that it is a critical or sensitive period for a wide range of psychological and developmental milestones. Investment in early childhood is argued to be one of the most effective economic strategies through promoting long-term socioeconomic and health outcomes. Investment before age 2 years, in particular, appears to be associated with the greatest rate of return for investment. This is reflected in an increasing policy focus globally on the first thousand and one days from conception to age 2 years.

Evidence suggests that complex traits are substantially but not entirely, heritable. Consequently, to gain understanding of the development of traits in infancy, it is important to draw on literature examining genetic and environmental factors associated with infant trait variation. The quantitative genetic method most widely and comprehensively performed in infancy is the classical twin design, which has been used for more than a century to partition phenotypic variance into additive genetic variance (heritability) and variance in the shared and nonshared environment. Family studies comparing biologically related siblings or parent-offspring pairs are typically unable to separate genetics from shared environment. In contrast, the classical twin design can provide separate estimates of heritability (the proportion of trait variation explained by genetic differences) and shared and nonshared environment. Twin studies are more feasible than adoption studies (which compare degree of resemblance between adoptees and their birth parents with resemblance between adoptees and their adoptive parents) to conduct at scale during infancy because adoption often occurs later in childhood. This has resulted in a far smaller and less comprehensive body of evidence in infancy from adoption studies than twin studies. The molecular genetic literature on infant traits is also small; the first genome-wide association study of infant traits was only recently conducted, and most molecular genetic studies in infancy have used candidate gene association methods, which in general have failed to yield replicable findings.

A landmark meta-analysis, synthesizing virtually all twin studies of complex traits (predominantly psychiatric, metabolic, and cognitive traits) found a heritability of 49% across the lifespan when all traits and age groups were combined. The analysis combined data from infants and older children, calculating pooled estimates for children aged 0 to 11 years. Infancy is a rapid and sensitive period of development that deserves special focus. To address this, we conducted the first, to our knowledge, meta-analysis of twin studies of psychological and developmental functioning, disability, and health in infancy (birth to age 2 years), calculating pooled estimates of heritability and shared and nonshared environment.

### Heritability of psychological traits and developmental milestones in infancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115D3KLp]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

CIs for some estimates were wide. In meta-analysis, CIs depend on the precision of included studies, which are influenced by sample size and, in the case of twin modeling, the ratio of MZ to DZ pairs and relative contribution of each parameter. Furthermore, for any given sample size, there is more power to estimate e 2 than h 2 and c 2, which may explain the narrower intervals around e 2. CIs are also associated with the number of samples included in a meta-analysis; while adding studies may improve precision, it may also increase heterogeneity, decreasing precision. Crucially, in multilevel modeling, CIs are also dependent on the degree of between-study heterogeneity. High variability in estimates across studies is associated with wider CIs, and ignoring such heterogeneity tends to overestimate precision. The heterogeneity we observed was generally high, and so CIs were comparatively wide.

A downside of the comprehensive approach we took is that it may have increased between-study heterogeneity. We attempted to reduce this in the narrower subcategory and rater analyses. However, between-study heterogeneity was substantial in all categories and subcategories, suggesting that between-study differences likely created considerable noise in our estimates. Understanding and reducing heterogeneity will be important for future research to provide more precise twin estimates in infancy. Possible publication bias was also detected across multiple outcome domains. The impact of this on the estimates is difficult to rigorously assess.

Although individuals from Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic societies represent 12% of the world's population, twins from these areas of the world constituted more than 80% of our sample. Infants in Africa, Asia, and South America combined represented approximately 16% of our sample, highlighting a need for twin research on infants in these continents.

There was an imbalance in the amount of research conducted on the synthesized categories; for example, far more was conducted on anthropometric phenotypes included in growth maintenance functions (which included data from 24 of 52 included samples) than other domains. Important areas in which research was lacking included nonsocial autistic traits and dysregulation, eating behavior, memory, higher-level cognitive functions, and brain structure.

### Long-term effects of stimulant treatment on ADHD symptoms, social-emotional functioning, and cognition [^115HPZdn]. Psychological Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Methodological and ethical constraints have hampered studies into long-term lasting outcomes of stimulant treatment in individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Lasting effects may be beneficial (i.e. improved functioning even when treatment is temporarily ceased) or detrimental (i.e. worse functioning while off medication), but both hypotheses currently lack empirical support. Here we investigate whether stimulant treatment history predicts long-term development of ADHD symptoms, social-emotional functioning or cognition, measured after medication wash-out.

Methods

ADHD symptoms, social-emotional functioning and cognitive test performance were measured twice, 6 years apart, in two ADHD groups (stimulant-treated versus not stimulant-treated between baseline and follow-up). Groups were closely matched on baseline clinical and demographic variables (n = 148, 58% male, age = 11.1). A matched healthy control group was included for reference.

Results

All but two outcome measures (emotional problems and prosocial behaviour) improved between baseline and follow-up. Improvement over time in the stimulant-treated group did not differ from improvement in the not stimulant-treated group on any outcome measure.

Conclusions

Stimulant treatment is not associated with the long-term developmental course of ADHD symptoms, social-emotional functioning, motor control, timing or verbal working memory. Adolescence is characterised by clinical improvement regardless of stimulant treatment during that time. These findings are an important source to inform the scientific and public debate.

### When epilepsy grows up… [^1169zwEo]. Epilepsy Currents (2019). Medium credibility.

The authors acknowledge that since the 1960s when the patients in this sample were initially treated for epilepsy, substantial improvements in medical and surgical treatment have occurred. Advances in neuroimaging and neurosurgical intervention in pediatric epilepsy have revolutionized seizure control and contributed to the preservation of cognitive development. Of course, we would like to think that surgery makes a difference in seizure remission and survival over the long term.

There is paucity of truly long-term pediatric epilepsy surgery follow-up studies available to review. However, one such study offers parallel findings to those reported by Sillanpaa et al. Ten-year follow-up from epilepsy surgery for 85 Japanese patientsdocumented very good survival rate with only one death. Seizure remission in this sample was also highest for patients with normal cognitive development (81%) relative to patients with low cognitive development (47.4%). Most patients with full seizure remission underwent single lobe resection (80.3%). Seizure frequency at the time of surgery and age of seizure onset were found to be strong predictors of seizure remission following surgery. Social adjustment outcomes were best for patients with seizure freedom, in general.

How are clinicians in pediatric epilepsy to advise our young patients and their families? Early age of onset continues to be strongly associated with cognitive development and reduced likelihood of seizure remission. This association is likely related to the underlying causes of epilepsy with more systemic and globally impactful disease with onset in the early years of life. Patients with later onset and relatively preserved cognitive development are more likely to enjoy seizure remission, even without surgery. However, they may still be vulnerable to SUDEP, which is an important risk to factor into pediatric epilepsy surgery and counseling decision-making. Although patients with cognitive impairment and early onset of seizures may be less likely to experience complete seizure freedom from epilepsy surgery, they may still benefit from a reduction in seizure frequency, seizure severity, and antiepileptic drug usage. This may improve quality of life and is therefore a worthwhile option to consider.

The value of long-term follow-up research cannot be understated. Clinicians are asked to support the long-term development of their patients and predict outcomes. We need to understand hazards that lay ahead in later stages of development, long after our provision of care will come to an end.

### Prem baby triple P: a randomised controlled trial of enhanced parenting capacity to improve developmental outcomes in preterm infants [^111BHerN]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Triple P is a highly effective parenting intervention

Triple P (Positive Parenting Program) has been developed and evaluated over the past 30 years. It is one of the most extensively evaluated and effective models of parenting intervention, and is now implemented in Australia and 25 other countries. Triple P is a comprehensive population-level system of parenting and family support that incorporates a multi-level system of interventions targeting parents of children from infancy to adolescence. The aim of Triple P is to impact upon child outcomes at a population level through enhancing parenting practices. Various levels of the Triple P system have been subjected to controlled evaluations and consistently shown positive effects on observed and parent-reported child behaviour and adjustment, parenting practices, and parental adjustment. The benefits of Triple P are not restricted to children and include beneficial effects on family functioning, including reduced maternal depression and stress, increased parental satisfaction and efficacy, and reduced couple conflict over parenting issues. A 5-year RCT reported that Triple P significantly reduced population indicators of child maltreatment at a population level with effect sizes ranging from large to very large (d = 1.09 – d = 1.22). At least two independent meta-analyses drawing on 55 evaluation studies from different countries, research teams and child age groups have established the efficacy of Triple P in improving children's behaviour and adjustment over and above improving parenting skills and the efficacy of Triple P has been noted in a systematic review of all preventative interventions for child behavioural and emotional problems. Effect sizes of the intervention on child outcome measures range from small-moderate (mean d = 0.4) with universal, low-risk populations to moderate-large for high risk and clinical populations (mean d = 0.7). There is also strong evidence that improvements in the domains of parenting and child behaviour have a positive effect on cognitive and school performance.

### Social inequalities in child development: the role of differential exposure and susceptibility to stressful family conditions [^117MrZeh]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Why are stressful family conditions less relevant for explaining inequalities in cognitive and educational outcomes than for explaining inequalities in socioemotional development? One reason may be that the role of genetic determinants is perhaps stronger for cognitive development and educational attainment than for socioemotional development. However, by adjusting for mother's intelligence we have tried to at least partly account for the intergenerational transmission of cognitive ability, which may be due to both genetic and environmental factors related to mother's intelligence. Moreover, because genetic factors are not modifiable, they hold little relevance for informing public health policy. Another explanation may be that cognitive development and school results at age 13 years are more dependent on cognitive stimulation that also occurs outside of the family environment, while socioemotional development is much more dependent on family dynamics, in addition to school environment and peer-relationships. Especially in early adolescence, cognitive ability and educational progress are perhaps more dependent on contextual determinants at the school and peer level, such as school and classroom composition, and social connectedness. Finally, we assessed stressful family conditions at one particular point in time, and 4 years prior to the outcomes, which does not capture the cumulative effects of stress over a longer period or effects from stressful conditions that have occurred nearer in time to the outcome. Future research should consider to what extent these results are dependent on the time lapse between the (repeated) occurrence of stress and child development, and the cumulative effects of prolonged exposure to (periods of) stress.

In sum, our study found that higher exposure to stressful family conditions among children from less-educated mothers substantially contributes to inequalities in socioemotional development, but less so for cognitive development and educational attainment. Future research is needed to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms that account for these inequalities.

### Trajectories and social determinants of child cognitive development: a prospective cohort study from infancy through middle childhood in dhaka, Bangladesh [^1139VyDN]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2025). High credibility.

The effects of food security on child development outcomes have been examined in two systematic reviews of studies in HICs. Household food insecurity, even at modest levels of undernutrition, was associated with worse general cognitive and executive functioning through adolescence. However, a minority of studies (< 10%) examine early childhood. Studies have documented the detrimental effects of food insecurity on cognitive outcomes in school-aged children (5–15 years) in South Africa, Malawi, and Ghana, underscoring the importance of developing interventions that deliver additional levels of social protection, for example protections for food security, in addition to cash transfers, to improve outcomes in childhood. Research is needed in LMICs to determine whether these findings might extend to even earlier periods in development (0–5 years of age) in other settings. Early childhood is a crucial period when the brain is expecting nutrient-sensitive inputs (e.g. protein, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, trace minerals, and vitamins), which if unmet can negatively affect neurodevelopment.

We sought to fill some of the existing gaps in the literature by identifying social determinants that are most related to cognition longitudinally (from infancy through 7 years) and determine whether social determinants may interact with poverty level to increase risk for cognitive delays.

### Long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes after intrauterine and neonatal insults: a systematic review [^113r9srE]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Background

Neonatal interventions are largely focused on reduction of mortality and progression towards Millennium Development Goal 4 (child survival). However, little is known about the global burden of long-term consequences of intrauterine and neonatal insults. We did a systematic review to estimate risks of long-term neurocognitive and other sequelae after intrauterine and neonatal insults, especially in low-income and middle-income countries.

Methods

We searched Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, the Cochrane Library, and Embase for studies published between Jan 1, 1966, and June 30, 2011, that reported neurodevelopmental sequelae after preterm or neonatal insult. For unpublished studies and grey literature, we searched Dissertation Abstracts International and the WHO library. We reviewed publications that had data for long-term outcome after defined neonatal insults. We summarised the results with medians and IQRs, and calculated the risk of at least one sequela after insult.

Findings

Of 28,212 studies identified by our search, 153 studies were suitable for inclusion, documenting 22,161 survivors of intrauterine or neonatal insults. The overall median risk of at least one sequela in any domain was 39·4% (IQR 20·0–54·8), with a risk of at least one severe impairment in any insult domain of 18·5% (7·7–33·3), of at least one moderate impairment of 5·0% (0·0–13·3%), and of at least one mild impairment of 10·0% (1·4–17·9%). The pooled risk estimate of at least one sequela (weighted mean) associated with one or more of the insults studied (excluding HIV) was 37·0% (95% CI 27·0–48·0%) and this risk was not significantly affected by region, duration of the follow-up, study design, or period of data collection. The most common sequelae were learning difficulties, cognition, or developmental delay (n = 4032; 59%); cerebral palsy (n = 1472; 21%); hearing impairment (n = 1340; 20%); and visual impairment (n = 1228; 18%). Only 40 (26%) studies included data for multidomain impairments. These studies included 2815 individuals, of whom 1048 (37%) had impairments, with 334 (32%) having multiple impairments.

Interpretation

Intrauterine and neonatal insults have a high risk of causing substantial long-term neurological morbidity. Comparable cohort studies in resource-poor regions should be done to properly assess the burden of these conditions, and long-term outcomes, such as chronic disease, and to inform policy and programme investments.

### Academic achievement of twins and singletons in early adulthood: Taiwanese cohort study [^113qHsBm]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The cognitive disadvantage for twins during childhood has been well documented. Most of the earlier studies, which used cohorts from the 1950s and 1960s, found that cognitive ability (as measured by verbal reasoning scores and test scores in word knowledge, reading, and numeracy) was lower among twins than singletons. Although cohort analyses of the entire samples in these studies did provide relatively consistent evidence, conflicting results were nevertheless reported in family based studies.

A study carried out in the Netherlands with 260 adult twins and their 98 singleton siblings reported little difference in intelligence between the samples. In contrast, a large sample study of primary students born in Scotland in 1950–6 found that, at the ages of 7 and 9, twins had substantially lower IQ scores than their singleton siblings, even after adjustment for potential confounding factors within the families. A more recent study, which used nationwide registers of ninth grade (aged 15–16) children born in Denmark in 1986–8, concluded that the academic performance of twins and singletons was quite similar.

Cognitive functioning and intellectual performance are developed through a mixture of genetic and environmental effects. The tendency towards lower intelligence among twins might be attributable to both the suboptimal intrauterine environment and the subsequent family environment. A shared fetal environment might lead to impairment in brain growth, thereby giving rise to adverse effects on cognitive development. Furthermore, compared with singletons, twins might experience greater limitations on resources, as well as heightened competition, within the family environment in which they are brought up. The influence of genetic factors in determining childhood IQ levels has also been examined by using data on pairs of twins, with a study of 170 same sex twin pairs reporting that the association between birth weight and IQ could be attributable to underlying genetic factors.

We used the Taiwanese nationwide registers of academic outcomes, which is based on the results of the college joint entrance examination, to compare performance levels between twins and singletons. We undertook separate analyses of the effects of low birth weight on long term academic outcomes for twins and singletons and the effects on twin pairs.

### Maternal metabolic syndrome in pregnancy and child development at age 5: exploring mediating mechanisms using cord blood markers [^111X91yz]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study participants

The Born in Bradford (BiB) Study is a longitudinal multi-ethnic birth cohort study aiming to examine the impact of environmental, psychological, and genetic factors on maternal and child health and well-being. Bradford is a city in the North of England with high levels of socioeconomic deprivation and ethnic diversity. Women were recruited at the Bradford Royal Infirmary at 26–28 weeks of gestation. For those consenting, a baseline questionnaire was completed. The full BiB cohort recruited 12,453 women and 3353 of their partners across 13,776 pregnancies and 13,858 children between 2007 and 2010. The cohort is broadly characteristic of the city's maternal population. Ethical approval for the data collection was granted by Bradford Research Ethics Committee (Ref 07/H1302/112). Full details on recruitment, attrition, and assessment procedures in BiB can be found on the study website. Of the total sample, singleton births made up n = 13,455, while twins made up n = 354, triplets made up n = 9, and unknown for n = 40. As the proportion of multiple births was not substantial, this study's mediation models did not consider these effects.

### Does a triplet birth pose a special risk for infant development? Assessing cognitive development in relation to intrauterine growth and mother-infant interaction across the first 2 years… [^111PNW62]. publications.aap.org (2005). Low credibility.

Objective. To examine whether a triplet birth per se poses a risk to the development of infants' cognitive competencies and to the mother-infant relationship. Methods. Twenty-three sets of triplets were matched with 23 sets of twins and 23 singleton infants with respect to gestational age, birth weight, and medical and demographic features. Infants with perinatal asphyxia, intraventricular hemorrhage of grade 3 or 4, periventricular leukomalacia, or central nervous system infection were excluded from the study. At 6, 12, and 24 months of age, mother-infant interaction was observed and infants' cognitive development was tested with the Bayley II test. Results. Mothers of triplets displayed lower levels of sensitivity at 6, 12, and 24 months and infants were less socially involved at 6 and 24 months, compared with singletons and twins. Triplets scored lower than singletons and twins on the Bayley Mental Developmental Index at 6, 12, and 24 months.

A weight discordance of > 15% was found for 15 triplet sets. The discordant triplets showed decreased cognitive skills at 12 and 24 months, compared with their siblings, and received the lowest scores for maternal sensitivity. Hierarchical multivariate regression analysis revealed that greater medical risk at birth, multiple-birth status, lower maternal sensitivity, and reduced infant social involvement in the first 2 years were each predictive of lower cognitive outcomes at 2 years. Conclusions. Triplets appear to be at higher risk for cognitive delays in the first 2 years of life, and discordant infants are at especially high risk. This delay is related in part to the difficulty of providing sensitive mothering to 3 infants at the same time. The findings may assist practitioners in guiding prenatal and postpartum parental care and management. Comments.

### Gestational age and cognitive development in childhood [^116SwYb2]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Preterm and early-term births are known risk factors for cognitive impairment, but studies that comprehensively include genetics, prenatal risk, and child-specific factors in high-risk populations are lacking.

Objective

To investigate the long-term cognitive outcomes of children born at various gestational ages, including very preterm (28–31 weeks), moderately preterm (32–33 weeks), late preterm (34–36 weeks), and early term (37–38 weeks), compared with full-term (≥ 39 weeks), accounting for genetics and other risk factors.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this prospective, multicenter, longitudinal cross-sectional study, children aged 9 to 10 years were recruited from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2018. Children underwent cognitive assessments using the National Institutes of Health Toolbox, Little Man Task, and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. Polygenic scores for cognitive performance (cogPGS) were generated using results of a genome-wide association study from the genetic variants related to cognitive performance, educational attainment, and mathematical ability. Data analysis was performed from March to June 2024.

Exposure

Preterm (very preterm, moderately preterm, late preterm) and early-term birth status, with full-term birth status as the reference group.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome of interest was the composite cognitive score, while secondary outcomes included individual cognitive domain scores. Hierarchical regression models were used to examine associations between gestational age and cognitive outcomes, adjusting for socioeconomic status (SES), cogPGS, prenatal risks, and child-specific factors.

Results

Among 5946 children included in the study (mean [SD] age, 9.9 [0.6] years; 3083 [51.8%] male), 55 (0.9%) were born very preterm, 110 (1.8%) were born moderately preterm, 454 (7.6%) were born late preterm, 261 (4.4%) were born early term, and 5066 (85.2%) were born full term. The cogPGS was positively associated with the composite cognitive score (β = 0.14; 95% CI, 0.12–0.17; P < .001) in the overall cohort. Compared with full-term children, those born moderately preterm had lower composite cognitive scores (β = -0.39; 95% CI, -0.55 to -0.22; P < .001) and lower scores in vocabulary (β = -0.36; 95% CI, -0.53 to -0.19; P < .001), working memory (β = -0.27; 95% CI, -0.45 to -0.09; p = 0.003), episodic memory (β = -0.32; 95% CI, -0.50 to -0.14; P < .001), and both short-delay recall (β = -0.36; 95% CI, -0.54 to -0.18; P < .001) and long-delay recall (β = -0.29; 95% CI, -0.48 to -0.11; p = 0.002). These associations were independent of SES, cogPGS, and other risk factors. Importantly, the lowest cognitive scores appeared among children born at 32 weeks or less. In contrast, late-preterm and early-term children performed similarly to full-term peers.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study of children aged 9 to 10 years, moderately preterm birth was associated with long-term cognitive problems independent of SES, genetics, and other risk factors. These findings underscore the need for continued follow-up of all preterm children, with particular focus on those born before 34 weeks' gestational age, because they may face greater developmental challenges over time.

### Outcomes of multiplets [^111ZjwnE]. Neonatology (2009). Low credibility.

Outcomes, both short and long term, differ between singletons and multiplets. Recently, a number of large, well-designed studies have clarified these differences, particularly in light of major changes in perinatal and neonatal care that have influenced changing outcomes. Accordingly, this article will review risks for singletons, twins and higher-order multiples as whole groups and also after correction for gestational age and other potential confounding variables that differ markedly between the groups. In addition, we will focus on the effects of certain factors such as antenatal steroid therapy and gender. Finally, we will detail the specific long-term risks for multiples in terms of growth and neurodevelopmental disabilities.

### Impact of social media on cognitive development of children and young adults: a systematic review [^112qLpkA]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this review examines the impact of social media on cognitive development in children and young adults, revealing both positive and negative effects. While excessive use is linked to impairments in memory, attention, and decision-making, social media can also enhance communication skills and language development. The variability in outcomes may depend on factors such as social media type, usage intensity, and emotional state. Further research is needed to clarify these effects and explore strategies to mitigate potential risks, especially among vulnerable individuals. This study recommends that researchers and policymakers conduct more research and implement more policies that regulate the use of social media in children. However, more research is required on the long-term impact of social media exposure and usage.

### Neurodevelopmental outcomes following late and moderate prematurity: a population-based cohort study [^114rq46w]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Prematurity remains one of the major causes of infant mortality and lifelong morbidity worldwide. We have demonstrated that babies born at 32–36 weeks of gestation are at double the risk for neurodevelopmental disability at 2 years of age, with the vast majority of identified impairments in the cognitive domain. Given the size of the LMPT population, even the small increases in impaired outcomes observed in the present study may have significant long-term public health implications.

### Social isolation changes and long-term outcomes among older adults… [^111oejUf]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Between baseline and the second SII measurement, they experienced higher incidences of stroke and psychiatric problems, increased levels of depression, and worsened physical and cognitive function declines. The demographic characteristics stratified by baseline social isolation status are summarized in eTable 3 in Supplement 1. There were no significant differences in follow-up periods among the 3 comparison groups for any outcome. Cumulative incidence curves of mortality, disability, and dementia outcomes are shown in Figure 2. For mortality and disability, the increased isolation group exhibited the highest cumulative incidence, followed by the stable group, and then the decreased isolation group. These patterns were consistent for both baseline nonisolated and isolated respondents. A higher incidence of dementia was observed for the increased isolation group, while the stable and decreased isolation groups had similar rates.

Minimal differences were observed for CVD and stroke among the 3 groups. Figure 3 presents the number of events per the number at risk and IRs of the studied outcomes for each isolation change group, stratified by isolation status at baseline. The increased isolation group exhibited higher incidences of mortality, disability, and dementia compared with the stable status and decreased isolation groups, regardless of baseline isolation status. Among respondents who were socially isolated at baseline, the increased social isolation group exhibited significantly higher hazards for mortality, disability, and dementia compared with the stable group. Decreased isolation was associated with a lower risk of mortality solely among respondents not socially isolated at baseline, with no association observed for other analyzed outcomes. There was no association observed between changes in isolation and the risk of CVD or stroke outcomes. Hazard ratios of full covariates for mortality, disability, and dementia outcomes are summarized in eTable 4 in Supplement 1. Unadjusted HRs without IPTW are provided in eFigure 4 in Supplement 1.

### Cerebral disorders in the first 7 years of life in children born post-term: a cohort study [^114aHB8e]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Interpretation

The analysis of several different variables increased the risk of finding significant associations due to chance and replication studies are thus needed. We found neither statistically significant adverse nor protective long-term effects on the studied outcomes when comparing post-term born children with all children born at term or with children born in week 41. However, both compared to all children born at term and children born in week 41 a non-significant tendency towards an adverse effect was seen for most studied outcomes. This corroborates the findings of a large study on the association between school performance at the age of 16 years and gestational age reporting a decreased performance for children born post-term after week 41, and of a study finding increased intellectual disabilities with increasing gestational age post-term from week 42, an association persisting in a cohort of matched siblings suggesting that they were robust against confounding by shared familial traits.

### Using parent-offspring pairs and trios to estimate indirect genetic effects in education [^111fKCUZ]. Genetic Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

2.2 ∣ Measurements

2.2.1 ∣ Educational outcomes

Educational outcomes were coded based in the Dutch school system. After primary education, Dutch students are grouped into three levels for secondary schooling: prevocational education (VMBO), higher general continued education (HAVO), and preparatory scientific education (VWO). This placement is defined after age 12, informed by teacher's advice and performance in a nationwide standardized test, and is highly predictive of an individual's final educational attainment. As each educational track takes a distinct time to complete, information about final education attainment can be ambiguous under a certain age. Therefore, individuals were grouped into two subsets: youth (age 13–24, N = 1883) and adults (age ≥ 25, N = 4264). Education was defined in the youth subset by an ordinal variable with three levels representing secondary education level. Current school level was used for individuals under 17 years old, and highest obtained degree was used to code secondary school level for individuals between 18 and 24 years old (Supplementary Materials). For adults, we used two outcome variables based on highest obtained degree: educational attainment and years of education. Educational attainment was defined as an ordinal variable with three levels: low (primary or prevocational secondary education), middle (higher general continued education or preparatory scientific education), and high (university of applied sciences or research university). This ordinal measure was used to allow for comparison with the youth sample. Years of education was coded as the minimum number of cumulative years required to finish the highest achieved degree, which provided a more fine-grained measure of educational attainment.

2.2.2 ∣ Income

Adult Lifelines participants were asked to report their net household income along with the number of people living on this income. We calculated the household equivalent monthly income using the square root scale method. This method adjusts the household income for the number of people in the household by dividing the household income by the square root of the number of people. The resulting household equivalent monthly income was used to categorize the households into three groups: low (< 1100 Euro), intermediate (1100–1899 Euro), and high (≥ 1900 Euro) income.

Parental education years and household income were defined as the mean of both parental phenotypes if data was available for both, or the phenotype of the single available parent otherwise.

### Association between cognitive phenotype in unaffected siblings and prospective 3-and 6-year clinical outcome in their proband affected by psychosis [^111HYrFY]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Cognitive alterations are a central and heterogeneous trait in psychotic disorders, driven by environmental, familial and illness-related factors. In this study, we aimed to prospectively investigate the impact of high familial risk for cognitive alterations, unconfounded by illness-related factors, on symptomatic outcomes in patients.

Methods

In total, 629 probands with non-affective psychosis and their sibling not affected by psychosis were assessed at baseline, 3- and 6-year follow-up. Familial cognitive risk was modeled by three cognitive subtypes ('normal', 'mixed' and 'impaired') in the unaffected siblings. Generalized linear mixed models assessed multi-cross-sectional associations between the sibling cognitive subtype and repeated measures of proband symptoms across all assessments. Between-group differences over time were assessed by adding an interaction effect of time and sibling cognitive subtype.

Results

Probands affected by psychosis with a sibling of the impaired cognitive subtype were less likely to be in symptomatic remission and showed more disorganization across all time points. When assessing differences over time, probands of siblings with the impaired cognitive subtype showed less remission and less improvement of disorganization after 3 and 6 years relative to the other subtypes. They also showed less reduction of positive, negative and excitement symptoms at 6-year follow-up compared to probands with a sibling of the normal cognitive subtype.

Conclusions

Cross-sibling pathways from higher levels of familial cognitive vulnerability to worse long-term outcomes may be informative in identifying cognition-related environmental and genetic risks that impact psychotic illness heterogeneity over time.

### Improved outcome for very low birth weight multiple births [^115x6Zx4]. Pediatric Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

This study describes time trends for very low birth weight multiple births in relation to very low birth weight singletons. Two cohorts of very low birth weight (less than 1250 gm) children recruited between 1983–85 (cohort 1, n = 115) and 1992–94 (cohort 2, n = 144) were compared. The Bayley Scales of Infant Development and a standardized neurologic examination were administered at 2 years corrected age. Neurodevelopmental outcome did not change between cohort 1 and 2 for singletons. For multiple births, mean Mental Developmental Index increased after adjustment for neonatal risk factors [adjusted mean (standard deviation) 81.8 (11.7) to 96.5 (18.6), analysis of covariance P = 0.007]. The prevalence of cerebral palsy decreased, however not significantly [adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 0.3 (0.1–1.5), P = 0.14]. The proportion of disease-free survival (no cerebral palsy and no developmental delay) increased for multiple births (7–37%, P = 0.002), but not for singletons. In cohort 2, neurodevelopmental outcome of multiple births was similar to that of singletons. The cognitive outcome of very low birth weight multiple births improved, possibly because of changes in perinatal practice. However, neurodevelopmental outcome was similar to that of very low birth weight singletons who were unaffected by changes in neonatal care with high proportions of motor delay and cerebral palsy.

### Long term outcome of small versus appropriate size for gestational age co-twins / triplets [^112Nk468]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Small for gestational age (SGA) extremely low birthweight (ELBW < 1000 g) survivors often remain small and/or have subnormal school performance. Some are twins/triplets with larger appropriate size for gestational age (AGA) co-twins/triplets.

Objective

To assess whether SGA ELBW twins/triplets remain different from their AGA co-twins/triplets.

Design, Setting

During 1981–1999, 353 SGA ELBW neonates were admitted to our neonatal intensive care unit: 267 survived, 54/267 were twins/triplets, and 36/54 had AGA surviving co-twins/triplets. This longitudinal study describes the growth, neurodevelopmental outcome, and school performance of these 36 sets (3–17 years). The children were classified as normal, or having minor, moderate, or severe deficiencies.

Results

Values for birth weight (mean intrapair z score difference 2.26), length (2.74), and head circumference (2.62) were lower in SGA neonates than in AGA co-twins/triplets. SGA survivors remained smaller at 3–6 years of age: mean intrapair z score difference in weight, 1.37, height, 1.54, head circumference, 1.21. From 6 to 17 years, smaller differences persisted. Former SGA children had a tendency to have motor deficiencies (nine SGA v three AGA) and mental retardation (seven v four), same hearing loss (two v two), but significantly more visual abnormalities (15 v 11), behavioural disturbances (14 v five), and speech problems (14 v eight). Twenty four sets were in the same normal level class, often supported by familial/professional help.

Conclusions

Although raised in the same environment, SGA ELBW survivors remained smaller and had more visual/behavioural/speech problems, but most maintained grade level parity with their AGA siblings, with appropriate help.

### Developmental outcomes in small-for-gestational age twins using a singleton vs twin birthweight reference [^115GNzwX]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Limited data exist about the potential developmental delays in appropriately grown twins; furthermore, twins may be at higher risk of developmental delay than singletons. Small-for-gestational age is a risk factor for developmental delay and is based on singleton birthweight references, which may misclassify small-for-gestational age in a subset of appropriately grown twins.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate the risk of developmental delay in twins classified as small-for-gestational age according to the twin and singleton birthweight references (< 10th percentile).

Study Design

In a birth cohort (2008–2010) of twins (n = 1790) and singletons (n = 3829) where parents completed Ages & Stages Questionnaires for child development between 4 and 36 months, we used a US population-based birthweight reference to categorize singletons and twins as small-for-gestational age. Uncertain small-for-gestational age twins were defined as small-for-gestational age by a singleton reference (< 10th percentile) and not by a twin reference, and twin-reference small-for-gestational age twins were defined as small-for-gestational age by a twin reference. Adjusted generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate the odds of failure on any Ages & Stages Questionnaires domain and on each of the 5 domains (fine motor, gross motor, communication, personal-social, and problem-solving domains); random intercepts accounted for repeated measures and twin clustering.

Results

Compared with non-small-for-gestational age twins (> 10th percentile), uncertain small-for-gestational age twins did not have higher odds of Ages & Stages Questionnaires failure (adjusted odds ratio, 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 0.91–1.80). Compared with non-small-for-gestational age singletons, both twin-reference and uncertain small-for-gestational age twins had higher odds of Ages & Stages Questionnaires failure, with the highest risk conferred to twin-reference small-for-gestational age twins (twin-reference adjusted odds ratio, 3.14 [95% confidence interval, 1.94–5.10]; uncertain adjusted odds ratio, 2.35 [95% confidence interval, 1.69–3.26]; P < .01 for trend). Results remained consistent when limiting analyses to term births (≥ 37 weeks' gestation).

Conclusion

Although a singleton reference may overestimate small-for-gestational age in twins, the findings indicated that a singleton birthweight reference may be appropriate for twins because it identifies more twins at risk of developmental delay than a twin reference.

### Birth weight in a large series of triplets [^115kCZP9]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

BW discordance and SGA

The prevalence of BW discordance is comparable with a study of Jacobs et al. (2003) and other studies (for a short review see Blickstein et al. (2002) or Blickstein & Kalish (2003)). Compared to singletons or twins, triplets are delayed in growth and cognitive development. There has been limited research on the effects of BW discordance, but it seems that triplets who are discordant in BW are at an even higher developmental risk than other triplets. One study found that most triplets without BW discordance have caught up with singleton and twin standards on cognitive and executive functions at age 5. In contrast, BW discordant triplets still showed a lower performance on these functions at that age. BW discordance in that study was defined as a difference in BW between the heaviest and lightest triplet of more than 15%. In the current sample, this includes 63.2% of the trios.

We also estimated the resemblance in BW of triplets. The resemblance for BW in MZ triplets was higher than in DZ triplets. Both were higher before correction for GA, sex and smoking than after adjusting for these factors. This suggests that genetic as well as common environmental factors influence birth weight and that GA, sex and smoking are some of the specific common environmental factors.

We observed that, when taking US singleton standards as a reference, 40–50% of the triplets were SGA. Children who are born SGA are at risk for asphyxia and intrauterine mortality. As a consequence, children born SGA have to be monitored in neonatal intensive care units (NICU). In the Netherlands triplets are classified SGA based on singleton standards. As a result, at least half of all triplet births have to be born in tertiary referral centers with NICU facilities.

### Impact of social media on cognitive development of children and young adults: a systematic review [^112r9fdv]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The effects of social media on cognitive development are multifaceted, with both positive and negative outcomes. The mixed results can be attributed to several factors, including the type of social media platform, the nature of the interaction and individual characteristics such as pre-existing cognitive abilities and emotional state. Some of the limitations of this review were that the included studies showed heterogeneity in terms of the types of social media by the different age group and data was not given regarding the duration of use of social media by the participants. There was a lack of studies on the usage of social media among children under the age of 9 years. An insufficient number of randomised control trials were identified on this subject. The findings of this review will help future research by identifying specific longitudinal studies focusing on social media usage and how it influences various aspects of cognitive function, including attention, memory, language, and executive functioning. Future research should aim to explore these factors in greater depth, particularly focusing on the long-term effects of social media use and the potential for interventions to mitigate its negative impacts on cognitive development. Furthermore, understanding how social media can be used positively to enhance cognitive skills in children and young adults could inform strategies for integrating technology into educational settings in a beneficial way. Additionally, this review will guide future research, support educators and parents in making informed decisions, and inform policymakers and other stakeholders in shaping guidelines and interventions to optimise developmental outcomes. Based on the review findings, we further recommend that researchers focus on the type and usage of social media for children below the age of 9 years, and researchers should use randomised control trials to develop better results in this area of research.

### Long-term cognitive outcomes in tuberous sclerosis complex [^1129r2Hr]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

We aimed to build on previous work by investigating: (1) the distribution of IQ and rates of intellectual disability later in childhood and adolescence in individuals with TSC and unaffected siblings; (2) the effect of genetic mutation as well as brain‐ and epilepsy‐related risk factors on long‐term change in IQ over childhood and adolescence, by grouping individuals according to a faster (increase in IQ) versus slower (decrease in IQ) gain in skills; and (3) multifactorial longitudinal pathways to individual differences in intellectual ability in individuals with TSC using structural equation modelling. We hypothesized that early seizure severity would mediate the relationship between genetic mutation and long‐term intellectual outcomes in TSC.

### The cognitive cost of being a twin: evidence from comparisons within families in the aberdeen children of the 1950s cohort study [^112odVrv]. BMJ (2005). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether twins have lower IQ scores in childhood than singletons in the same family and, if so, whether differences in fetal growth explain this deficit.

Design

Cohort study.

Setting

Scotland.

Participants

9832 singletons and 236 twins born in Aberdeen between 1950 and 1956.

Results

At age 7, the mean IQ score of twins was 5.3 points lower (95% confidence interval 1.5 to 9.1) and at age 9, 6.0 points lower (1.7 to 10.2) than that of singletons in the same family. Adjustment for sex, mother's age, and number of older siblings had little effect on these differences. Further adjustment for birth weight and gestational age attenuated the IQ difference between twins and singletons: the difference in mean IQ was 2.6 points (-1.5 to 6.7) at age 7 and 4.1 points (-0.5 to 8.8) at age 9.

Conclusions

Twins have substantially lower IQ in childhood than singletons in the same family. This effect cannot be explained by confounding due to socioeconomic, maternal, or other family characteristics, or by recruitment bias. The reduced prenatal growth and shorter gestations of twins may explain an important part of their lower IQ in childhood.

### Long term follow up of high risk children: who, why and how? [^116iA6Zs]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

What are the research gaps in long-term outcomes?

The child.

The concept of school readiness needs to be clarified and defined – it is a complex construct with child-specific physical, social, emotional, and cognitive components, as well consideration of whether the school is ready for the child, and broader factors such as the adequacy of family and community supports.
Much of the research has focused on risks rather than factors that protect at risk children from adverse outcome or contribute to resilience (e.g. such as the family). More resiliency research is required.
More early interventions, before, during or after birth, as well as after discharge, must be developed to reduce the excessive rates of adverse long-term outcomes for high-risk children. There have been some successes in improving long-term outcomes from trials of magnesium sulphate before very preterm birth, caffeine therapy after birth for infants < 1250 g birthweight, and early interventions after discharge, but more are needed. Outcomes from any trials of early intervention should be designed to target specific outcomes, and the outcomes need to encompass more than just developmental or intellectual functioning of the child. Such outcomes could include not only specific health problems, such as neurological, respiratory or cardiovascular health, but also quality of life of individuals and their families, and other behavioural, social and functional outcomes. Importantly, interventions that may be helpful at school age and not just in infancy are needed and are promising new avenues to be explored.
More standardisation of the types of high-risk subjects, their ages and the outcomes assessed would facilitate the pooling of data, and the ability to bench-mark outcomes between centres and regions.

### The effect of antenatal corticosteroids on fetal growth, survival, and neurodevelopmental outcome in triplet pregnancies [^112v2kzi]. American Journal of Perinatology (2004). Low credibility.

Triplet pregnancies have increased as a result of infertility therapy. The objectives of this study are to review the outcome of triplet pregnancies and to determine the effect of different antenatal corticosteroid treatments on fetal growth, survival, and neurodevelopmental outcome. A retrospective case note review of infant and maternal records from a single tertiary neonatal unit was performed from January 1, 1986, through December 31, 1999; 173 live births from 60 triplet pregnancies were divided into groups according to maternal antenatal corticosteroid exposure. Logistic regression model showed only gestation had a significant effect on survival. There was no adverse effect of steroid exposure on weight or head circumference at birth. Ninety percent of live births survived to discharge. Of 143 survivors, only five infants had documented neurodevelopmental problems. Survival rate in triplet pregnancy is high. In this analysis of cohort data repetitive antenatal steroids were not associated with adverse outcome.

### Parsing brain-behavior heterogeneity in very preterm born children using integrated similarity networks [^111QXSHg]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Sensitivity analyses including one sibling only from each twin/triplet set mostly replicated the main findings, showing similar early brain patterns as well as cognitive, neonatal clinical, social, and childhood behavioral profiles for both two- and three-cluster solutions, suggesting that the effects seen here are not biased by the presence of multiple pregnancy siblings in the main analyses. While the functional connectivity results were no longer significant in the sensitivity analyses, we speculate this may be due to a loss in power associated with the reduced sample size.

In summary, using an integrative clustering approach, we were able to stratify VPT children into distinct multidimensional subgroups. A subgroup of VPT children at risk of experiencing behavioral and cognitive difficulties was characterized by high neonatal clinical complications and white matter microstructural alterations at term, whereas a resilient subgroup, with comparably favorable childhood behavioral outcomes, was characterized by increased childhood cognitive stimulation at home and larger and functionally more connected fronto-limbic brain regions at term. These results highlight a potential application of precision psychiatry, to enable meaningful inferences to be made at the individual level. Patterns of fronto-limbic brain maturation may be used as image-based biomarkers of outcomes in VPT children, while promoting enriching environments may foster more optimal behavioral outcomes. Risk stratification following VPT birth could, therefore, guide personalized behavioral interventions aimed at supporting healthy development in vulnerable children.

### Neurocognitive function of 10-year-old multiples born less than 28 weeks of gestational age [^116HtbLz]. Journal of Perinatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Few studies have examined the relationship between birth plurality and neurocognitive function among children born extremely preterm.

Study Design

We compared rates of Z-scores ≤ -2 on 18 tests of neurocognitive function and academic achievement at age 10 years in 245 children arising from twin pregnancies, 55 from triplet pregnancies, and 6 from a septuplet pregnancy to that of 568 singletons, all of whom were born before the 28th week of gestation.

Results

In total, 874 children were evaluated at the age of 10 years. After adjusting for confounders, children of multifetal pregnancies performed significantly better on one of six subtests of executive function than their singleton peers. Performance was similar on all other assessments of intelligence, language, academic achievement, processing speed, visual perception, and fine motor skills.

Conclusion

We found no evidence that children born of multifetal pregnancies had worse scores than their singleton peers on assessments of neurocognitive and academic function.

### Assisted reproductive technology: short-and long-term outcomes [^111yGUbu]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

With all these factors to consider, patients are in a position to make the best decisions for themselves when the provider presents information in a straightforward manner, so that patients can use their own common sense, personal instincts, and beliefs to make informed decisions on how to proceed.

ART has been variably associated with a range of adverse obstetric and perinatal outcomes, birth defects and neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as adult disorders including obesity, early onset diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. With reports of short‐ and long‐term consequences, the question remains whether these reported outcomes are secondary to the procedures themselves, to the postponement of childbearing, or to factors related to underlying maternal or paternal infertility. An important requirement is human studies with adequate sample sizes and appropriate comparison groups to fully assess these risks. Furthermore, specific differences in methodologies, such as the media used, are not standardized or reported in a uniform manner.

From the perspective of clinicians evaluating patients with developmental delay or neurodevelopmental disorders conceived by ART, knowledge of underlying risk factors and the procedures themselves, including an understanding of potential epigenetic mechanisms, is an important component of the diagnostic evaluation.

To address the complex relationship between ART and outcome from the prenatal/perinatal period and extending through adulthood, we have divided this paper into two parts. The first section will focus on specific medical and technical aspects of ART. Potential alterations in epigenetic and other mechanisms will be discussed, with the recognition that the importance of specific factors related to outcome has not been fully established. The second part will focus on clinical outcomes — from the perinatal period through adulthood, discussing challenges in evaluating outcome studies, with the focus on ART singletons, as ART multiples have additional potential risks, which are linked to preterm birth.

This review should be read with a recognition of the challenges required to fully integrate the rapid advances in ART technology, with expansions to individuals beyond heterosexual couples and the variability in short‐ and long‐term outcome, and viewed as a guide to focus diagnostic questions in the clinic rather than to provide 'answers'. For clinicians evaluating children conceived by ART, care is required not to imply that the ART is the underlying etiological cause of a medical or developmental disorder, unless this can be clearly established. The rapidly expanding literature should be investigated with the understanding that up‐to‐date expertise is required.

### Long-term cognitive outcomes in tuberous sclerosis complex [^1149ZQWV]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first study to explore long‐term risk pathways to intellectual outcome in individuals with TSC, by examining the interaction between clinical risk factors on the trajectories of intellectual development. The findings demonstrate a robust effect of epilepsy severity in the first 2 years of life, particularly for seizures other than epileptic spasms. This finding holds both when examining change in IQ over an average period of 8 years, and when applying structural equation modelling to explore the indirect longitudinal pathways linking genetic mutation to intellectual ability.

Lower IQ was demonstrated in individuals with TSC compared to unaffected siblings, and IQ scores were truncated in the group with TSC, even in the more able subgroup. Association with maternal education level, a proxy for socio‐economic status, was not indicated in the group with TSC, suggesting lower IQ is not associated with environmental factors and familial influences. This suggests that specific genetic and/or neurological factors are associated with intellectual impairment in individuals with TSC, even in the absence of intellectual disability, and override the effects of socio‐economic status that are seen in typically developing individuals. Intellectual ability in individuals with TSC showed a unimodal distribution in line with findings at a younger age in the same cohort 18 but in contrast with other findings, 4 which may reflect a subset of individuals who experience further cognitive decline into adulthood. 26 A decrease in IQ from early childhood to middle childhood/adolescence, which could reflect either loss of or failure to gain skills over time, was associated with earlier age at seizure onset and increased seizure severity in the first 2 years of life, similar to previous retrospective studies. 12, 17 It is important to conduct follow‐up IQ assessments as cohort members transition to adulthood to track further changes in developmental trajectories.

### The role of focused attention in learning from early childhood to late adolescence: implications of neonatal brainstem compromise following preterm birth [^1138yQFx]. Child Development (2024). Medium credibility.

FA and cognitive and academic development

The mean ratio of FA to total session time was 0.237 (SD = 0.11) in early childhood and a triplet ratio of 0.663 (SD = 0.18) in late adolescence, based on the entire sample at each time point. When considering participants with observations at both times, a paired samples t ‐test indicated a significant increase (t (23) = −11.7, p < .001) in FA from 16 m (M = 0.255, SD = 0.10) to 17 y (M = 0.658, SD = 0.18). The association between FA in the second year of life and FA 16 years later was r = .379 (n = 24; Figure S3), reflecting a medium effect size (Cohen). However, this association was not statistically significant (p = .068), plausibly due to the relatively lower availability of observations in the 17 y FA assessment.

Notably, an increased FA ratio in early childhood was significantly associated with improved early cognitive development, as reflected in the MDI of the BSID–II and the verbal comprehension and expressive language indices in the RDLS. Regarding long‐term outcomes, an increased FA ratio in the second year of life was associated with superior academic efficacy, joy of learning, global subjective academic wellbeing, and decreased inattention symptoms, based on adolescents' reports (Table 4).

TABLE 4
Association between focused attention performance and cognitive/academic‐related outcomes in early childhood and late adolescence.

FA in late adolescence was positively associated with concurrent perceived academic functioning reflected in the academic efficacy, school connectedness, and global subjective academic wellbeing indices in the SSWQ and decreased inattention and hyperactivity standardized scores in the Conners‐3 (Table 4). Furthermore, adolescents who spent more time in FA also endeavored in more complex manipulations of the cutlery (M = 0.756, SD = 0.11) compared to adolescents who created two‐dimensional models (M = 0.545, SD = 0.18), suggesting that FA ability was significantly associated with enhanced visuospatial effort and possibly with a greater ability to entertain novel options and execute them creatively (t (23) = 3.65, p = .001).

### Very early-life risk factors for developing dementia: evidence from full population registers [^115xSHbJ]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2023). Medium credibility.

Exposure

Actual birth characteristics data for the full population is only available from 1973 in Sweden. We derive risk factors for birth complications and adverse birth outcomes using demographic family links. Our choice of characteristics is driven by empirical evidence from pediatrics and epidemiological research. Using linked multigenerational data, we identify the following risk markers for pregnancy and birth complications:

Advanced maternal age proxied by a binary indicator of high maternal age (maternal age at birth ≥ 35) or in 3-year age intervals,
Short inter-pregnancy interval for an index sibling, capturing a narrow (≤ 18 months) spacing to the next oldest sibling, and
Twin/multiple births, measured as a binary indicator.

All of the above risk factors are associated with birth complications and adverse birth outcomes. Meta-analytic estimates based on 46 studies indicate that advanced maternal age (≥ 35) is associated with a 45% increase in preterm births. Additionally, advanced maternal age is associated with infants born being small for gestational age (25 studies, 16% increased risk), of low birth weight (35 studies, 37% increased risk), having fetal growth restriction (12 studies, 23% increased risk), and increased risk for being admitted to neonatal intensive care (NICU) admission (20 studies, 49% increased risk) suggesting a rise in the incidence of birth complications. A meta-analysis demonstrates that a short inter-pregnancy interval is linked to a 50% increased risk of preterm birth, a 33% increased risk of low birth weight, and poorer fetal growth with a 14% increased risk of newborn being small for gestational age. Short inter-pregnancy interval also is associated with a 25% increased risk of being admitted to NICU. Twin births are associated with a high risk of complications during pregnancy and childbirth, with more NICU admissions, and more than five times increased risk of stillbirth compared to singleton pregnancies. Fetal growth restriction is also more common in the case of twin pregnancies with incidence rates varying between 16% and 48% across studies, and according to a Finnish study about half of all twin births were preterm deliveries. In sum, twin pregnancies are at a heightened risk for unfavorable pregnancy outcomes and birth complications.

### Health-related quality of life at 5 years of age for children born very preterm with congenital anomalies: a multi-national cohort study [^116u2o2i]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Independent variables used in the modelling were selected based on published evidence, – and a published empirical model that used data from the identical cohort. These included: (i) socioeconomic status (SES) variables — employment status (employed or other situation, at least one parent unemployed), highest maternal education level at 5-year follow-up (high education: International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) 6–8, intermediate education: ISCED 3–5, low education: ISCED 0–2), maternal country of birth (native-born, non-native from other European country, non-native from non-European country), and maternal age at childbirth (years) (< 25, 25–34, > 34); (ii) perinatal variables — parity (primiparous, multiparous), multiplicity (singletons, twins or triplets), sex (male or female), gestational age at birth in completed weeks (< 26, 26–27, 28–29, 30–31), and small for gestational age (SGA) status (birth weight for gestational age < 3rd percentile, 3rd to 9th percentiles, ≥ 10th percentile); and (iii) neonatal morbidities - bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD, defined as the need for supplemental oxygen or assisted ventilation at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age) (no or yes), and severe non-respiratory morbidity (no or yes). The ISCED categorises educational programmes and qualifications by level and field. ISCED 0 to 2 covers early childhood education through lower secondary education. ISCED 3 to 5 covers upper secondary education through short-cycle tertiary education. Finally, ISCED 6 to 8 covers bachelor's level education through doctoral education. Severe non-respiratory morbidity (no or yes) was defined as a intraventricular haemorrhage grades III–IV (IVH), cystic periventricular leukomalacia (cPVL), retinopathy of prematurity stages III–V (ROP) or necrotising enterocolitis requiring surgery or peritoneal drainage (NEC).

### Long-term effects of selective fetal growth restriction (LEMON): a cohort study of neurodevelopmental outcome in growth discordant identical twins in the Netherlands [^115SdSwq]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2022). High credibility.

Background

Singletons born after fetal growth restriction (FGR) are at increased risk of poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. Studies of singletons with FGR usually compare outcomes with those without FGR, a comparison that is inherently biased by obstetrical, parental, and genetic factors. We aim to compare neurodevelopmental outcomes between the smaller and larger twin in a population of discordant identical twins who shared a single placenta (monochorionic diamniotic), naturally eliminating these confounders.

Methods

This study is part of the cohort study LEMON of monochorionic diamniotic twins with selective FGR. All monochorionic diamniotic twins with selective FGR who were born in Leiden University Medical Center (Leiden, Netherlands) between March 1, 2002, and Dec 31, 2017, were eligible for inclusion. Twin pregnancies that were complicated by twin-twin transfusion syndrome, twin anaemia polycythaemia sequence, or monoamnionicity were excluded. Cognitive performance was evaluated with two standardised psychometric age-appropriate tests, producing a full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ). Motor functioning was assessed with a standardised neurological examination. A composite outcome of neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) was used, subdivided into mild NDI (defined as FSIQ < 85, minor neurological dysfunction or cerebral palsy grade 1, or mild visual or hearing impairment) and severe NDI (defined as FSIQ < 70, severe neurological dysfunction, or severe visual or hearing impairment).

Findings

Between Jan 25, 2021, and March 15, 2022, 47 twin pairs were enrolled in the study and underwent neurodevelopmental assessment. The median gestational age at birth was 33·9 weeks (IQR 31·3–36·0) for the 47 included twin pairs, with median birthweights of 1400 g (1111–1875) in the smaller twin and 2003 g (1600–2680) in the larger twin. The median age at neurodevelopmental assessment was 11 years (8–13). Median FSIQ was 94 (86–101) for the smaller twin and 100 (92–108) for the larger twin (p < 0·0001). More smaller twins had mild NDI (17 [36%] of 47) than did the larger twins (five [11%] of 47; odds ratio 4·8 [95% CI 1·6–14·1]; p = 0·0049). There was no difference in the proportion of children with severe NDI (two [4%] of 47 in both groups, p = 1·0).

Interpretation

As mild NDI can impede children in their daily functioning, we recommend standardised long-term follow-up, including neurodevelopmental testing, for monochorionic diamniotic twins with selective FGR to facilitate early identification of children at risk.

### Social activities and cognitive functioning across mid-and late life: evidence from China [^116BGv6Y]. The Gerontologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Social Activity and Cognition

Participation in social activities is defined as an individual's engagement in activities that foster social interactions with others, driven by personal interests and the use of shared communal spaces. Specifically, social activities encompass informal activities, such as interactions with families, neighbors, and friends, and providing help to family, friends, and neighbors that are more related to emotional function. Additionally, formal activities include participation in voluntary work and community activities that are based on specific objectives and focus on achieving a goal.

Social activity plays a critical role in late-life cognitive health. The underlying mechanisms linking social activities to cognitive functioning appear to be both biological and psychosocial in nature. Biologically, increased physical activity resulting from participating in social activities may help sustain cerebral blood flow and increase aerobic capacity and cerebral nutrient supply, thus lowering the risk of cognitive impairment. In addition, intellectual stimulation through social activities can preserve cognitive function by enhancing the capacity of cognitive reserve, a person's ability to maintain cognitive function despite challenges to brain health. Increased cognitive reserve can act as a protective barrier against the onset of mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Psychosocially, involvement in social activities mitigates the likelihood of experiencing mental health problems among the older adults, which aids in preserving cognitive health.

Although much of above work does not explicitly utilize a life course framework, it implicitly acknowledges the life course principle of "linked lives", which asserts that individual behaviors and outcomes are frequently influenced by those of nearby individuals. Consequently, participation in social activities emphasizes interactions between individuals, indicating that people's health can be influenced by others through these interactions. Two additional tenets of a life course perspective — "lifespan development" and "timing" — are also important to consider. The first, "lifespan development", insists that development is dynamic across the life course and that change is central beyond childhood. Guided by this life course principle, we view both cognitive functioning and social activities as dynamic across mid- and late life and test the extent to which cognitive functioning and social activities change together. Also guided by the life course principle of "timing", suggesting that actions taken at different stages of life can have varying impacts on later outcomes, and consonant withnotion of midlife being a pivotal period in the life course, we consider the extent to which social activities in midlife predict trajectories of change in late-life cognitive functioning, independent of later activities.

### Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome neurodevelopmental follow-up study (neurodevelopmental outcomes for children whose twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome was treated with placental laser photocoagulation) [^116xrC29]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is a serious complication of 10–15% of twin or triplet pregnancies in which multiple fetuses share a single placenta. Communicating placental vessels allow one fetus (the donor) to pump blood to the other (the recipient). Mortality rates without intervention are high, approaching 100% in some series, with fetal deaths usually due to cardiac failure. Surgical correction using laser photocoagulation of communicating placental vessels was developed in the 1980s and refined in the 1990s. Since it was introduced in Victoria in 2006, laser surgery has been performed in approximately 120 pregnancies.

Survival of one or more fetuses following laser surgery is currently > 90%, however the neurodevelopmental outcomes for survivors remain incompletely understood. Prior to laser therapy, at least one in five survivors of TTTS had serious adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes (usually cerebral palsy). Current estimates of neurological impairment among survivors following laser surgery vary from 4 to 31% and long-term follow-up data are limited.

Methods

This paper describes the methodology for a retrospective cohort study in which children aged 24 months and over (corrected for prematurity), who were treated with laser placental photocoagulation for TTTS at Monash Health in Victoria, Australia, will undergo comprehensive neurodevelopmental assessment by a multidisciplinary team. Evaluation will include parental completion of pre-assessment questionnaires of social and behavioural development, a standardised medical assessment by a developmental paediatrician or paediatric neurologist, and age-appropriate cognitive and academic, speech and fine and gross motor assessments by psychologists, speech and occupational therapists or physiotherapists. Assessments will be undertaken at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute/Royal Children's Hospital, at Monash Health or at another mutually agreed location. Results will be recorded in a secure online database which will facilitate future related research.

Discussion

This will be the first study to report and evaluate neurodevelopmental outcomes following laser surgery for twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome in Victoria, and will inform clinical practice regarding follow-up of children at risk of adverse outcomes.

### Perinatal outcomes and growth discordance of triplet pregnancies based on chorionicity: a retrospective cohort study [^114knXJR]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The occurrence of triplet pregnancy has been reported to be 0.093%, with a natural incidence of 1/8000. Triplet pregnancy is the most common type of high-order multiple gestations and is most likely to occur after infertility treatment. Indeed, 0.9% of pregnancies conceived by assisted reproductive technology (ART) are higher-order multifetal pregnancies. Furthermore, the latest data in the United States estimated that 1 in 1880 pregnancies is a triplet pregnancy.

Triplet pregnancies increase the risk of miscarriage and preterm birth. Moreover, the occurrence of hypertensive complications has been reported to be approximately three times higher than that in singleton pregnancies and 1.5 times higher than that in twin pregnancies. Reported neonatal outcomes are also somewhat pessimistic, with a preterm delivery (< 32 weeks) rate of approximately 37% in triplet pregnancy, which is 3.5 times higher than that of twins and 31 times higher than that of singleton pregnancies. One study also demonstrated that, compared to twins, triplets have a four-fold increased risk for birth after less than 29 weeks of gestation; furthermore, the risk of death or neurodevelopmental impairment is also high in low-birth-weight infants from triplet pregnancies when compared to twins and singletons. Thus, prematurely born triplet neonates exhibit an associated increase in short- and long-term sequelae. Data from a meta-analysis of 43,653 triplets presented a mean birth age of 32.3 gestational weeks, including 98.3% of neonates born before 37 gestational weeks, with 2.8% exhibiting cerebral palsy and with an overall infant mortality rate of 5.25%. Twin–twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), a potential cause of in-utero demise, and medically indicated preterm delivery occur in 10%–15% of monochorionic twins, as well as in dichorionic triamniotic (DCTA) and monochorionic triamniotic (MCTA) triplets, in which the prevalence is currently unknown. Reports have shown that among confirmed cases of triplets at 5–6 weeks of gestation, more than 50% have a spontaneous reduction of one or more embryos before 12 weeks. The risk of spontaneous loss of the pregnancy before 24 weeks is 15–18% for triplets and 8% for twins. Moreover, the intrauterine fetal demise of one or more triplets, which is higher than that for twin or singleton pregnancies, is estimated to be 1–3% or more, depending on gestational age and chorionicity. Taken together, all of these factors yield a heavy healthcare cost burden.

### Triplet infants with birthweight [^116bQ3qh]. American Journal of Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine if triplet infants with birthweight ≤ 1250 g were at increased risk of long-term disability compared with similar birthweight and gestational age singletons and twins. This was a retrospective cohort study of ≤ 1250-g infants admitted to a regional neonatal intensive care unit from 1986 to 2001 with follow-up to 36 to 48 months corrected gestational age. Outcomes studied were cognitive ability, cerebral palsy, and neurosensory impairment at 36 to 48 months. Enrollment was 1717 infants: 59 triplets, 402 twins, and 1256 singletons. Triplet infants differed from twin or singleton infants because they were more likely to have older, married mothers (relative risk [RR] 3.62, 95% CI 1.31, 5.94), be products of assisted reproductive technology pregnancies (RR 29.59, 95% CI 13.97, 62.68), be exposed to antenatal steroids (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.38, 1.75), and were all delivered by cesarean section. Triplet infants had lower risk of having intraventricular hemorrhage (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.05, 0.75). The risk of cerebral palsy, cognitive delay, total major disability, or chronic lung disease was similar in triplet and twin infants compared with singleton infants. The lower risk of having intraventricular hemorrhage in triplet infants may have been due to the use of antenatal corticosteroids and cesarean section delivery.

### Health-related quality of life and behavior of triplets at adolescent age [^116sqkst]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and behavior of triplets compared with matched singletons at adolescent age and to identify medical and sociodemographic predictors of outcome.

Study Design

Fifty-four triplets (19 sets, mean [SD] gestational age 32.0 [2.4] weeks, birth weight 1580 [450] g) and 51 gestational age-, birth weight-, and sex-matched singleton controls self-rated their HRQoL at age 14.5 (0.3) years. Proxy reports about HRQoL and behavior were obtained by parents and teachers. HRQoL was measured with the Kidscreen-52 questionnaire child and parent form, and behavior with the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist.

Results

Self- and parent-reported HRQoL values was similar in both groups except for the dimensions "mood and emotions" and "autonomy", which were better (P = 0.001, P = 0.03) in triplets. Parents reported significantly less behavioral problems in triplets compared with controls. Compared with community norms, both HRQoL and behavior measures in triplets were in the normal range. Parent-reported HRQoL was predicted by dichorionicity.

Conclusions

HRQoL and behavioral outcome in adolescent triplets was good in our study and was, in some aspects, better than in matched singleton controls. Dichorionicity is an important outcome determinant.

### Cognitive outcome of early intervention in preterms at 7 and 9 years of age: a randomised controlled trial [^1154cFVJ]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Examine the effect of an early intervention programme on cognitive outcome at 7 and 9years in children with birth weight (BW) < 2000g.

Design

A randomised controlled trial of a modified version of the Mother-Infant Transaction Program.

Setting

A single tertiary neonatal unit.

Patients

146 infants were randomised into a preterm control group (74) or a preterm intervention group (72).

Interventions

The intervention consisted of eight sessions shortly before discharge and four home visits by specially trained nurses focusing on the infants' unique characteristics, temperament, developmental potential and the interaction between infants and parents.

Main Outcome Measures

Outcomes were assessed with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III).

Results

Mean BWs were 1396 (429) g in the intervention group and 1381(436) g in the control group. After adjusting for the possible clustering effects of twin pairs and maternal education, there were no significant differences in WISC-III scores at age 7 or 9. The mean difference was 4.1 points (95% CI -1.5 to 9.8 points) in favour of the intervention group at 7years and 2.2 points (95% CI -3.4 to 7.6 points) at 9years. At 7years, a 6.8 points difference in the Verbal Comprehension Index (95% CI 0.5 to 13.0 points) was found in favour of the intervention group. Loss to follow-up at age 7 and 9 was 11% and 14%, respectively.

Conclusions

This intervention programme did not have a sustained significant effect on overall cognitive outcomes in preterm children at age 7 and 9.
