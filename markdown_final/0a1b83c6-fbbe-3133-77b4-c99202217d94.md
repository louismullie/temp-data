## Question

Ativan

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Ativan (lorazepam). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug identity and pharmacology. Then, I should verify labeled indications and key off-label uses. Next, I will review dosing by indication and special populations, followed by safety, boxed warnings, and drug interactions. After that, I need to examine dependence and withdrawal, including tapering. Finally, I will consider special populations, monitoring, and practical pearls, and close with a concise synthesis and bottom-line recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the drug identity and core pharmacology. Ativan is lorazepam, a benzodiazepine with anxiolytic, sedative, anticonvulsant, and amnestic properties, acting via GABA-A modulation. It is rapidly absorbed orally with about 90% bioavailability, peaks around 2 hours, has a mean half-life near 12 hours, and is metabolized by direct glucuronidation without active metabolites, which matters for hepatic impairment and drug interactions [^116nqzC4] [^1165pTs8].

> I need to check the labeled indications. The FDA-labeled indication is for the management of anxiety disorders or short-term relief of anxiety or anxiety associated with depressive symptoms, with explicit caution that effectiveness beyond 4 months has not been established and that periodic reassessment is required [^116nqzC4]. Wait, let me verify the IV indications; I initially thought status epilepticus was FDA-approved for IV lorazepam, but hold on, I should confirm — status epilepticus is a labeled indication for IV lorazepam in some sources, though not universally reflected across all FDA labels, so I should note this as a recognized use supported by guidelines and trials even if not uniformly labeled [^112Z4KAc] [^114Gd1nE].

> Next, I should review key off-label uses with evidence. Lorazepam is widely used for alcohol withdrawal syndromes, including seizure prophylaxis and treatment, with multiple high-credibility guidelines endorsing benzodiazepines as first-line and lorazepam as a preferred agent in many protocols due to its pharmacokinetics and lack of active metabolites [^114k4vzo] [^113YyHtF] [^111h6hX4]. It is also used for catatonia, with consensus recommending high-dose lorazepam trials up to 16 mg/day in divided doses, and for acute agitation in emergency settings, where it offers rapid onset and predictable absorption compared with some alternatives [^112m1qof] [^116taNuv] [^115hkbrx]. For chemotherapy-related nausea, lorazepam is a useful adjunct but not a single-agent antiemetic, and topical ABH gel has been shown ineffective due to lack of absorption, so I should caution against relying on transdermal lorazepam for nausea control [^115nZbFm] [^11127bSG] [^114dbJZs].

> I will now examine dosing by indication, starting with anxiety. For adults, typical oral dosing starts at 2–3 mg/day in divided doses, with a usual range of 2–6 mg/day and a practical ceiling around 10 mg/day; elderly or debilitated patients should start at 1–2 mg/day with cautious titration, and insomnia due to anxiety is often managed with 2–4 mg at bedtime, again with geriatric dose reductions [^1114bAmp] [^115fTtTy]. For alcohol withdrawal, IV lorazepam 1–2 mg every 4–6 hours is common, with dose titration to symptom control and consideration of phenobarbital in refractory cases or ICU settings, and for status epilepticus, 0.1 mg/kg IV is standard, with redosing if needed and escalation to second-line agents if seizures persist [^114k4vzo] [^113YyHtF] [^114Gd1nE]. For catatonia, expert consensus supports aggressive lorazepam dosing up to 16 mg/day in divided doses until response or limiting sedation occurs, which is off-label but evidence-based in specialty practice [^112m1qof] [^116taNuv].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and organ dysfunction. In hepatic impairment, lorazepam is preferred over many other benzodiazepines because it lacks active hepatic metabolites, though severe hepatic encephalopathy warrants caution and dose reduction; some labels advise avoiding IV lorazepam in severe liver disease, so I should individualize and monitor closely [^117Nqcwy] [^117TG9Gx]. In renal impairment, dose adjustments are generally modest, with slower titration as eGFR declines and attention to accumulation of glucuronide metabolites; in dialysis, treat as eGFR less than 10 mL/min and monitor for excess sedation [^111VHgLN] [^11337d8R] [^114SQiUP]. In pregnancy, avoid lorazepam late in gestation due to neonatal sedation and withdrawal; if exposure occurs, monitor the neonate and taper prepartum when feasible [^115TWpcn] [^115GEvbw]. In pediatrics, weight-based dosing applies, with 0.1 mg/kg IV for status epilepticus and lower oral doses for anxiety, always titrated to effect and monitored for respiratory depression [^114Gd1nE] [^116tectP].

> I need to ensure I cover boxed warnings and major safety issues. Concomitant use with opioids can cause profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death; reserve coadministration for when alternatives are inadequate, use the lowest effective doses and shortest durations, and monitor closely for respiratory depression and sedation [^1127Vkq8] [^111AmNeM] [^114EAMKf]. Benzodiazepines carry risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction even at therapeutic doses; assess risk, counsel patients, avoid high-risk combinations, and monitor for aberrant use throughout therapy [^1127Vkq8] [^111AmNeM]. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dose reduction can precipitate life-threatening withdrawal, including seizures; taper gradually with patient-specific plans, and consider switching to longer-acting agents in some cases while recognizing lorazepam's advantages in hepatic disease [^1127Vkq8] [^115GEvbw] [^117Nqcwy].

> Next, I should review adverse effects and monitoring. Common effects include sedation, dizziness, weakness, and unsteadiness, with higher incidence in older adults; paradoxical reactions such as agitation, aggression, and disinhibition can occur, and respiratory depression is a concern, especially with CNS co-medications or in vulnerable patients [^111pW6Dr] [^114xNL3q]. I should double-check hematologic and hepatic monitoring; periodic CBC and LFTs are reasonable with long-term therapy, and clinicians should watch for leukopenia and LDH elevations reported in some patients [^11745D42]. In the elderly, falls and cognitive impairment are major risks; use the lowest effective dose, reassess frequently, and consider deprescribing when possible [^1111efX5] [^114jfuiM].

> I will now examine dependence and withdrawal management. Dependence risk rises with dose, duration, and frequency; clinical consensus suggests that use beyond about 3 months at least four days per week confers meaningful withdrawal risk, with higher risk at moderate to high doses, and lorazepam's shorter half-life may increase withdrawal propensity compared with longer-acting agents [^111HaPj4] [^111HGttc]. Tapering should be individualized, often by about 10–25% every 1–2 weeks with flexibility to pause or slow if symptoms emerge; switching to longer-acting benzodiazepines can be considered in some cases, though lorazepam remains advantageous in hepatic impairment, and adjunctive non-benzodiazepine strategies can support discontinuation [^117Nqcwy] [^111HGttc]. I should confirm that protracted withdrawal can persist weeks to months in some users, reinforcing the need for slow, patient-centered tapers and expectation management [^115GEvbw].

> But wait, what about drug interactions beyond opioids. Lorazepam's clearance can be inhibited by valproate and probenecid, roughly doubling exposure; reduce lorazepam dose by about 50% when coadministered and monitor for excess sedation and ataxia [^11745D42]. CNS depressants such as alcohol, barbiturates, antipsychotics, sedative-hypnotics, and antihistamines additively increase sedation and respiratory depression; avoid or minimize combinations and counsel patients strictly about alcohol use [^11745D42]. Theophylline can antagonize benzodiazepine sedation, which may be clinically relevant in select cases [^11745D42].

> Let me consider practical pearls and pitfalls. For acute agitation, lorazepam offers predictable absorption and no active metabolites, but midazolam may have faster onset and shorter duration, which can be advantageous in some settings; choose based on context and monitoring capacity [^115hkbrx]. For nausea, avoid relying on topical ABH gel given lack of absorption; instead, use oral or IV lorazepam as an adjunct within guideline-based antiemetic regimens when appropriate [^11127bSG] [^114dbJZs] [^115nZbFm]. In older adults, start low, go slow, and reassess frequently to mitigate falls and cognitive harms; consider deprescribing initiatives and non-benzodiazepine alternatives for anxiety and sleep when feasible [^114jfuiM] [^1111efX5]. I should confirm that patients receive clear counseling on risks, storage, and disposal, and that prescribers check PDMPs regularly to identify risky combinations or misuse patterns [^115j63Nr] [^115uwb45].

> In summary, lorazepam is a versatile benzodiazepine with a favorable pharmacokinetic profile in hepatic and renal disease, effective for anxiety, alcohol withdrawal, status epilepticus, catatonia, and adjunctive control of chemotherapy-related nausea, but it carries substantial risks of dependence, withdrawal, and dangerous interactions with opioids and other CNS depressants. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest necessary duration, taper slowly when discontinuing, and individualize therapy in special populations to balance benefit and harm [^116nqzC4] [^1127Vkq8] [^117Nqcwy] [^114k4vzo] [^114Gd1nE] [^112m1qof] [^115nZbFm].

Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions

To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue Ativan or reduce the dosage (a patient-specific plan should be used to taper the dose) (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Ativan).

Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages, and those who have had longer durations of use.

Acute Withdrawal Reactions

The continued use of benzodiazepines, including Ativan, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of Ativan after continued use, or administration of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening (e.g., seizures) (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence).

Protracted Withdrawal Syndrome

In some cases, benzodiazepine users have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence).

Pre-existing depression may emerge or worsen during use of benzodiazepines including lorazepam. Ativan (lorazepam) is not recommended for use in patients with a primary depressive disorder or psychosis.

Use of benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, both used alone and in combination with other CNS depressants, may lead to potentially fatal respiratory depression (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).

As with all patients on CNS-depressant drugs, patients receiving lorazepam should be warned not to operate dangerous machinery or motor vehicles and that their tolerance for alcohol and other CNS depressants will be diminished.

Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome

Use of Ativan late in pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression, lethargy, hypotonia) and/or withdrawal symptoms (hyperreflexia, irritability, restlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties) in the neonate (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy). Monitor neonates exposed to Ativan during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation and monitor neonates exposed to Ativan during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal; manage these neonates accordingly.

### Lorazepam (Ativan) [^1114bAmp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Ativan (lorazepam) is administered orally. For optimal results, dose, frequency of administration, and duration of therapy should be individualized according to patient response. To facilitate this, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg tablets are available.

The usual range is 2 to 6 mg/day given in divided doses, the largest dose being taken before bedtime, but the daily dosage may vary from 1 to 10 mg/day.

For anxiety, most patients require an initial dose of 2 to 3 mg/day given two times a day or three times a day.

For insomnia due to anxiety or transient situational stress, a single daily dose of 2 to 4 mg may be given, usually at bedtime.

For elderly or debilitated patients, an initial dosage of 1 to 2 mg/day in divided doses is recommended, to be adjusted as needed and tolerated.

The dosage of Ativan (lorazepam) should be increased gradually when needed to help avoid adverse effects. When higher dosage is indicated, the evening dose should be increased before the daytime doses.

Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Ativan

To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue Ativan or reduce the dosage. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the previous tapered dosage level. Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence).

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).
The use of benzodiazepines, including Ativan, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing Ativan and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (see WARNINGS).
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including Ativan, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of Ativan after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue Ativan or reduce the dosage (DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and WARNINGS).

Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including Ativan, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe Ativan concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of Ativan than indicated in the absence of an opioid and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid is initiated in a patient already taking Ativan, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid and titrate based upon clinical response.

Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when Ativan is used with opioids. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use with the opioid have been determined (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).

Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction

The use of benzodiazepines, including Ativan, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Abuse).

Before prescribing Ativan and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., using a standardized screening tool). Use of Ativan, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of Ativan along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, evaluate the patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Studies in healthy volunteers show that in single high doses Ativan (lorazepam) has a tranquilizing action on the central nervous system with no appreciable effect on the respiratory or cardiovascular systems.

Ativan (lorazepam) is readily absorbed with an absolute bioavailability of 90%. Peak concentrations in plasma occur approximately 2 hours following administration. The peak plasma level of lorazepam from a 2 mg dose is approximately 20 ng/mL.

The mean half-life of unconjugated lorazepam in human plasma is about 12 hours and for its major metabolite, lorazepam glucuronide, about 18 hours. At clinically relevant concentrations, lorazepam is approximately 85% bound to plasma proteins. Ativan (lorazepam) is rapidly conjugated at its 3-hydroxy group into lorazepam glucuronide which is then excreted in the urine. Lorazepam glucuronide has no demonstrable central nervous system (CNS) activity in animals.

The plasma levels of lorazepam are proportional to the dose given. There is no evidence of accumulation of lorazepam on administration up to 6 months.

Studies comparing young and elderly subjects have shown that advancing age does not have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam. However, in one study involving single intravenous doses of 1.5 to 3 mg of Ativan Injection, mean total body clearance of lorazepam decreased by 20% in 15 elderly subjects of 60 to 84 years of age compared to that in 15 younger subjects of 19 to 38 years of age.

Information for Patients

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids

Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of potentially fatal respiratory depression and sedation when Ativan is used with opioids and not to use such drugs concomitantly unless supervised by a healthcare provider. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use with the opioid have been determined (see WARNINGS: Risks from Concomitant Use of Opioids and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).

Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction

Inform patients that the use of Ativan even at recommended doses, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose and death, especially when used in combination with other medications (e.g., opioid analgesics), alcohol, and/or illicit substances. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of benzodiazepine abuse, misuse, and addiction; to seek medical help if they develop these signs and/or symptoms; and on the proper disposal of unused drug (see WARNINGS: Abuse Misuse, and Addiction and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE).

Withdrawal Reactions

Inform patients that the continued use of Ativan may lead to clinically significant physical dependence and that abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of Ativan may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. Inform patients that in some cases, patients taking benzodiazepines have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months. Instruct patients that discontinuation or dosage reduction of Ativan may require a slow taper (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE).

Pregnancy

Advise pregnant females that use of Ativan late in pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression, lethargy, hypotonia) and/or withdrawal symptoms (hyperreflexia, irritability, restlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties) in newborns (see WARNINGS: Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome and PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy). Instruct patients to inform their healthcare provider if they are pregnant.

Advise patients that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to Ativan during pregnancy (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy).

Nursing

Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed. Instruct breastfeeding patients using Ativan to monitor infants for excessive sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain, and to seek medical attention if they notice these signs (see PRECAUTIONS: Nursing Mothers).

Nursing Mothers

Risk Summary

Lorazepam is present in breast milk. There are reports of sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain in infants exposed to benzodiazepines through breast milk. The effects of lorazepam on milk production are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Ativan and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Ativan or from the underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

Infants exposed to Ativan through breast milk should be monitored for sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain.

Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of Ativan generally were not adequate to determine whether subjects aged 65 and over respond differently than younger subjects; however, the incidence of sedation and unsteadiness was observed to increase with age (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Age does not appear to have a significant effect on lorazepam kinetics (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

Clinical circumstances, some of which may be more common in the elderly, such as hepatic or renal impairment, should be considered. Greater sensitivity (e.g., sedation) of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, and lower doses may be sufficient in these patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Essential Laboratory Tests

Some patients on Ativan (lorazepam) have developed leukopenia, and some have had elevations of LDH. As with other benzodiazepines, periodic blood counts and liver function tests are recommended for patients on long-term therapy.

Drug Interactions

The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in the CNS that control respiration. Benzodiazepines interact at GABAAsites and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors. When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids, and monitor patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation.

The benzodiazepines, including Ativan (lorazepam), produce increased CNS-depressant effects when administered with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, barbiturates, antipsychotics, sedative/hypnotics, anxiolytics, antidepressants, narcotic analgesics, sedative antihistamines, anticonvulsants, and anesthetics.

Concomitant use of clozapine and lorazepam may produce marked sedation, excessive salivation, hypotension, ataxia, delirium, and respiratory arrest.

Concurrent administration of lorazepam with valproate results in increased plasma concentrations and reduced clearance of lorazepam. Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to approximately 50% when coadministered with valproate.

Concurrent administration of lorazepam with probenecid may result in a more rapid onset or prolonged effect of lorazepam due to increased half-life and decreased total clearance. Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when coadministered with probenecid.

The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation.

Administration of theophylline or aminophylline may reduce the sedative effects of benzodiazepines, including lorazepam.

Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis

No evidence of carcinogenic potential emerged in rats during an 18-month study with Ativan (lorazepam). No studies regarding mutagenesis have been performed.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Most adverse reactions to benzodiazepines, including CNS effects and respiratory depression, are dose dependent, with more severe effects occurring with high doses.

In a sample of about 3500 patients treated for anxiety, the most frequent adverse reaction to Ativan (lorazepam) was sedation (15.9%), followed by dizziness (6.9%), weakness (4.2%), and unsteadiness (3.4%). The incidence of sedation and unsteadiness increased with age.

Other adverse reactions to benzodiazepines, including lorazepam are fatigue, drowsiness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion, disorientation, depression, unmasking of depression, disinhibition, euphoria, suicidal ideation/attempt, ataxia, asthenia, extrapyramidal symptoms, convulsions/seizures, tremor, vertigo, eye function/visual disturbance (including diplopia and blurred vision), dysarthria/slurred speech, change in libido, impotence, decreased orgasm; headache, coma; respiratory depression, apnea, worsening of sleep apnea, worsening of obstructive pulmonary disease; gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, change in appetite, constipation, jaundice, increase in bilirubin, increase in liver transaminases, increase in alkaline phosphatase; hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactoid reactions; dermatological symptoms, allergic skin reactions, alopecia; syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), hyponatremia; thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia; hypothermia; and autonomic manifestations.

Paradoxical reactions, including anxiety, excitation, agitation, hostility, aggression, rage, sleep disturbances/insomnia, sexual arousal, and hallucinations may occur. Small decreases in blood pressure and hypotension may occur but are usually not clinically significant, probably being related to the relief of anxiety produced by Ativan (lorazepam).

### Benzodiazepines for delirium [^115ep6eq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Delirium occurs in 30% of hospitalised patients and is associated with prolonged hospital stay and increased morbidity and mortality. The results of uncontrolled studies have been unclear, with some suggesting that benzodiazepines may be useful in controlling non-alcohol related delirium.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and incidence of adverse effects of benzodiazapines in the treatment of non-alcohol withdrawal related delirium.

Search Strategy

The trials were identified from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 26 February 2008 using the search terms: (deliri* or confusion) and (benzo* or lorazepam", or "alprazolam" or "ativan" or diazepam or valium or chlordiazepam). The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from major health databases (including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, LILACS) as well as many ongoing trial databases and grey literature sources.

Selection Criteria

Trials had to be unconfounded, randomized and with concealed allocation of subjects. Additionally, selected trials had to have assessed patients pre- and post-treatment. Where crossover design was present, only data from the first part of the trial were to be examined.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers extracted data from included trials. Data were pooled where possible, and were to be analysed using appropriate statistical methods. Odd ratios or average differences were to be calculated. Only "intention to treat" data were to be included.

Main Results

Only one trial satisfying the selection criteria could be identified. In this trial, comparing the effect of the benzodiazepine, lorazepam, with dexmedetomidine, a selective alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist, on delirium among mechanically ventilated intensive care unit patients, dexmedetomidine treatment was associated with an increased number of delirium- and coma-free days compared with lorazepam treated patients (dexmedetomidine patients, average seven days; lorazepam patients, average three days; P = 0.01). One partially controlled study showed no advantage of a benzodiazepine (alprazolam) compared with neuroleptics in treating agitation associated with delirium, and another partially controlled study showed decreased effectiveness of a benzodiazepine (lorazepam), and increased adverse effects, compared with neuroleptics (haloperidol, chlorpromazine) for the treatment of acute confusion.

Authors' Conclusions

No adequately controlled trials could be found to support the use of benzodiazepines in the treatment of non-alcohol withdrawal related delirium among hospitalised patients, and at this time benzodiazepines cannot be recommended for the control of this condition. Because of the scarcity of trials with randomization of patients, placebo control, and adequate concealment of allocation of subjects, it is clear that further research is required to determine the role of benzodiazepines in the treatment of non-alcohol withdrawal related delirium.

### Five things physicians and patients should question in hospice and palliative medicine [^116h7cmy]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2013). Low credibility.

Overuse or misuse of tests and treatments exposes patients to potential harm. The American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation's Choosing Wisely® campaign is a multiyear effort to encourage physician leadership in reducing harmful or inappropriate resource utilization. Via the campaign, medical societies are asked to identify five tests or procedures commonly used in their field, the routine use of which in specific clinical scenarios should be questioned by both physicians and patients based on the evidence that the test or procedure is ineffective or even harmful. The American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine (AAHPM) was invited, and it agreed to participate in the campaign. The AAHPM Choosing Wisely Task Force, with input from the AAHPM membership, developed the following five recommendations: 1) Don't recommend percutaneous feeding tubes in patients with advanced dementia; instead, offer oral-assisted feeding; 2) Don't delay palliative care for a patient with serious illness who has physical, psychological, social, or spiritual distress because they are pursuing disease-directed treatment; 3) Don't leave an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator activated when it is inconsistent with the patient/family goals of care; 4) Don't recommend more than a single fraction of palliative radiation for an uncomplicated painful bone metastasis; and 5) Don't use topical lorazepam (Ativan®), diphenhydramine (Benadryl®), and haloperidol (Haldol®) (ABH) gel for nausea. These recommendations and their supporting rationale should be considered by physicians, patients, and their caregivers as they collaborate in choosing those treatments that do the most good and avoid the most harm for those living with serious illness.

### Lorazepam [^114EAMKf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including Lorazepam, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.

Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe Lorazepam concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of Lorazepam than indicated in the absence of an opioid and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid is initiated in a patient already taking Lorazepam, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid and titrate based upon clinical response.

Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when Lorazepam is used with opioids. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use with the opioid have been determined (see PRECAUTIONS, Clinically Significant Drug Interactions).

Pre-existing depression may emerge or worsen during use of benzodiazepines including lorazepam. Lorazepam is not recommended for use in patients with a primary depressive disorder or psychosis.

### Lorazepam stimulates IL6 production and is associated with poor survival outcomes in pancreatic cancer [^116o1f1H]. Clinical Cancer Research (2023). Medium credibility.

The role of palliative care medicine in influencing the TME and cancer patient outcomes is also vitally important. Cancer is a devastating diagnosis, associated with emotional distress, anxiety, and depression. Harsh surgical, radiologic, and chemotherapeutic interventions can induce numerous side effects, including nausea, anxiety, fatigue, and insomnia. To combat these cancer-associated effects, patients are frequently prescribed an array of palliative care drugs such as aspirin, cannabinoids, antihistamines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, opioids, and benzodiazepines (BZD). There is a growing appreciation that many commonly prescribed drugs can either positively or negatively impact cancer risk, tumor progression, and chemotherapeutic efficacy. Many of these interactions are being tested experimentally, providing insight into clinical observations, and opening new avenues to improve patient outcomes. This is a highly significant problem due to the vast majority of patients who are taking these medications, and our general lack of knowledge regarding their impact on the cancer phenotype.

In this study, we report the novel discovery that lorazepam (LOR, Ativan) and alprazolam (ALP, Xanax), BZDs frequently prescribed to cancer patients to treat anxiety, affect patient survival outcomes across the cancer spectrum. We use a combination of in vivo and in vitro models to mechanistically determine the effects of LOR and ALP on the PDAC TME. Specifically, we find that LOR promotes IL6 secretion from CAFs and drives ischemic necrosis and desmoplasia in mouse models of PDAC. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that the commonly prescribed BZD lorazepam modifies the TME and has potential clinical implications when prescribing BZDs to cancer patients.

### A randomized trial of the effectiveness of topical "ABH gel" (ativan (®), benadryl (®), haldol (®)) vs. placebo in cancer patients with nausea [^11127bSG]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2014). Low credibility.

Context

The topical gel known as "ABH gel", comprising lorazepam (Ativan(®)), diphenhydramine (Benadryl(®)), and haloperidol (Haldol(®)), is frequently used to treat nausea because of its perceived efficacy, relatively low cost, and ease of use in the home setting. There are limited scientific data on this medication, however. Recent pilot studies showed no absorption of the active ingredients of the gel, prompting further prospective studies into the cause of the perceived efficacy in the clinical setting.

Objectives

To determine any difference in the effectiveness of ABH gel compared with placebo in cancer patients with nausea.

Methods

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, noninferiority clinical trial was developed to test the hypothesis that there is no difference in the effectiveness of ABH gel compared with placebo in cancer patients with nausea. The primary outcome was the difference in nausea score (on a 0–10 scale) at baseline and at 60 minutes in each treatment group. The difference in the ABH gel-treated group compared with placebo was evaluated for noninferiority. Secondary outcomes included the number of vomiting episodes and side effects over time.

Results

The mean change in nausea score from baseline to 60 minutes after treatment in the ABH gel group was 1.7 ± 2.05 and 0.9 ± 2.45 for the placebo group (P = 0.42). The placebo group was found to be noninferior to the ABH gel group in reducing the nausea score. ABH gel also did not decrease vomiting events better than placebo (P = 0.34). Only one patient reported any side effects from the treatments in either arm of the study.

Conclusion

ABH gel in its current formulation should not be used in cancer patients experiencing nausea.

### Lorazepam (Loreev xr) [^113o8XRz]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction

The use of benzodiazepines, including LOREEV XR, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)].

Before prescribing LOREEV XR and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., using a standardized screening tool). Use of LOREEV XR, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of LOREEV XR along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, evaluate the patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate.

5.3 Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions

To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue LOREEV XR or reduce the dosage (a patient-specific plan should be used to taper the dose) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages, and those who have had longer durations of use.

Acute Withdrawal Reactions

The continued use of benzodiazepines, including LOREEV XR, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of LOREEV XR after continued use, or administration of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening (e.g., seizures) [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].

Protracted Withdrawal Syndrome

In some cases, benzodiazepine users have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].

Appendix N — medications for managing intoxication: Benzodiazepines (BZDs) (first line) are GABAergic and indicated for excitatory symptoms, anxiety/agitation, neuromuscular excitation, and seizures. Initial dosing includes lorazepam 1–2 mg IV based on clinical signs and symptoms and duration of effects; diazepam 5–10 mg PO for less severe symptoms based on patient parameters; and midazolam 5 mg IM or 0.01–0.05 mg/kg IV for acute agitation in adult patients, and redosing frequency and dose should be guided by the degree and duration of the clinical effects of the initial dose. Other considerations note parenteral vs. PO administration based on signs and symptom severity and drug availability (eg, parenteral BZD shortages), and IM administration allows for administration in agitated patients without IV access; lorazepam has very slow IM onset (15–30 min); midazolam has very rapid IV onset, allowing for easy titration, and a relatively fast IM onset; if psychosis is primary symptom, antipsychotics should be considered primarily or adjunctively.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^111ccKRN]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

BZDs are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to manage a wide range of conditions, including acute conditions (e.g. panic and acute anxiety, alcohol withdrawal, seizures) and common chronic conditions (e.g. anxiety disorders, primary insomnia). These medications are commonly prescribed and represent important therapeutic tools; however, data on long-term safety and efficacy are limited. BZD use is associated with an increased risk of adverse events including falls, motor vehicle accidents, cognitive impairment, delirium, overdose, and death, particularly when BZDs are used in combination with CNS depressants such as alcohol or opioids. –

Since 2000, fatal overdoses involving BZDs have increased nearly tenfold, often involving the combination of opioids and BZDs. Although prescribing rates for BZDs have fallen since the most recent peak in 2013, in the 2023 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 9.1% of US adults reported use of BZDs in the past year, with more than 15% of those reporting BZD misuse. Between 1996 and 2013, the number of adults filling BZD prescriptions increased from 4.1 to 5.6%, while the total quantity of BZD prescriptions filled more than tripled, from 1.1 to 3.6 kg lorazepam equivalents per 100,000 adults. Over this time, emergency department (ED) visits related to BZDs also tripled, and BZD-related overdose deaths quadrupled. Since 2013, however, BZD prescriptions dispensed from outpatient and mail-order pharmacies have fallen by approximately 33%.

### ABH gel is not absorbed from the skin of normal volunteers [^114dbJZs]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Lorazepam (Ativan(®)), diphenhydramine (Benadryl(®)), haloperidol (Haldol(®)) (ABH) topical gel is currently widely used for nausea in hospice because of perceived efficacy and low cost and has been suggested for cancer chemotherapy. However, there are no studies of absorption, a prerequisite for effectiveness. We completed this study to establish whether ABH gel drugs are absorbed, as a prerequisite to effectiveness.

Intervention

Ten healthy volunteers, aged 25 to 58 years (mean 37 years), two African Americans and eight Caucasian Americans, applied the standard 1.0 mL dose (2mg of lorazepam, 25mg of diphenhydramine, and 2mg of haloperidol in a pluronic lecithin organogel), rubbed on the volar surface of the wrists by the subject.

Measures

Blood samples were obtained at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 minutes. Plasma concentrations were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using deuterated internal standards for each drug.

Outcomes

No lorazepam or haloperidol was detected in any sample from any of the 10 volunteers down to a level of 0.05 ng/mL. Diphenhydramine was found in multiple plasma samples at concentrations > 0.05 ng/mL in three patients, with the highest concentration of 0.30 ng/mL in one person at 240 minutes. Overall, five of 10 patients exhibited detectable diphenhydramine in one or more samples, supporting limited absorption. No subject noted any side effects.

Conclusions/Lessons Learned

As commonly used, none of the lorazepam, haloperidol, or diphenhydramine in ABH gel is absorbed in sufficient quantities to be effective in the treatment of nausea and vomiting. Diphenhydramine is erratically absorbed at subtherapeutic levels. The efficacy of ABH gel should be confirmed in randomized trials before its use is recommended.

### Self-reported benzodiazepine use among adults with chronic spinal cord injury in the southeastern USA: associations with demographic, injury, and opioid use characteristics [^114tYdjk]. Spinal Cord (2024). Medium credibility.

To assess prescription benzodiazepine use, participants were asked, "In the past 12 months, which, if any, of these sedatives or tranquilizers have you used?" and asked to indicate the frequency of use as Never, Once or twice, Monthly, Weekly, or Daily/almost daily. The SRA informed them that "tranquilizers are usually prescribed to relax people, to calm people down, to relieve anxiety, or to relax muscle spasms; and that some people call them nerve pills". Prescription sedatives were defined as "drugs that are also called sleeping pills or downers. People take these drugs to help them relax or help them sleep". The specific benzodiazepines included: (a) Alprazolam (Xanax®, Xanax® XR); (b) Lorazepam (Ativan®); (c) Clonazepam (Klonopin®); (d) Diazepam (Valium®); (e) Flurazepam (Dalmane®); (f) Temazepam (Restoril®); and (g) Triazolam (Halcion®).

For the opioid items, participants were asked, "In the past 12 months, which, if any, of these prescription pain relievers have you used?" and reported the frequency of use (Never, Once or twice, Monthly, Weekly, or Daily/almost daily). Participants were asked about their use of prescription pain relievers, because they were more likely to understand the term "pain relievers" rather than "opioids", since "pain relievers" indicates the purpose for which the drugs are likely to be taken. Eleven common opioids comprise the item set. The methods of assessment have been documented in a previous manuscript.

Based on participant responses and regularity of use, we combined "once or twice" with "monthly" use, and "daily/almost daily" use with "weekly" use; we refer to once/monthly or weekly/daily use of the drugs in the cross-tabulation and the logistic regression model. Our operational definition of concurrent use included those individuals who indicated "weekly" or "daily/almost daily" using both any opioid and any benzodiazepine. Although individuals who indicated using these medications "monthly", or "once or twice", may also experience risky concurrent use, due the greater uncertainty of overlap in the frequency of use, they were not included in our definition.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (5.1, 7)
The use of benzodiazepines, including LOREEV XR, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Before prescribing LOREEV XR and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (5.2)
Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of LOREEV XR after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue LOREEV XR or reduce the dosage (2.4, 5.3)

### Lorazepam [^114xNL3q]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Use of benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, both used alone and in combination with other CNS depressants may lead to potentially fatal respiratory depression. (See PRECAUTIONS Clinically Significant Drug Interactions)

Use of benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, may lead to physical and psychological dependence.

As with all patients on CNS-depressant drugs, patients receiving lorazepam should be warned not to operate dangerous machinery or motor vehicles and that their tolerance for alcohol and other CNS depressants will be diminished.

Physical and Psychological Dependence

The use of benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, may lead to physical and psychological dependence. The risk of dependence increases with higher doses and longer term use and is further increased in patients with a history of alcoholism or drug abuse or in patients with significant personality disorders. The dependence potential is reduced when lorazepam is used at the appropriate dose for short-term treatment. Addiction-prone individuals (such as drug addicts or alcoholics) should be under careful surveillance when receiving lorazepam or other psychotropic agents.

In general, benzodiazepines should be prescribed for short periods only (e.g. 2 to 4 weeks). Extension of the treatment period should not take place without reevaluation of the need for continued therapy. Continuous long-term use of the product is not recommended. Withdrawal symptoms (e.g. rebound insomnia) can appear following cessation of recommended doses after as little as one week of therapy. Abrupt discontinuation of product should be avoided and a gradual dosage-tapering schedule followed after extended therapy.

It's just these continuous cascades. This person might have been fine. Maybe they're getting a bit more agitated or a bit more kind of restless at home. So the wife calls the family doc, and the family doc… prescribes Ativan (lorazepam). But it's well known that Ativan causes falls and cognitive impairment. So as a geriatrician, I would never use it. It has to do with the capacity of medical professionals to understand the implications of the drugs that they're prescribing. And so, yes, this person now has a fall, breaks a hip… and comes into hospital. And I can trace it all back to, ugh, if we had just not done the Ativan.

She detailed the "flip side" of knowing which medications facilitated avoidance of challenges:

On the flip side… there's someone who has really bad behaviours… and family doc didn't feel comfortable prescribing anything. They came into hospital and the family is so burnt out, they can't manage anything. And if we had just been able to get them access to behavioural management a few weeks earlier we could have avoided that admission. But now… they're headed for long-term care.

James thus felt it necessary to engage in "capacity building for geriatric care across the system". Sunita (caregiver) conveyed that pharmacists were well-positioned to mitigate iatrogenic harm from conflicting medications when they had a keen clinical acumen (Table 6):

The role of a pharmacist is extremely important because they are the ones who have access to all medications. And a lot of times you go into one doctor and another doctor and they give you different stuff. The buck stops at the pharmacist because they are supposed to be able to know, "You know what, you can't take this one [medication] with this one [other medication] because it's going to do this".

Study selection and analysis

A comprehensive literature search of BZD medication therapy use in adult patients in the ED for the treatment of acute agitation was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar (update: April 2024) to identify primary literature. Studies were excluded if the population only included patients suffering from substance intoxication. Search terms included "antipsychotic agents"; "lorazepam"; "midazolam"; "diazepam"; "emergency service". Published reports on double-blind clinical trials were included in this review. Open-label studies of a given medication were included if no published double-blind studies were identified. In addition, referenced citations from publications identified in the search were also reviewed.

### Lorazepam [^115fTtTy]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Lorazepam is administered orally. For optimal results, dose, frequency of administration, and duration of therapy should be individualized according to patient response. To facilitate this, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg tablets are available.

The usual range is 2 to 6 mg/day given in divided doses, the largest dose being taken before bedtime, but the daily dosage may vary from 1 to 10 mg/day.

For anxiety, most patients require an initial dose of 2 to 3 mg/day given two times a day or three times a day.

For insomnia due to anxiety or transient situational stress, a single daily dose of 2 to 4 mg may be given, usually at bedtime.

For elderly or debilitated patients, an initial dosage of 1 to 2 mg/day in divided doses is recommended, to be adjusted as needed and tolerated.

The dosage of lorazepam should be increased gradually when needed to help avoid adverse effects. When higher dosage is indicated, the evening dose should be increased before the daytime doses.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^114k4vzo]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal seizures — acute treatment and anticonvulsant options — are outlined as follows: Benzodiazepines are effective in the primary and secondary prevention of alcohol withdrawal seizures, and intravenous (IV) administration of a fast-acting agent such as lorazepam or diazepam is recommended after a withdrawal-related seizure; in a randomized, double-blind trial, patients received either 2 mL of saline or 2 mL of lorazepam intravenously and IV lorazepam significantly reduced recurrent seizures. All patients presenting with an alcohol withdrawal seizure should have IV access established immediately for fluids and medication, and intramuscular (IM) administration is also an effective and acceptable route. Phenobarbital is an appropriate option with a long half-life and a narrow therapeutic window and is more commonly used in an inpatient setting, such as the intensive care unit (ICU) or emergency department (ED) where there is continuous supervision; the Guideline Committee recommends caution when using in settings that offer less monitoring than the ICU and ED, and clinicians with minimal experience should use extra caution in case over-sedation or respiratory depression occurs. Supporting data include a prospective series in which none of the 38 patients with alcohol withdrawal seizures had a subsequent convulsion after IV phenobarbital, and a small randomized trial in the ED found phenobarbital to be as effective as benzodiazepines for reducing CIWA-Ar scores from baseline to discharge. While animal studies show anticonvulsants can prevent seizures and delirium, human evidence is mixed and insufficient to conclude superiority over benzodiazepines, and phenytoin has been shown to be ineffective in preventing the recurrence of seizure and is not recommended unless treating a concomitant underlying seizure disorder.

### Lorazepam (Loreev xr) [^112U3tPF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

9.1 Controlled Substance

LOREEV XR contains lorazepam, a Schedule IV controlled substance.

9.2 Abuse

LOREEV XR is a benzodiazepine and a CNS depressant with a potential for abuse and addiction. Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a health care provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Even taking benzodiazepines as prescribed may put patients at risk for abuse and misuse of their medication. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines may lead to addiction.

Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death. Benzodiazepines are often sought by individuals who abuse drugs and other substances, and by individuals with addictive disorders [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

The following adverse reactions have occurred with benzodiazepine abuse and/or misuse: abdominal pain, amnesia, anorexia, anxiety, aggression, ataxia, blurred vision, confusion, depression, disinhibition, disorientation, dizziness, euphoria, impaired concentration and memory, indigestion, irritability, muscle pain, slurred speech, tremors, and vertigo.

The following severe adverse reactions have occurred with benzodiazepine abuse and/or misuse: delirium, paranoia, suicidal ideation and behavior, seizures, coma, breathing difficulty, and death. Death is more often associated with polysubstance use (especially benzodiazepines with other CNS depressants such as opioids and alcohol).

### Haloperidol for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in palliative care patients [^116jU1wf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms in patients with terminal, incurable illnesses. Both nausea and vomiting can be distressing. Haloperidol is commonly prescribed to relieve these symptoms. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 2, 2009, of Haloperidol for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in palliative care patients.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and adverse events associated with the use of haloperidol for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in palliative care patients.

Search Methods

For this updated review, we performed updated searches of CENTRAL, EMBASE and MEDLINE in November 2013 and in November 2014. We searched controlled trials registers in March 2015 to identify any ongoing or unpublished trials. We imposed no language restrictions. For the original review, we performed database searching in August 2007, including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and AMED, using relevant search terms and synonyms. Handsearching complemented the electronic searches (using reference lists of included studies, relevant chapters and review articles) for the original review.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of haloperidol for the treatment of nausea or vomiting, or both, in any setting, for inclusion. The studies had to be conducted with adults receiving palliative care or suffering from an incurable progressive medical condition. We excluded studies where nausea or vomiting, or both, were thought to be secondary to pregnancy or surgery.

Data Collection and Analysis

We imported records from each of the electronic databases into a bibliographic package and merged them into a core database where we inspected titles, keywords and abstracts for relevance. If it was not possible to accept or reject an abstract with certainty, we obtained the full text of the article for further evaluation. The two review authors independently assessed studies in accordance with the inclusion criteria. There were no differences in opinion between the authors with regard to the assessment of studies.

Main Results

We considered 27 studies from the 2007 search. In this update we considered a further 38 studies from the 2013 search, and two in the 2014 search. We identified one RCT of moderate quality with low risk of bias overall which met the inclusion criteria for this update, comparing ABH (Ativan®, Benadryl®, Haldol®) gel, applied to the wrist, with placebo for the relief of nausea in 22 participants. ABH gel includes haloperidol as well as diphenhydramine and lorazepam. The gel was not significantly better than placebo in this small study; however haloperidol is reported not to be absorbed significantly when applied topically, therefore the trial does not address the issue of whether haloperidol is effective or well-tolerated when administered by other routes (e.g. by mouth, subcutaneously or intravenously). We identified one ongoing trial of haloperidol for the management of nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer, with initial results published in a conference abstract suggesting that haloperidol is effective for 65% of patients. The trial had not been fully published at the time of our review. A further trial has opened, comparing oral haloperidol with oral methotrimeprazine (levomepromazine) for patients with cancer and nausea unrelated to their treatment, which we aim to include in the next review update.

Authors' Conclusions

Since the last version of this review, we found one new study for inclusion but the conclusion remains unchanged. There is incomplete evidence from published RCTs to determine the effectiveness of haloperidol for nausea and vomiting in palliative care. Other than the trial of ABH gel vs placebo, we did not identify any fully published RCTs exploring the effectiveness of haloperidol for nausea and vomiting in palliative care patients for this update, but two trials are underway.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^111HaPj4]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine withdrawal risk by dose, duration, and frequency (Table 3) — clinical consensus estimates indicate that with any duration and ≤ 3 days per week the risk is no; with < 1 month and ≥ 4 days per week the risk is lower risk, but possible; with 1–3 months and ≥ 4 days per week at low total daily dose the risk is lower risk, but possible, whereas at moderate to high dose the risk is yes, with greater risk with increasing dose and duration; with ≥ 3 months and ≥ 4 days per week at any dose the risk is yes, with greater risk with increasing dose and duration. A low daily dose is estimated as 10 mg diazepam equivalents or less (e.g., ≤ 0.5 mg clonazepam, ≤ 2 mg lorazepam, ≤ 1 mg alprazolam), a moderate daily dose is estimated as 10–15 mg diazepam equivalents (e.g., 0.5–1.5 mg clonazepam, 2–3 mg lorazepam, 1–2 mg alprazolam), and a high daily dose is estimated as more than 15 mg diazepam equivalents (e.g., > 1.5 mg clonazepam, > 3 mg lorazepam, > 2 mg alprazolam).

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^117Nqcwy]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Selection of longer-acting benzodiazepines during transition reports that guidelines recommending a transition most commonly endorse switching to diazepam or clonazepam, with a few suggesting chlordiazepoxide; because all of these are metabolized in the liver and have active metabolites, they should not be used in patients with significant hepatic impairment; instead, lorazepam — which is not impacted by hepatic function and does not have active metabolites — is a better agent in these patients; conversion to diazepam equivalents is not straightforward and depends on patient factors such as age, metabolism, and other medications.

SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS

Recommendations for Considerations for Tapering Benzodiazepines

Clinicians should ideally assess the risks and benefits of ongoing BZD prescribing at least every 3 months for each patient taking BZD medications (see Tables 2 and 3; Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). a At a minimum, clinicians should assess the risks and benefits with each new BZD prescription or BZD prescription renewal (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). b Clinicians should review the information in the relevant prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) as part of the risk–benefit assessment (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

Table 2
Potential Benefits and Risks of Continued BZD Use and BZD Tapering

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including LOREEV XR, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing LOREEV XR and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including LOREEV XR, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of LOREEV XR after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue LOREEV XR or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Prescription characteristics associated with fall-related injury risk among older adults prescribed benzodiazepines: a cohort study [^1111efX5]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Exposures

For both cohorts, our primary exposures of interest were characteristics of the prescribed BZD as well as prescriptions of other common CNS-active medications (Table S 1). For the index BZD, we derived average daily dosage (< 1, 1–1.99, or 2+ in lorazepam-equivalent [lor-eq] mg/day hereafter) and days' supply (< 14, 14–30, or 30+ days). For the continuing BZD cohort, we also computed the baseline BZD medication possession ratio (MPR), calculated as the sum of BZD days prescribed during baseline divided by 180 days (i.e. the 6-month baseline; Figure S 2), categorized as < 0.5, 0.5–1, or > 1. These variables were categorized based on clinically meaningful cut-points similar to prior analyses.

For the other exposures of interest, we used prescription fills and days prescribed during the baseline to classify each cohort member, on the index date, as a current (i.e. exposure that covered the index date), former (i.e. exposure during baseline that did not include the index date), or never use (no days of exposure during baseline or the index date) of: antidepressants, antiepileptics, antipsychotics, opioids, and non-benzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonists (i.e. 'z-drugs').

Benzodiazepines for agitation — mechanism and agent attributes are noted: Benzodiazepines exert their CNS depressant effect by binding to presynaptic γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, and GABA, the primary CNS inhibitory neurotransmitter, decreases neuronal excitability; commonly used agents are lorazepam, midazolam, and diazepam; some experts prefer lorazepam for the management of acute agitation because it has fast onset of action, rapid and complete absorption, and no active metabolites; midazolam may have a more rapid onset but a shorter duration of action; diazepam has a longer half-life and erratic absorption when given intramuscularly (IM).

Buspirone is available in 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg tablets. We recommend starting with a dosage of 2.5 mg (half of a 5 mg tablet) given each morning. We then increase the dosage by 2.5 mg weekly, in the morning and at "after school" time points. We continue in this manner until the symptoms of anxiety are "much improved" or "very much improved", the patient develops interfering side effects (see above) that limit further dose escalation, or we reach a target dose of 15 mg twice a day.

While no published trials have been completed in ASD, benzodiazepines can be highly effective for acute episodes of anxiety (i.e. as needed for acute panic attacks) but can also be used as a short-term treatment of anxiety while waiting for a primary medication to take effect. Lorazepam dosing depends on its specific intent (acute administration or as a short-term treatment) and the age of the individual. Minimal dose is typically initiated to achieve efficacy without sedation or dizziness. For acute dosing, which is the most common use of lorazepam, children can be given 0.25 mg up to 1 mg, and adults can be given 0.5 mg up to 2 mg. However, in some cases, it may be advantageous to start at an even lower dose (0.125 in children and 0.25 in adults). For short-term daily treatment, with the intended action of 4–6 h, the frequency of administration would be 2–3 times/day with a total maximum daily dose of 1–3 mg. Clinical exceptions may require higher dosing. Side effects include sedation, dizziness, impaired muscle coordination (ataxia), and confusion. A less common yet notable side effect may include misuse or development of addiction (with increased risk in individuals who have a history of substance misuse). To protect against misuse, clinicians may consider short-term usage only or increase the monitoring of refill durations. Benzodiazepines can act with other sedating medications (to increase the risk of sedation), and at high dosages, risks include suppression of respiration drive, which is contraindicated for treating sleep in patients with sleep apnea. In addition, patients taking more than 3 mg in 24 h are at risk for seizure if medication is stopped suddenly. Prescribers are advised to taper down as the safest way to discontinue use. Finally, benzodiazepines also carry a risk of paradoxical reactions in those with neurodevelopmental disorders (again emphasizing the need to start low and go slow).

Anxiety in relation to medical procedures — management of moderate-to-severe episodic anxiety that has not responded to behavioural approaches may include the benzodiazepine lorazepam, which may be considered for short-term use, with benzodiazepines preferable to SSRIs primarily when rapid onset of action is needed or when serotonergic agents are contraindicated. Use of benzodiazepines requires additional caution and monitoring for those with a history of substance abuse, depression or an elevated risk for respiratory depression. Lorazepam is available in both oral and intravenous forms, its duration of action is short enough to avoid a prolonged period of sedation following a procedure, and it is renally excreted with no hepatic metabolism, which reduces medication interactions and may be useful in the context of CF liver disease; however, dose reduction may be necessary in patients who develop renal insufficiency.

### EFNS guideline on the diagnosis and management of alcohol-related seizures: report of an EFNS task force [^114wmjpK]. European Journal of Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Despite being a considerable problem in neurological practice and responsible for one-third of seizure-related admissions, there is little consensus as to the optimal investigation and management of alcohol-related seizures. The final literature search was undertaken in September 2004. Consensus recommendations are given graded according to the EFNS guidance regulations. To support the history taking, use of a structured questionnaire is recommended. When the drinking history is inconclusive, elevated values of carbohydrate-deficient transferrin and/or gammaglutamyl transferase can support a clinical suspicion. A first epileptic seizure should prompt neuroimaging (CT or MRI). Before starting any carbohydrate containing fluids or food, patients presenting with suspected alcohol overuse should be given prophylactic thiamine parenterally. After an alcohol withdrawal seizure (AWS), the patient should be observed in hospital for at least 24 h and the severity of withdrawal symptoms needs to be followed. For patients with no history of withdrawal seizures and mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms, routine seizure preventive treatment is not necessary. Generally, benzodiazepines are efficacious and safe for primary and secondary seizure prevention; diazepam or, if available, lorazepam, is recommended. The efficacy of other drugs is insufficiently documented. Concerning long-term recommendations for non-alcohol dependent patients with partial epilepsy and controlled seizures, small amounts of alcohol may be safe. Alcohol-related seizures require particular attention both in the diagnostic work-up and treatment. Benzodiazepines should be chosen for the treatment and prevention of recurrent AWS.

### A comparison of injectable diazepam and lorazepam in the goal-directed management of severe alcohol withdrawal [^113FjG9U]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Benzodiazepines are the gold standard for treatment of alcohol withdrawal, yet the selection of a preferred benzodiazepine is limited due to a lack of comparative studies.

Objectives

The primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of injectable lorazepam (LZP) and diazepam (DZP) in the treatment of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS).

Methods

Retrospective cohort study of adult patients admitted to an intensive care unit with a primary diagnosis of AWS. Subjects who received at least 12 LZP equivalent units (LEU) of injectable DZP or LZP within 24 hours of initiation of the severe AWS protocol were included. The primary outcome was time with Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-Revised (CIWA-Ar) scores at goal over the first 24 hours of treatment.

Results

A total of 191 patients were included (DZP n = 89, LZP n = 102). Time with CIWA-Ar scores at goal during the first 24 hours was similar between groups (DZP 12 hours [interquartile range, IQR, = 9–15] vs LZP 14 hours [IQR = 10–17]), P = 0.06). At 24 hours, LEU requirement was similar (DZP 40 [IQR = 22–78] vs LZP 32 [IQR = 18–56], P = 0.05). Drug cost at 24 hours was higher in the DZP group ($204.6 [IQR = 112.53–398.97] vs $8 [IQR = 4.5–14], P < 0.01).

Conclusion and Relevance

DZP or LZP are equally efficacious for the treatment of severe AWS. LZP may be preferred due to cost but both medications can be used interchangeably based on availability.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^111h6hX4]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to management of withdrawal seizure, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to initiate immediate treatment with a medication effective at preventing another seizure following a withdrawal seizure. Administer benzodiazepines as first-line therapy, preferably a fast-acting agent such as lorazepam or diazepam. Consider administering phenobarbital as another option but is less preferred than benzodiazepines.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^111LK8VM]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Anxiety disorders

Patients with BD frequently experience symptoms of anxiety and comorbid anxiety disorders (GAD, panic disorder, post‐traumatic stress disorder and others). Clinical samples indicate that 24%‐56% of patients with BD meet criteria for one or more anxiety disorders, with the highest rates in women. 720 Comorbid anxiety symptoms and anxiety disorders are associated with a higher number of mood episodes and depressive symptoms, including suicidality and sleep disturbance, and greater impairment of psychosocial functioning and quality of life. 721 The presence of a comorbid anxiety disorder is also associated with high rates of use of antidepressants, 722 which should be employed with caution due to their potential for mood destabilization (Section 4).

While the CANMAT Task Force report 720 described key studies and treatment recommendations in length, those recommendations have been updated below. However, it remains the case that there are few studies that have focused exclusively on anxiety symptoms or disorders comorbid with BD, whether for treatment efficacy or safety. While there are treatment options, the limitations resulting from a paucity of data prevent the development of clear guidelines or treatment algorithms.

A "step‐wise" approach was recommended in the 2012 CANMAT recommendations for managing comorbid anxiety. In general, mood stabilization is the priority before specific anxiety treatments are considered (Figure 9). Despite clinical experience, antidepressants, particularly serotoninergic agents, should be employed with caution due to their potential to provoke mood destabilization. While benzodiazepines are an important clinical tool because they can rapidly alleviate anxiety, clinicians should strive to prescribe them at the lowest possible dose for the shortest period possible, given the concerns about suicide risk, abuse and dependence. CBT continues to be an appropriate first‐line treatment for anxiety.

### Brief interventions targeting long-term benzodiazepine and Z-drug use in primary care: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111UyPzm]. Addiction (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Benzodiazepines have multiple clinical indications, including anxiety and insomnia. Guidelines recommend restricting benzodiazepine prescriptions to short‐term use (≤ 4 weeks) to minimize adverse outcomes, such as dependence and withdrawal symptoms [1, 2]. Similar recommendations apply to Z‐drugs (e.g. zopiclone, zolpidem), a group of non‐benzodiazepine hypnotics which are also available to treat insomnia [3]. However, guidelines are often not adhered to, as long‐term use of these medications, which are collectively referred to as benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZRAs), persists world‐wide [4, 5]. Numerous countries have reported no notable changes, or only modest decreases, in benzodiazepine use in recent years [6, 7, 8, 9]. In some instances, changes in benzodiazepine prescribing have been offset by increased Z‐drug prescribing [5, 9, 10, 11] for which evidence of a more favourable risk profile is lacking [3].

The estimated prevalence of long‐term BZRA use (> 6 months) among the general population varies throughout countries (range = 6–15%), with the highest prevalence reported among older people (range = 22–55%), typically defined as ≥ 65 years [12, 13, 14]. Long‐term benzodiazepine use is one of the most commonly identified indicators of potentially inappropriate prescribing in older people [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. This is concerning, as age‐related physiological changes impact on the drugs' pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, thereby making older adults most susceptible to BZRAs' adverse effects such as falls, fractures and cognitive impairment [21, 22]. Only in recent years have prescribing tools to assess quality use of medicines incorporated Z‐drugs (e.g. Beers criteria [23]). Hence, comparatively fewer studies have examined potentially inappropriate Z‐drug prescribing and associated risks [24, 25]. The ongoing issue of long‐term BZRA use has called existing guidelines into question [26]. As long‐term BZRA prescribing also occurs in middle‐aged populations (typically defined as 45–64 years) [7, 27], the problem is likely to persist for generations to come without targeted interventions.

### Lorazepam (Loreev xr) [^114woRG2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of lorazepam tablets were not adequate to determine whether patients age 65 years and older responded differently than younger patients; however, the incidence of sedation and unsteadiness was observed to increase with age [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Age does not appear to have a significant effect on lorazepam pharmacokinetics [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Greater sensitivity (e.g., sedation) of some older individuals cannot be ruled out [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

As with all benzodiazepines, the use of lorazepam, including LOREEV XR, may worsen hepatic encephalopathy. Therefore, LOREEV XR should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency and/or encephalopathy.

### Muscle relaxants for pain management in rheumatoid arthritis [^117DLgSv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Pain management is a high priority for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Muscle relaxants include drugs that reduce muscle spasm (for example benzodiazepines such as diazepam (Valium), alprazolam (Xanax), lorazepam (Ativan) and non-benzodiazepines such as metaxalone (Skelaxin) or a combination of paracetamol and orphenadrine (Muscol)) and drugs that prevent increased muscle tone (baclofen and dantrolene). Despite a paucity of evidence supporting their use, antispasmodic and antispasticity muscle relaxants have gained widespread clinical acceptance as adjuvants in the management of patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to determine the efficacy and safety of muscle relaxants in pain management in patients with RA. The muscle relaxants that were included in this review are the antispasmodic benzodiazepines (alprazolam, bromazepam, chlordiazepoxide, cinolazepam, clonazepam, cloxazolam, clorazepate, diazepam, estazolam, flunitrazepam, flurazepam, flutoprazepam, halazepam, ketazolam, loprazolam, lorazepam, lormetazepam, medazepam, midazolam, nimetazepam, nitrazepam, nordazepam, oxazepam, pinazepam, prazepam, quazepam, temazepam, tetrazepam, triazolam), antispasmodic non-benzodiazepines (cyclobenzaprine, carisoprodol, chlorzoxazone, meprobamate, methocarbamol, metaxalone, orphenadrine, tizanidine and zopiclone), and antispasticity drugs (baclofen and dantrolene sodium).

Search Methods

We performed a search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 4th quarter 2010), MEDLINE (1950 to week 1 November 2010), EMBASE (Week 44 2010), and PsycINFO (1806 to week 2 November 2010). We also searched the 2008 to 2009 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) abstracts and performed a handsearch of reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials which compared a muscle relaxant to another therapy (active, including non-pharmacological therapies, or placebo) in adult patients with RA and that reported at least one clinically relevant outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two blinded review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the trials. Meta-analyses were used to examine the efficacy of muscle relaxants on pain, depression, sleep and function, as well as their safety.

Main Results

Six trials (126 participants) were included in this review. All trials were rated at high risk of bias. Five cross-over trials evaluated a benzodiazepine, four assessed diazepam (n = 71) and one assessed triazolam (n = 15). The sixth trial assessed zopiclone (a non-benzodiazepine) (n = 40) and was a parallel group study. No trial duration was longer than two weeks while three single dose trials assessed outcomes at 24 hours only. Overall the included trials failed to find evidence of a beneficial effect of muscle relaxants over placebo, alone (at 24 hrs, 1 or 2 weeks) or in addition to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (at 24 hrs), on pain intensity, function, or quality of life. Data from two trials of longer than 24 hours duration (n = 74) (diazepam and zopiclone) found that participants who received a muscle relaxant had significantly more adverse events compared with those who received placebo (number needed to harm (NNTH) 3, 95% CI 2 to 7). These were predominantly central nervous system side effects, including dizziness and drowsiness (NNTH 3, 95% CI 2 to 11).

Authors' Conclusions

Based upon the currently available evidence in patients with RA, benzodiazepines (diazepam and triazolam) do not appear to be beneficial in improving pain over 24 hours or one week. The non-benzodiazepine agent zopiclone also did not significantly reduce pain over two weeks. However, even short term muscle relaxant use (24 hours to 2 weeks) is associated with significant adverse events, predominantly drowsiness and dizziness.

Administration can be oral, IM or IV. Parenteral administration can be particularly useful if oral administration is not possible, for example due to negativism. Lorazepam is usually administered in 2–4 divided doses each day.

Reported response ranges from 66% up to 100%. These studies were mainly conducted in Western countries. Studies conducted in India and Asia show more variable response, ranging from 0% to 100%. The reason for these differences remains unclear, but it is possible that – given that lorazepam is unstable at room temperature – storage conditions may play a role. Usually, administration of lorazepam is well tolerated, and major side effects are rare. Even a dose as high as 16 mg of lorazepam is often well tolerated without sedation.

### Lorazepam vs diazepam for pediatric status epilepticus: a randomized clinical trial [^114Gd1nE]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Benzodiazepines are considered first-line therapy for pediatric status epilepticus. Some studies suggest that lorazepam may be more effective or safer than diazepam, but lorazepam is not Food and Drug Administration approved for this indication.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that lorazepam has better efficacy and safety than diazepam for treating pediatric status epilepticus.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This double-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted from March 1, 2008, to March 14, 2012. Patients aged 3 months to younger than 18 years with convulsive status epilepticus presenting to 1 of 11 US academic pediatric emergency departments were eligible. There were 273 patients; 140 randomized to diazepam and 133 to lorazepam.

Interventions

Patients received either 0.2 mg/kg of diazepam or 0.1 mg/kg of lorazepam intravenously, with half this dose repeated at 5 minutes if necessary. If status epilepticus continued at 12 minutes, fosphenytoin was administered.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy outcome was cessation of status epilepticus by 10 minutes without recurrence within 30 minutes. The primary safety outcome was the performance of assisted ventilation. Secondary outcomes included rates of seizure recurrence and sedation and times to cessation of status epilepticus and return to baseline mental status. Outcomes were measured 4 hours after study medication administration.

Results

Cessation of status epilepticus for 10 minutes without recurrence within 30 minutes occurred in 101 of 140 (72.1%) in the diazepam group and 97 of 133 (72.9%) in the lorazepam group, with an absolute efficacy difference of 0.8% (95% CI, -11.4% to 9.8%). Twenty-six patients in each group required assisted ventilation (16.0% given diazepam and 17.6% given lorazepam; absolute risk difference, 1.6%; 95% CI, -9.9% to 6.8%). There were no statistically significant differences in secondary outcomes except that lorazepam patients were more likely to be sedated (66.9% vs 50%, respectively; absolute risk difference, 16.9%; 95% CI, 6.1% to 27.7%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among pediatric patients with convulsive status epilepticus, treatment with lorazepam did not result in improved efficacy or safety compared with diazepam. These findings do not support the preferential use of lorazepam for this condition.

### Discontinuation of psychotropic medication: a synthesis of evidence across medication classes [^111HGttc]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

How to discontinue?

Discontinuation strategies

Lithium: gradual discontinuation of lithium (at least over a month) reduces risk of DS and early recurrence relative to rapid discontinuation. In clinical practice, lithium and other mood stabilizers are often tapered hyperbolically (Supplementary Text). If lithium needs to be discontinued because of inefficacy or severe side effects, it may be replaced with another mood stabilizer or SGA.

Valproate/carbamazepine/lamotrigine: it is unclear whether this also applies to other mood stabilizers.

Dose reduction

Lithium: for lithium, recommended effective doses for the prevention of manic and depressive episodes result in blood plasma levels of 0.6–0.8 mmol/l, or, in some cases, 0.4–0.6 mmol/l. Dose reductions below these levels may diminish effectiveness.

Valproate/carbamazepine/lamotrigine: minimally effective blood levels are less robustly established than for lithium: 50 mg/l for valproate, 4 mg/l for carbamazepine, and 3 mg/l for lamotrigine.

Discontinuation interventions

There are no known interventions to reduce relapse risk or DS during or after mood stabilizer discontinuation. Closely monitoring mood symptoms during discontinuation of mood stabilizers is recommended, for at least 1 year.

Benzodiazepines

Who can discontinue?

Relapse rates after discontinuation

Relapse rates for benzodiazepines are generally intricate to ascertain given the diversity of symptoms for which benzodiazepines are prescribed. Nevertheless, the majority of patients succeed in discontinuing benzodiazepines, as shown by systematic reviews and meta-analyses that found an average 1-year discontinuation success rate of 55–64%.

Discontinuation symptoms (DS)

Most patients discontinuing benzodiazepines experience some degree of DS (59–78%). Physical DS of benzodiazepine discontinuation include muscle tension, weakness, spasms, pain, and influenza-like symptoms (sweating and shivering). Psychological DS include anxiety and panic attacks, restlessness, agitation, depression, mood swings, concentration difficulties, and sleep disturbances. In rare instances, rapid discontinuation may induce more severe DS, including seizures and psychotic symptoms. DS may emerge or worsen weeks after discontinuation, with highest risks in short elimination half-life benzodiazepines (temazepam and lorazepam).

Risk factors for relapse following discontinuation

Patients often want to stop after long-term benzodiazepine use, but face barriers such as dependence and misuse, reliance on benzodiazepines for comfort, and anticipation of sleep problems. Intrinsic motivation and sufficient time to consider the benefits of discontinuation can help.

### Efficacy and safety of intranasal lorazepam versus intramuscular paraldehyde for protracted convulsions in children: an open randomised trial [^114BFJ6u]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Background

In sub-Saharan Africa, rectal diazepam or intramuscular paraldehyde are commonly used as first-line anticonvulsant agents in the emergency treatment of seizures in children. These treatments can be expensive and sometimes toxic. We aimed to assess a drug and delivery system that is potentially more effective, safer, and easier to administer than those presently in use.

Methods

We did an open randomised trial in a paediatric emergency department of a tertiary hospital in Malawi. 160 children aged over 2 months with seizures persisting for more than 5 min were randomly assigned to receive either intranasal lorazepam (100 microg/kg, n = 80) or intramuscular paraldehyde (0.2 mL/kg, n = 80). The primary outcome measure was whether the presenting seizure stopped with one dose of assigned anticonvulsant agent within 10 min of administration. The primary analysis was by intention-to-treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00116064.

Findings

Intranasal lorazepam stopped convulsions within 10 min in 60 (75%) episodes treated (absolute risk 0.75, 95% CI 0.64–0.84), and intramuscular paraldehyde in 49 (61.3%; absolute risk 0.61, 95% CI 0.49–0.72). No clinically important cardiorespiratory events were seen in either group (95% binomial exact CI 0–4.5%), and all children finished the trial.

Interpretation

Intranasal lorazepam is effective, safe, and provides a less invasive alternative to intramuscular paraldehyde in children with protracted convulsions. The ease of use of this drug makes it an attractive and preferable prehospital treatment option.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^112M4tyZ]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Benzodiazepines for behavioral symptoms in dementia — trial scope and comparative efficacy: The use of benzodiazepines has been studied in at least eight randomized clinical trials; in six studies including a total of 873 subjects, benzodiazepines were compared to antipsychotics, and in two studies they were compared to placebo. Overall, benzodiazepines performed better than placebo but not as well as antipsychotics in reducing behavioral problems. In a trial comparing intramuscular lorazepam with intramuscular olanzapine, efficacy was equal at 2 hours but lorazepam was inferior at 24 hours. There are no data concerning efficacy after 8 weeks or evidence that one benzodiazepine is more effective than another.

### Management of the first stage of convulsive status epilepticus in adults: a systematic review of current randomised evidence [^1143kuHY]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Current, limited evidence suggests that both 2 mg IV lorazepam and 5 mg IV diazepam administered by paramedics are more effective than placebo and 10 mg IM midazolam is non-inferior to 4 mg IV lorazepam. The addition of levetiracetam to clonazepam does not offer clear advantages over clonazepam alone. Large well-designed clinical trials are needed to establish which benzodiazepines are more effective and preferable for the first-line treatment of adults with convulsive status epilepticus. In particular, well-designed clinical trials in adults are needed to assess the use of IV lorazepam versus IV diazepam and to confirm the efficacy and safety of IM midazolam versus IV lorazepam. Future clinical trials comparing IM midazolam versus buccal or intranasal midazolam would provide useful information to inform the management of the first stage of convulsive status epilepticus in adults, especially when IV access is not feasible. Future cost-effectiveness analyses will also be useful to guide health policy and more cost-effective use of healthcare resources.

### Prescribing and deprescribing guidance for benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine receptor agonist use in adults with depression, anxiety, and insomnia: an international scoping review [^112cwr2w]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

When BZD are used for anxiety related disorders, there is a clear consensus among most documents to restrict their use to the 'short-term' (often unspecified in terms of duration) but most commonly for less than 4 weeks. Interestingly, alprazolam which has become noticeably more problematic in terms of misuse or harm based on real world data over the past two decades, is still over-represented as a BZD of choice in many guidance documents. This is no doubt attributable to the larger abundance of earlier randomised controlled trial data compared to some other BZDs for conditions such as PD. However, real world evidence of harm via overdose and diversion trends should be considered in framing future recommendations on BZD selection. For instance, some newer documents specifically advise against the use of alprazolam given its rapid onset and shorter-half life; pharmacokinetic properties that increase its potential for withdrawal and misuse. Other major BZD that were prominently represented were diazepam, lorazepam and, especially; clonazepam which has more long-term use data from clinical trials, particularly in PD.

Another area of clear heterogeneity in guidance was in the dosing pattern recommended. Some major guidelines advise regular scheduled dosing of BZD for common anxiety disorders. In contrast, other documents advise 'prn' use or intermittent dosing. How prescriptions are issued and used in real world medical practice can have profound effects on the development of tolerance or dependence for individuals with these conditions and so this is an area where further clarity could be achieved within future guidelines. This is especially important because recent observational research indicates potentially safer outcomes with intermittent compared to chronic dosing.

Guidance for OCD and PTSD were comparatively limited, based on lack of positive evidence of benefit, and no documents clearly advised their use as first line pharmacologic options. Furthermore, the use of BZD in PTSD has been controversial and frequently ill-advised based on their proposed propensity to interfere with fear extinction in exposure therapy as well as potentiate the development of ongoing stress symptomatology in the aftermath of a traumatic event.
