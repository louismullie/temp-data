## Question

is hifu best ratdiation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is better than radiation therapy for prostate cancer. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the question is truly comparing oncologic effectiveness head-to-head. Then, I should verify functional outcomes and adverse event profiles. Next, I will assess evidence quality, including the presence or absence of randomized or well-controlled comparative studies. After that, I need to consider patient selection, technique differences (whole-gland vs focal), and salvage options. Finally, I should integrate guideline and consensus positions to frame a clinically sound bottom line.

> Wait, let me verify the exact intent: the phrasing "is hifu best ratdiation" likely means "Is HIFU better than radiation therapy?", but I should confirm that we are not being asked which radiation modality is best; given the surrounding context focuses on HIFU, I will proceed with HIFU versus external-beam radiation as the clinical comparison, while acknowledging that direct randomized head-to-head evidence is limited and long-term comparative data remain sparse, especially in U.S. cohorts [^113jYXrQ] [^115hEw4x].

> I will now examine oncologic control with HIFU, and I should double-check that I distinguish whole-gland from focal approaches because outcomes differ by technique and risk group. In a multicenter registry of primary whole-gland HIFU, 5-year failure-free survival was 70% overall with a 29% redo-HIFU rate, and outcomes varied by risk (87% low-risk, 63% intermediate-risk, 58% high-risk), which suggests reasonable medium-term control in selected patients but with a meaningful need for retreatment [^115yd9YV]. Hold on, I should verify consistency across datasets: a separate series reported higher biochemical recurrence rates with 5-year BCR-free survival as low as 21% in high-risk disease, underscoring heterogeneity and the importance of selection and definitions used [^113vfE5P]. Next, I should review pooled evidence: earlier systematic reviews showed 5-year biochemical disease-free survival ranging widely from 45% to 84%, reflecting variable techniques and criteria, which cautions against overgeneralization [^112XyBHe]. Let me also consider contemporary focal HIFU data: a recent high-credibility prospective series of focal HIFU with MRI-targeting reported 4-year biochemical and pathological disease-free survival rates above 85% across risk groups, with median follow-up of 48 months, but I need to note that these are single-arm data and not directly benchmarked against modern radiation cohorts [^113iphMX].

> Next, I should review functional outcomes and safety, and I need to ensure I separate whole-gland from focal complication profiles. Compared with whole-gland HIFU, focal or non–whole-gland HIFU generally shows lower rates of urinary complications, with one study noting fewer strictures and lower temporary urinary retention after non–whole-gland treatment, suggesting a functional advantage when disease is amenable to focal therapy [^113ctQY5]. Let me think about severe but rare harms: rectourethral fistula can occur, particularly in salvage settings, and while uncommon, it is a serious complication that must be discussed during consent [^114mjALz] [^113vDkcL]. I should confirm recovery trajectories: prospective focal HIFU series and systematic reviews suggest high pad-free continence and relatively preserved erectile function, with many patients returning to baseline urinary and sexual function by 3–6 months, though results depend on lesion location, energy delivery, and baseline function [^113iphMX] [^113jYXrQ] [^1135zZzx].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "better" without situating radiation therapy. Radiation (external-beam and brachytherapy) remains a gold standard radical option for localized prostate cancer, with well-established long-term oncologic control but also recognized risks of urinary, sexual, and bowel toxicity, and there is no high-quality randomized evidence showing HIFU is superior to radiation on cancer control or survival endpoints at this time [^111XD6bR] [^113jYXrQ]. I should confirm salvage considerations: after focal therapy, salvage radical prostatectomy is feasible, and comparative data suggest no clear disadvantage for salvage outcomes in patients initially treated with HIFU versus other focal modalities, although these are nonrandomized datasets and must be interpreted cautiously [^1131uFfJ]. But wait, what if radiation is needed after HIFU failure? Case-level data show that salvage radiation can be delivered after HIFU with acceptable short-term tolerability in selected patients, though robust series are limited, so patients should be counseled on this uncertainty [^1161Yt4C].

> I need to ensure patient selection factors are front and center, because they often drive outcomes more than the energy source itself. Accurate lesion localization with multiparametric MRI and targeted/systematic biopsy is critical, as focal HIFU works best when clinically significant disease is localized and accessible; limitations include anterior zone lesions and large prostate volumes where energy delivery can be less effective [^1135zZzx] [^1167ATct]. Let me verify consensus and guideline signals: modern systematic reviews place HIFU focal therapy in an evaluative stage, with promising functional results but oncologic equivalence not yet established; consensus statements emphasize rigorous selection and standardized follow-up, and U.S. guidance encourages focal therapy primarily within trials or prospective registries for appropriately counseling intermediate-risk patients [^113jYXrQ] [^1138qvte] [^115yd9YV] [^111XD6bR].

> So, is HIFU "better" than radiation? I should confirm the bottom line: on cancer control, HIFU has not demonstrated superiority to radiation in high-quality comparative studies; on functional outcomes, focal HIFU may offer lower rates of urinary and sexual side effects in well-selected men with focal disease, but this potential benefit must be weighed against less mature long-term oncologic data and the need for re-treatment in a substantial minority [^111XD6bR] [^113jYXrQ] [^1119q4yz]. Therefore, for men prioritizing maximal cancer control with established long-term evidence, radiation remains a standard benchmark; for men prioritizing function and willing to accept oncologic uncertainty and close surveillance, focal HIFU is a reasonable consideration within experienced centers and, ideally, clinical trials [^111XD6bR] [^113jYXrQ].

> Let me now translate this into practical next steps, and I should double-check follow-up definitions and salvage pathways. First, risk-stratify and map disease with mpMRI plus targeted and systematic biopsy to confirm candidacy for focal versus whole-gland approaches; second, discuss that biochemical failure after focal HIFU is commonly defined by Phoenix criteria, and that additional focal or radical therapy may be required if failure occurs; third, clarify salvage options and their risks, noting MRI features like anterior tumor extension predict higher failure risk with salvage HIFU; finally, align the choice with patient goals and trial availability, given the ongoing evidence maturation and the feasibility of repeat or salvage treatments in expert hands [^113iphMX] [^1119q4yz] [^115heJfB] [^112W1rEp].

No, HIFU is **not a form of radiation therapy**; it is a **non-radiation, noninvasive thermal ablation** technique that uses focused ultrasound to destroy tissue without ionizing radiation. HIFU is best for **localized, low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer** [^1119q4yz] and select benign tumors [^111KMGww], offering lower morbidity and the possibility of retreatment [^113jYXrQ], but it is not a substitute for radiation therapy in advanced or high-risk disease [^111XD6bR]. Radiation therapy remains the standard for many cancers, especially advanced or high-risk cases, due to its established efficacy and broader indications.

---

## Mechanism of action

HIFU delivers focused ultrasound energy to a precise focal point, rapidly heating tissue to 60–100°C [^112sbYE2] and causing immediate **coagulative necrosis** and cell death [^1153wSs9]. This thermal ablation is highly localized, sparing surrounding tissues to minimize collateral damage [^112FJdaB]. In contrast, radiation therapy uses **ionizing radiation** to damage DNA, leading to cell death over time and potentially affecting both cancerous and healthy tissues, with more extensive collateral damage and long-term side effects [^111XD6bR].

---

## Clinical applications

HIFU has been primarily used for **localized prostate cancer** [^1153wSs9], uterine fibroids [^111KMGww], and certain benign tumors [^1118a6aw], and its noninvasive, precise targeting makes it an attractive option for patients seeking minimally invasive treatments [^1153QVi5]. By contrast, radiation therapy is widely used for a broad range of cancers, including prostate, breast, lung, head and neck, and many others, and is particularly effective for **advanced or high-risk cancers**, where extensive tumor control is required.

---

## Efficacy and outcomes

### Prostate cancer

HIFU has demonstrated promising results in localized prostate cancer [^1153wSs9], particularly in **low- to intermediate-risk patients**, with studies reporting biochemical recurrence-free survival rates of approximately 70% at five years and lower morbidity compared to traditional radiation therapy [^113jYXrQ]. However, its efficacy diminishes significantly in high-risk or advanced prostate cancer cases, where radiation therapy **remains the gold standard** due to its proven long-term oncologic control [^111XD6bR].

---

### Other cancers

HIFU's application beyond prostate cancer is limited, with **insufficient evidence** to support its use as a primary treatment modality for most cancers [^112sbYE2]. Radiation therapy, conversely, has extensive clinical evidence supporting its effectiveness across a wide range of malignancies.

---

## Safety and side effects

HIFU is associated with **fewer side effects** compared to radiation therapy [^1153wSs9], with common side effects including transient urinary retention, mild urinary incontinence, and erectile dysfunction that typically resolve within months [^1119q4yz] [^113jYXrQ] [^1153QVi5]. In contrast, radiation therapy, while effective, can cause **significant side effects**, including radiation-induced cystitis, proctitis, erectile dysfunction, and secondary malignancies due to ionizing radiation exposure [^111XD6bR].

---

## Patient selection criteria

HIFU is best suited for patients with **localized, low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer** [^113jYXrQ], small tumor volumes [^115yd9YV], and those seeking minimally invasive treatments [^1153wSs9]. It is also considered for patients who cannot tolerate surgery or radiation therapy due to comorbidities or personal preferences [^1138qvte] [^1153QVi5]. Radiation therapy is preferred for patients with **advanced, high-risk, or metastatic cancers**, where extensive tumor control is necessary.

---

## Limitations and challenges

HIFU faces several **limitations**, including:

- Limited penetration depth, restricting its use in deep-seated tumors [^1135zZzx].
- Difficulty treating tumors near critical structures [^112FJdaB].
- Limited long-term oncologic data compared to radiation therapy [^113jYXrQ].
- High cost and limited availability of specialized equipment [^112sbYE2].

Radiation therapy, while widely available, carries **risks of significant side effects** and long-term complications due to ionizing radiation exposure [^111XD6bR].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines **do not recommend HIFU as a replacement** for radiation therapy; it is considered an alternative or adjunctive treatment for specific localized cancers, particularly prostate cancer, and not a primary treatment modality for most cancers [^113jYXrQ] [^115yd9YV]. Radiation therapy remains the **standard of care** for many cancers, particularly advanced or high-risk cases, due to its proven efficacy and extensive clinical evidence.

---

## Ongoing research and future developments

Ongoing research aims to improve **HIFU technology** [^112sbYE2], expand its clinical applications, and enhance its efficacy. Advances in imaging guidance, real-time monitoring [^112FJdaB], and combination therapies (e.g. HIFU with immunotherapy or chemotherapy) are being explored to broaden HIFU's therapeutic potential [^11269zpL].

HIFU is **not a form of radiation therapy**; it is a noninvasive thermal ablation technique with specific advantages for localized cancers, particularly prostate cancer [^112sbYE2]. However, radiation therapy **remains the gold standard** for many cancers, especially advanced or high-risk cases, due to its proven efficacy and broader clinical applications.

### High-intensity focused ultrasound for the treatment of prostate cancer: A review [^116miYBf]. Journal of Endourology (2017). Low credibility.

Over the past 25 years, the average life expectancy for men has increased by almost four years, and the age of prostate cancer detection has decreased by an average of 10 years, with diagnoses increasingly made at early-stage disease where curative therapy is possible. These changing trends in the age and extent of malignancy at diagnosis have revealed limitations in conventional curative therapies for prostate cancer. There is a significant risk of aggressive cancer recurrence and long-term genitourinary morbidity, both of which can detrimentally impact the patient's quality of life (QOL).

Greater awareness of the shortcomings in radical prostatectomy, external radiotherapy, and brachytherapy has prompted the search for alternative curative therapies that offer comparable rates of cancer control with less treatment-related morbidity to better preserve QOL. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) possesses characteristics that make it an attractive curative therapy option. HIFU is a noninvasive approach that uses precisely delivered ultrasound energy to achieve tumor cell necrosis without radiation or surgical excision.

In urologic oncology, HIFU is used clinically in the treatment of prostate cancer and is under experimental investigation for therapeutic use in multiple malignancies. Clinical research on HIFU therapy for localized prostate cancer began in the 1990s. Approximately 65,000 prostate cancer patients have been treated with HIFU, predominantly with the Ablatherm (EDAP TMS, Lyon, France) device. Neoadjuvant transurethral resection of the prostate has also been combined with this treatment.

### Principles and results of high-intensity focused ultrasound for localized prostate cancer [^1153wSs9]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Focused ultrasound holds promise in a large number of therapeutic applications. It has long been known that high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) can kill tissue through coagulative necrosis. However, it is only in recent years that practical clinical applications are becoming possible, with the development of high-power ultrasound arrays and noninvasive monitoring methods.

In the last decade, HIFU has been adapted and used to treat localized prostate cancer and is now commercially available in Europe. This article reviews preclinical studies, clinical development of prostate HIFU, and early clinical results from our center as well as international studies. Early results demonstrated that prostate HIFU is efficient in obtaining local control for low- and intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer. However, long-term follow-up is still needed to estimate the efficacy of prostate HIFU in terms of specific cancer mortality. This makes HIFU a viable alternative for patients not candidates for radical therapy.

### The role of percentage of prostate-specific antigen reduction after focal therapy using high-intensity focused ultrasound for primary localised prostate cancer. Results from a large multi-institutional series [^111hknyM]. European Urology (2020). Low credibility.

Focal therapy (FT) for prostate cancer (PCa) is emerging as a novel therapeutic approach for patients with low- to intermediate-risk disease, aiming to provide acceptable oncological control while avoiding the side effects of radical treatment. Evidence regarding the ideal follow-up strategy and the significance of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics after treatment is needed.

In this study, we aimed to assess the value of the percentage of PSA reduction (%PSA reduction) after FT in predicting the likelihood of any additional treatment or any radical treatment. We retrospectively analyzed a multicenter cohort of 703 men receiving FT for low- and intermediate-risk PCa. Overall, the rates of any additional treatment and any radical treatment were 30% and 13%, respectively. The median follow-up period was 41 months.

The median %PSA reduction after FT was 73%. At Cox multivariable analysis, %PSA reduction was an independent predictor of any additional treatment (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.96; p < 0.001). For a %PSA reduction of ≥ 90%, the probability of any additional treatment within 5 years was 20%. Conversely, for %PSA reduction of < 10%, the probability of receiving any additional treatment within 5 years was roughly 70%.

This study is the first to assess the role of %PSA reduction in the largest multicenter cohort of men receiving FT for PCa. Given the lack of standardized follow-up strategies in the FT field, the use of the %PSA reduction should be considered.

### Sonodynamic therapy and magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound: New therapeutic strategy in glioblastoma [^11269zpL]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Conventional therapeutic options in the treatment of solid brain tumors, particularly glioblastomas (GBs), are based on the assumption that these cancerous lesions have relatively homogeneous spatiotemporal characteristics. However, recent advances in molecular, genetic, and epigenetic research have shown that this assumption is inaccurate, highlighting the inherent limitations of radiation and chemotherapy. Moreover, the understanding that GBs do not represent a focal pathological entity but are, instead, pathologies spread throughout the brain underscores the limitations of surgery, even though it remains a primary therapeutic approach for these tumors.

This situation necessitates the development of new therapeutic strategies that can eradicate the underlying pathology in the least invasive manner possible while enhancing overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) without compromising patients' quality of life and neurological status.

In this context, the use of ultrasound for therapeutic purposes, referred to as Theranostics, presents promising potential. Focused ultrasound (FUS) can be utilized to destroy cancerous cells through heating or serve as an adjuvant therapy alongside chemotherapy or radiation therapy. The main advantages of FUS include its non-invasiveness, incision-free nature, controllability through real-time magnetic resonance (MR) guidance, and capability to activate the immune system. The first non-invasive thermal ablation of a brain tumor in humans was accomplished by Coluccia et al. in their ongoing phase I clinical study in 2014 when they first employed this technique.

### Image-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound, a novel application for interventional nuclear medicine [^1118a6aw]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Image-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has been increasingly used in medicine over the past few decades, with several systems having become commercially available. HIFU has received regulatory approval worldwide for the ablation of various solid tumors, the treatment of neurologic diseases, and the palliative management of bone metastases. The mechanical and thermal effects of focused ultrasound offer possibilities for histotripsy, supportive radiation therapy, and targeted drug delivery.

The integration of imaging modalities into HIFU systems allows for precise temperature monitoring and accurate treatment planning, enhancing the safety and efficiency of treatment. Preclinical and clinical results have demonstrated the potential of image-guided HIFU to reduce adverse effects and increase the quality of life postoperatively. Interventional nuclear image-guided HIFU presents an attractive noninvasive option for the future.

### Focal therapy using high-intensity focused ultrasound with intraoperative prostate compression for patients with localized prostate cancer: A multi-center prospective study with 7 year experience [^113iphMX]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2025). High credibility.

To evaluate clinical outcomes of focal therapy using high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) with intraoperative prostate compression for patients with localized prostate cancer (PC), patients were included if they had prostate-specific antigen levels of ≤ 20 ng/mL and clinically significant PC (CSPC) within the left or right half, or upper or lower half of the prostate. CSPC was detected using magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound fusion image-guided target biopsy and a 12-core systematic biopsy. Focal therapy using HIFU with intraoperative prostate compression was administered to lesions visible on the magnetic resonance imaging. Biochemical failure was defined by the Phoenix ASTRO definition, while pathological failure was defined as having CSPC in the biopsy at the time of biochemical failure.

The results showed that the patients (n = 240; median age, 69 years old; median prostate-specific antigen level, 6.42 ng/mL) were divided according to the D'Amico risk classification into 'low' (n = 51), 'intermediate' (n = 107), and 'high' (n = 82) groups. The biochemical and pathological disease-free survival rates following a single treatment for the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups were 93.7% and 92.2%, 88.5% and 91.6%, and 84.8% and 86.6%, respectively. The radical or systematic treatment-free survival rates were 96.1%, 94.4%, and 95.1%, respectively. The median follow-up period was 48 months (range 24–84). Although urinary and sexual function had deteriorated 1 month post-treatment, they returned to preoperative levels at 3 or 6 months after treatment.

### Focused ultrasound: Noninvasive image-guided therapy [^1171W1Ww]. Investigative Radiology (2025). High credibility.

There are two general approaches that could be considered for the use of ultrasound (US) in drug delivery. The first approach involves co-administration or subsequent administration of microbubbles, followed by US action and intravascular administration of the drug. Most study designs of this kind are rapidly progressing and have reached the clinical trial stage, with some demonstrating more successful therapeutic interventions than others. This may be considered a "low-hanging fruit" because clinical-grade US contrast agent microbubbles are already approved by the FDA, as are the drugs, most likely anticancer drug formulations. Consequently, the approval process required to reach the clinical trial stage is relatively straightforward, and the associated cost is not as high.

The potential mechanisms for this approach have been discussed earlier in this review, where the action of US combined with microbubbles on the vasculature is examined. General principles are presented in a recent review by Durham et al.

### Non-whole-gland high-intensity focused ultrasound vs whole-gland high-intensity focused ultrasound for management of localized prostate cancer: 1-year oncological and functional outcomes [^113ctQY5]. Journal of Endourology (2019). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to compare the oncological and functional outcomes in localized prostate cancer patients who received non-whole-gland high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) with those in patients who received whole-gland HIFU therapy.

Eighty-six patients from September 2012 to January 2017 in our center were retrospectively analyzed. Oncological outcomes included the histological absence of prostate cancer, biochemical disease-free survival (BDFS), as well as the absence of lesions suspected for harboring prostate cancer in multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI). Regarding functional outcomes, we determined the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), pad-free rate, pad-free and leakage-free rates, as well as the International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5).

Of the 86 patients, 25 patients who underwent non-whole-gland HIFU and 61 patients who underwent whole-gland HIFU were enrolled in our 1-year follow-up study. There were no significant differences in the histological absence of prostate cancer (p = 0.655), BDFS (p = 0.820), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir (p = 0.453), and absence of suspicious lesions in mpMRI (p = 0.633) between the non-whole-gland HIFU group and the whole-gland HIFU group. However, compared with the whole-gland HIFU, the non-whole-gland HIFU group had fewer IPSS at 1 month (8.64 ± 3.63 vs 10.85 ± 6.10), a longer time to PSA nadir (5.04 ± 2.07 vs 3.83 ± 1.65), a lower temporary urine retention rate (20.0% vs 44.3%), and a lower complication rate, especially urinary tract strictures (4% vs 26.2%).

### Focused ultrasound: Noninvasive image-guided therapy [^115KjecQ]. Investigative Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Contrast-enhanced ultrasound uses exogenous microbubbles to image the vasculature within the body. Due to their size, microbubbles can travel throughout the capillaries and other blood vessels but do not pass into the interstitial spaces of the tissue. The nonlinear scattering of the microbubbles provides an opportunity to isolate their echo from that of the surrounding tissue to detect perfusion and blood vessel anatomy. The simplest techniques use the increased echogenicity where microbubbles are present to detect perfusion. Within the clinic, contrast-enhanced ultrasound has been used as an alternative to MRI to assess the nonperfused volume of uterine fibroids following the ablation of the fibroid with HIFU. Other opportunities for contrast-enhanced ultrasound techniques can be found in imaging other forms of cancer and the brain during BBB opening.

- **Cavitation detection**: Cavitation plays a significant role in multiple FUS treatments. To better characterize and control this mechanical bioeffect, different approaches have been adopted to selectively identify the cavitation activity of endogenous and exogenous microbubbles. This is possible due to the unique properties of the gas-filled microbubbles that scatter ultrasound waves. There are two domains of microbubble cavitation — stable cavitation and inertial cavitation. When insonated at low pressures, the microbubbles oscillate (i.e. the microbubble repeatedly expands and contracts) in what is termed stable cavitation. The resulting ultrasound waves scattered by the microbubbles occur not only at the applied frequency but also at other frequencies.

### Can ultrasound irradiation be a therapeutic option for prostate cancer [^116NqsKu]. The Prostate (2020). Low credibility.

Focal therapies for prostate cancer (PC) can reduce adverse events and do not lead to androgen-independent progression. Ultrasound could be used for cancer treatments if the repetition frequency is fitted to the purpose. We investigated the possible therapeutic effect of ultrasound irradiation on PC cells.

- **Materials and methods**: We irradiated two PC cell lines, androgen-dependent LNCaP as well as androgen-independent PC-3, with ultrasound (3.0 W/cm², 3 MHz, irradiation time rate: 20%) for 2 minutes for 1 day or 3 consecutive days at a repetition frequency of 1, 10, or 100 Hz in vitro. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were determined after irradiation.

- **Results**: Cell proliferation of PC-3 was significantly inhibited after 1 day (p < 0.0001) and 3 days (p < 0.0001) of 10 Hz ultrasound irradiation, and that of LNCaP after 1 day (p < 0.0001) and 3 days (p < 0.0001) of irradiation. LNCaP was more sensitive to ultrasound at both lower and higher cell densities, but PC-3 was only sensitive at a lower cell density (p < 0.01). Irradiation with 10 Hz ultrasound induced significantly more PC-3 apoptotic cells than control (1 day, P = 0.0137; 3 days, P = 0.0386) rather than irradiation with 1 Hz. Apoptosis via caspase-3 was induced at 10 Hz in 1-day (p < 0.05) irradiation in both cell lines.

- **Conclusions**: Ultrasound irradiation with even 1 day of 10 Hz significantly inhibited cell proliferation in both LNCaP and PC-3, especially by the remarkable induction of apoptosis in vitro. Our study indicated that ultrasound irradiation can be a therapeutic option for PC, and further studies in vivo will be undertaken.

### An updated systematic review on focal therapy in localized prostate cancer: What has changed over the past 5 years [^113jYXrQ]. European Urology (2022). High credibility.

Focal therapy is a promising, minimally invasive strategy to selectively treat localized prostate cancer. A previous systematic review indicated that there is growing evidence for favorable functional outcomes but that oncological effectiveness was yet to be defined.

- **Objective**: To assess the effectiveness of focal therapy in patients with localized prostate cancer in terms of functional and oncological outcomes.

- **Evidence acquisition**: PubMed, Embase, and The Cochrane Library were searched for studies between October 2015 and December 31, 2020. In addition, the research stages were acquired according to the Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment, Long-term study (IDEAL) recommendations. Ongoing studies were identified through clinical trial registries.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Seventy-two studies were identified exploring eight different sources of energy to deliver focal therapy in 5827 patients. Twenty-seven studies reported on high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), nine studies on irreversible electroporation, 11 on cryoablation, eight on focal laser ablation and focal brachytherapy, seven on photodynamic therapy (PDT), two on radiofrequency ablation, and one on prostatic artery embolization. The majority of studies were prospective development stage 2a studies (n = 357). PDT and HIFU, both in stage 3, showed promising results. Overall, HIFU studies reported a median of 95% pad-free patients and a median of 85% patients with no clinically significant cancer (CSC) in the treated area. For PDT, no changes in continence were reported and a median of 90% of patients were noted.

### Prostate focused ultrasound focal therapy — imaging for the future [^1167ATct]. Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of prostate cancer using high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) focal therapy will become a reliable treatment option only if several conditions are fulfilled. These conditions concern patient selection, assessment of the tumor location and aggressiveness, evaluation of target tissue destruction, and detection of local recurrence or appearance of new tumors.

Regarding patient selection, standard transrectal biopsies are not accurate enough, and although perineal template biopsies can detect tumors, they are invasive, expensive procedures, and there is a risk of incidental detection of insignificant cancers. In turn, multiparametric MRI is accurate for detecting and localizing high-grade (Gleason score ≥ 7) cancers and may provide non-invasive assessment of tumor aggressiveness. Moreover, contrast-enhanced imaging — ultrasonography or MRI — can assess post-HIFU tissue destruction and provide accurate detection of tumor recurrence, which is a key element for follow-up. This perspectives article will assess whether our methods for cancer diagnosis, tissue targeting, and treatment follow-up are accurate enough to allow the design of robust HIFU focal therapy protocols.

### Transrectal high-intensity focused ultrasound in the treatment of localized prostate cancer [^112W1rEp]. Journal of Endourology (2005). Low credibility.

The literature concerning the efficacy and safety of transrectal high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for the treatment of localized prostate cancer comprises a relatively small number of articles. The main studies have been published by four teams using an apparatus available in Europe for several years. The recently presented results of the European Multicentre Study and the study by Gelet and associates, based on 242 patients with a follow-up of more than one year, indicate that HIFU is a valid alternative for the management of well-differentiated and moderately differentiated localized prostate cancer with an initial PSA.

In two studies, the combination of transurethral resection of the prostate and HIFU limited the risk of postoperative urinary retention without inducing a higher complication rate. In a series of patients presenting recurrence after external-beam radiotherapy, HIFU was found to be a useful therapy, with over 80% negative biopsies.

The best indications for HIFU are men over the age of 65, those who are not candidates for radical prostatectomy, obese patients, or patients with comorbidities likely to make surgery more difficult. The learning curve for this technique is relatively short, between 10 and 15 patients, for urologists experienced in transrectal ultrasonography. One of the advantages of HIFU is that it can be repeated in the case of recurrence or to re-treat a prostatic site, involves no radiation, and patients do not suffer from long-term irritative urinary symptoms.

### Focal therapy using high-intensity focused ultrasound with intraoperative prostate compression for patients with localized prostate cancer: a multi-center prospective study with 7 year experience [^11633Ghr]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Five-year treatment-free and overall survival outcomes of active surveillance in 672 patients with localized invisible and visible prostate cancer (PC) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels of 20 ng/mL, and Gleason scores of 3 + 3 or 3 + 4, were 83.4% and 72.3%, and 62.8% and 33.8%, respectively. On the other hand, radical treatments raise concerns such as the deterioration of urinary and sexual function after radical prostatectomy, as well as radiation-induced hemorrhagic cystitis and severe rectal bleeding after radiation therapy. Focal therapy has been studied to evaluate its credibility as a treatment strategy to provide both cancer control and functional preservation.

High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) uses ultrasound waves generated by a spherical transducer to deliver ultrasonic energy to the target area, allowing for a distinct margin between the treated and adjacent normal tissue. The characteristics of HIFU are attractive as one of the modalities for focal therapy. However, clinically significant PC (CSPC) detection rates of the treated area with biopsies performed at different postoperative timings and with different methods to assess treatment efficacy were in the range of 8.2%, 17.2%, and 40% after focal therapy with HIFU. This variation is considered due to the use of non-uniform energy output settings in focal therapy.

The hyperechoic changes on the B-mode of TRUS images indicate effective treatment during the PC treatment with HIFU. However, the diffuse appearance of hyperechoic changes are less likely to appear.

### The role of focal therapy in the management of localised prostate cancer: a systematic review [^117FVCb6]. European Urology (2014). Low credibility.

The eligibility criteria for patients to be included in the five studies evaluating focal salvage therapy in patients with biochemical failure after radical whole-gland radiotherapy are summarised. Apart from one feasibility study investigating the role of RITA in a mixed population of primary and salvage cases, cryoablation, HIFU, and MRI-guided brachytherapy have all been evaluated in a focal manner in patients after external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and/or brachytherapy, or after proton-beam radiotherapy failure. The number of patients treated in this manner across the series was 115, with a median follow-up of 17–47 months (range: 3–90 months).

Thirteen registered trials are evaluating patients treated by focal ablation, with an expected accrual of 989 men. These trials are using cryosurgery (three trials), HIFU (three trials), PDT (three trials), irreversible electroporation (one trial), MRI-guided thermal therapy (one trial), brachytherapy (one trial), and high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy for external beam radiotherapy failure (one trial).

- **Defining the ideal candidate for focal therapy**: No overall consensus exists for defining the ideal candidate for primary focal therapy, despite several consensus statements. This reflects different schools of thought with respect to the role of focal therapy in prostate cancer (PCa). In 2007, the International Task Force on PCa proposed very conservative criteria for selecting patients.

### Seven years of experience with high-intensity focused ultrasound for prostate cancer: Advantages and limitations [^113vfE5P]. The Prostate (2012). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate oncologic outcomes and adverse events for patients with prostate cancer after treatment by high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU).

- **Methods**: Between February 2004 and August 2010, patients with prostate cancer who underwent HIFU treatment were reviewed for oncologic outcomes and complications. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) was defined as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir plus 1.2 ng/ml. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to evaluate BCR and disease progression-free survival according to risk stratification. Predictors for BCR and disease progression were identified using the Cox-proportional hazard method.

- **Results**: The overall BCR rate was 59.5%, and the median time to BCR was 13.8 months. The 5-year BCR-free survival rates for the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups were 66.3%, 40.2%, and 21.0%, respectively (P = 0.001), and the 5-year disease progression-free survival rates were 73.5%, 46.0%, and 29.2%, respectively (P = 0.008). Multivariate analysis showed that risk stratification, PSA nadir, and time to PSA nadir were significant predictors of BCR and disease progression. In the first 3 months post-op, 11 patients (8.7%) experienced complications. There were no cases requiring blood transfusions or incidents of wound problems, stroke, deep vein thrombosis, or bowel dysfunction.

- **Conclusions**: HIFU treatment does not provide effective oncologic outcomes even in low-risk patients with prostate cancer, as well as in intermediate or high-risk groups. Therefore, patients selected for HIFU treatment for prostate cancer must be evaluated carefully.

### High-intensity focused ultrasound: Past, present, and future in neurosurgery [^114XZ9Ne]. Neurosurgical Focus (2018). Low credibility.

Since Lynn and colleagues first described the use of focused ultrasound (FUS) waves for intracranial ablation in 1942, many strides have been made toward the treatment of several brain pathologies using this novel technology. In the modern era of minimal invasiveness, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) promises therapeutic utility for multiple neurosurgical applications, including the treatment of tumors, stroke, epilepsy, and functional disorders. Although the use of HIFU as a potential therapeutic modality in the brain has been under study for several decades, relatively few neuroscientists, neurologists, or even neurosurgeons are familiar with it.

In this extensive review, the authors intend to shed light on the use of HIFU in different neurosurgical avenues and its mechanism of action, as well as provide an update on the outcome of various trials and advances expected from various preclinical studies in the near future. Although the initial technical challenges have been overcome and the technology has been improved, only very few clinical trials have thus far been carried out. The number of clinical trials related to neurological disorders is expected to increase in the coming years, as this novel therapeutic device appears to have substantial expansive potential. There is a great opportunity to expand the use of HIFU across various medical and surgical disciplines for the treatment of different pathologies. As this technology gains recognition, it will open the door for further research opportunities and innovation.

### Identifying the best candidate for focal therapy: A comprehensive review [^115yd9YV]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Focal therapy (FT) has emerged as a viable treatment option in the management of patients with localized prostate cancer (PCa). The goal of FT is to mitigate the side effects commonly associated with more aggressive treatments without compromising cancer control. Numerous FT modalities are currently available, including high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), cryotherapy, irreversible electroporation (IRE), laser, photodynamic therapy (PDT), and brachytherapy (BT). Several single-center and multi-institutional studies have reported the outcomes of these novel therapies.

Currently, the American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines consider FT in select, appropriately informed patients with intermediate-risk PCa, with an emphasis on prioritizing enrollment in clinical trials. However, patients should be informed that high-quality data comparing the outcomes of FT to other PCa management options, including radiation therapy, surgery, and active surveillance, are currently lacking.

Despite the evidence supporting the use of FT in patients with localized PCa, reported studies exhibit considerable variability in terms of patient selection criteria and treatment planning approaches. Precise selection of patients is a crucial step in achieving the optimal outcomes following FT. The identification of the best candidate has evolved dynamically in the past two decades alongside the increasing comprehension and constraints of FT. Nevertheless, this process is still dependent on the available evidence, expert opinions, and international multidisciplinary collaboration.

### Established focal therapy-hifu, ire, or cryotherapy-where are we now?-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111XD6bR]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Radical therapy with surgery or radiation is the gold standard for treatment of localized prostate cancer (PCa), but it is associated with significant treatment-related sexual, urinary, and bowel morbidity. Focal therapy (FT), where only the area of cancer within the prostate is targeted for destruction, could potentially spare the adjacent critical anatomical structures responsible for sexual, urinary, and bowel function from damage and thus preserve quality of life. Although first proposed in the 2000s, physician adoption of FT was limited prior to the late 2010s.

The majority of prostate cancers are multifocal. However, it is now recognized that not every prostate cancer lesion may need treatment, with the understanding that intermediate- and high-grade (Gleason score ≥ 3 + 4) prostate cancers are the ones that tend to progress and are clinically significant (csPCa), whereas low-grade cancers have low cancer-specific mortality and metastasis and can be safely monitored on active surveillance. Furthermore, when small, low-grade cancer foci are discounted, the proportion of unifocal csPCa increases substantially. Accurately identifying such unifocal csPCa lesions within the prostate is key to successful FT.

Over the last decade, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has emerged as a key imaging tool for the prostate, being able to detect and locate csPCa lesions. The advent of mpMRI-fusion biopsy has allowed physicians to merge mpMRI data with accessible office prostate biopsies. These capabilities have significantly improved diagnosis and management strategies.

### Salvage high-intensity focused ultrasound for patients with recurrent prostate cancer after brachytherapy [^115bfrEU]. Urology (2014). Low credibility.

To report our experience with salvage high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) in patients with local failure after brachytherapy for prostate cancer, whole-gland HIFU was administered to prospectively recruited patients with local histologic failure after brachytherapy at two institutions in the United Kingdom and Canada. Functional and oncologic outcomes of the procedure were analyzed.

Nineteen patients underwent the treatment, 12 with Gleason sum 7 and 5 with Gleason sum 8 at recurrence. Thirteen men had grade-3a or -3b complications by the Clavien system; there were no grade-4 or -5 complications. The most common postoperative complication was dysuria, which was self-limited. Three men developed rectourethral fistulae. The overall continence rate was 68.4%. At a mean follow-up of 51.6 months, all men were alive. The overall biochemical recurrence-free survival rate was 66.7% and 73.3% using the "nadir prostate-specific antigen level" +1.3 ng/mL and +2 ng/mL criteria, respectively. This study is limited by the small cohort size, relatively short follow-up period, and heterogeneity of the patient population.

In this, the largest prospective series at the time of writing, we demonstrate that salvage HIFU for locally recurrent prostate cancer after failed primary brachytherapy has encouraging disease control results, albeit with a relatively high complication rate.

### Prostate ablation using high intensity focused ultrasound: A literature review of the potential role for patient preference information [^115hEw4x]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

The FDA (Food and Drug Administration) recently allowed the marketing of two high intensity focused ultrasound devices for prostate tissue ablation after previous rejections for a prostate cancer indication due to insufficient data on clinical effectiveness or direct patient benefit. We reviewed the safety and effectiveness of high intensity focused ultrasound and patient preferences, such as tolerance for adverse events associated with high intensity focused ultrasound ablation of tissue, in men with prostate cancer. This may inform decision making for device developers and the FDA.

- **Materials and methods**: We searched PubMed® and gray literature, including FDA reports, for relevant data on the safety and effectiveness of primary and salvage high intensity focused ultrasound of localized prostate cancer in studies performed in or outside the United States. Additionally, we looked for patient preference information related to high intensity focused ultrasound safety and effectiveness outcomes.

- **Results**: We found no high intensity focused ultrasound effectiveness data relevant to clinical decision making, such as overall or prostate cancer-specific survival, in the United States. Long-term effectiveness data from outside the United States were sparse and outcomes varied. We also found no patient preference data on high intensity focused ultrasound treatment in men with prostate cancer.

- **Conclusions**: The lack of long-term high intensity focused ultrasound oncological data in an American population has brought new challenges to prostate cancer stakeholders.

### High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) hemiablation of the prostate: Late follow-up MRI findings in non-recurrent patients [^115NugW4]. European Journal of Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Focal therapy with high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is an emerging option for the treatment of prostate cancer, often followed by MRI. Proper knowledge of typical procedure-related changes in prostate MRI is sparse, particularly for unilateral HIFU treatment and late follow-up (beyond 6 months). This study aimed to compile the type and frequency of such MRI findings in selected patients without recurrent cancer 12 months after prostate hemiablation.

Data from a prospective multicenter trial on HIFU hemiablation were reviewed retrospectively. Trial patients underwent late follow-up MRI (at around 12 months) and either MRI/transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) fusion or standard TRUS-guided biopsy. This study included patients with no recurrent cancer in the treated prostate lobe in per-protocol biopsy, focusing on 30 men with an initial International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Grade Group of 1 or 2. An expert committee assessed six categories of potential HIFU-related MRI features, which two readers evaluated in consensus:

- **Shrinkage of the treated lobe**: Observed in 93% of cases with an average percent volume change of -37% (range: -70% to +108%).
- **Residual prostate tissue**: Evaluated as one of the MRI features.
- **Fluid-filled cavity**: Assessed as a potential indicator of the treatment process.
- **Fibrosis**: Identified as a possible post-procedure finding.
- **Hematoma residuals**: Noted in the prostate or seminal vesicles.
- **Contrast enhancement of the ablated area**: Monitored in MRI evaluations.

In the contralateral lobe, the volume remained practically the same…

### Salvage radiotherapy after high intensity focused ultrasound for prostate cancer [^1161Yt4C]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a technique used for the treatment of localized prostate cancer. There is no standard treatment for patients who experience a relapse of prostate cancer following primary HIFU treatment. In this case, we report a patient who was successfully treated with external beam radiotherapy for disease relapse following HIFU. At the time of writing, our patient remains disease-free with no toxicity from the treatment.

### A comparative study of fibroid ablation rates using radio frequency or high-intensity focused ultrasound [^113b596h]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

This study compared the technical success of fibroid devascularization using high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and radio frequency (RF) to provide an experimental basis for the clinical selection of a suitable, minimally invasive method for treating uterine fibroids. Patients were randomly divided into two groups and treated with HIFU or RF accordingly. The two groups were further divided into subgroups based on fibroid diameter (A, B, and C) and fibroid blood supply grades (A', B', and C').

- **Subgroup details**: The fibroid diameters in subgroups A, B, and C were 2.0 cm, 4.0 cm, and greater than 4.0 cm, respectively. Subgroups A', B', and C' were based on fibroid blood supply grades.

- **Results**: In subgroups A, B, and C, HIFU achieved similar complete ablation rates to RF. However, in other subgroups, RF showed better complete ablation rates than HIFU (p < 0.05). No severe complications were observed after these two treatments.

RF can be applied for the majority of fibroids. As a noninvasive therapy, HIFU could be the preferred method for the treatment of small, hypovascular fibroids.

### Oncological outcomes after robotic salvage radical prostatectomy in patients primarily treated with focal versus radiation therapy: A Junior ERUS/YAU collaborative study [^1131uFfJ]. The Prostate (2025). Low credibility.

- **Comparison of HIFU versus non-HIFU patients**: Of 201 focal therapy patients, 80% initially received high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) as primary treatment. The most common non-HIFU focal therapy was cryotherapy. Descriptive baseline, surgical, and postoperative comparisons between HIFU and non-HIFU patients are displayed in Table 2.

In biochemical recurrence (BCR) analyses, as shown in Figure 3, no significant difference was observed between patients with initial HIFU versus non-HIFU therapies (HR: 0.9, p = 0.9), with 29 versus 8 BCR events respectively. The 24- and 48-month BCR-free survival rates were 79.3% and 64.4% for HIFU versus 69.1% and 69.1% for non-HIFU s-RARP patients.

Figure 3 graphically depicts the Kaplan Meier curve illustrating the BCR-free survival of robotic salvage radical prostatectomy patients stratified according to primary therapy with HIFU versus other focal therapy techniques.

### Salvage high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation for prostate cancer local recurrence after external-beam radiation therapy: prognostic value of prostate MRI [^115heJfB]. Clinical Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

To assess the prognostic value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before salvage high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for locally recurrent prostate cancer after external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT), a retrospective study was conducted.

Forty-six patients who underwent prostate MRI before salvage HIFU for locally recurrent prostate cancer after EBRT were analyzed. HIFU failure was defined as a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value greater than nadir + 2 ng/ml according to the Phoenix criteria, or a positive follow-up biopsy, or the initiation of any other salvage therapy. The prognostic parameters assessed included neoadjuvant hormone therapy, clinical stage and Gleason score of recurrence, PSA level and velocity at HIFU treatment, and six MRI-derived parameters: prostate volume, tumor volume, extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, tumor extension into the apex, or anterior to the urethra.

Two factors were significant independent predictors of salvage HIFU failure: the PSA level at HIFU treatment (p < 0.012; risk ratio: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.03–1.29) and tumor extension anterior to the urethra, as assessed by MRI (p = 0.046, risk ratio: 2.51, 95% CI: 1.02–6.16).

The location of cancer recurrence anterior to the urethra on MRI is an independent significant predictor of salvage HIFU failure for locally recurrent prostate cancer after EBRT. Therefore, MRI may be useful for patient selection before post-EBRT salvage HIFU ablation.

### Acute cataract by a high-intensity focused ultrasound procedure: a case report [^1139BE7j]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Low credibility.

High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) uses ultrasound waves to achieve therapeutic effects by destroying deep-localized tissue. It has been previously indicated as a treatment for prostate cancer and has recently been suggested as an alternative treatment for glaucoma. HIFU is also used as a cosmetic treatment, inducing selective thermal coagulation and delivering heat to the dermis and subdermis, including the superficial musculoaponeurotic system, to improve sagging skin and increase collagen through intense focused ultrasound (IFUS) treatment. Recently, IFUS has been performed as a "non-cutting eye treatment", consisting of the irradiation of the periocular area of sagging eyelids. In this treatment, medical contact eye protection must be used. We report a case of acute progressive cataract following IFUS.

### Minimally invasive image-guided therapy for inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma: What is the evidence today [^117SM9FD]. Insights into Imaging (2010). Low credibility.

In high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), an extracorporeal transducer produces high-energy ultrasound (US) beams that propagate harmlessly through the intact skin and are brought into a tight focus (1–3 mm) within the tumor. The rapid deposition of acoustic energy leads to an instantaneous temperature increase of > 55°C within the tissue, inducing coagulation necrosis. HIFU offers the first completely non-invasive approach to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is therefore a promising technology. In practice, both conventional ultrasound and MRI are used to guide and monitor HIFU treatment. MRI offers one important advantage over US guidance, as it enables accurate monitoring of the temperature during treatment.

There are only a few clinical reports on the application of HIFU for HCC treatment. The majority of work is published by two groups, both of whom use real-time US guidance during treatment. Wu et al. report that HIFU treatment is effective, safe, and feasible in patients with large HCCs. They treated 55 patients with a mean tumor diameter of 8.14 cm ± 3.37 (range 4–14 cm). Overall survival rates at 6, 12, and 18 months were 86.1%, 61.5%, and 35.3%, respectively. The survival rates were higher in patients with less advanced disease according to the TNM classification. It has to be noted, however, that pre-procedural transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) was carried out in half of the patients and that rib resection was performed in 14 patients, compromising the non-invasive character of the procedure. In another study by Zhu et al, ribs were removed in all patients to create a better acoustic window for HIFU treatment.

### Minimally invasive procedures in the diagnosis and treatment of localized prostate cancer: an interventional radiologist's perspective [^1135zZzx]. Current Oncology Reports (2022). Low credibility.

High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU), Photodynamic Therapy (PDT), and Irreversible Electroporation (IRE) are currently in more advanced research stages and will be briefly described in this section.

HIFU is performed under ultrasound or MRI guidance in an external or transrectal approach. The phased array transducer generates high-intensity ultrasound (usually greater than 500 W/cm²), causing focal coagulative necrosis in a process known as sonification. MRI offers real-time quantitative thermometry maps and the ability to precisely visualize the post-procedural ablated volume using dynamic contrast-enhanced images. HIFU can be performed as a stand-alone treatment or following transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), intended to reduce the risk of urinary retention and improve treatment efficacy by decreasing prostate volume. Due to its limited penetration depth, HIFU is less suitable for very large prostates or for anterior zone lesions. A recent study reported short-term significantly decreased efficacy of HIFU treatment of the anterior hemi-gland compared with HIFU treatment of the posterior gland.

HIFU is the most studied method of focal therapy (FT) at the time of writing, including in ongoing studies. Most HIFU-related studies are at IDEAL stage 2, two studies are at IDEAL stage 3, and one large retrospective study is at IDEAL stage 4. In terms of oncological outcome, studies report a median of 85% disease-free status in the treated area with a median follow-up of 12 months. For functional outcomes, no significant changes in urinary continence and erectile function were found. Yap et al. reported transient postoperative erectile dysfunction with no significant difference.

### Focal therapy: Patients, interventions, and outcomes — a report from a consensus meeting [^1138qvte]. European Urology (2015). Low credibility.

- **Prostate volume**: Acknowledging that some energy sources have limitations in their ability to treat certain anatomic regions (e.g. high-intensity focused ultrasound is limited to treating anterior lesions in small prostates only) while others do not, it was agreed that prostate volume should not be a primary determinant of eligibility for focal therapy.

- **Age and life expectancy**: It was agreed that age should not be a primary determinant of focal therapy, although the panel was uncertain about whether focal treatment should be recommended for patients aged 80 years. The panel was also asked to evaluate criteria other than age when selecting patients eligible for focal therapy. It was agreed that patients with a World Health Organization performance status of 0 or 1 should be recommended for focal treatment, while patients with a performance status of 3 or 4 should not be recommended. There was uncertainty about treating patients with a performance status of 2. The group agreed that focal therapy was best suited to patients with a life expectancy of more than 10 years and that this therapy should not be applied to patients with a life expectancy of 5 years or less.

- **Preintervention diagnostics**: The panel agreed that a confirmatory tissue diagnosis of cancer should be available prior to performing focal therapy. There was a lack of agreement for providing focal treatment without a biopsy, given that the true positive predictive value of mp-MRI is yet to be fully quantified. It was agreed that focal therapy can be performed in patients who have undergone an MRI-targeted prosta…

### High-intensity focused ultrasound for focal therapy: Reality or pitfall [^112FGLSy]. Current Opinion in Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Progress in imaging, fusion software, and ablative modalities has fostered the growth of the latest image-guided generation of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for focal treatment of prostate cancer. Although early reports are encouraging, important questions remain regarding candidate selection, treatment, and outcomes. Contemporary considerations for the use of HIFU for focal treatment of primary and radio-recurrent prostate cancer are reviewed.

HIFU has been used to treat prostate cancer for over two decades. More recently, stage migration from screening and improvements in pelvic imaging and fusion technology have resulted in wider clinical application of focal HIFU as a first-line treatment for localized prostate cancer. Advanced imaging has also improved targeting for focal salvage therapy of radio-recurrent disease. Proponents point to the minimally invasive nature, limited morbidity profile, and the ability to perform retreatments in the future. Critics emphasize positive post-treatment biopsies, nonuniform treatment protocols, and absence of long-term follow-up data. Thus, a review of clinical considerations and recently published data is warranted.

Recent advances have strengthened support for the use of focal HIFU. Although HIFU has great potential, it must be applied judiciously, maintaining appropriate oncologic principles in the setting of standardized trials to determine its true clinical value.

### Thermal ablation of uterine fibroids using MR-guided focused ultrasound — a truly non-invasive treatment modality [^111pfxAE]. European Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Uterine fibroids are a significant source of morbidity for women of reproductive age. Definitive treatment has traditionally been a hysterectomy, but increasingly, women are not prepared to undergo such an invasive procedure for a benign and usually self-limiting condition. Although a number of minimally invasive techniques are now available, focused ultrasound has a considerable advantage over them, as it is completely non-invasive and does not require an anesthetic. Improvements in imaging techniques, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have enabled the accurate planning, targeting, and monitoring of treatments.

We review the early experience of focused ultrasound surgery for the treatment of fibroids, particularly examining the results of recent phase I, II, and III multi-centre clinical trials. These trials, along with other studies, demonstrate that MR-guided focused ultrasound ablation is feasible, safe, and appears to have an efficacy comparable with other treatment modalities. This technique has the advantages of being non-invasive and deliverable as an outpatient procedure.

### Focused ultrasound: Noninvasive image-guided therapy [^116aBCq6]. Investigative Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Imaging modalities to guide FUS: No different than when diagnosing disease, different imaging modalities present tradeoffs when guiding therapy with FUS. This review will focus on magnetic resonance (MR) and ultrasound (US) image guidance of FUS, but x-ray computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography/single photon emission computed tomography (PET/SPECT) imaging also play an important role in FUS planning and posttreatment assessment. X-ray CT is a quick, readily available, and cost-effective method to measure tumor size and plays a key role in the RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) standard for assessing treatment effect on tumor burden. PET/SPECT imaging provides opportunities to image immune and cell therapies in both clinical and preclinical studies. US and MR have been the most promising imaging modalities for FUS guidance at the time of writing due to their lack of ionizing radiation, their application for planning, monitoring, and posttreatment measurements, and their widespread availability in clinical settings.

- **Ultrasound guidance**: Prior to the pairing of FUS with MRI performed by Hynynen in 1992, US was the dominant method for FUS guidance. In the context of FUS, US guidance presents the opportunity to image anatomy, image blood flow, image cavitation, measure a change in tissue properties, and monitor temperature changes. Though not all of these techniques are in clinical use, we will discuss each to provide insights into the benefits of US guidance and the direction of the technology.

### Conservative treatment of a recto-urethral fistula due to salvage HIFU for local recurrence of prostate cancer, 5 years after radical prostatectomy and external beam radiotherapy [^113vDkcL]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Recto-urethral fistula is one of the most serious complications caused by high-intensity-focused ultrasound used as salvage treatment for recurrence of prostate cancer after brachytherapy or external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). We report the case of a recto-urethral fistula in a 68-year-old patient who previously had undergone radical prostatectomy and EBRT for prostate cancer (pT3 N0 Mx). The fistula was treated conservatively by an indwelling Foley catheter, without the creation of an intestinal diversion.

The fistula was assessed initially by a retrograde and a CT scan of the pelvis with contrast medium and reassessed periodically by means of retrograde urethrograms. At the time of writing, 24 months after this episode, no evidence of recurrence of the fistula has been found.

### Focused ultrasound for the treatment of glioblastoma [^1131xNgX]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

Several focused ultrasound parameters should be considered for safely and effectively inducing blood-brain barrier opening (BBBO). The sonication parameters used affect the depth of ultrasound penetration and the duration of opening. Nathan McDannold, PhD, reviewed these variables and their common values. Other factors that might affect the degree of BBBO are anesthesia, supplemental oxygen, steroid administration, and timing of focused ultrasound in relationship to microbubble administration. Dr. McDannold explained that the penetration depth and duration of opening are affected by the sonication parameters used. Panelists Nathan McDannold, PhD, Francesco Prada, MD, Elisa Konofagou, PhD, and Kullervo Hynynen, PhD, agreed that there are no well-defined optimal sonication parameters for BBBO; ideally, the parameters used for each patient will lead to maximum drug delivery with minimal tissue damage. They agreed that the best focused ultrasound settings for inducing BBBO will vary based on the size of the molecule being delivered and the type of microbubble being used.

- **Confirmation of BBBO**: After microbubble administration and the application of low-intensity focused ultrasound to the target area, the desired effect of increased permeability of the BBB must be confirmed. Michael Canney, PhD, Nathan McDannold, PhD, Antonis Pouliopoulos, PhD, and Raag Airan, MD, PhD, discussed methods used to confirm BBBO. There was consensus that the most common methods to confirm BBBO are T1-weighted imaging, among others.

### MRI methods for the evaluation of high intensity focused ultrasound tumor treatment: Current status and future needs [^112FJdaB]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Thermal ablation with high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is an emerging noninvasive technique for the treatment of solid tumors. HIFU treatment of malignant tumors requires accurate treatment planning, monitoring, and evaluation, which can be facilitated by performing the procedure in an MR-guided HIFU system. The MR-based evaluation of HIFU treatment is most often restricted to contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging, while it has been shown that the non-perfused volume may not reflect the extent of nonviable tumor tissue after HIFU treatment. Multiple studies have assessed more advanced MRI methods for their suitability in evaluating HIFU treatment. While several of these methods seem promising regarding their sensitivity to HIFU-induced tissue changes, there is still ample room for improvement in MRI protocols for HIFU treatment evaluation.

- **Acute and delayed effects of HIFU treatment**: In this review article, the major acute and delayed effects of HIFU treatment are described. For each effect, the MRI methods that have been — or could be — used to detect the associated tissue changes are outlined.

- **Value of multiparametric MRI**: The potential value of multiparametric MRI for the evaluation of HIFU treatment is discussed.

The review concludes with a discussion on future directions for the MRI-based evaluation of HIFU treatment.

### Focused ultrasound: Noninvasive image-guided therapy [^116bznMi]. Investigative Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Electronic focusing is achieved by transmitting waves from multiple acoustic sources at different starting times, allowing the waves to converge at a desired depth and steer the focus from side to side (see Fig. 1 C). This phased array approach has played an important role in the adoption of FUS in the clinic. Phased arrays can both focus and steer the waves in real-time by changing the delay between element transmissions. The trade-off of this approach, compared with mechanical focusing, is the added complexity and cost of the electronics and transducer. It is worth noting that mechanical and electronic focusing techniques can be combined to meet the specific needs of a given application.

FUS provides therapeutic effects through different mechanisms of action. There is a wide range of bioeffects in tissue, and many mechanisms of action are still under investigation. A comprehensive list of FUS mechanisms of action is provided in the Focused Ultrasound Foundation State of the Field report. For this review, we will briefly describe the mechanisms of action that benefit most from image guidance in clinical practice and translational research.

Thermal ablation uses HIFU to noninvasively heat tissue within the body beyond the threshold of protein denaturation, effectively acting as an ultrasonic scalpel to eliminate target tissue. Thermal ablation is used in the clinic to treat a range of disorders including essential tremor, prostate cancer, and uterine fibroids.

Cavitation is the oscillation of microbubbles in the tissue. The ex

### Focused ultrasound: Noninvasive image-guided therapy [^112sbYE2]. Investigative Radiology (2025). High credibility.

Focusing an externally applied acoustic field to the desired areas of the body for therapy is a rapidly expanding area of research. In some instances, it has moved from early stage applied physics research and development to a clinical trial setting, and even approved clinical indications, such as noninvasive essential tremor treatment. Most successes and clinical translation currently take place in the image-guided hyperthermia domain, especially under MRI guidance. Real-time temperature monitoring appears to be currently the best strategy for sustained improvement of the outcome of FUS procedures. For optimal treatment, temperature in the targeted volume should be controlled accurately and continuously.

With the expanded development of nonthermal mechanisms of action, additional imaging techniques will be important to the continued success of FUS. In this regard, US imaging of cavitation and blood flow may provide important tools for new mechanisms of action that rely on cavitation and nonthermal effects. In addition, B-mode US guidance provides a low-cost alternative to MRI thermometry that monitors cavitation and echogenicity to select treatment parameters and identify changes in the tissue due to the action of FUS.

Some areas of research, such as triggered drug and gene delivery, are progressing slower due to the enhanced complexity and cost of generating robust formulations that would bring success in clinical trials. Overall, the progress already achieved and expected to occur in the area of FUS therapy is greatly enhanced by real-time imaging guidance.

### Treatment with high intensity focused ultrasound: Secrets revealed [^115Y7ftu]. European Journal of Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

For many decades, open surgery remained the only way available for local control of body tumors. To decrease patients' morbidity and mortality, several image-guided minimally invasive procedures have been adopted. High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is an extracorporeal non-invasive method for tumor ablation. High intensity ultrasonic waves can be focused to a focal point, resulting in a lethal elevation of the temperature at the target site, which consequently damages the tumoral cells.

Advances in HIFU technology over the past two decades have expanded HIFU applications to include the ablation of both benign and malignant tumors, with different treatment strategies being implemented for each type. The aim of this review is to introduce the reader to the details of the treatment process, including pretreatment preparation, treatment planning, different ablation strategies, patient aftercare, as well as follow-up regimens for the most common HIFU applications.

### Focal therapy for prostate cancer: An "à la carte" approach [^115Z98fW]. European Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Personalizing focal ablation energy for prostate cancer based on cancer location is a novel concept. We propose the use of high-intensity focused ultrasound for posterior tumors, cryotherapy for anterior tumors, and brachytherapy for apical tumors to improve overall outcomes. This concept needs to be verified in prospective studies.

### Is MR-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound a feasible treatment modality for desmoid tumors [^1172oQe1]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2016). Low credibility.

MR-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound is a noninvasive treatment modality that uses focused ultrasound waves to thermally ablate tumors within the human body while minimizing side effects to surrounding healthy tissues. This technology is FDA-approved for certain tumors and has the potential to be a noninvasive treatment option for extremity soft tissue tumors. The development of treatment modalities that achieve tumor control, decrease morbidity, or both might be of great benefit for patients. We wanted to assess the potential use of this technology in the treatment of extremity desmoid tumors.

- **Questions/purposes**: (1) Can we use MR-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound to accurately ablate a predetermined target volume within a human cadaver extremity? (2) Does MR-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound treatment stop progression and/or cause regression of extremity desmoid tumors?

- **Methods**: Simulated tumor volumes in four human cadavers, created by using plastic markers, were ablated using a commercially available focused ultrasound system. Accuracy was determined in accordance with the International Organization of Standards location error by measuring the farthest distance between the ablated tissue and the plane corresponding to the target. Between 2012 and 2014, we treated nine patients with desmoid tumors using focused ultrasound ablation. Indications for this were tumor-related symptoms or failure of conventional treatment. Of those, five were available for MRI follow-up at 12 months or longer (mean, 18.2 months; range, 12–23 months). The radio

### Systematic review of the efficacy and safety of high-intensity focussed ultrasound for the primary and salvage treatment of prostate cancer [^112XyBHe]. European Urology (2010). Low credibility.

High-intensity focussed ultrasound (HIFU) is an emerging minimally invasive treatment option for prostate cancer. Our aim was to assess the efficacy and safety of HIFU in both primary treatment of men with localized and locally advanced prostate cancer as well as salvage treatment of men with recurrent prostate cancer following treatment failure of radical prostatectomy or external-beam radiation therapy.

We conducted a systematic literature search for studies conducted on humans and published in either English or German in several databases from 2000 to 2010. In addition, we screened several websites for assessments on HIFU in prostate cancer and contacted the manufacturers of the two currently available HIFU devices for supplemental information on HIFU. We included all prospective studies with more than 50 study participants and assessed their quality using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

We identified 20 uncontrolled prospective case series, each of which treated between 58 and 517 patients. These studies were all conducted within the past decade. In total, 3018 patients were treated with HIFU, with 93% undergoing primary therapy and 7% undergoing salvage HIFU. For all HIFU procedures, the biochemical disease-free survival rate at 1, 5, and 7 years, respectively, was 78–84%, 45–84%, and 69%. The negative biopsy rate was 86% at 3 months and 80% at 15 months. Overall survival rates and prostate cancer-specific survival rates were 90% and 100% at 5 years and 83% and 98% at 8 years, respectively.

### Focal therapy for prostate cancer: revolution or evolution [^116A9UYq]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

High-intensity focused ultrasound (HiFU) was first introduced in the 1940s and uses energy focused at a specific point within the prostate, enabling targeted destruction of prostatic tissue. Currently, two HiFU devices are attempting to gain FDA approval for the treatment of prostate cancer in the US. However, HiFU therapy for localized prostate cancer has been widely accepted in Europe and Asia.

In a large Phase II/III prospective multicenter study, Thuroff reported the results of 402 patients with stage T1–2, Nx-0, M0 prostate cancer treated with HiFU. The follow-up was extremely short, at approximately 1 year, but the negative biopsy rate observed in the T1–2 primary-care population was 87.2%. The HiFU series with the longest follow-up comes from the University of Regensburg in Germany. In their report, Blana discusses the outcomes of 163 patients with clinical Stage T1-T2N0M0, biopsy-proven, localized prostate cancer, with a serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of ≤ 20 ng/mL and Gleason score of ≤ 7, treated with HiFU. Median follow-up was 4.8 years. Of the 163 patients, 86.4% achieved a PSA nadir of < 1 ng/mL, and 92.7% had negative post-treatment biopsy findings. The biochemical recurrence-free survival rate at 5 years was 75%, with salvage treatment initiated for 12% of the patients. On multivariate analysis, the pretreatment PSA level was the only statistically significant predictive factor of recurrence (P = 0.005).

### High-intensity focused ultrasound for the reduction of subcutaneous adipose tissue using multiple treatment techniques [^111H76NJ]. Dermatologic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a noninvasive alternative to traditional invasive body sculpting procedures.

- **Objective**: To assess the effectiveness and tolerability of HIFU treatment using high and low fluence settings with two treatment techniques, grid repeat (GR) and site repeat (SR).

- **Materials and methods**: Two multicenter studies were conducted. Subjects underwent one HIFU treatment with one of five treatment protocols (total fluence, 150–180 J/cm). The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in waist circumference (CBWC) at 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints included CBWC at 4 and 8 weeks and investigator- and subject-assessed clinical improvement. Adverse events were monitored throughout the study.

- **Results**: In the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, all subjects had a statistically significant mean circumferential reduction of -2.3 ± 2.9 cm (p < .0001) from baseline at 12 weeks, with no significant differences among the five treatment groups (ITT: p = .153). Analysis of secondary endpoints in the ITT population demonstrated a significant circumferential reduction starting as early as 4 weeks in all subjects (-1.1 ± 1.9 cm, p < .0001). Most subjects in all treatment groups showed improvements at 12 weeks as rated by the investigators and subjects.

- **Conclusion**: High-intensity focused ultrasound treatment using either a low or high fluence setting in a GR or SR method is effective for circumferential waist reduction, resulting in statistically significant CBWC in all treatment groups.

### Magnetic resonance guided focused high frequency ultrasound ablation for focal therapy in prostate cancer - phase 1 trial [^111Z8TjP]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

To evaluate the feasibility and safety of focal therapy for low-intermediate risk prostate cancer (PCa) using magnetic resonance-guided high frequency focused ultrasound (MRgFUS), this IRB-approved phase 1 prospective study was conducted. It enrolled eight patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤ 10 ng/ml, tumor stage ≤ cT2a, and Gleason score ≤ 7 (4 + 3 disease) after obtaining informed consent. Under MRI guidance, focused high-frequency ultrasound energy was delivered to ablate the target tissue. Treatment-related adverse events were recorded, and oncologic outcomes were evaluated with multiparametric MRI, PSA levels, and TRUS biopsy at 6 months post-treatment.

Ten target lesions, comprising six Gleason 6 lesions and two each of Gleason 7 (3 + 4) and Gleason 7 (4 + 3), were treated in eight men. The prostate volume ranged from 25–50 cc, with a mean MRI time of 248 minutes per patient and a mean sonication duration of 65 minutes. The mean target volume was 2.7 cc, and the mean post-treatment non-perfused volume was 4.3 cc. Quality of life parameters remained similar between baseline and 6 months in 6 out of 8 patients. All treated regions were negative on MRI. Additionally, 4 out of 8 patients and 6 out of 10 target lesions (60%) were disease-free on biopsy. One patient had a 2-mm Gleason 8 disease in one of five cores from the treatment site (4 + 3 disease at baseline) and subsequently underwent prostatectomy with negative surgical margins. Three patients with low volume (5–15%) Gleason 6 residual disease were offered active surveillance. The mean PSA decreased from 5.06 ng/ml at baseline to 3.4 ng/ml at 6 months.

In conclusion, MRgFUS is a feasible and safe method for noninvasively ablating prostate cancer.

### Rectourethral fistula [^114mjALz]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

A 73-year-old male had prostatic adenocarcinoma since 2003. After external-beam radiotherapy and cryotherapy had failed, the patient was treated with transrectal high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). Because of recurrent hematuria, pneumaturia, and urinary tract infection, a fistula to the urinary tract was suspected. Computed tomography raised the suspicion of a rectourethral fistula. Sigmoidoscopy showed a large rectourethral fistula between the distal anterior rectal wall and the prostate bed. The urinary catheter and the inflated balloon could be easily inspected (Fig. 1A, B). No endoscopic attempt was made to close the fistula because of its size and location. The case was discussed in a multidisciplinary forum, and the patient was sent for urinary and colonic diversion before undergoing transanal surgical fistula sealing.

- **Figure 1**:
	- **(A) Endoscopic view from distal rectum**: The rectal lumen and the urinary catheter can be seen.
	- **(B) The scope is inside the prostate bed**.

Transrectal HIFU is a relatively new technology capable of inducing instantaneous and irreversible coagulative necrosis in all biologic tissue via a thermal effect (absorption of ultrasound energy converted into heat) and cavitation. Rectourethral fistula is a possible but rare complication of the treatment of prostate cancer with transrectal HIFU treatment that inevitably requires stepped and complex reconstructive surgery.

### Real-time adaptive methods for treatment of mobile organs by MRI-controlled high-intensity focused ultrasound [^1163v2Ro]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Focused ultrasound (US) is a unique and noninvasive technique for the local deposition of thermal energy deep inside the body. MRI guidance offers additional benefits of excellent target visualization and continuous temperature mapping. However, treating a moving target poses significant challenges. Motion-related thermometry artifacts must be corrected, and the US focal point must be realigned according to the target displacement.

This paper describes a complete MRI-compatible, high-intensity focused US (HIFU) system alongside adaptive methods for continuous MR thermometry and therapeutic US, featuring real-time tracking of a moving target. It includes online motion correction of the thermometry maps and regional temperature control based on the proportional, integral, and derivative method. The hardware utilizes a 256-element phased-array transducer with rapid electronic displacement of the focal point. The exact location of the target during US firing is anticipated through automatic analysis of periodic motions.

The methods were tested with moving phantoms undergoing either rigid body or elastic periodical motions. The results demonstrate accurate tracking of the focal point, and focal and regional temperature control showed performance similar to that obtained with stationary phantoms.

### Whole-gland ablation of localized prostate cancer with high-intensity focused ultrasound: Oncologic outcomes and morbidity in 1002 patients [^1153KH7Z]. European Urology (2014). Low credibility.

High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a nonsurgical therapy for selected patients with localized prostate cancer (PCa). The long-term oncologic and morbidity outcomes of primary HIFU therapy for localized PCa were evaluated in a prospective, single-arm, single-institution cohort study. Participants were patients treated with HIFU for localized PCa from 1997 to 2009. Patients with local recurrence following radiotherapy were excluded. A second HIFU session was systematically performed in patients with biopsy-proven local recurrence.

Whole-gland prostate ablation was performed with transrectal HIFU. Incontinence was assessed using the Ingelman-Sundberg score, and potency was evaluated using the five-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) scores. Primary outcomes included survival rates (biochemical-free, cancer-specific, metastasis-free, and overall survival), while secondary outcomes were morbidity rates. The median follow-up was 6.4 years (range: 0.2–13.9 years). The Kaplan-Meier method was employed to determine survival estimates, and multivariate analysis was used to identify predictive factors of biochemical progression.

A total of 1002 patients were included in the study. The median nadir prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 0.14 ng/ml, with 63% of patients reaching a nadir PSA ≤ 0.3 ng/ml. Sixty percent of patients received one HIFU session, 38% underwent two sessions, and 2% had three sessions. The 8-year biochemical-free survival rates were collected; however, specific rates were cut off in the provided text.

### Salvage cryotherapy: Is there a role for focal therapy [^1166sb5d]. Journal of Endourology (2010). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer treatment has undergone vast developments over the last few decades. The most notable changes have included nerve-sparing open radical prostatectomy, laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (including robot-assisted), and more recently, cryotherapy and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). While radical surgery is the gold standard, the less invasive therapeutic options of cryotherapy and HIFU are regarded as largely experimental by governing bodies.

In the case of cryotherapy, a wealth of experience has been accumulated, demonstrating its efficacy. Initially used as a salvage treatment for radiation-failed prostate cancer, cryotherapy has been widely used as a primary treatment for localized and locally advanced prostate cancer. More recently, there has been interest expressed in the concept of focal therapy in prostate cancer. This has been evaluated as a primary treatment for prostate cancer, but little information is available regarding its potential use as a salvage treatment. In this article, we evaluate the potential for focal treatment in the salvage setting.

### Focal therapy for prostate cancer: A more vehement view of the approach could translate into real benefits for our patients [^113T4RQx]. European Urology (2018). Low credibility.

The literature on focal therapy is currently insufficient to recommend it as a first-line treatment. Information is needed from both randomized controlled trials and prospective registries for every available energy. That said, important research is underway in this field, and the door should be kept open to an approach that has the potential to offer adequate cancer control with lower morbidity and better post-treatment quality of life in properly selected patients.

### Minimally invasive procedures in the diagnosis and treatment of localized prostate cancer: an interventional radiologist's perspective [^114hqhfV]. Current Oncology Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Focal ablative therapies use one of several available high-energy sources to damage the index lesion. Because of the need for real-time image guidance, focal ablative therapies are often delivered by interventional radiologists (IRs). According to their main ablation mechanism, they can be categorized into thermal and non-thermal energy sources. Irreversible electroporation (IRE), photodynamic therapy (PDT), and focal brachytherapy use non-thermal sources of energy. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), transurethral ultrasound ablation (TULSA), cryotherapy, focal laser ablation (FLA), and radio-frequency ablation (RFA) are thermal sources of energy. Thermal-based therapies cause a progressive gradient of thermal dispersion around the targeted lesion. A recent systematic review compared the oncologic and functional outcomes between thermal and non-thermal energy sources, reporting individual advantages and disadvantages of each focal therapy modality.

A 68-year-old male presented with an elevated PSA level of 5 ng/mL and was diagnosed with prostate cancer in the right peripheral zone in the midportion of his prostate, with a Gleason score of 3 + 4 = 7 (ISUP 2). Initial T2-weighted MR images of the lesion were taken before treatment. Contrast-enhanced images directly at the end of the focal laser ablation procedure showed a lack of enhancement at the ablation bed. At a 1-year follow-up after treatment, the patient's PSA level dropped to 2.2 ng/mL, and subsequent MRI images confirmed no evidence of residual or recurrent tumor at the treatment area, as seen in perfusion-weighted color MR images.

### Transrectal high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation of prostate cancer: Effective treatment requiring accurate imaging [^114kpBLM]. European Journal of Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Transrectal HIFU ablation has become a reasonable option for the treatment of localized prostate cancer in non-surgical patients, with a 5-year disease-free survival rate similar to that of radiation therapy. It is also a promising salvage therapy for local recurrence after radiation therapy. These favorable results are partly due to recent improvements in prostate cancer imaging. However, further improvements are needed in patient selection, pre-operative localization of the tumor foci, assessment of the volume treated, and early detection of recurrence.

A better knowledge of the factors influencing HIFU-induced tissue destruction and a better pre-operative assessment using imaging techniques should improve treatment outcomes. While prostate HIFU ablation is currently performed under transrectal ultrasound guidance, MR guidance with real-time operative monitoring of temperature will be available in the near future. If this technique provides better targeting and more uniform tissue destruction, its cost-effectiveness will need to be carefully evaluated.

Finally, a recently reported synergistic effect between HIFU ablation and chemotherapy opens possibilities for treatment in high-risk or clinically advanced tumors.

### The role of high-intensity focused ultrasound in prostate cancer [^1153QVi5]. Current Oncology Reports (2007). Low credibility.

High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has emerged in the past decade as a new addition to the range of treatment options for prostate cancer. Clinical studies have investigated its use as a treatment for clinically localized disease and as salvage therapy in cases of failure after external beam radiotherapy. Additional studies with long-term follow-up are needed to further evaluate the cancer control and quality of life outcomes of this new therapeutic modality.
