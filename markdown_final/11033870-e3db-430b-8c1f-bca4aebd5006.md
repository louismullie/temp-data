## Question

Can a patient with stage 2 kidney disease tolerate bactrim da?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a patient with Stage 2 CKD can tolerate Bactrim DA (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, TMP/SMX), and if so, how to dose, monitor, mitigate risks, and when to consider alternatives. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how Stage 2 CKD (eGFR 60–89) maps onto creatinine clearance–based dose adjustments in the FDA label. Then, I should verify pharmacokinetics and the specific renal liabilities of each component. Next, I will examine hyperkalemia and AKI risks, including confounders like assay interference. After that, I need to confirm dosing strategy at this kidney function and identify when "precision dosing" might matter. Finally, I will set a monitoring plan, clarify contraindications, consider alternatives in high-risk situations, and synthesize a bottom-line recommendation with risk quantification and practical pearls.

> Let me first confirm the kidney function category and label-based dosing rules. Stage 2 CKD corresponds to mild impairment (eGFR roughly 60–89 mL/min/1.73 m²), which generally aligns with creatinine clearance above 30 mL/min in most adults; I should double-check that the FDA labeling requires no dose adjustment when CrCl > 30 mL/min and only mandates a 50% reduction for CrCl 15–30 mL/min, avoiding use if CrCl < 15 mL/min when monitoring cannot be assured, which matches the oral TMP/SMX label guidance [^114tB35F] [^115uyNcC] [^111sHFGH]. Hold on, I should verify this also applies to IV formulation and that the same thresholds are used; yes, IV labeling aligns with the 15–30 mL/min 50% dose reduction and avoidance in severe renal insufficiency without monitoring [^111X1VYR].

> Next, I will examine the pharmacology to anticipate accumulation and class-specific risks. Trimethoprim is largely renally cleared and acts as an epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) blocker in the distal nephron, which predictably reduces potassium excretion; sulfamethoxazole undergoes hepatic metabolism with a renally cleared metabolite (N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole) that can accumulate with declining eGFR, particularly with high-dose regimens and prolonged therapy, supporting consideration of TDM in such contexts [^116oAAwA]. Wait, let me verify whether Stage 2 CKD alone causes clinically relevant accumulation at standard doses; at eGFR 60–89, substantial accumulation is not expected, but the potassium-sparing effect of trimethoprim remains clinically relevant, especially with interacting drugs or baseline hyperkalemia risk [^116oAAwA].

> I will now examine hyperkalemia risk specifically and quantify it. Mechanistically, TMP inhibits distal tubular sodium reabsorption via ENaC, increasing serum potassium, with additive risk alongside RAAS inhibitors, potassium-sparing diuretics, or supplements; UK renal guidance also warns to use caution with trimethoprim in renal impairment or RAAS blockade, underscoring the clinical signal I should not ignore [^116oAAwA] [^113uFQi8]. But wait, what is the absolute risk at this kidney function range? In a large matched cohort of older adults, TMP-SMX increased hospital encounters with hyperkalemia versus amoxicillin, with an absolute risk difference of about 0.12% at eGFR ≥ 60 that grows as eGFR falls, which means Stage 2 CKD carries a small but real excess risk that becomes more clinically significant with interacting drugs or older age [^116C7QHU] [^11447Pon].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about nephrotoxicity without separating true injury from measurement artifacts. Trimethoprim increases serum creatinine by inhibiting tubular secretion, and it can also interfere with the Jaffé assay, causing a roughly 10% overestimation, so modest creatinine rises after starting TMP/SMX may be pseudo-AKI; I should confirm that this effect can mislead clinicians if not contextualized with clinical status and, when possible, alternative GFR markers like cystatin C [^1145k1Sg] [^114kfagc]. That said, I should double-check epidemiologic data: compared with amoxicillin, trimethoprim is associated with higher odds of AKI in older adults, and general nephrotoxicity mechanisms include acute interstitial nephritis, crystalluria, and hemodynamic factors, so vigilance is still warranted even in Stage 2 CKD [^117HpZiS] [^115rd67s].

> Next, I should review hematologic and metabolic adverse effects that might be accentuated in CKD. I need to ensure awareness of blood dyscrasias (agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia) and serious hypersensitivity, plus rare hypoglycemia and hyponatremia; these events are label-recognized and justify CBC checks in longer courses or high-dose therapy, with special caution in older adults or those with nutritional compromise or interacting drugs [^1136cCih] [^113RRnHU]. Let me verify folate-related risks and formal contraindications: TMP/SMX is contraindicated with megaloblastic anemia due to folate deficiency and in marked hepatic damage, and it should be avoided in severe renal insufficiency when renal status cannot be monitored, which reinforces baseline screening and problem-list review before initiating therapy [^1167FBMS] [^114ENzGZ].

> Now, dosing strategy at this kidney function: I should confirm that standard adult oral dosing (for example, 1 double-strength tablet q12h for uncomplicated UTI) is acceptable without adjustment when CrCl > 30 mL/min and that the label specifically states no adjustment is required in this range, which applies to typical short courses in Stage 2 CKD [^1167oGXZ] [^114tB35F]. Let me reconsider whether precision dosing is needed in mild impairment; pharmacometric work suggests dose reductions become relevant as eGFR approaches 30 mL/min for high-dose indications like PJP, not for eGFR 60–89, so in Stage 2 CKD I would not reduce standard-dose regimens, reserving adjustments for high-dose protocols or when eGFR declines toward 30 mL/min [^113uVBLs] [^115UFTP1].

> I need to ensure a practical monitoring protocol that balances risk and feasibility. Before starting, I should check serum potassium and creatinine/eGFR, review co-medications that raise potassium or reduce renal perfusion, and consider a baseline CBC if the course will be prolonged or the dose high; counseling on hydration helps mitigate crystalluria risk, which is emphasized in patient-facing FDA materials [^112saqk2] [^117MT2Fp]. During therapy, I should double-check timing: in practice, recheck potassium and creatinine within 3–5 days of initiation (earlier if high-risk co-therapies or older age), then periodically if therapy extends beyond a week, aligning with hyperkalemia caution in renal impairment and RAAS users highlighted by guidance and observational data [^113uFQi8] [^11447Pon]. Hmm, wait a minute — if creatinine bumps modestly without other AKI signals, I should verify whether this is TMP-related secretion interference or Jaffé assay artifact before attributing it to true AKI, especially in clinically stable patients [^1145k1Sg] [^114kfagc].

> But wait, what if the patient has multiple hyperkalemia risks? If baseline potassium is high-normal or the patient uses a RAAS inhibitor plus a potassium-sparing diuretic or supplement, I should consider an alternative agent or commit to very close potassium surveillance, because the combined risk materially exceeds the baseline Stage 2 CKD risk signal; UK practice guidance and evidence summaries for older adults specifically warn against trimethoprim in the RAAS plus K-sparing scenario unless monitoring is diligent [^113uFQi8] [^11447Pon]. For systems-level safety, I could adapt "nephrotoxin stewardship" approaches (for example, NINJA-style flags) to trigger timely lab checks and reduce nephrotoxic AKI, which is sensible even outside pediatrics as a generalizable principle [^1148ZhNa].

> I should confirm absolute and relative contraindications and when to choose alternatives. Absolute contraindications include hypersensitivity to sulfonamides or trimethoprim, history of drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia from these agents, documented megaloblastic anemia due to folate deficiency, marked hepatic damage, infants < 2 months, and severe renal insufficiency if renal status cannot be monitored; pregnancy requires a risk–benefit discussion with possible folate supplementation, and concomitant dofetilide is prohibited due to arrhythmic risk [^114ENzGZ] [^1167FBMS] [^115FFo1u]. Hold on, I should verify allergy nuances: cross-reactivity between sulfonamide antibiotics and nonantibiotics is unlikely due to structural differences, which can help refine allergy labels and expand options when appropriate, though severe cutaneous adverse reactions remain a critical concern with TMP/SMX [^112BrZov]. When hyperkalemia risk is unacceptable or the patient recently had AKI, alternatives like beta-lactams or fosfomycin can be considered based on organism and site, while remembering that renal dosing principles apply across agents to avoid different but real toxicity profiles in CKD [^116dZUzY].

> Synthesis and bottom line: I should double-check the risk quantification to be clear with patients and clinicians. In Stage 2 CKD, standard-dose TMP/SMX is generally acceptable without dose reduction, provided there is upfront risk assessment and early lab monitoring; the absolute increase in hyperkalemia risk at eGFR ≥ 60 is small (about 0.12% versus amoxicillin over 14 days), though the relative risk is roughly tripled and rises with lower eGFR or interacting drugs, and AKI encounters are also more frequent, with careful interpretation needed to separate true injury from creatinine handling and assay issues [^114tB35F] [^116C7QHU] [^117HpZiS] [^1145k1Sg]. Therefore, my verdict is that TMP/SMX can be tolerated at standard doses in Stage 2 CKD if baseline potassium is normal, major hyperkalemia risks are minimized, hydration is maintained, and potassium and creatinine are rechecked within 3–5 days; I need to ensure enhanced vigilance in older adults and those on RAAS inhibition or potassium-sparing agents, and to pivot to alternatives when risk clearly outweighs benefit [^112saqk2] [^113uFQi8] [^11447Pon].

> Practical pearls I should not overlook: counsel on fluid intake to prevent crystalluria and on adherence to avoid resistance; anticipate mild, reversible creatinine increases from TMP effect or Jaffé interference; reserve dose reductions for CrCl 15–30 mL/min or for high-dose indications as eGFR approaches 30 mL/min; and deploy system prompts for early lab checks in high-risk patients to mitigate nephrotoxicity events [^117MT2Fp] [^1145k1Sg] [^113uVBLs] [^1148ZhNa].

In general, patients with stage 2 CKD (eGFR 60–89 mL/min/1.73 m²) can tolerate Bactrim DS at standard doses [^114tB35F], but **monitor renal function and potassium** [^112NZoGD] due to risks of hyperkalemia and AKI [^116C7QHU]. No routine **dose adjustment** is needed, but use caution with RAAS inhibitors or potassium-sparing diuretics [^113uFQi8] and ensure adequate hydration to reduce crystalluria risk [^117MT2Fp]. If eGFR declines below 30 mL/min/1.73 m², **reduce the dose by 50%** and monitor closely [^111X1VYR] [^115uyNcC].

## Pharmacokinetics of bactrim in renal impairment

In renal impairment, **trimethoprim** is eliminated primarily unchanged by the kidneys [^112xFTRF], and its clearance declines as renal function falls, increasing exposure and toxicity risk [^116dZUzY]. In contrast, **sulfamethoxazole** is extensively metabolized to inactive metabolites that are renally excreted, and N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole accumulates as eGFR decreases [^116oAAwA], raising toxicity risk [^112xFTRF].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines for bactrim use in stage 2 CKD

- **No dose adjustment**: For eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^114tB35F], standard dosing is acceptable with monitoring of renal function and potassium.
- **Hyperkalemia risk**: Trimethoprim can cause hyperkalemia [^112NZoGD], especially with renal impairment or RAAS inhibitors [^113uFQi8]; monitor potassium and use caution [^116C7QHU].
- **AKI risk**: TMP-SMX is associated with AKI [^115rd67s], particularly in older adults or those with pre-existing renal impairment; monitor renal function during therapy [^112t7zw8].

---

## Recommended dosing and monitoring strategies

| **Renal function (eGFR)** | **Recommended dosing** | **Monitoring parameters** |
|-|-|-|
| > 30 mL/min/1.73 m² (stage 2 CKD) | Standard dosing (no adjustment) [^114tB35F] | - Renal function <br/> - Serum potassium [^113uFQi8] <br/> - CBC |
| 15–30 mL/min/1.73 m² (stage 3b CKD) | Reduce dose by 50% [^111X1VYR] [^115uyNcC] | - Renal function <br/> - Serum potassium <br/> - CBC |
| < 15 mL/min/1.73 m² (stage 4–5 CKD) | Avoid use if possible | - Renal function <br/> - Serum potassium <br/> - CBC |

---

Additionally, maintain **adequate hydration** to reduce crystalluria risk [^112saqk2], and be mindful of **drug interactions**; use caution with RAAS inhibitors, potassium-sparing diuretics, and other nephrotoxic drugs [^115rd67s] [^113uFQi8].

---

## Clinical outcomes and adverse effects

- **Hyperkalemia**: Increased risk, especially with RAAS inhibitors or potassium-sparing diuretics [^116C7QHU] [^112NZoGD].
- **AKI**: Higher risk in older adults and those with pre-existing renal impairment [^11447Pon] [^112t7zw8].
- **Crystalluria**: Risk mitigated by adequate hydration [^112saqk2].
- **Hematologic toxicity**: Monitor CBC for blood dyscrasias [^113RRnHU] [^112saqk2].

---

## Clinical recommendations

- **Standard dosing**: Acceptable in stage 2 CKD with monitoring of renal function and potassium [^114tB35F].
- **Monitor potassium**: Especially with RAAS inhibitors or potassium-sparing diuretics [^113uFQi8] [^116C7QHU].
- **Monitor renal function**: Watch for AKI during therapy [^11447Pon] [^112t7zw8].
- **Hydration**: Maintain adequate fluid intake [^1136cCih] [^112saqk2].
- **Dose reduction**: If eGFR declines below 30 mL/min/1.73 m², reduce dose by 50% and monitor closely [^111X1VYR] [^115uyNcC].

---

Patients with stage 2 CKD **can generally receive Bactrim DS at standard doses**, but **close monitoring** of renal function and potassium is essential to mitigate the risks of hyperkalemia and AKI [^114tB35F] [^116C7QHU] [^112t7zw8].

### Sulfatrim [^117MT2Fp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension, should only be used to treat bacterial infections; they do not treat viral infections (e.g. the common cold). When sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension is prescribed for a bacterial infection, patients should be informed that, although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Patients should be instructed to maintain an adequate fluid intake to prevent crystalluria and stone formation.

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics, which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes, after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

Complete blood counts should be done frequently in patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. If a significant reduction in the count of any formed blood element is noted, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim should be discontinued.

### How to define and manage low-risk drug allergy labels [^112BrZov]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Low credibility.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole

Sulfonamide antibiotics are commonly prescribed for the immunocompromised population as prophylaxis and directed therapy for opportunistic pathogens such as Pneumocystis jirovecii. Sulfonamide antibiotics are the second most frequently reported antibiotic allergy, with 3% to 8% of patients reporting a sulfonamide allergy. These antibiotics can cause immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reactions with various severities. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) is also one of the most prevalent causes of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic syndrome.

Although there is limited evidence on the cross-reactivity between sulfonamide antibiotics, it has been demonstrated that sulfonamide antimicrobials and sulfonamide nonantimicrobials are unlikely to cross-react due to differences in chemical structure, except for sulfasalazine, a prodrug composed of 5-aminosalicylic acid linked to the sulfa antibiotic sulfapyridine. Sulfonamide antibiotic hypersensitivity reactions target N1 (heterocyclic ring) or N4 (an aromatic amine), which are absent in sulfonamide nonantibiotics.

- **Risk stratification approach**: Historically, patients with sulfonamide allergy histories consistent with a potentially immediate or benign delayed hypersensitivity were managed with desensitization or induction of tolerance procedures. Although skin testing with the nonirritant concentration was possible, it rarely yielded positive tests.

### Sulfaprim [^1167FBMS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

**Contraindications**: Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to trimethoprim or sulfonamides, those with a history of drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia due to the use of trimethoprim and/or sulfonamides, and patients with documented megaloblastic anemia resulting from folate deficiency. Furthermore, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are contraindicated in pregnant and nursing mothers, as sulfonamides can cross the placenta, are excreted in breast milk, and may cause kernicterus. The oral suspension of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 2 months of age. Additionally, it is contraindicated in patients with marked hepatic damage or severe renal insufficiency when renal function status cannot be monitored.

Contraindications regarding the use of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole IV (also known as Bactrim, Sulfatrim, Septra):

- **Concomitant use of leucovorin**: Avoid using leucovorin with TMP/SMX for the treatment of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in HIV-positive patients due to the associated risks of treatment failure and increased mortality.

- **Pediatric patients aged < 2 months**: Use caution in pediatric patients aged ≥ 2 months because of the risk of benzyl alcohol toxicity, including gasping syndrome.

- **Porphyria**: Avoid use of TMP/SMX in patients with porphyria, as sulfonamides can precipitate porphyria crisis.

- **Possible folate deficiency**: Avoid using TMP/SMX in patients with possible folate deficiency, including the elderly, patients with alcohol use disorder, malabsorption syndrome, malnutrition, or those receiving anticonvulsant therapy. This also applies to patients with severe allergy or asthma.

- **Thyroid dysfunction**: Avoid use of TMP/SMX in patients with thyroid dysfunction, as sulfonamides can precipitate hypothyroidism.

- **Treatment of streptococcal infections**: Do not use TMP/SMX for the treatment of group A streptococcal infections, as sulfonamides do not eradicate streptococci and therefore cannot prevent sequelae such as rheumatic fever.

### Population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole: Dosage optimization for patients with renal insufficiency or receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^113ZPKwe]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim pharmacokinetics show large interindividual variability (IIV) in hospitalized patients and are affected by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The recommended dose for PCP treatment leads to adequate exposure in general, but there is a risk of both under- and over-exposure. Dose reductions for patients with an eGFR < 30 mL/minute/1.73 m² are suggested to achieve similar exposure compared with patients without renal insufficiency. The risk of concentrations above the target range increases in patients with lower eGFR and high cotrimoxazole doses. Notably, in patients treated with CRRT, sulfamethoxazole clearance is increased. Therefore, doubling the sulfamethoxazole dose is necessary to reach similar exposure to patients without renal failure. Monitoring with therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is necessary in patients treated with CRRT as high doses might lead to N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole accumulation.

### Bactrim [^1145k1Sg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The interaction between BACTRIM and laboratory tests can influence results. Specifically, the trimethoprim component may interfere with the serum methotrexate assay when using the competitive binding protein technique (CBPA) with bacterial dihydrofolate reductase as the binding protein. However, no interference occurs if methotrexate is measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA).

BACTRIM may also affect the Jaffé alkaline picrate reaction assay for creatinine, causing overestimations of approximately 10% within the normal value range.

- **Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility**:
	- **Carcinogenesis**: Sulfamethoxazole was evaluated in a 26-week tumorigenic mouse (Tg-rasH2) study at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day, equating to 2.4-fold the human systemic exposure at a daily dose of 800 mg twice a day, and was not found to be carcinogenic.
	- **Mutagenesis**: Standard in vitro reverse mutation bacterial tests have not been conducted with the combination of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Nonetheless, an in vitro chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes was negative. In both in vitro and in vivo tests across animal species, no chromosomal damage was noted for sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. However, positive results were observed with in vivo micronucleus assays post oral administration. Observations of leukocytes from patients treated with these drugs showed no chromosomal abnormalities.
	- **Sulfamethoxazole alone** was positive in an in vitro reverse mutation bacterial assay.

### Safety of medical therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease [^113SmH8P]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Maintaining patient safety is a necessary step to improve healthcare delivery. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have an increased frequency of adverse safety events largely because of medication errors.

CKD and ESRD have several features that threaten patient safety. Reduced glomerular filtration rate affects the clearance of many medications and is associated with several comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, metabolic bone disease, and anemia. These comorbidities in CKD often increase the complexity of treatment regimens. Patients with ESRD, requiring dialysis or transplantation, have an even greater potential for adverse safety events due to their reliance on renal replacement modalities and the frequent requirement of polypharmacy and potential drug-drug interactions.

There is an important need to develop strategies to provide inpatient and outpatient management plans to limit the risk of adverse medication errors across a wide range of educational and socioeconomic backgrounds. It is also critical to develop a uniform set of standards for evaluating patient safety in CKD and ESRD, along with appropriate descriptions of the prototypical safety profiles of patients who have CKD, a kidney transplant, or who are on dialysis.

### Trimethoprim use for urinary tract infection and risk of adverse outcomes in older patients: Cohort study [^112t7zw8]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

This cohort covers the years 1997–2015, and we have shown a progressive increase in the odds of developing hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury following a UTI in more recent years. The increase in hyperkalemia may be due to an increased rate of blood testing in primary care (particularly among groups at risk of high potassium levels, such as patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease) or improved automatic recording of test results in general practice records. The marked increase in acute kidney injury over time as defined by Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) coding is well established and likely to be predominantly related to increased clinical focus and the adoption of consensus definitions defined by changes in creatinine levels. By adjusting for calendar period we aimed to minimize the influence of these secular trends on our results.

In contrast to previous studies, we did not identify an increased risk of death from any cause in users of trimethoprim. The two previous papers that identified an increased risk of sudden death among users of renin-angiotensin system blockade taking co-trimoxazole, used a case-control design with cases defined by sudden death among residents of Ontario over 18 years of follow-up. They were therefore well powered for this outcome. We chose all-cause death as a prespecified analysis owing to the lack of power for cause-specific death since we restricted the cohort to patients with a UTI to address issues of confounding by indication for antibiotic choice that had limited previous research.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole IV (also known as Bactrim, Sulfatrim, Septra):

- **Antimicrobial resistance**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as the use of TMP/SMX in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.

- **Blood dyscrasias**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and other blood dyscrasias.

- **C. difficile infection**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as nearly all antibiotics, including TMP/SMX, are associated with an increased risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea.

- **Crystalluria**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of crystalluria. Ensure adequate fluid intake and urinary output.

- **Decreased blood glucose**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with rare cases of hypoglycemia, especially in patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition, or receiving high doses of TMP/SMX.

- **Decreased platelet count**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of drug-induced thrombocytopenia.

- **Decreased serum sodium**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX can cause severe and symptomatic hyponatremia.

- **Hemolysis**: Use caution in patients with G6PD deficiency.

- **Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocyt.

### Population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole: Dosage optimization for patients with renal insufficiency or receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^115yeoVz]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

The clearance of sulfamethoxazole in patients on CRRT exceeds the median clearance of the patients in this study. For trimethoprim, the clearance in patients on CRRT was comparable to patients with an eGFR of 70 mL/minute/1.73 m². N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole is not rapidly eliminated by CRRT. The rapid clearance of sulfamethoxazole and the difference between sulfamethoxazole and N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole clearance has been previously reported in small case series. One possible explanation is that tubular reabsorption, which is significant for sulfamethoxazole, does not occur in patients treated with CRRT. When filtrated via CRRT, sulfamethoxazole will be cleared directly from the body via the ultrafiltrate. This lack of tubular reabsorption of sulfamethoxazole could explain the increased clearance observed in patients treated with CRRT. In contrast, N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole, being reabsorbed to a lesser extent, is less affected by CRRT. This change in pharmacokinetics presents a risk of rapid clearance of active sulfamethoxazole in CRRT patients, while N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole accumulates, potentially leading to underexposure or toxicity.

The clinical impact is unclear as the exposure to trimethoprim is sufficient in these patients. To prevent toxicity, therapy for PCP could be started with TID 1,920 mg, and doses can be subsequently individualized using early TDM. For other infections requiring lower daily doses and thereby a lower risk of N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole accumulation, doubling the cotrimoxazole dose should be considered to reach similar exposure of sulfamethoxazole.

### Trimethoprim use for urinary tract infection and risk of adverse outcomes in older patients: Cohort study [^115chpcP]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

There are some important limitations to consider. While we attempted to capture only simple UTIs, defined using primary care morbidity coding but not excluding those with a history of more complex urological pathology, our main analysis may have included patients with underlying urinary tract disorders or other infections. Since different classes of antibiotic drugs are prescribed for different clinical scenarios, some degree of confounding by indication is unavoidable. However, we reduced confounding by robustly defining and adjusting for variables that may have influenced the choice of antibiotic drug prescribed, such as baseline renal function. Trimethoprim was less frequently prescribed for patients with urological pathology, which would likely have led to an underestimation of the odds of adverse outcomes, particularly acute kidney injury, compared to the true result. Similarly, clinicians may have been cautious in prescribing trimethoprim to those at highest risk of acute kidney injury and hyperkalaemia, again leading to an underestimation of the true risk of adverse outcomes, particularly for those taking renin-angiotensin system blockers. However, the strongest evidence of adverse outcomes associated with trimethoprim use for those taking renin-angiotensin system blockers was published only towards the end of the period of this study.

Our assessment of antibiotic exposure was based on prescriptions alone, so patients may not have collected or taken their medicine, which may have led to differential misclassification owing to this factor.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus vancomycin for severe infections caused by meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus: Randomised controlled trial [^112kFk7a]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to show the non-inferiority of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared with vancomycin for the treatment of severe infections due to meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

- **Design**: Parallel, open label, randomised controlled trial.

- **Setting**: Four acute care hospitals in Israel.

- **Participants**: Adults with severe infections caused by MRSA susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. Patients with left-sided endocarditis, meningitis, chronic haemodialysis, and prolonged neutropenia were excluded.

- **Interventions**: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily versus vancomycin 1 g twice daily for a minimum of seven days and then by indication.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary efficacy outcome was treatment failure assessed at day 7, consisting of death, persistence of haemodynamic instability or fever, stable or worsening Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and persistence of bacteraemia. The primary safety outcome was all-cause mortality at day 30. Non-inferiority was defined by a difference of less than 15% for treatment failure.

Results indicated that 252 patients were included in the trial, of whom 91 (36%) had bacteraemia. No significant difference in treatment failure was observed between trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (51/135, 38%) and vancomycin (32/117, 27%) with a risk ratio of 1.38 (95% confidence interval 0.96 to 1.99). However, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole did not meet the non-inferiority criterion, with an absolute difference of 10.4% (95% confidence interval -1.2% to 21.5%). For patients with bacteraemia, the risk ratio was 1.40 (0.91 to 2.16).

### Pharmacology behind common drug nephrotoxicities [^115rd67s]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). High credibility.

Patients are exposed to numerous prescribed and over-the-counter medications. Unfortunately, drugs remain a relatively common cause of acute and chronic kidney injury. A combination of factors, including the innate nephrotoxicity of drugs, underlying patient characteristics that increase their risk for kidney injury, and the metabolism and pathway of excretion by the kidneys of the various agents administered, enhance risk for drug-induced nephrotoxicity. This paper will review these clinically relevant aspects of drug-induced nephrotoxicity for the clinical nephrologist.

### Quality use of medicines in patients with chronic kidney disease [^112RxNCy]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

A breakdown of potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP) across the different stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is provided in Figure 1. Overall, 35% (n = 9,926) of patients had at least one PIP based on either CG CrCl or eGFR. Approximately 6.5% (n = 1,866) and 1.8% (n = 505) were prescribed two and three or more potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs), respectively [Table 2]. A total of 1,171 patients (4.1%) were prescribed both a contraindicated medication and a medication at an inappropriate dose as per their kidney function.

- **Potential inappropriate prescribing as per CKD stage**:
	- **Potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) in the study sample**: Analgesics were prescribed to 7.2% of patients (n = 2,082) and were the most frequent inappropriate class of medication, with 73.8% (n = 1,536) of those prescribed being inappropriate. This was followed by medications for diabetes, prescribed to 30.4% (n = 8,730) of patients, with 44.1% (n = 3,384) being inappropriately prescribed, and beta-blockers, prescribed to 16.8% (n = 4,832) of patients, with 38.2% (n = 1,849) deemed inappropriate.
	- **Most commonly prescribed medications at an inappropriate dose**: Vildagliptin was prescribed to 1.2% (n = 355) of patients, with 77.2% (n = 274) being inappropriate by dose, followed by fenofibrate, prescribed to 6.7% (n = 1,939) of patients, with 69.4% (n = 1,346) being inappropriate by dose.
	- **Medications contraindicated by CG CrCl or eGFR**: Dapagliflozin had a contraindication rate of 82.8% among those prescribed (n = 296), while alendronate had a contraindication rate of 31.7% among those prescribed (n = 791). Codeine, glibenclamide, and glimepiride were associated with PIP in all patients prescribed these drugs, as the AMH recommends their avoidance in renal impairment.

Note: Codeine, glibenclamide, and glimepiride were excluded from analyses due to their universally contraindicated status in cases of renal impairment according to the Australian Medicines Handbook (AMH).

### Clinical pharmacokinetics in kidney disease: Application to rational design of dosing regimens [^116dZUzY]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

A change in pharmacokinetics can alter drug exposure and predispose the patient to either over- or underdosing, potentially resulting in adverse drug reactions or therapeutic failure. Kidney disease is characterized by multiple physiological effects, which induce clinically significant changes in pharmacokinetics. These vary between individuals and may be quantified in certain instances. An understanding of pharmacokinetic concepts is, therefore, important for a rational approach to the design of drug dosing regimens for the delivery of personalized medical care.

Whether kidney disease is acute or chronic, drug clearance decreases, and the volume of distribution may remain unchanged or increase. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined by dynamic changes in kidney function, which complicates attempts to accurately quantify drug clearance. In contrast, changes in drug clearance progress more slowly with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In general, kidney replacement therapies increase drug clearance, but the extent to which this occurs depends on the modality used and its duration, the drug's properties, and the timing of drug administration.

However, the changes in drug handling associated with kidney disease are not isolated to reduced kidney clearance, and an appreciation of the scale of potential derangements is important. In most instances, the first dose administered in patients with kidney disease is the same as in patients with normal kidney function. However, in some cases, a higher (loading) initial dose is given to rapidly achieve therapeutic concentrations, followed by a lower maintenance dose, as is well described.

### Population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole: Dosage optimization for patients with renal insufficiency or receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^116oAAwA]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

Cotrimoxazole is an antibiotic combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, effective against both Gram‐positive and Gram‐negative pathogens. The drug disrupts the production of essential nucleic acids needed for bacterial proliferation and replication by synergistically inhibiting two consecutive enzymatic steps involved in bacterial folinic acid synthesis. It has excellent tissue penetration and is therefore used for the treatment of various infections, ranging from infections caused by more resistant pathogens (ESBL+ E. coli, MRSA) to *Pneumocystis jirovecii* pneumonia (PCP).

Trimethoprim is primarily eliminated through nonionic renal diffusion, with 40–75% of the drug recovered unchanged in the urine within 24 hours. Sulfamethoxazole is extensively metabolized into inactive metabolites which are renally excreted. Approximately 16% of sulfamethoxazole is eliminated unchanged and 46% as N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole, the predominant metabolite. Although N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole lacks relevant antibacterial activity, this metabolite has been associated with concentration-dependent toxicity due to accumulation in patients with renal impairment. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is therefore recommended in patients with impaired renal function receiving high-dose cotrimoxazole.

### Trimethoprim use for urinary tract infection and risk of adverse outcomes in older patients: cohort study [^116otiLc]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Results in context

Multiple historical case reports and case series have implicated co-trimoxazole as a cause of reduced renal function, interstitial nephritis, or acute tubular necrosis. Among patients receiving co-trimoxazole in hospital, 6% developed a creatinine-based definition of acute kidney injury attributed to the antibiotics. However, we believe our study to be the first to show and quantify an association between trimethoprim alone and acute kidney injury in the general population. This is an important distinction, as sulphonamide antibiotics (including sulfamethoxazole) have long been recognized to be associated with a substantial risk of acute renal impairment, which could have been assumed to be causal. Our finding of an association between ciprofloxacin and acute kidney injury is similar to another population-based study that showed users of fluoroquinolones had a 2.18-fold (95% confidence interval 1.74 to 2.73) higher rate of acute kidney injury. However, ciprofloxacin is recommended for the treatment of pyelonephritis, so an association with acute kidney injury may be due to confounding by severity of infection.

An association between both co-trimoxazole or trimethoprim alone, with hyperkalemia is well-reported, particularly in association with renin-angiotensin system blockers. Our results suggest that, regardless of other drug use (renin-angiotensin system blockers or potassium-sparing diuretics), trimethoprim (but not ciprofloxacin) is associated with more than doubling the odds of hyperkalemia. There is an additional increase in the odds of h.

### A European renal best practice (ERBP) position statement on the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines on acute kidney injury: part 1: definitions, conservative management and contrast-induced nephropathy [^113SkcCk]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Aminoglycosides are highly potent, bactericidal antibiotics with favorable attributes, including remarkable stability, predictable pharmacokinetics, low incidence of immunologically mediated side effects, and a lack of hematologic or hepatic toxicity. Although nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity remain major concerns, these events appear to be due to cumulative exposure, and their occurrence after single-dose administration is exceptional.

Due to their potent bactericidal activity, aminoglycosides can help reverse sepsis-related hemodynamic instability and thus reduce the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). In light of recent developments with progressive antimicrobial resistance to other classes of agents, aminoglycosides remain useful antibiotics. From this perspective, ERBP does not object to the use of aminoglycosides as a single-shot administration in certain conditions. However, careful dosing and therapeutic drug monitoring should be applied to mitigate the risk of AKI when more than one dose is administered. It is recommended that aminoglycosides be used for as short a period as possible.

### Clinical outcomes of failing to dose-reduce cephalosporin antibiotics in older adults with CKD [^114PjLEf]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

Dosing recommendations for cephalosporin antibiotics are based on pharmacokinetic studies and are frequently ignored in practice. This study was undertaken to investigate the clinical outcomes of failing to dose-reduce cephalosporin antibiotics in patients with CKD.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: This was a retrospective cohort study conducted in Ontario, Canada, using linked population-based health care databases. The study included 9,347 outpatients (median age 83; interquartile range, 77–88 years; 57% women) with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 30 ml/min per 1.73 m² who received relatively high doses of cephalexin (> 1000 mg), cefuroxime (> 500 mg), or cefprozil (> 500 mg). The primary outcome was a hospital encounter (emergency room visit or hospital admission) with a condition listed as a possible side-effect of cephalosporins. Secondary outcomes were antibiotic treatment failure and all-cause mortality. All measures were assessed in the 30 days after cephalosporin initiation.

- **Results**: Patients who received a higher than recommended dose of a cephalosporin antibiotic were similar in multiple indicators of baseline health to patients who received a reduced dose. Overall, 6% of patients presented to the hospital with a possible cephalosporin side-effect, 13% failed antibiotic treatment, and 3% died. Compared with a reduced dose, receiving a higher dose of antibiotic was not associated with reduced outcomes in this study.

Objective: To demonstrate the non-inferiority of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared with vancomycin for treating severe infections due to meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

Design: Parallel, open-label, randomized controlled trial.

Setting: Four acute care hospitals in Israel.

Participants: Adults with severe infections caused by MRSA susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. Exclusion criteria included patients with left-sided endocarditis, meningitis, chronic haemodialysis, and prolonged neutropenia.

Interventions: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole at 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily versus vancomycin at 1 g twice daily for at least seven days or as indicated thereafter.

Main outcome measures: The primary efficacy outcome was treatment failure at day 7, defined by death, persistence of haemodynamic instability or fever, stable or worsening Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and persistence of bacteraemia. The primary safety outcome was all-cause mortality at day 30. Non-inferiority was determined by a difference of less than 15% for treatment failure.

Results: A total of 252 patients were included in the trial, with 91 (36%) experiencing bacteraemia. There was no significant difference in treatment failure between trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (51/135, 38%) and vancomycin (32/117, 27%) — risk ratio 1.38 (95% confidence interval 0.96 to 1.99). However, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole did not meet the non-inferiority criterion — absolute difference 10.4% (95% confidence interval −1.2% to 21.5%). For patients with bacteraemia, the risk ratio was 1.40 (0.91 to 2.16).

### Antibiotics for asymptomatic bacteriuria in kidney transplant recipients [^116JgT6L]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria, defined as bacteriuria without signs or symptoms of urinary tract infection (UTI), occurs in 17% to 51% of kidney transplant recipients and is thought to increase the risk for a subsequent UTI. No consensus exists on the role of antibiotics for asymptomatic bacteriuria in kidney transplantation.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in kidney transplant recipients with antimicrobial agents to prevent symptomatic UTI, all-cause mortality, and the indirect effects of UTI (acute rejection, graft loss, worsening of graft function).

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 1 September 2017 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in any language assessing treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in kidney transplant recipients at any time point after transplantation.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently determined study eligibility, assessed quality, and extracted data. Primary outcomes were the incidence of symptomatic UTI and incidence of antimicrobial resistance. Other outcomes included incidences of all-cause mortality, graft loss, graft rejection, graft function, hospitalization for UTI, and adverse reactions.

### Sulfatrim [^116ftdEo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Use in the treatment of and prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)

AIDS patients may not tolerate or respond to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in the same manner as non-AIDS patients. The incidence of side effects, particularly rash, fever, leukopenia, and elevated aminotransferase (transaminase) values, with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim therapy in AIDS patients who are being treated for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, has been reported to be greatly increased compared with the incidence normally associated with the use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in non-AIDS patients. The incidence of hyperkalemia appears to be increased in AIDS patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Adverse effects are generally less severe in patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim for prophylaxis. A history of mild intolerance to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension in AIDS patients does not appear to predict intolerance of subsequent secondary prophylaxis. However, if a patient develops a skin rash or any sign of adverse reaction, therapy with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim should be reevaluated.

High dosage of trimethoprim, as used in patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, induces a progressive but reversible increase of serum potassium concentrations in a substantial number of patients. Even treatment with recommended doses may cause hyperkalemia when trimethoprim is administered to patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism.

### Population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole: Dosage optimization for patients with renal insufficiency or receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^113uVBLs]. Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics (2025). High credibility.

- **Study highlights**: Cotrimoxazole is an antibiotic combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. Sulfamethoxazole peak concentrations above 100 mg/L and trimethoprim concentrations > 5 mg/L have been associated with clinical effectiveness for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Concentrations of sulfamethoxazole > 200 mg/L, its metabolite N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole > 75 mg/L, and trimethoprim > 15 mg/L are associated with toxicity. All three components are cleared to some extent by renal clearance.

- **What question did this study address?** Which dosing regimens of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole should be used to reach the target concentrations for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and which dose adjustments are needed for patients with renal insufficiency or with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)?

- **What does this study add to our knowledge?** TID 1,920 mg and b.i.d. 2,400 mg lead to sufficient exposure for infections with P. jirovecii in patients without renal insufficiency. To reach equivalent exposure, a dose reduction of 33.3% is needed in patients with an eGFR of 10 mL/minute/1.73 m² and of 16.7% for an eGFR of 30 mL/minute/1.73 m². N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole accumulates in patients with a reduced eGFR. CRRT increased the clearance of sulfamethoxazole, but not trimethoprim or N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole, compared with the median clearance in the population.

- **How might this change clinical pharmacology or translational science?** The dosing regimens suggested in the study provide guidance for improving therapeutic outcomes while minimizing toxicity in patients with renal insufficiency or those undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy.

### Xigduo XR [^1127eTyU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Renal impairment**: Initiation of Xigduo XR is not recommended in patients with an eGFR below 45 mL/min/1.73 m² and is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) or end-stage renal disease [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3)].

- **Dapagliflozin evaluation**: Dapagliflozin 10 mg was evaluated in 4,304 adult patients with chronic kidney disease (eGFR 25 to 75 mL/min/1.73 m²) in the DAPA-CKD trial. It was also evaluated in 1,926 adult patients with an eGFR of 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m² in the DAPA-HF trial. The safety profile of dapagliflozin across eGFR subgroups was consistent with the known safety profile [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.4 and 14.5)].

- **Glycemic control trials**: Dapagliflozin 10 mg was evaluated in two glycemic control trials that included adult patients with moderate renal impairment (an eGFR of 45 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m², and an eGFR of 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m²) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Patients with diabetes and renal impairment using dapagliflozin 10 mg are more likely to experience hypotension and may be at higher risk for acute kidney injury secondary to volume depletion. In the trial of adult patients with an eGFR 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m², 13 patients receiving dapagliflozin experienced bone fractures compared to none receiving placebo. The use of dapagliflozin 10 mg for glycemic control in patients without established cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors is not recommended when eGFR is less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m² [see Dosage].

### Trimethoprim is associated with a greater risk of acute kidney injury and hyperkalaemia in older adults compared with other antibiotics used to treat UTIs [^117HpZiS]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

This review highlights the association of prescription of trimethoprim with hyperkalaemia and acute kidney injury (AKI), but not with death, in older adults being treated for a simple urinary tract infection (UTI). The results were adjusted for a wide range of appropriate confounders. The authors adjusted for baseline renal function, defined as "the most recent biochemical test results recorded in primary care". Renal function declines with age. If there was a long interval between the most recent recorded renal function and the renal function recorded post-antibiotic prescription, it is possible that the perceived baseline renal function for some individuals may not have reflected their true baseline. This may have led to an overestimation of the number of AKI cases.

Death and hyperkalaemia were determined from read codes in either primary or secondary care. However, the authors defined AKI as a hospital admission with AKI. By excluding cases of AKI occurring in general practice, this may have led to an underestimation of the number of episodes of AKI.

The authors helpfully contextualize the results. While the odds of hyperkalaemia and AKI with trimethoprim prescription are increased by 127% and 72%, respectively, compared with amoxicillin prescription, the increase in absolute risk is small. The authors state that for 1,000 UTI episodes treated with trimethoprim rather than amoxicillin, there would be one additional case of hyperkalaemia and two of AKI. These results would be very similar among those concurrently prescribed RAAs.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole PO (also known as Bactrim, Sulfatrim, Septra):

- **Antimicrobial resistance**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as the use of TMP/SMX in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.

- **Blood dyscrasias**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and other blood dyscrasias.

- **C. difficile infection**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as nearly all antibiotics, including TMP/SMX, are associated with an increased risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea.

- **Crystalluria**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of crystalluria. Ensure adequate fluid intake and urinary output.

- **Decreased blood glucose**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with rare cases of hypoglycemia, especially in patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition, or receiving high doses of TMP/SMX.

- **Decreased platelet count**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of drug-induced thrombocytopenia.

- **Decreased serum sodium**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX can cause severe and symptomatic hyponatremia.

Therefore, no dosage adjustment is necessary based on age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

- **Pediatric patients**: A single-dose safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic study of tigecycline was conducted in pediatric patients aged 8 to 16 years who recently recovered from infections. The doses administered were 0.5, 1, or 2 mg/kg. The study showed that for children aged 12 to 16 years (n = 16), a dosage of 50 mg twice daily would likely result in exposures comparable to those observed in adults with the approved dosing regimen. Large variability observed in children aged 8 to 11 years (n = 8) required additional study to determine the appropriate dosage. A subsequent tigecycline dose-finding study was conducted in 8 to 11-year-old patients with cIAI.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for melioidosis in patients receiving hemodialysis in the tropics? One size does not fit all [^116XWR1N]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Melioidosis has a high case fatality rate and is more common in patients with chronic kidney disease. Some authors have recommended trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) prophylaxis for all hemodialysis (HD) patients during the wet season in melioidosis-endemic regions. Historical data were reviewed to determine if TMP/SMX prophylaxis was warranted in the HD population of Far North Queensland, Australia. Between 1997 and 2017, there were 242 culture-confirmed cases of melioidosis in the region; three (1.2%) occurred in HD patients, and all survived without intensive care support. During the study period, there were 843 HD patients in the region with 3,024 cumulative patient years of risk. Even assuming 100% efficacy, it would have been necessary to prescribe TMP/SMX for 1,008 patient years to prevent one case of melioidosis. Given the significant additional cost and potentially life-threatening side effects of TMP/SMX therapy, clinicians should review the local epidemiology of melioidosis before the implementation of universal TMP/SMX prophylaxis in their HD population.

### Population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole: Dosage optimization for patients with renal insufficiency or receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^112XBvAd]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

We did not estimate the optimal dosing regimens for infections other than PCP. In the literature, target concentrations have been suggested for infections caused by other pathogens; however, these target concentrations are based predominantly on in vitro studies and are not clinically validated. For PCP, the evidence for the target range is also limited to small studies; therefore, larger studies are needed to establish the optimal concentrations for effectiveness.

To further optimize the dosing regimens of cotrimoxazole, additional research is needed to investigate its PK/PD, PK/toxicity, post-antibiotic effect, and tissue penetration. In a murine thigh model, AUC/MIC was found to best predict the effectiveness for MRSA infections. However, T > MIC, C max > MIC, and species-dependent associations have also been suggested. Based on the specific association for a certain pathogen, alternative dosing regimens could be explored.

For instance, beta-lactam antibiotics are often administered via continuous infusion because T > MIC best predicts their effectiveness. If T > MIC is also a predictor of cotrimoxazole's effectiveness, shortening the dose interval or using continuous infusion might be beneficial. If C max best predicts effectiveness and there is a sufficient post-antibiotic effect, high doses with a prolonged dosing interval might be more effective. Furthermore, because of the high tissue penetration of both trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, the target site concentrations might be higher compared with plasma concentrations, which could require alternative dosing regimens based on these observations.

### Nephrotoxin exposure and acute kidney injury in adults [^1148ZhNa]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

Rates of nephrotoxic acute kidney injury (AKI) are not well described in adults due to a lack of a clear definition, debate over which drugs should be considered nephrotoxins, and illness-related confounding. Nephrotoxic Injury Negated by Just-in-Time Action (NINJA), a program that reduces rates of nephrotoxic AKI in pediatric populations, may be able to address these concerns, but whether NINJA can be effectively applied to adults remains unclear.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective cohort study conducted at the University of Iowa Hospital, we included adult patients admitted to a general hospital floor for ≥ 48 hours during 2019. The NINJA algorithm screened charts for high nephrotoxin exposure and AKI. After propensity score matching, Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to evaluate the relationship between nephrotoxic exposure and all-stage AKI, stage 2–3 AKI, or death. Additional analyses evaluated the most frequent nephrotoxins used in this population.

- **Results**: Of 11,311 patients, 1527 (16%) had ≥ 1 day of high nephrotoxin exposure. Patients with nephrotoxic exposures subsequently developed AKI in 29% of cases, and 22% of all inpatient AKI events met nephrotoxic AKI criteria. Common nephrotoxins were vancomycin, iodinated contrast dye, piperacillin-tazobactam, acyclovir, and lisinopril. After propensity score matching, Cox proportional hazard models for high nephrotoxin exposure were significantly associated with all AKI (hazard ratio [HR] 1.43, 1.19–1.72, P < 0.001), stage 2–3 AKI (HR 1.78, 1.18–2.67, P = 0.006), and mortality (HR 2.12, 1.09–4.11, P = 0.03).

### Population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole: Dosage optimization for patients with renal insufficiency or receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^115UFTP1]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). High credibility.

The goal of the study was to describe the population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole in hospitalized patients. Furthermore, this study used the model to optimize dosing regimens of cotrimoxazole for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and in patients with renal insufficiency or with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). This was a retrospective multicenter observational cohort study based on therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) data from hospitalized patients treated with cotrimoxazole.

We developed two population pharmacokinetic (POPPK) models: a model of trimethoprim and an integrated model with both sulfamethoxazole and N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole concentrations. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to determine the optimal dosing regimen. A total of 348 measurements from 168 patients were available. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and CRRT were included as covariates on the clearance of all three compounds.

Cotrimoxazole TID 1,920 mg and b.i.d. 2,400 mg led to sufficient exposure for infections with P. jirovecii in patients without renal insufficiency. To reach equivalent exposure, a dose reduction of 33.3% is needed in patients with an eGFR of 10 mL/minute/1.73 m² and of 16.7% for an eGFR of 30 mL/minute/1.73 m². N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole accumulates in patients with a reduced eGFR. CRRT increased the clearance of sulfamethoxazole, but not trimethoprim or N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole, compared with the median clearance in the population. Doubling the sulfamethoxazole dose is needed for patients on CRRT to reach effective exposure levels.

Contraindications regarding the use of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole PO (also known as Bactrim, Sulfatrim, Septra):

- **Concomitant use of leucovorin**: Avoid using leucovorin with TMP/SMX for the treatment of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in HIV-positive patients due to the associated risks of treatment failure and increased mortality.

- **Porphyria**: Avoid use of TMP/SMX in patients with porphyria, as sulfonamides can precipitate a porphyria crisis.

- **Possible folate deficiency**: Avoid using TMP/SMX in patients with possible folate deficiency, including the elderly, patients with alcohol use disorder, malabsorption syndrome, malnutrition, or those receiving anticonvulsant therapy. Patients with severe allergy or asthma should also avoid TMP/SMX.

- **Thyroid dysfunction**: Avoid use of TMP/SMX in patients with thyroid dysfunction, as sulfonamides can precipitate hypothyroidism.

- **Treatment of streptococcal infections**: Do not use TMP/SMX for the treatment of group A streptococcal infections, as sulfonamides do not eradicate streptococci and therefore cannot prevent sequelae such as rheumatic fever.

### Population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole: Dosage optimization for patients with renal insufficiency or receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^114kfagc]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

This study has some limitations. First, we utilized retrospectively collected routine TDM data to build the model, which unavoidably introduced some uncertainties regarding exact dosing and sampling times. In addition, the number of samples per patient was limited. However, the chosen type of analysis, nonlinear mixed-effects modeling, can still provide reliable pharmacokinetic parameter estimates even in sparse datasets.

Renal function was estimated using the CKD-EPI formula to calculate the eGFR. The CKD-EPI formula is not ideal for assessing glomerular filtration in ICU patients. Furthermore, trimethoprim interferes with tubular creatinine secretion, resulting in an approximate 10–30% elevation in serum creatinine concentrations and thereby falsely underestimating eGFR. To address this issue, future studies should focus on alternative measures of GFR, such as cystatin C or iohexol clearance.

Because of the limited number of patients treated with CRRT, we were not able to investigate the influence of different CRRT regimens and settings on the pharmacokinetics. Lastly, we lacked information about N-acetyltransferase or CYP2C19 genotypes, as well as urine pH, all of which are factors previously associated with the pharmacokinetics of cotrimoxazole.

### Hypoglycaemia associated with co-trimoxazole use in a 56-year-old Caucasian woman with renal impairment [^114YX9yt]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Here we present a case of refractory hypoglycemia associated with the use of the antibiotic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) to treat Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) infection. The patient had significant pre-existing renal impairment with a kidney transplant in situ. Refractory hypoglycemia occurred 5 days after starting the antibiotic and persisted for 36 hours after its cessation. SMX contains the same sulphanilamide structural group as oral hypoglycemic agents called sulphonylureas. SMX could therefore act as an insulin secretagogue. The inappropriately raised insulin and c-peptide levels seen in our patient support this theory. The 5-day asymptomatic period would allow sufficient time for the drug to accumulate, and the extended period seen after its cessation would be indicative of a dose-dependent side effect. Following 3 days of observation and continuous glycemic support in the High Dependency Unit, she was discharged back to the ward with no further occurrence of hypoglycemia.

### Population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole: Dosage optimization for patients with renal insufficiency or receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^1117T5Wm]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). High credibility.

- **Results: Population**: A total of 168 patients (16 LUMC, 116 Erasmus MC, and 36 UMCG) were included in this study. The population was predominantly male (64.3%), with a median age of 58 years. The median eGFR, based on the CKD‐EPI formula, was 70 mL/minute/1.73 m². Eighteen patients (10.7%) were concomitantly treated with CRRT. The most frequently used initial dosing regimen was cotrimoxazole TID 1,920 mg (48.2%), and intravenous infusion was the most common route of administration (55.4%). Baseline patient characteristics are presented in Table 1.

- **Table 1: Baseline characteristics**: In total, 348 sulfamethoxazole and N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole concentrations were available for analysis. Trimethoprim concentrations were only measured in two of the three participating hospitals, with 137 concentrations from 52 patients (16 LUMC and 36 UMCG) available for the trimethoprim model. The concentrations included both peak and trough concentrations. Sulfamethoxazole concentrations ranged between 2 and 380 mg/L, N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole between 2 and 173.4 mg/L, and trimethoprim concentrations were between 0.2 and 15.6 mg/L.

### Treatment with reduced-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is effective in mild to moderate Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with hematologic malignancies [^116ks9C7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Recent studies have reported that reduced-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) may be effective in the treatment of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), but data are lacking for patients with hematologic malignancies.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study included all adult hematologic patients with PJP between 2013 and 2017 at six Swedish university hospitals. Treatment with 7.5–15 mg TMP/kg/day (reduced dose) was compared with > 15–20 mg TMP/kg/day (standard dose), after correction for renal function. The primary outcome was the change in respiratory function (Δpartial pressure of oxygen [PaO₂]/fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO₂]) between baseline and day 8. Secondary outcomes were clinical failure and/or death at day 8 and death at day 30.

- **Results**: Of a total of 113 included patients, 80 received the reduced dose and 33 received the standard dose. The overall 30-day mortality in the whole cohort was 14%. There were no clinically relevant differences in ΔPaO₂/FiO₂ at day 8 between the treatment groups, either before or after controlling for potential confounders in an adjusted regression model (-13.6 mm Hg [95% confidence interval {CI}, -56.7 to 29.5 mm Hg] and -9.4 mm Hg [95% CI, -50.5 to 31.7 mm Hg], respectively). Clinical failure and/or death at day 8 and 30-day mortality did not differ significantly between the groups (18% vs. 21% and 14% vs. 15%, respectively). Among patients with mild to moderate pneumonia, defined as PaO₂/FiO₂ > 200 mm Hg, all 44 patients receiving the reduced dose were alive at day 30.

- **Conclusions**: This study suggests that in this cohort of 113 patients, reduced-dose TMP-SMX was as effective as the standard dose for the treatment of mild to moderate Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with hematologic malignancies, without increasing mortality or clinical failure rates.

### Imcivree [^114p4d53]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Recommended dosage in patients with end stage renal disease**: IMCIVREE is not recommended for use in patients with end stage renal disease (eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m²).

- **Recommended dosage in patients with severe renal impairment**: For adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] of 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m²), the recommended starting dosage is 0.5 mg (0.05 mL) injected subcutaneously once daily for 2 weeks. The recommended target dosage is 1.5 mg (0.15 mL) injected subcutaneously once daily [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Monitor patients for GI adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

	If the recommended starting dosage is tolerated for 2 weeks, increase the dosage to 1 mg (0.1 mL) once daily. If the 1 mg daily dosage is tolerated for at least 1 week, increase the dosage to 1.5 mg (0.15 mL) once daily. If not tolerated, discontinue IMCIVREE. The use of IMCIVREE in pediatric patients 6 to less than 12 years of age with severe renal impairment is not recommended [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

- **Recommended dosage in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment**: The recommended dosage in patients with mild renal impairment (eGFR of 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m²) or moderate renal impairment (eGFR of 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m²) is the same as in those with normal kidney function [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)].

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and the risk of a hospital encounter with hyperkalemia: a matched population-based cohort study [^116C7QHU]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) can cause hyperkalemia by reducing renal potassium excretion. We assessed the risk of hyperkalemia after initiating TMP-SMX versus amoxicillin and determined if this risk is modified by a patient's baseline kidney function [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)].

- **Methods**: We conducted a population-based cohort study in Ontario, Canada, involving adults ≥ 66 years of age newly treated with TMP-SMX (n = 58,999), matched 1:1 with those newly treated with amoxicillin (2008–2020). The primary outcome was a hospital encounter with hyperkalemia, defined by a laboratory serum potassium value ≥ 5.5 mmol/L within 14 days of antibiotic treatment. Secondary outcomes included a hospital encounter with acute kidney injury (AKI) and all-cause hospitalization. Risk ratios (RRs) were obtained using a modified Poisson regression.

- **Results**: A hospital encounter with hyperkalemia occurred in 269/58,999 (0.46%) patients treated with TMP-SMX versus 80/58,999 (0.14%) in those treated with amoxicillin [RR 3.36 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.62–4.31)]. The absolute risk of hyperkalemia in patients treated with TMP-SMX versus amoxicillin increased progressively with decreasing eGFR (risk difference of 0.12% for an eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m², 0.42% for eGFR 45–59, 0.85% for eGFR 30–44, and 1.45% for eGFR < 30; additive interaction P < .001). TMP-SMX versus amoxicillin was associated with a higher risk of a hospital encounter with AKI [RR 3.15 (95% CI 2.82–3.51)] and all-cause hospitalization [RR 1.43 (95% CI 1.34–1.53)].

- **Conclusions**: The 14-day risk of hyperkalemia after initiating TMP-SMX was notably higher in comparison to amoxicillin, especially with decreased eGFR. This suggests increased risk among those with impaired kidney function.

### Bactrim [^112saqk2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Advise patients on the potential for hypersensitivity and other serious or fatal reactions. They should discontinue BACTRIM immediately if they experience clinical signs such as rash, pharyngitis, fever, arthralgia, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, pallor, purpura, or jaundice and contact their healthcare provider as soon as possible.

- **Antibacterial resistance**: Counsel patients that antibacterial drugs, including BACTRIM (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets, should only be used to treat bacterial infections and not viral infections like the common cold. If BACTRIM is prescribed for a bacterial infection, emphasize that patients must take the medication exactly as directed. Failing to complete the full course may decrease treatment effectiveness and increase the likelihood of bacterial resistance, rendering BACTRIM and other antibacterial drugs ineffective in the future.

- **Crystalluria and stone formation**: Advise patients to maintain adequate fluid intake to prevent crystalluria and stone formation.

- **Diarrhea**: Inform patients that diarrhea is a common side effect caused by antibiotics, which usually resolves after discontinuation. However, they should be aware that watery and bloody stools can sometimes develop after starting antibiotic treatment, with or without stomach discomfort.

### Dosing errors in prescribed antibiotics for older persons with CKD: a retrospective time series analysis [^112uyVto]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Prescribing excessive doses of oral antibiotics is a common issue in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and contributes to more than one-third of preventable adverse drug events in this population. To improve patient care, many ambulatory laboratories now report estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). We sought to describe the rate of ambulatory antibiotic dosing errors in CKD and examine the impact of eGFR reporting on these errors.

- **Study design**: Population-based retrospective time series analysis.

- **Setting & participants**: Southwestern Ontario, Canada, from January 2003 to April 2010. Participants were ambulatory patients aged 66 years or older with CKD stages 4 or 5 (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) who were not receiving dialysis.

- **Predictor**: Introduction of eGFR reporting in ambulatory laboratories (January 2006).

- **Outcome**: Antibiotic dosing errors.

- **Measurements**: Using linked health care databases, we assessed the monthly rate of excess dosing of orally prescribed antibiotics that require dose adjustment in CKD. We compared this rate before and after the implementation of eGFR reporting.

Results showed that 1,464 prescriptions were filled for study antibiotics throughout the study period. Prior to eGFR reporting, the average rate of antibiotic prescriptions dosed in excess of guidelines was 64 per 100 antibiotic prescriptions. The introduction of eGFR reporting had no impact on this rate (68 per 100 antibiotic prescriptions; P = 0.9). Notably, nitrofurantoin, which is contraindicated in patients with CKD, was prescribed 169 times throughout the study period.

### Renal association commentary on the KDIGO (2017) clinical practice guideline update for the diagnosis, evaluation, prevention, and treatment of CKD-MBD [^115Evcnz]. BMC Nephrology (2018). High credibility.

The strength of this guideline recommendation has been upgraded from a 2D to a 2C based on two randomized controlled trials published after the original document in 2009. The first study by Spasovski et al. examined the effects of two different dialysate calcium concentrations in patients with adynamic bone disease. A lower dialysate calcium (1.25 mmol) was found to improve bone and mineral parameters compared with the higher concentration of 1.75 mmol.

The second study by Ok et al. demonstrated that lowering dialysate calcium levels slowed the progression of coronary arterial calcification and improved biopsy-proven bone turnover; low bone turnover decreased from 85.0% to 41.8% in their studied cohort of patients on HD. Neither study had a comparator group using a 1.5 mmol/L calcium concentration, leaving open the possibility that lower levels of dialysate calcium (> 1.25 mmol/L but < 1.75 mmol/L) would be equally beneficial.

It is worth noting observations from a retrospective cohort study by Brunelli et al. published in 2015. This study raised some safety concerns with the default use of lower dialysate calcium concentrations (< 1.25 mmol/L), which were associated with heart failure events and hypotension. These findings underpin the original 2009 KDIGO Guidelines, which pointed out that a low dialysate calcium concentration may predispose patients to cardiac arrhythmias and intradialytic hypotension. Similarly, higher dialysate calcium concentrations of 1.75 mmol/L are associated with an increased risk for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular or infection-related hospitalization in incident HD patients.

### Population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole: Dosage optimization for patients with renal insufficiency or receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^115L8NWi]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). High credibility.

The goal of the study was to describe the population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole in hospitalized patients. Furthermore, this study used the model to optimize dosing regimens of cotrimoxazole for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and in patients with renal insufficiency or with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). This was a retrospective multicenter observational cohort study based on therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) data from hospitalized patients treated with cotrimoxazole.

Two population pharmacokinetic (POPPK) models were developed: a model of trimethoprim and an integrated model with both sulfamethoxazole and N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole concentrations. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to determine the optimal dosing regimen. A total of 348 measurements from 168 patients were available. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and CRRT were included as covariates on the clearance of all three compounds.

- **Dosing recommendations**: Cotrimoxazole TID 1,920 mg and b.i.d. 2,400 mg led to sufficient exposure for infections with P. jirovecii in patients without renal insufficiency. To reach equivalent exposure, a dose reduction of 33.3% is needed in patients with an eGFR of 10 mL/minute/1.73 m² and of 16.7% for an eGFR of 30 mL/minute/1.73 m².

- **Drug accumulation and clearance**: N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole accumulates in patients with a reduced eGFR. CRRT increased the clearance of sulfamethoxazole, but not trimethoprim or N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole, compared with the median clearance in the population. Doubling the sulfamethoxazole dose is needed for patients on CRRT.

### Population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole: Dosage optimization for patients with renal insufficiency or receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^112xFTRF]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

eGFR and CRRT were included as covariates in both models. As expected, it was observed that the inclusion of eGFR had a more significant impact on the clearance of N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole compared with sulfamethoxazole. The primary clearance route for sulfamethoxazole is liver metabolism, with less than 30% being recovered unchanged in urine. In contrast, N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole is mainly cleared renally, leading to its accumulation in patients with reduced eGFR. For trimethoprim, the association between eGFR and clearance was also as expected, since the primary elimination route is renal clearance, with only a small percentage of metabolism or biliary excretion.

The final model was used to generate dose recommendations for PCP and dose reductions in case of renal insufficiency. A starting dose of TID 1,920 mg or b.i.d. 2,400 mg for PCP will result in sufficient exposure in the majority of patients. TID 1,920 mg has a larger risk of concentrations above the target range, while b.i.d. 2,400 mg has a larger risk of underexposure. Because of the large IIV, TDM should be considered to improve the percentage of patients within the target range. Patients with an eGFR of 30 mL/minute/1.73 m² require a dose reduction of 16.7%, and patients with an eGFR of 10 mL/minute/1.73 m² a dose reduction of 33.3% to reach similar exposure to patients without renal insufficiency. The risk of concentrations above the target range increases with doses in patients with a low eGFR. Therefore, for infections requiring high‐dose cotrimoxazole like PCP or infections caused by Nocardia spp.
