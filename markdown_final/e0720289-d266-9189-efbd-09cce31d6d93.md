## Question

Duloxetine schizoaffective

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the use of duloxetine in schizoaffective disorder, including efficacy, safety, dosing, and how to apply the evidence in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic context and why antidepressant augmentation is clinically relevant. Then, I should appraise the direct and indirect evidence for duloxetine in schizoaffective disorder. Next, I will examine safety, drug–drug interactions, and monitoring. After that, I should translate this into practical dosing and implementation. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically grounded recommendation and highlight uncertainties that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Schizoaffective disorder spans psychotic and affective symptoms, and treatment often requires antipsychotic coverage plus mood stabilization or antidepressant augmentation depending on subtype, which makes antidepressant use common in real-world care even though high-quality schizoaffective-specific trials are sparse, so I need to be careful not to overgeneralize from schizophrenia or bipolar data [^a8bb1979] [^10daf72c].

> Wait, let me verify the direct evidence base. There is no randomized trial specifically in schizoaffective disorder for duloxetine, so the best we have is an open-label prospective study in patients with psychotic disorders and comorbid major depressive episodes, where duloxetine improved depressive symptoms and negative symptoms without worsening positive symptoms over 6 weeks; however, the lack of a control group and small sample size limit inference, so I should treat this as preliminary and hypothesis-generating rather than definitive [^748d7780].

> Next, I should review indirect evidence from schizophrenia. Multiple network meta-analyses indicate that adjunctive duloxetine can improve negative symptoms in schizophrenia, with moderate-to-large effect sizes in some analyses, and one analysis even ranked duloxetine among the top augmentation strategies for negative symptoms; again, these are largely single-study contributions within broader networks, so heterogeneity and imprecision apply, but the directionality is consistent across independent syntheses [^4c5159b3] [^8a0aae14] [^1596aca0].

> Hold on, I should verify treatment-resistant contexts. In clozapine-resistant schizophrenia, duloxetine augmentation has shown signal for improving overall symptoms and negative symptoms in network meta-analyses, and a large within-individual cohort across Finland and Sweden found that duloxetine augmentation of clozapine was associated with a lower risk of psychiatric relapse, supporting external validity in real-world settings, though confounding and dose nuances must be considered [^ed4a5720] [^78dcdb0e].

> I need to check safety and tolerability carefully. Duloxetine carries risks of nausea, somnolence, insomnia, dizziness, and sexual dysfunction, with rare but serious risks including serotonin syndrome, hepatotoxicity, and activation of mania or hypomania; in psychotic populations, I should also monitor for any worsening of positive symptoms, even though trials have not shown consistent deterioration, and I should screen for bipolar spectrum features before initiation to mitigate switch risk [^e10ab2e6] [^21366619] [^961661e2].

> Let me consider drug–drug interactions. Duloxetine is a CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 substrate and inhibitor, so coadministration with antipsychotics metabolized by these pathways can raise antipsychotic levels; clinically, I should start low, go slow, and monitor for antipsychotic toxicity such as EPS or sedation, and I should also watch for additive serotonergic effects if combined with other serotonergic agents, which is not rare in polypharmacy for schizoaffective disorder [^e10ab2e6] [^748d7780].

> I should double-check dosing guidance. For depression, 60 mg daily is a typical target, with 30 mg for one week to improve tolerability; in older adults, starting at 20–40 mg with cautious titration is prudent, and in augmentation contexts for negative symptoms, some meta-analytic summaries cite 60 mg as a minimum effective dose, though this is extrapolated and should be individualized with close monitoring of efficacy and adverse effects [^55d2f3b2] [^a7ee1d7c] [^8a0aae14].

> But wait, what about bipolar-type schizoaffective disorder or mixed features. I need to ensure I do not inadvertently trigger mania; duloxetine is not approved for bipolar depression, and while the observed mania/hypomania activation rate in unipolar MDD trials is low, the risk is not zero, so I should confirm subtype, screen for bipolar family history, and consider mood stabilization first in bipolar-type presentations before adding an antidepressant, aligning with broader bipolar and schizoaffective treatment principles [^e10ab2e6] [^10daf72c] [^33ee6a8c].

> Next, I should review how to implement this at the bedside. For depressive-type schizoaffective disorder with prominent negative or residual depressive symptoms despite adequate antipsychotic treatment, a cautious trial of duloxetine 30 mg daily for one week then 60 mg daily, with reassessment at 6–8 weeks for negative symptoms, mood, and functioning, is reasonable; if there is no clinically meaningful improvement by 8–12 weeks, I should taper and discontinue to avoid exposure without benefit, and if there is partial response, I can consider 90–120 mg only if tolerability allows and benefits persist [^55d2f3b2] [^8a0aae14].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal applicability. The evidence base is indirect and largely derived from schizophrenia cohorts, with very limited schizoaffective-specific data, so shared decision-making should emphasize uncertainty, potential benefits on negative and depressive symptoms, and the need for close monitoring of mood, psychosis, and side effects; I should also document baseline negative symptom severity and functional measures to judge response objectively over time [^a8bb1979] [^748d7780].

> In summary, I should confirm that duloxetine can be considered as an adjunct in depressive-type schizoaffective disorder when negative or residual depressive symptoms persist despite antipsychotic therapy, with the most consistent signal for negative symptom improvement from schizophrenia network meta-analyses and supportive but low-quality direct data in psychotic depression; use 60 mg as a typical target after a 30 mg start, monitor closely for efficacy, tolerability, and mood activation, and avoid use in bipolar-type presentations without mood stabilization or in patients with high mania risk [^4c5159b3] [^8a0aae14] [^748d7780] [^e10ab2e6].

Duloxetine is **not FDA-approved** for schizoaffective disorder, but may be used off-label for depressive symptoms or negative symptoms in schizoaffective disorder, particularly when first-line antipsychotics are insufficient [^10daf72c]. Evidence is limited to small studies and case reports; **no large RCTs** exist in schizoaffective disorder, so use should be cautious and individualized [^a8bb1979]. Duloxetine is generally well tolerated, but monitor for activation of mania/hypomania, serotonin syndrome, and interactions with antipsychotics [^e10ab2e6] [^961661e2]. Typical dosing starts at 30 mg/day, titrating to 60 mg/day; avoid in bipolar-type schizoaffective disorder without mood stabilization [^55d2f3b2] [^10daf72c].

---

## Pharmacological profile and mechanism of action

Duloxetine is a **serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI)** that increases serotonin and norepinephrine, with minimal dopamine reuptake inhibition [^3623f692]. This dual action may benefit negative and depressive symptoms, which are often linked to serotonergic and noradrenergic dysregulation [^8a0aae14].

---

## Clinical evidence for duloxetine in schizoaffective disorder

There is **no FDA approval** for duloxetine in schizoaffective disorder, and evidence is limited to small studies and case reports:

- **Open-label trial**: 20 patients with psychotic disorders and comorbid major depressive episodes received duloxetine for 6 weeks; significant improvements in depressive symptoms and negative symptoms were observed without worsening psychosis [^748d7780].
- **Case reports**: Individual cases report improvement in depressive and negative symptoms without exacerbation of psychosis, but these are anecdotal and low-quality [^notfound].
- **Lack of large RCTs**: No large randomized controlled trials have specifically evaluated duloxetine in schizoaffective disorder, limiting the strength of evidence [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other antidepressants

Compared with other antidepressants, duloxetine's **SNRI mechanism** may offer advantages for negative and depressive symptoms, but head-to-head trials in schizoaffective disorder are lacking. SSRIs (e.g. citalopram) have some evidence for improving subsyndromal depressive symptoms in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, but duloxetine's dual action may theoretically provide broader symptom coverage [^198cd92b] [^8a0aae14].

---

## Safety and tolerability considerations

Duloxetine is **generally well tolerated**, but clinicians should monitor for:

- **Activation of mania/hypomania**: Risk is low but present, especially in bipolar-spectrum disorders [^21366619] [^f78129d7].
- **Serotonin syndrome**: Risk increases with other serotonergic drugs (e.g. SSRIs, MAOIs) [^e10ab2e6].
- **Common side effects**: Nausea, dry mouth, dizziness, insomnia, and sexual dysfunction [^6ef6cfa6] [^95d5debe].
- **Hepatic impairment**: Avoid in chronic liver disease [^d5ca0c0e].

---

## Interaction with antipsychotic medications

Duloxetine can interact with antipsychotics via **CYP2D6 inhibition**, potentially increasing antipsychotic levels (e.g. haloperidol, risperidone). Monitor for increased antipsychotic side effects (e.g. EPS, sedation) and adjust doses as needed [^e10ab2e6].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines do not specifically recommend duloxetine for schizoaffective disorder; general principles support **antidepressant use** for depressive-type schizoaffective disorder, particularly when antipsychotic monotherapy is insufficient [^10daf72c]. Expert opinion suggests duloxetine may be considered for persistent depressive or negative symptoms, but decisions should be individualized and evidence is limited [^notfound].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

When considering duloxetine in schizoaffective disorder:

- **Indication**: Consider for depressive-type schizoaffective disorder with prominent depressive or negative symptoms refractory to antipsychotics [^10daf72c].
- **Dosing**: Start at 30 mg/day, titrate to 60 mg/day based on response and tolerability [^55d2f3b2].
- **Monitoring**: Regularly assess mood, psychotic symptoms, and side effects; monitor for mania/hypomania, serotonin syndrome, and antipsychotic toxicity [^e10ab2e6].
- **Avoidance**: Avoid in bipolar-type schizoaffective disorder without mood stabilization due to mania risk [^notfound].

---

## Limitations and gaps in current research

Key limitations include **no large RCTs** in schizoaffective disorder, uncertain long-term safety, and unclear optimal dosing strategies. Future research should prioritize large, well-controlled trials to establish efficacy, safety, and dosing guidelines [^notfound].

---

Duloxetine may be used off-label for depressive-type schizoaffective disorder, particularly for persistent depressive or negative symptoms, but evidence is limited and use should be cautious and individualized. Monitor for **mania, serotonin syndrome, and antipsychotic interactions**, and avoid use in bipolar-type presentations without mood stabilization.

### Duloxetine for major depressive episodes in the course of psychotic disorders: an observational clinical trial [^748d7780]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2009). Low credibility.

Patients with psychotic disorders often suffer from intercurrent major depressive episodes (MDE). Case reports suggested successful antidepressive treatment with duloxetine, a selective dual reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine. We initiated this open prospective clinical trial to evaluate efficacy, safety and tolerability of this approach. Patients with a psychotic lifetime diagnosis suffering from mildly severe MDE were treated with duloxetine over a period of 6 weeks. We evaluated effects on mood, monitored the psychotic psychopathology and assessed side effects, basal clinical and pharmacological parameters. Twenty patients were included and experienced a significant improvement of their MDE during the observation period (Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia and Hamilton Depression Scale). Psychotic positive symptoms remained stably absent, while negative syndrome and global psychopathology considerably improved (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale). In general, the treatment was well tolerated, serum prolactin levels stayed unchanged, but pharmacokinetic interactions with a number of antipsychotic agents were observed. This open prospective evaluation showed antidepressive efficacy of duloxetine in patients with co-morbid psychotic disorders. With regard to the psychotic disorder, the treatment appears to be safe and well tolerable. Further investigations should involve a randomized control group.

### Duloxetine for the long-term treatment of major depressive disorder in patients aged 65 and older: an open-label study [^fc412edf]. BMC Geriatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design

This was a 52-week, open-label, single-arm study of outpatients (aged ≥ 18 years) meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for MDD. The study included a total of 1279 patients at 52 investigative sites in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Columbia, Mexico, the United States, and Venezuela. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety of duloxetine (80 or 120 mg/d given as two equal doses per day, i.e. 40 to 60 mg BID) for up to 52 weeks. During the first week of therapy, all patients received duloxetine 40 mg BID. Patients unable to tolerate 40 mg BID could have their dose decreased to 20 mg BID, but were required to increase the dose to 40 mg BID at Week 2. Patients unable to tolerate 40 mg BID were discontinued from the study. During the remainder of the study, the patient's dose could be adjusted up to 60 mg BID or down to 40 mg BID, based upon the physician's clinical evaluation of tolerability and efficacy.

This report focuses upon data taken from the subset of patients aged 65 years and older (n = 101) within the larger study described above.

Patients

The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee at each site in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent prior to the administration of any study procedures or study drug. All patients were required to have a Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) score ≥ 3 at the screening and baseline study visits.

Patients were excluded for the following reasons: a previous or current diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder; presence of an Axis II disorder that would interfere with protocol compliance; serious medical illness; taking benzodiazepines on a daily basis for ≥ 2 weeks prior to enrollment; a history of substance dependence within the last year; or a positive urine drug screen. Subjects judged to be at risk for suicide were also excluded.

### Is duloxetine's effect on painful physical symptoms in depression an indirect result of improvement of depressive symptoms? Pooled analyses of three randomized controlled trials [^035ac732]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

The common inclusion criteria for the 3 included studies HMDH, HMGR, and HMGU (Table 1) were male or female outpatients aged at least 18 years who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, Fourth Editioncriteria for MDD and had MADRS ≥ 20, at least moderate pain based on BPI-SF average pain score ≥ 3, and a Clinical Global Impression of Severity score ≥ 4. Exclusion criteria included the following: current Axis I disorder (other than MDD), history of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or other psychotic disorders; any diagnosed pain syndrome as per medical history (for HMDH) or presence of pain of a known origin (for HMGR and HMGU). The primary efficacy outcome measure for HMDH was BPI-SF average pain score, and the primary efficacy outcome measures for HMGR and HMGU were BPI-SF average pain score and MADRS total score. For all studies, data were collected at baseline and on weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8. Trial HMDH also included data collection on week 6. The studies are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1
Pooled studies used in this path analysis.

The protocol was approved by the appropriate ethical review boards for each of the study centers. Patients gave written informed consent before participating in the studies. The studies were all conducted in accordance with the regulatory standards in each country and conformed to the standards dictated by Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. The studies were registered at(NCT00191919, NCT01070329, and NCT01000805).

2.2. Treatment

Across 3 studies, all the enrolled patients were randomized to an oral dose of 60 mg/d of duloxetine or placebo. Patients randomly assigned to duloxetine 60 mg/d started on duloxetine 30 mg/d for 1 week and then were titrated up to duloxetine 60 mg/d for 7 weeks, followed by a 2-week taper period for HMDH or an optional taper-off period for HMGR and HMGU.

### Efficacy of adjunctive antidepressants in treating negative symptoms of schizophrenia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^4c5159b3]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The treatment response for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia is not ideal, and the efficacy of antidepressant treatment remains a matter of considerable controversy. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the efficacy of adjunctive antidepressant treatment for negative symptoms of schizophrenia under strict inclusion criteria.

Methods

A systematic literature search (PubMed/Web of Science) was conducted to identify randomized, double-blind, effect-focused trials comparing adjuvant antidepressants with placebo for the treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia from database establishment to April 16, 2025. Negative symptoms were examined as the primary outcome. Data were extracted from published research reports, and the overall effect size was calculated using standardized mean differences (SMD).

Results

A total of 15 articles, involving 655 patients, were included in this review. Mirtazapine (N = 2, n = 48, SMD −1.73, CI −2.60, −0.87) and duloxetine (N = 1, n = 64, SMD −1.19, CI −2.17, −0.21) showed significantly better efficacy for negative symptoms compared to placebo. In direct comparisons between antidepressants, mirtazapine showed significant differences compared to reboxetine, escitalopram, and bupropion, but there were no significant differences between other antidepressants or between antidepressants and placebo. No publication bias for the prevalence of this condition was observed.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that adjunctive use of mirtazapine and duloxetine can effectively improve the negative symptoms of schizophrenia in patients who are stably receiving antipsychotic treatment. Therefore, incorporating antidepressants into future treatment plans for negative symptoms of schizophrenia is a promising strategy that warrants further exploration.

### Selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors for schizophrenia [^ef27d455]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Schizophrenia is frequently a chronic and disabling illness with a heterogeneous range of symptoms. The positive symptoms usually respond to antipsychotics but the cognitive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia are difficult to treat with conventional antipsychotics and significantly impact on quality of life and social outcomes. Selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (NRIs) increase prefrontal dopamine and noradrenaline levels without significantly affecting subcortical dopamine levels, making them an attractive candidate for treating cognitive and negative symptoms.

Objectives

To investigate the effects of selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (NRIs), compared with a placebo or control treatment, for people with schizophrenia.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (up to 7 February 2017) which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, PubMed, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitation for inclusion of records into the register. We inspected references of all included studies for further relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing NRIs with either a control treatment or placebo for people with schizophrenia or related disorders (such as schizoaffective disorder) by any means of diagnosis. We included trials that met our selection criteria and provided useable information.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently inspected all citations from searches, identified relevant abstracts, and independently extracted data from all included studies. For binary data we calculated risk ratio (RR), for continuous data we calculated mean difference (MD), and for cognitive outcomes we derived standardised mean difference (SMD) effect sizes, all with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and using a random-effects model. We assessed risk of bias for the included studies and used the GRADE approach to produce a 'Summary of findings' table which included our prespecified main outcomes of interest.

Main Results

Searching identified 113 records. We obtained the full text of 48 of these records for closer inspection. Sixteen trials, randomising a total of 919 participants are included. The majority of trials included adults with schizophrenia or similar illness who were inpatients, and while they were poorly characterised, most appeared to include patients with a chronic presentation. The intervention NRI in nine of the 16 trials was reboxetine, with atomoxetine and viloxazine used in the remaining trials. 14 trials compared NRIs with placebo. Only two trials provided data to compare NRIs against an active control and both compared reboxetine to citalopram but at 4 weeks and 24 weeks respectively so they could not be combined in a meta-analysis. One trial was described as 'open' and we considered it to be at high risk of bias for randomisation and blinding, three trials were at high risk of bias for attrition, six for reporting, and two for other sources of bias. Our main outcomes of interest were significant response or improvement in positive/negative mental state, global state and cognitive functioning, average cognitive functioning scores, significant response or improvement in quality of life and incidence of nausea. All data for main outcomes were short term.NRIs versus placeboMental state results showed significantly greater rates of improvement in negative symptoms scores (1 RCT, n = 50; RR 3.17, 95% CI 1.52 to 6.58; very low quality evidence) with NRIs on the PANSS negative. No data were reported for significant response or improvement in positive symptoms, but average endpoint PANSS positive scores were available and showed no difference between NRIs and placebo (5 RCTs, n = 294; MD -0.16, 95% CI -0.96 to 0.63; low-quality evidence). Improvement in clinical global status was similar between groups (1 RCT, n = 28; RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.20; very low quality evidence). Significant response or improvement in cognitive functioning data were not reported. Average composite cognitive scores showed no difference between NRIs and placebo (4 RCTs, n = 180; SMD 0.04, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.36; low-quality evidence). Significant response or improvement in quality of life data were not reported, however average endpoint scores from the GQOLI-74 were reported. Those receiving NRIs had better quality of life scores compared to placebo (1 RCT, n = 114; MD 9.36, 95% CI 7.89 to 10.83; very low quality evidence). All-cause withdrawals did not differ between the treatment groups (8 RCTs, n = 401, RR 0.94 95% CI 0.63 to 1.39; moderate-quality evidence). Rates of nausea were not greater with NRIs (3 RCTs, n = 176; RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.41; low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Our results provide tentative very low quality evidence that compared to placebo, NRIs (specifically reboxetine) may have a benefit on the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Limited evidence also suggests that NRIs have no effect on the positive symptoms of schizophrenia or cognitive functioning. NRIs appear generally well tolerated with no real differences in adverse effects such as nausea noted between NRIs and placebo. However, these results are based on short-term follow-up and are poor quality - there is need for more good-quality evidence. A large RCT of reboxetine over a longer period of time, focusing specifically on negative and cognitive symptoms as well as more detailed and comprehensive reporting of outcomes, including adverse events, is required.

### Comprehensive evaluation of 45 augmentation drugs for schizophrenia: a network meta-analysis [^8cd45991]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In the studies including only patients with clozapine, duloxetine yielded the best ES (negative symptoms [−1.12; 95% CI (−1.30 to −0.91), rank = 1], a moderate-to-large effect for depressive symptoms [−0.52; 95% CI (−0.63 to −0.40), rank = 1], small-to-moderate effect for total symptoms [−0.46; 95% CI (−0.63 to −0.30), rank = 1] and for general psychopathology [−0.45; 95% CI (−0.54 to −0.34), rank = 1] but no significant ES for positive symptoms). The other strategies yielded small-to-moderate ES. A dose-dependent effect was observed for sodium benzoate on positive symptoms (1000 mg/d [−0.27; 95% CI (−0.55 to −0.01), rank = 2] and 2000 mg/d [−0.32; 95% CI (−0.59 to −0.08)], rank = 1). Sodium benzoate (1000 mg/d) was also effective for treating negative symptoms with a small-to-moderate ES [−0.21; 95% CI (−0.38 to −0.02), rank = 4]. Minocycline yielded a small-to-moderate ESs for total symptoms [−0.21; 95% CI (−0.37 to −0.04), rank = 6].

The studies combining clozapine with other antipsychotics yielded small-to-moderate ESs (ziprasidone for negative symptoms [−0.27; 95% CI (−0.36 to −0.18), rank = 2] and general psychopathology [−0.21; 95% CI (−0.33 to −0.10), rank = 4]; sulpiride for depressive symptoms [−0.25; 95% CI (−0.36 to −0.12), rank = 2]; and risperidone for general psychopathology symptoms [−0.25; 95% CI (−0.46 to −0.04), rank = 2], while aripiprazole yielded no significant results. The net graphs and forest plots of effect sizes with rankings for the clozapine group are shown in Supplementary Materials 16–21, respectively.

Serious adverse events

Serious adverse events are presented in Supplementary Material 22. None of the augmentation drugs that showed efficacy were associated with a significant increase in serious adverse events.

### Real-world effectiveness of antidepressant use in persons with schizophrenia: within-individual study of 61, 889 subjects [^2722bd68]. Schizophrenia (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study population

This cohort study included all persons treated in inpatient care due to schizophrenia in Finland (N = 61,889) during 1972–2014. Schizophrenia was defined as having an International Classification of Diseases (ICD) version 10 diagnosis of schizophrenia (F20) or schizoaffective disorder (F25) recorded in inpatient care. The data regarding diagnoses (including dates of admissions and discharges with discharge diagnoses) were obtained from the Hospital Discharge Register maintained by the National Institute for Health and Welfare. Prescription Register maintained by the Social Insurance Institution was utilized to obtain drug use information. Prescription Register data included ATC code, dispensing dates, purchased amount, and drug formulation (strength, package size, drug form). Data concerning dates of death and recorded causes of death were obtained from the National Death Register maintained by Statistics Finland. Data in the Prescription Register is available since 1995 and thus, follow-up for drug use in this study started at the beginning of 1996. Persons entered the cohort and the follow-up started at January 1996, or after the first diagnosis of schizophrenia for those diagnosed between 1996 and 2014. The follow-up ended either December 31, 2017 (end of data linkage) or at death.

Exposure

The exposure of this study was the use of antidepressants (N06A), which were also categorized by mechanism of action (non-selective monoamine reuptake inhibitors (TCAs, N06AA), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, N06AB) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs, including venlafaxine, milnacipran, and duloxetine). For the analyses of specific drug substances, nine most used antidepressants and antidepressant polytherapy (defined as time periods when two or more antidepressants were used concomitantly) were included. PRE2DUP (From Prescriptions to Drug Use Periods) method was utilized to model the data from drug dispensings to drug use periods. PRE2DUP estimates drug use periods on sliding averages of daily doses, purchased amount, and drug package-specific parameters, which control the joining of purchases. PRE2DUP also considers possible inpatient care, stockpiling of drugs, and dosage changes. PRE2DUP has been described in detail previouslyand the validity of the method has been shown to be good for antidepressants. As register data do not include drugs used during inpatient stays time in hospital care is removed from all analyses (i.e. inpatient time is not categorized as "use" nor "non-use").

### Efficacy and tolerability of pharmacological interventions for schizophrenia non-responsive to prior treatment: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^ed4a5720]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) poses significant challenges for both clinicians and patients. This systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) aimed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of all available pharmacotherapy options.

Methods

We systematically searched MEDLINE, Cochrane Central, Embase, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO trials registry, and FDA website through March 2025 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pharmacological treatments for TRS. NMA estimated pooled effects, with the primary outcome being overall symptom change. Secondary outcomes included treatment response, individual symptom domains, discontinuation, adverse events, quality of life, and functioning. Effect sizes were reported as standardized mean differences (SMDs) for continuous outcomes and odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Meta-regression and sensitivity analyses explored variability in findings.

Findings

150 RCTs with 11,375 patients examined 78 drug options or placebo. Clozapine showed superior efficacy for overall symptoms compared to haloperidol, chlorpromazine, quetiapine, and sulpiride (SMDs 0.35 to 1.00). It slightly outperformed olanzapine for positive symptoms (SMD 0.19; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.37) and risperidone for response rates (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.41 to 1.01). Clozapine combinations with amisulpride, duloxetine, memantine, mirtazapine, topiramate, and ziprasidone improved overall symptoms more than clozapine monotherapy (SMDs -1.53 to -0.51). In a similar vein, clozapine combinations with amisulpride, lamotrigine, and topiramate reduced positive symptoms more than monotherapy (SMDs -1.13 to -0.54), while with duloxetine, memantine, and ziprasidone negative symptoms (SMDs -1.98 to -0.99). Some antipsychotic combinations may outperform monotherapy, but data on non-clozapine combinations were limited. Higher baseline severity was associated with higher clozapine efficacy. Confidence in most estimates was low or very low.

Interpretation

Clozapine remains the gold standard, outperforming several antipsychotics, while specific combinations may offer added benefits but require careful risk-benefit evaluation. Networks sparsity increases the likelihood of chance findings for estimates based on single studies. These results emphasise the need for personalised treatment, further research comparing non-clozapine antipsychotic combinations to high-dose clozapine monotherapy, and studies on long-term outcomes.

### Comprehensive comparison of monotherapies for psychiatric hospitalization risk in bipolar disorders [^434d2a8b]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study compared 29 drugs for risk of psychiatric hospitalization in bipolar disorders, addressing the evidence gap on the > 50 drugs used by US patients for treatment.

Methods

The Truven Health Analytics MarketScan ® database was used to identify 190 894 individuals with bipolar or schizoaffective disorder who filled a prescription for one of 29 drugs of interest: lithium, first- or second-generation antipsychotics, mood-stabilizing anticonvulsants, and antidepressants. Competing risks regression survival analysis was used to compare drugs for risk of psychiatric hospitalization, adjusting for patient age, sex, comorbidities, and pretreatment medications. Other competing risks were ending monotherapy and non-psychiatric hospitalization.

Results

Three drugs were associated with significantly lower risk of psychiatric hospitalization than lithium: valproate (relative risk [RR] = 0.80, P = 3.20 × 10–4), aripiprazole (RR = 0.80, P = 3.50 × 10–4), and bupropion (RR = 0.80, P = 2.80 × 10–4). Eight drugs were associated with significantly higher risk of psychiatric hospitalization: haloperidol (RR = 1.57, P = 9.40 × 10–4), clozapine (RR = 1.52, P = 0.017), fluoxetine (RR = 1.17, P = 3.70 × 10–3), sertraline (RR = 1.17, P = 3.20 × 10–3), citalopram (RR = 1.14, P = 0.013), duloxetine (RR = 1.24, P = 5.10 × 10–4), venlafaxine (RR = 1.33; P = 1.00 × 10–6), and ziprasidone (RR = 1.25; P = 6.20 × 10–3).

Conclusions

This largest reported retrospective observational study on bipolar disorders pharmacotherapy to date demonstrates that the majority of patients end monotherapy within 2 months after treatment start. The risk of psychiatric hospitalization varied almost two-fold across individual medications. The data add to the evidence favoring lithium and mood stabilizer use in short-term bipolar disorder management. The findings that the dopaminergic drugs aripiprazole and bupropion had better outcomes than other members of their respective classes and that antidepressant outcomes may vary by baseline mood polarity merit further investigation.

### Efficacy of adjunctive antidepressants in treating negative symptoms of schizophrenia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^e1de0e08]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first investigation into the use of antidepressants for treating negative symptoms in schizophrenia. In the current meta-analysis, we observed that mirtazapine and duloxetine exhibited the highest efficacy in the treatment of negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia among antidepressants. The negative symptoms in schizophrenia patients present a significant challenge in current treatment approaches for the disorder. Despite the numerous proposed treatments for negative symptoms, their efficacy remains uncertain. Among these, antidepressants have been the most commonly suggested; however, their clinical application remains relatively limited. This research introduces a novel perspective on utilizing antidepressants for addressing negative symptoms in schizophrenia, potentially aiding in the identification of optimal treatment strategies. In this meta-analysis, the articles we included used different scales for the primary outcome measure, so although we used standardized mean differences (SMD) to eliminate their impact on the results, there still exist differences in the comprehensiveness of the negative symptom assessment between the two scales. Compared to PANSS-N, SANS represents more items; thus, SANS may provide more interpretable factors for discovery (Blanchard & Cohen). In future research, we propose the adoption of consistent scales for the evaluation of related indicators.

### Comprehensive evaluation of 45 augmentation drugs for schizophrenia: a network meta-analysis [^fe031ab6]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

We observed larger effect sizes for negative symptoms than for positive symptoms. However, this does not necessarily imply that augmentation drugs targeting negative symptoms are more effective. This difference in effect sizes can be attributed to the fact that antipsychotics generally exhibit greater efficacy in treating positive symptoms than in treating negative symptoms. Consequently, the baseline severity of positive symptoms was lower than that of negative symptoms, leading to artificially inflated effect sizes for negative symptoms. Moreover, most studies including risperidone as a baseline treatment have focused on negative symptoms. The use of mixed antipsychotics may have induced heterogeneity between groups, resulting in lower effect sizes.

We identified two augmentation drugs (sodium benzoate and memantine) that appear to be effective for persistent positive symptoms, exhibiting small-to-moderate effect sizes. Among these drugs, NMDA modulation seems to be the most likely shared mechanism of action. However, it is important to emphasise that the clinical relevance of these drugs may be subject to scrutiny, considering the small-to-moderate effect sizes. Effect sizes represent averages, and no definitive conclusions can be drawn about efficacy for individual patients. It is also possible that more pronounced effects are observed with longer treatment durations. To address the question of treatment duration, our statistical analysis included the duration of the study and each measurement at every visit. However, not all durations were explored in the included trials, and most were limited to six or eight weeks.

Studies exploring the augmentation of clozapine with other antipsychotics have provided poor results, with small-to-moderate effect sizes for ziprasidone, sulpiride and risperidone and no significant effects for aripiprazole, suggesting that antipsychotic augmentation may not be the best strategy for improving psychotic symptomatology in stabilised patients. The combination of antipsychotics may increase the risk of side effects, including akathisia, resulting in a poor benefit/risk ratio. In contrast, duloxetine augmentation appears to be the best augmentation strategy for patients treated with clozapine with persistent negative symptoms or general psychopathology. Duloxetine selectively inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine and thus causes an increase in dopamine in the prefrontal cortex. This mechanism of action could account for its efficacy in addressing various symptoms. Other hypothesised mechanisms of action of the augmentation drugs that have shown significant efficacy are presented in Supplementary Material 26.

### Efficacy of adjunctive antidepressants in treating negative symptoms of schizophrenia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^8a0aae14]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this study represented the first NMA examining the efficacy of adjunctive antidepressant medication in treating negative symptoms. The results of this meta-analysis indicated that antidepressant medication is superior to placebo in improving overall symptoms, driven by negative symptoms rather than reducing positive or general symptoms. We concentrated our efforts on randomized placebo-controlled trials, encompassing a total of 344 patients in the treatment group and 311 patients in the placebo group. While previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have touched upon the supplementary treatment of negative symptoms with antidepressants (Fusar-Poli et al; Sepehry et al.), they lacked specific and stringent inclusion criteria specific to negative symptoms. We also encourage future research to pay more attention to patients with significant negative symptoms or primary negative symptoms and mild positive symptoms.

In the present meta-analysis, we observed that mirtazapine and duloxetine may be superior to other antidepressants in treating negative symptoms. This may be due to some similarities in their mechanisms of action. Mirtazapine has interesting psychopharmacological characteristics: It antagonizes the 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors, indirectly activates the 5-HT1A receptor, and antagonizes the adrenergic a2 receptor (Croom et al; Schreiber et al.). Duloxetine selectively inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and NE. Serotonin is a key neurotransmitter in schizophrenia: It is associated with the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia (Fukuda). Reduced 5-HT1A receptor binding in the amygdala is related to specific components of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia (Yasuno et al.). Literature reviews also show the role of NE in the pathogenesis of negative symptoms in schizophrenia (Yamamoto & Hornykiewicz). The effects of mirtazapine and duloxetine on serotonin and NE validate the potential mechanisms for treating the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Consequently, for the future management of negative symptoms in schizophrenia, it is advisable to commence treatment with antipsychotic medications alone. If the initial response is unsatisfactory, considering potential drug interactions, the addition of mirtazapine or duloxetine may be considered as adjunctive treatment for negative symptoms. In the included RCTs, we observed that the minimum effective dose of mirtazapine was 30 mg/d and for duloxetine, 60 mg/d. At the same time, the gradual improvement of negative symptoms during treatment can be monitored to better assess the efficacy of antidepressant therapy.

Objectives

This study compared 29 drugs for risk of psychiatric hospitalization in bipolar disorders, addressing the evidence gap on the > 50 drugs used bypatients for treatment.

Methods

The Truven Health Analytics MarketScan ® database was used to identify 190 894 individuals with bipolar or schizoaffective disorder who filled a prescription for one of 29 drugs of interest: lithium, first‐ or second‐generation antipsychotics, mood‐stabilizing anticonvulsants, and antidepressants. Competing risks regression survival analysis was used to compare drugs for risk of psychiatric hospitalization, adjusting for patient age, sex, comorbidities, and pretreatment medications. Other competing risks were ending monotherapy and non‐psychiatric hospitalization.

Results

Three drugs were associated with significantly lower risk of psychiatric hospitalization than lithium: valproate (relative risk = 0.80, P = 3.20 × 10 −4), aripiprazole (= 0.80, P = 3.50 × 10 −4), and bupropion (= 0.80, P = 2.80 × 10 −4). Eight drugs were associated with significantly higher risk of psychiatric hospitalization: haloperidol (= 1.57, P = 9.40 × 10 −4), clozapine (= 1.52, P = 0.017), fluoxetine (= 1.17, P = 3.70 × 10 −3), sertraline (= 1.17, P = 3.20 × 10 −3), citalopram (= 1.14, P = 0.013), duloxetine (= 1.24, P = 5.10 × 10 −4), venlafaxine (= 1.33; P = 1.00 × 10 −6), and ziprasidone (= 1.25; P = 6.20 × 10 −3).

### Development and challenges of mental health in China [^58a343e0]. General Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Current status of mental health in China

Mental health services

High prevalence of mental disorders and low consultation rate

The epidemiological survey conducted in four provinces in China showed that the prevalence of mental disorders among adults in China was 17.5%, in which the prevalence of mood disorders (mainly depression), anxiety disorders and substance use disorders were 6.1%, 5.6% and 5.9%, respectively. According to the WHO report, the recognition rate of global mental disorders is around 50%, and the recognition rate in China is far below the world average. Taking depression as an example, the recognition rate of depression was only 21% in Shanghai, China. In addition, the rate of diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders is also relatively low, with an average of only around 150 people per 100 000 people receiving treatment for serious mental disorders. The treatment rate for serious mental disorders in high-income countries is about 17 times that of low-income countries.

High proportion of refractory mental disorders and poor medications response

The effectiveness of medications treating mental disorders varies among patients. For example, when one patient with schizophrenia treated with aripiprazole gains improvement, about four patients cannot benefit from the same medication. When duloxetine is effective in treating one patient with depression, it is instead ineffective for the other eight patients. For the sake of improving the precision of mental illness diagnosis and the effectiveness of various treatments, the US National Institute of Mental Health proposed the Research Domain Criteria programme in 2008.

### Comprehensive evaluation of 45 augmentation drugs for schizophrenia: a network meta-analysis [^1596aca0]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The studies that included patients treated with risperidone mainly focused on patients with negative symptoms. The results of the network meta-analysis of patients taking risperidone indicated that tropisetron was the most effective treatment for negative symptoms, with a large effect size (ES) [−0.83; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) (−1.12 to −0.55); rank = 1]. The three drugs had moderate-to-large ES for negative symptoms: pioglitazone [−0.63; 95% CI (−0.94 to −0.30), rank = 2]; minocycline [−0.56; 95% CI (−0.72 to −0.39), rank = 3]; and memantine [−0.50; 95% CI (−0.66 to −0.32), rank = 4]. Palmitoylethanolamide had a small ES for negative symptoms [−0.28; 95% CI (−0.50 to −0.05), rank = 5] but a moderate-to-high effect on general psychopathology [−0.58; 95% CI (−0.84 to −0.32), rank = 1]. Duloxetine [−0.47; 95% CI (−0.59 to−0.35), rank = 5] and sarsasapogenin [−0.21 (−0.33 to −0.09, rank = 6] had small-to-moderate effects on total symptoms. The net graphs and forest plots of effect sizes with rankings for the risperidone group are shown in Supplementary Materials 3–8, respectively.

### Antidepressants for people with both schizophrenia and depression [^eae92e98]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Depressive symptoms, often of substantial severity, are found in 50% of newly diagnosed suffers of schizophrenia and 33% of people with chronic schizophrenia who have relapsed. Depression is associated with dysphoria, disability, reduction of motivation to accomplish tasks and the activities of daily living, an increased duration of illness and more frequent relapses.

Objectives

To determine the clinical effects of antidepressant medication for the treatment of depression in people who also suffer with schizophrenia.

Search Strategy

We undertook electronic searches of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (October 2000), ClinPsych (1988–2000), The Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2000), EMBASE (1980–2000) and MEDLINE (1966–2000). This was supplemented by citation searching, personal contact with authors and pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

All randomised clinical trials that compared antidepressant medication with placebo for people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were also suffering from depression.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were independently selected and extracted. For homogeneous dichotomous data the fixed effects risk difference (RD), the 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, the number needed to treat (NNT) were calculated on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, reviewers calculated weighted mean differences. Statistical tests for heterogeneity were also undertaken.

Main Results

Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. All were small, and randomised fewer than 30 people to each group. Most included people after the most acute phase of psychosis and investigated a wide range of antidepressants. The quality of reporting varied a great deal. For the outcome of 'no important clinical response' antidepressants were significantly better than placebo (n = 209, 5 RCTs, summary risk difference fixed effects -0.26, 95% CI -0.39 to -0.13, NNT 4 95% CI 3 to 8). The depression score at the end of the trial, as assessed by the Hamilton Rating Scale (HAM-D), seemed to suggest that using antidepressants was beneficial, but this was only statistically significant when a fixed effects model was used (n = 261, 6 RCTs, WMD fixed effects -2.2 95% CI -3.8 to -0.6; WMD random effects -2.1 95% CI -5.04 to 0.84). There was no evidence that antidepressant treatment led to a deterioration of psychotic symptoms in the included trials. Heterogeneous data on 'any adverse effect' are equivocal (n = 110, 2 RCTs, RD fixed 0.11 CI -0.03 to 0.25, Chi square 7.5, df = 1, p = 0.0062). In one small study extrapyramidal adverse effects were reported less often by those allocated to antidepressant (n = 52, 1 RCT, RD fixed -0.28 CI -0.5 to -0.04). Only about 10% of people left these studies by 12 weeks. There was no apparent difference between those allocated placebo and those given an antidepressant (n = 426, 10 RCTs, RD fixed 0.04 CI -0.02 to 0.1).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Overall, the literature was of poor quality, and only a small number of trials made useful contributions. Though our results provide some evidence to indicate that antidepressants may be beneficial for people with depression and schizophrenia, the results, at best, are likely to overestimate the treatment effect, and, at worst, could merely reflect selective reporting of statistically significant results and publication bias. At present, there is no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of antidepressants in treating depression in people with schizophrenia. We need further well-designed, conducted and reported research to determine the best approach towards treating depression in people with schizophrenia.

### Treatment response for acute depression is not associated with number of previous episodes: lack of evidence for a clinical staging model for major depressive disorder [^38ec072a]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Mental illness has been observed to follow a neuroprogressive course, commencing with prodrome, then onset, recurrence and finally chronic illness. In bipolar disorder and schizophrenia responsiveness to treatment mirrors these stages of illness progression, with greater response to treatment in the earlier stages of illness and greater treatment resistance in chronic late stage illness. Using data from 5627 participants in 15 controlled trials of duloxetine, comparator arm (paroxetine, venlafaxine, escitalopram) or placebo for the treatment of an acute depressive episode, the relationship between treatment response and number of previous depressive episodes was determined. Data was dichotomised for comparisons between participants who had > 3 previous episodes (n = 1697) or ≤ 3 previous episodes (n = 3930), and additionally for no previous episodes (n = 1381) or at least one previous episode (n = 4246). Analyses were conducted by study arm for each clinical trial, and results were then pooled. There was no significant difference between treatment response and number of previous depressive episodes. This unexpected finding suggests that treatments to reduce symptoms of depression during acute illness do not lose efficacy for patients with a longer history of illness.

### Real-world effectiveness of clozapine augmentation with antidepressants: within-subject data evidence from two European nationwide cohorts [^78dcdb0e]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Background

Only 40% of people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia will have an adequate response to clozapine. Data on the effect of antidepressant augmentation on these patients are scarce. We aimed to study the effectiveness and safety of antidepressant augmentations to clozapine in two nationwide cohorts.

Methods

For this within-subject data evidence study, data from two cohort studies were analysed then meta-analysed, including patients with schizophrenia using clozapine identified from Finnish (1996–2017) and Swedish (2006–23) nationwide registers, followed up from first clozapine use until death or end of data linkage. Clozapine augmentation with specific antidepressants was compared with clozapine use only. The primary outcome was schizophrenia relapse (hospital admission with ICD-10 F20-F29 diagnosis), and the secondary outcome was somatic hospital admission. The risk of outcomes (expressed as adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]) was assessed by a within-individual cohort design, using each individual as their own control. Ethnicity data were not available. People with lived experience were not involved.

Findings

The analysis included 23206 clozapine users (9531 women and 13675 men), with a mean age of 41·3 years (SD 13·5). The lowest risk of relapse was observed for sertraline (meta-analysis aHR 0·76 [95% CI 0·69–0·83]), duloxetine (aHR 0·78 [0·68–0·89]), and escitalopram (0·85 [0·79–0·92]). When antidepressants were recategorised by dose, the lowest risk of relapse was observed for standard doses of sertraline at 30–54 mg/day (aHR 0·49 [0·27–0·89]), escitalopram 6–10 mg/day (aHR 0·57 [0·37–0·88]), and duloxetine 18–32 mg/day (aHR 0·59 [0·46–0·75]). No antidepressant was associated with an increased risk of somatic hospital admission at low or standard dose, whereas high-dose use was associated with increased risk, although most of the risk estimates were not significant.

Interpretation

This meta-analysis from two nationwide cohorts indicates that SSRI and SNRI augmentation therapies for people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia are associated with a substantially decreased risk of relapse at standard dose, unlike other antidepressants. Potential benefits associated with augmentation must be balanced against risks of possible deleterious somatic outcomes, which were observed only when antidepressants were used at high doses.

### Duloxetine [^961661e2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.

If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7) for descriptions of the risks of discontinuation of duloxetine delayed-release capsules.

Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for duloxetine should be written for the smallest quantity of capsules consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.

Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder

A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that duloxetine is not approved for use in treating bipolar depression.

### An update on the efficacy of anti-inflammatory agents for patients with schizophrenia: a meta-analysis [^530d58bd]. Psychological Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Literature search

The literature was systematically reviewed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (Moher et al.). Two independent investigators (N.Ç. and G.E.) systematically searched PubMed, Embase, the National Institutes of Health website, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from inception to 9 August 2018. No language or year restrictions were applied. The search strategy used for each database can be found in online Supplementary Material S1.

Inclusion criteria

Consensus on the studies included was reached on the basis of the following criteria:
(1) Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials regarding augmentation of antipsychotic medication with anti-inflammatory agents.
(2) Patients included had a diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, or schizoaffective disorder) according to the diagnostic criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III, DSM-III-R, DSM-IV, and DSM-IV-TR or International Classification of Diseases, 9th or 10th revision). Schizotypal and schizoid personality disorder were not included.
(3) Studies reported information to calculate common effect size (ES) statistics of change scores, i.e. means and standard deviations; exact p, t, or z values; or corresponding authors could supply these data upon request. Studies providing only post-treatment data were not included.

We also included crossover studies to obtain as much information as possible. We excluded antipsychotic, antidepressant, and mood-stabilizing agents because their well-known efficacy on symptom severity would confound the results. Studies that were only published as abstracts were included after contacting the authors for more detailed information. If multiple publications from the same cohort were available, we extracted data from the largest or most recent data set.

5.8 Activation of Mania/Hypomania

In adult placebo-controlled trials in patients with MDD, activation of mania or hypomania was reported in 0.1% (4/3779) of duloxetine -treated patients and 0.04% (1/2536) of placebo-treated patients. No activation of mania or hypomania was reported in DPNP, GAD, fibromyalgia, or chronic musculoskeletal pain placebo-controlled trials. Activation of mania or hypomania has been reported in a small proportion of patients with mood disorders who were treated with other marketed drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder. As with these other agents, duloxetine should be used cautiously in patients with a history of mania.

5.9 Angle-Closure Glaucoma

The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including duloxetine may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy.

5.10 Seizures

Duloxetine has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a seizure disorder, and such patients were excluded from clinical studies. In adult placebo-controlled clinical trials, seizures/convulsions occurred in 0.02% (3/12,722) of patients treated with duloxetine and 0.01% (1/9513) of patients treated with placebo. Duloxetine should be prescribed with care in patients with a history of a seizure disorder.

Tolerability In clinical trials for depression, the discontinuation rate in patients receiving duloxetine was significantly higher than in patients receiving placebo. 2 Nausea, somnolence, insomnia, and dizziness are the main side effects, reported by about 10 to 20 percent of patients. 2 Anticholinergic-type side effects can occur. Changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and weight are not clinically significant. 3 In four studies of depression, there was a higher rate of sexual dysfunction in men receiving duloxetine compared with those receiving placebo, based on the Arizona Sexual Experience scale. 2 Men receiving duloxetine, 80 mg daily, found it more difficult to achieve orgasm than men receiving placebo. 4 Rates of sexual dysfunction based on voluntary reporting range from 3 to 6 percent, although underreporting is likely. 2 No effect on sexual function in women has been reported.

There are no data comparing duloxetine with other anti-depressants in terms of their impacts on the rates of sexual dysfunction. Effectiveness Four studies involving a total of 1, 059 patients with major depression have demonstrated the superiority of duloxetine over placebo based on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. 2 The primary outcome measure — a reduction in the 24-hour average pain severity on the 11-point Brief Pain Inventory — decreased by about one point more with duloxetine than with placebo. A change in pain intensity of two points or more is considered clinically relevant. Functional outcomes were not assessed. There are no published studies, other than the trials mentioned above, 2 of duloxetine's efficacy in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy. Duloxetine has not been compared with other treatments for diabetic neuropathy. Bottom Line Duloxetine is safe and effective for the treatment of major depressive disorder.

Because of its expense and the lack of data supporting its superiority over other antidepressants, it should be used as an alternative if other agents are ineffective or are not tolerated. The manufacturer has launched an aggressive marketing campaign targeting the use of duloxetine for the painful physical symptoms of depression, although there is insufficient evidence to support the choice of duloxetine for this indication over any other antidepressant. Duloxetine causes a modest reduction in pain in patients with diabetic neuropathy but is more expensive than amitriptyline and desipramine, and evidence showing benefit over these older agents is lacking.

### Duloxetine hydrochloride (duloxetine) [^0026a018]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.

If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] for descriptions of the risks of discontinuation of duloxetine delayed-release capsules.

Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for duloxetine delayed-release capsules should be written for the smallest quantity of capsules consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.

 Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder

A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that duloxetine delayed-release capsules are not approved for use in treating bipolar depression.

14.2 Schizoaffective Disorder

Adults

The acute efficacy of paliperidone (3 mg to 12 mg once daily) in the treatment of schizoaffective disorder was established in two placebo-controlled, 6-week trials in non-elderly adult subjects. Enrolled subjects 1) met DSM-IV criteria for schizoaffective disorder, as confirmed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders, 2) had a Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score of at least 60, and 3) had prominent mood symptoms as confirmed by a score of at least 16 on the Young Mania Rating Scale and/or Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. The population included subjects with schizoaffective bipolar and depressive types. In one of these trials, efficacy was assessed in 211 subjects who received flexible doses of paliperidone (3 to 12 mg once daily). In the other study, efficacy was assessed in 203 subjects who were assigned to one of two dose levels of paliperidone: 6 mg with the option to reduce to 3 mg (n = 105) or 12 mg with the option to reduce to 9 mg (n = 98) once daily. Both studies included subjects who received paliperidone either as monotherapy [no mood stabilizers and/or antidepressants (55%)] or as an adjunct to mood stabilizers and/or antidepressants (45%). The most commonly used mood stabilizers were valproate and lithium. The most commonly used antidepressants were SSRIs and SNRIs. Paliperidone was dosed in the morning without regard to meals. Studies were carried out in the United States, Eastern Europe, Russia, and Asia.

### Is treatment-associated hypomania rare with duloxetine: secondary analysis of controlled trials in non-bipolar depression [^f78129d7]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Selective serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) like duloxetine have the efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) with a more tolerable side-effect profile. Bipolar disorder is often undetected, with the most common misdiagnosis being unipolar depression. Studies have suggested that treatment of bipolar and unipolar depression with heterocyclic TCAs may increase the risk of switch rate to mania. Studies of antidepressants in unipolar major depression show a small risk of mania or hypomania, presumably because some bipolar depressives were mistakenly studied. This study investigated the rate of hypomania, mania, and hypomanic-like symptoms observed during treatment with duloxetine in patients with major depression.

Methods

This was a retrospective analysis of data from eight placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trials of duloxetine in patients with non-bipolar major depression.

Limitations

The studies were of limited duration. Manic or hypomanic symptoms were not elicited using standardized mania rating scale instruments.

Results

One case of mania occurred in the placebo group (0.1%), and two cases of hypomania were observed in the duloxetine-treated group (0.2%). Among hypomanic-like symptoms, only insomnia was significantly higher in the duloxetine group than in the placebo group (p < 0.05).

Conclusions

Duloxetine was associated with a low incidence of treatment-emergent hypomania, mania, or hypomanic-like symptoms in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). The low incidence reported here may be due to greater diagnostic diligence on the part of the investigators. It is possible that the cases reported likely reflect inclusion of misdiagnosed bipolar II patients rather than true unipolar MDD cases. The effect of duloxetine in patients with bipolar depression is not known.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^a7ee1d7c]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Antidepressant dosing in dementia — elderly patients: Low starting doses, small dose increases, and long intervals between increases are advised; citalopram is started at 5–10 mg/day and increased at several-week intervals to a maximum of 40 mg/day, and sertraline may be started at 12.5–25.0 mg/day and increased at 1–2-week intervals up to a maximum dosage of 150–200 mg/day. If initial agents are ineffective, venlafaxine can be started at 25 mg/day (extended release, 37.5 mg/day) and increased at approximately weekly intervals up to a maximum of 375 mg/day in divided doses (extended release, 225 mg/day), and if venlafaxine is prescribed, careful monitoring of blood pressure is indicated. Mirtazapine can be started at 7.5 mg at bedtime and increased by 7.5-mg or 15-mg increments to 45–60 mg at bedtime; lower dosages have been associated with sedation and appetite increase, and less sedation is found in dosages over 15 mg/day. Bupropion should be used in prescribing with caution for patients with liver dysfunction or renal impairment and for patients who develop signs of delirium; it can be started at 37.5 mg once or twice per day (sustained release, 100 mg/day) and increased slowly to a maximum dosage of 300 mg/day in divided doses (sustained release, 300 mg/day), and no more than 150 mg of immediate release bupropion should be given within any 4- hour period because of the risk of seizures. Duloxetine can be started at 20–40 mg/day and increased slowly to a maximum of 60–80 mg/day, typically in divided doses.

### Onset of action for duloxetine 60 mg once daily: double-blind, placebo-controlled studies [^e7e78db9]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2005). Low credibility.

Background

It is widely believed that most antidepressant medications exhibit a delay of 2–4 weeks before clinically relevant improvement can be observed among patients. During this latency period, patients continue to be symptomatic and functionally impaired. Thus, time to onset of effect is an important attribute of a new pharmacotherapy. We assessed the onset of effect for duloxetine, utilizing analytical methods previously recommended in the literature.

Method

Efficacy data were pooled from two identical, but independent, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 9-week clinical trials of duloxetine (60 mg QD). Efficacy measures included the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD(17)), HAMD(17) subscales (Maier, core, and anxiety), and the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) and Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) scales. In each individual study, duloxetine demonstrated statistically significant advantages over placebo on multiple outcomes. The present analysis utilized pooled data to more accurately and fully characterize the onset of effect for duloxetine.

Results

Median times to sustained improvements of 10% and 20% in the HAMD(17) total score among duloxetine-treated patients were 14 days and 21 days, respectively, compared with 34 days and 49 days, respectively, for placebo-treated patients (p < 0.001 for both results). The median time to sustained 30% improvement in HAMD(17) total score was 35 days for duloxetine-treated patients, while the median time for placebo-treated patients was not estimable since less than half of the patients met this criterion by the end of the trial. For duloxetine-treated patients, median times to sustained 10%, 20%, and 30% improvements on the Maier subscale of the HAMD(17) were the same as those for the HAMD(17) total score: 14, 21, and 35 days, respectively. However, in other analyses, changes in core emotional symptoms as measured by subscales of the HAMD(17) were somewhat faster than changes in overall symptomatology. The probabilities of achieving a sustained 30% improvement (Maier subscale) at Week 1 for duloxetine- and placebo-treated patients were 16.2% vs. 4.8%, respectively (p < 0.001). The corresponding probabilities of sustained improvement at Weeks 2 and 3 for duloxetine were 32.5% and 45.4%, respectively, compared to 12.8% and 21.4% for placebo ((p < 0.001 for both comparisons).

Conclusion

The absence of an active comparator limits the conclusions which can be drawn regarding the rapidity of onset of clinically meaningful improvement. However, results from the present investigation may be useful to clinicians in consideration of treatment options for individual patients.

### Efficacy and tolerability of duloxetine in the treatment of patients with borderline personality disorder: a pilot study [^8036d76f]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

Guidelines of the American Psychiatric Association for borderline personality disorder (BPD) indicate selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and the serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine for treating affective dysregulation and impulsive behavioural dyscontrol symptoms. The SNRI duloxetine has been studied in patients with major depression, generalized anxiety disorder and fibromyalgia, showing particular efficacy on somatic complaints. This study investigates duloxetine in the treatment of patients with BPD. Eighteen outpatients with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of BPD were treated with open-label duloxetine, 60 mg/day, for 12 weeks. Patients were assessed at baseline, week 4 and 12 with the CGI Severity item, the BPRS, the HAM-D, the HAM-A, the SOFAS, the BPD Severity Index (BPDSI) and the HSCL-90-Somatization Subscale (HSCL-90 SOM). Adverse effects were evaluated using the Dosage Record Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale. Statistics were performed with the analysis of variance. Significant P values were ≤ 0.05. Fourteen patients completed the study. Four patients (22.2%) discontinued treatment in the first 4 weeks because of non-compliance. A significant change was found for: BPRS, HAM-D, SOFAS, BPDSI total score and items 'impulsivity', 'outbursts of anger' and 'affective instability' and HSCL-90 SOM. Adverse effects were mild headache and nausea. Initial results suggest that duloxetine is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for BPD, with positive effects on somatic symptoms.

### Long-term real-world effectiveness of pharmacotherapies for schizoaffective disorder [^a8bb1979]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Schizoaffective disorder (SCHAFF) is a common diagnosis in psychiatry, even though the nosological status of SCHAFF remains controversial. SCHAFF symptoms include both schizophrenic (hallucinations, delusions) and affective (depression, mania) symptomsand both ICD-10 and DSM-5 separate manic/bipolar and depressive subtypes of SCHAFF. ICD-11 aims to improve the differential diagnosis and diagnostic accuracy of SCHAFF. It has been debated whether SCHAFF represents an independent illness, an atypical form of schizophrenia or a mood disorder, a form of schizophrenia combined with a mood disorder, a heterogeneous group of both schizophrenia and mood disorder patients, or if SCHAFF is on the continuum of schizophrenia and mood disorder spectrum. A systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that SCHAFF may be closer to schizophrenia than bipolar disorder but it shares features of both disorders. Also, from a genetic perspective, SCHAFF seems to be related to both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Conducting formal meta-analyses and giving specific guidelines for SCHAFF pharmacotherapy have been challenging due to the small number and heterogeneity of studies focusing purely on SCHAFF patients. Pharmacotherapy recommendations for SCHAFF are mostly derived from studies on schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and thus patients with SCHAFF are commonly treated with antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and/or antidepressants. Of specific antipsychotics, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) have approved the use of paliperidone for SCHAFF. Combining antipsychotics with adjunctive psychopharmacotherapies, namely mood stabilizers and/or antidepressants, in SCHAFF is common compared with schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder.

This study compares the long-term real-world effectiveness of psychopharmacotherapies for SCHAFF in two nationwide cohorts in order to observe whether the results are consistent in both countries, indicating that they may be generalizable to other populations as well. Sixteen most commonly used antipsychotics in both countries were reported, and drug formulation information was utilized to further categorize antipsychotics to oral and long-acting injectables (LAIs). Other pharmacotherapy categories included mood stabilizers, antidepressants, benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-related, so-called Z-drugs (BZDR).

### Long-term real-world effectiveness of pharmacotherapies for schizoaffective disorder [^29d26639]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2021). Medium credibility.

Since SCHAFF symptomatology includes both schizophrenic and affective symptoms, adjunctive mood stabilizer or antidepressant use is common, even though the evidence-based effectiveness of this practice is inconclusive. It has been proposed that the optimal treatment for the different subtypes of SCHAFF might be different; for the manic/bipolar subtype use of mood stabilizers could be useful, whereas the depressive subtype could benefit from antidepressants. Previous studies on the efficacy of adjunctive use of mood stabilizers in SCHAFF have been small and they have focused on specific combinations of antipsychotics and mood stabilizers. Indeed, preceding information on the use of mood stabilizers as adjunctive therapy in SCHAFF has been scarce and due to limitations, very few conclusions could have been drawn. Our results suggest that add-on mood stabilizer use could be beneficial in SCHAFF. However, our study did not separate the different subtypes of SCHAFF, which could have yielded more clinically relevant information.

### Efficacy and tolerability of duloxetine, a novel dual reuptake inhibitor, in the treatment of major depressive disorder [^51a152f1]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Although highly selective antidepressants such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors represent an advance over older drugs with respect to tolerability, they are not more effective than previous agents. Antidepressants that enhance transmission in more than one monoamine system may have greater efficacy than highly selective drugs, while equaling or improving their adverse effect profiles. This article reviews the properties of duloxetine, a potent and balanced inhibitor of norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake. Controlled studies indicate a high degree of efficacy, tolerability, and safety for duloxetine in the treatment of major depressive disorder. In particular, rapid therapeutic onset and high remission rates have been noted. Duloxetine appears to have significant benefit in the treatment of the painful physical symptoms associated with depression. The continued presence of such symptoms may predict relapse. Accordingly, it is hoped that duloxetine therapy may reduce the likelihood of depressive relapse.

### Duloxetine in the long-term treatment of major depressive disorder [^0bd19790]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Depression is a chronic recurring disorder and guidelines recommend long-term therapy. This clinical trial evaluated the long-term (1 year) safety and efficacy of duloxetine, a dual reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine, in patients with DSM-IV major depressive disorder.

Method

This was an open-label, 52-week, multinational clinical trial in outpatients (age ≥ 18 years) who received duloxetine at 80 mg/day (administered 40 mg twice daily) to 120 mg/day (administered 60 mg twice daily) for up to 1 year.

Results

A total of 1279 patients had postbaseline data. Of these, 520 were exposed to duloxetine for at least 360 days, yielding approximately 808 patient-years of total exposure. Mean changes in Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S) score, 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression total score and subfactor scores, Beck Depression Inventory-II score, and Sheehan Disability Scale score and mean Patient Global Impression-Improvement scale (PGI-I) scores all showed highly significant (p < .001) improvements at all assessment times. The estimated probabilities of improvement in CGI-S and PGI-I scores at week 1 were 40.4% and 59.2%, respectively, and at week 2 were 70.0% and 78.3%. The estimated probabilities of remission at weeks 6, 28, and 52 were 50.8%, 75.6%, and 81.8%, respectively. Adverse events led to discontinuation in 218 patients (17.0%). The most frequent specific events leading to discontinuation were nausea (1.5%), somnolence (1.4%), vomiting (0.9%), hypomania (0.8%), pregnancy (0.8%), dizziness (0.6%), insomnia (0.6%), and hypertension (0.5%). Treatment-emergent adverse events that were reported by > 10% of patients included nausea, insomnia, headache, somnolence, dry mouth, dizziness, constipation, sweating increase, anxiety, diarrhea, and fatigue. Most events occurred early in the study. Of those events that first occurred or worsened after discontinuation, only dizziness (8.3%) occurred in more than 5% of patients. Mean changes from baseline to last observation for standing and supine pulse were less than 2 b.p.m. Mean changes in blood pressure (< 1.0 mm Hg), corrected QT interval (< 1 msec), and body weight (2.4 kg [5.3 lb]) were not clinically significant. Laboratory analyses varied across visits, and mean changes after 52 weeks were generally close to zero. The incidence of laboratory values above or below normal limits at any time during treatment was low.

Conclusion

Duloxetine was effective, safe, and well tolerated in the long-term treatment of major depression at a dose of 80 to 120 mg/day in this study.

### Duloxetine hydrochloride: a new dual-acting medication for the treatment of major depressive disorder [^3623f692]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Duloxetine hydrochloride has recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Duloxetine is a potent inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, with weak effects on dopamine reuptake.

Objective

This article reviews the literature on duloxetine with regard to its pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and tolerability.

Methods

A comprehensive search of MEDLINE was performed using the terms duloxetine, Cymbalta, and major depressive disorder, with no restriction on year. The Eli Lilly and Company clinical trial registry, and abstracts and posters from recent American Psychiatric Association meetings were also reviewed.

Results

Duloxetine exhibits linear, dose-dependent pharmacokinetics across the approved oral dosage range of 40 to 60 mg/d. No dose adjustment appears to be needed based on age. Duloxetine has shown efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms compared with placebo, and duloxetine recipients have shown significant improvements in global functioning compared with placebo (both, P < 0.05). Response and remission rates have been comparable to or greater than those seen with fluoxetine or paroxetine. Duloxetine is generally well tolerated, with nausea, dry mouth, and fatigue being the most common treatment-emergent adverse effects. Cardiovascular adverse effects do not appear to result in sustained blood pressure elevations, QTc-interval prolongation, or other electrocardiographic changes.

Conclusions

Based on the available evidence, duloxetine is a well-tolerated and effective treatment for MDD in adults. Randomized head-to-head comparisons against established antidepressants are needed to determine the relative safety and efficacy of duloxetine.

### Long-term real-world effectiveness of pharmacotherapies for schizoaffective disorder [^02878a5c]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2021). Medium credibility.

Evidence on adding antidepressants to schizophrenia/SCHAFF pharmacotherapy is also limited. Our results differed between the two cohorts, as in the Swedish cohort exposure to antidepressants was associated with a decreased risk of psychosis hospitalization, whereas in the Finnish cohort this association was not observed. These differences could be due to different treatment guidelines and clinical practices between Finland and Sweden. It is also worth noticing that using BZDRs with antipsychotics was associated with an increased risk of psychosis hospitalization in both cohorts. This is especially important, as BZDRs were very widely used in both of our study cohorts. It is concerning that BZDRs were more commonly used than other adjunctive medications, even though the results suggest beneficial effects of mood stabilizers and antidepressants.

The strengths of this observational study include two large nationwide cohorts with thousands of patients and multiple years of follow-up time. Selection bias is minimal, since our study included all patients with SCHAFF in the nationwide registers (excluding a small number of patients who have only been treated in outpatient care in Finland). Therefore, our results represent a real-life setting and are generalizable to high-income countries that provide medications for free or with very low copayment for patients with serious mental disorders. Drug use was modeled with the PRE2DUP methodwhich has been shown to produce highly reliable estimates of drug use. The within-individual model used in this study controls for all time-invariant covariates in the design, and the analyses were adjusted for multiple time-varying covariates, minimizing the common sources of bias in observational studies. The limitations of our study are related to the nature of the data in the nationwide registers, which were not originally designed for analysis methods such as the ones employed here. Register-based data lack information on many clinically important factors, such as the severity of the symptoms during specific drug exposures and thus, residual confounding may exist. We were not able to confirm the certainty of the diagnostics between SCHAFF and schizophrenia from the medical records since our study is register-based. However, SCHAFF- and schizophrenia diagnoses are carefully considered before the diagnosis is given, and in both Finland and Sweden diagnostics should always follow the ICD criteria. Patients with diagnostic uncertainties (change of diagnosis from SCHAFF to schizophrenia) were removed from the sensitivity analyses. One weakness of the current study was that we did not make a division according to the subtypes of SCHAFF, as the different subtypes or polarities of episodes (manic, depressive, or mixed) may respond differently to pharmacological treatments. This topic remains for future studies to elucidate upon. Psychological interventions are important when treating psychiatric disorders, but unfortunately, our data did not allow us to adjust our models for them. It is also noteworthy that both Finland and Sweden use the ICD-system, and therefore, these results may not be directly translatable to healthcare systems using DSM criteria.

### Clozapine augmentation strategies-a systematic meta-review of available evidence. treatment options for clozapine resistance [^805b0717]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment options for clozapine resistance are diverse whereas, in contrast, the evidence for augmentation or combination strategies is sparse.

Aims

We aimed to extract levels of evidence from available data and extrapolate recommendations for clinical practice.

Methods

We conducted a systematic literature search in the PubMed/MEDLINE database and in the Cochrane database. Included meta-analyses were assessed using Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network criteria, with symptom improvement as the endpoint, in order to develop a recommendation grade for each clinical strategy identified.

Results

Our search identified 21 meta-analyses of clozapine combination or augmentation strategies. No strategies met Grade A criteria. Strategies meeting Grade B included combinations with first- or second-generation antipsychotics, augmentation with electroconvulsive therapy for persistent positive symptoms, and combination with certain antidepressants (fluoxetine, duloxetine, citalopram) for persistent negative symptoms. Augmentation strategies with mood-stabilisers, anticonvulsants, glutamatergics, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation or cognitive behavioural therapy met Grades C-D criteria only.

Conclusion

More high-quality clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of add-on treatments for symptom improvement in patients with clozapine resistance. Applying definitions of clozapine resistance would improve the reporting of future clinical trials. Augmentation with second-generation antipsychotics and first-generation antipsychotics can be beneficial, but the supporting evidence is from low-quality studies. Electroconvulsive therapy may be effective for clozapine-resistant positive symptoms.

### Developing an individualized treatment plan for patients with schizoaffective disorder: from pharmacotherapy to psychoeducation [^10daf72c]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

To develop an individualized treatment plan that addresses both psychotic and affective symptoms in patients with schizoaffective disorder, clinicians can take several steps. First, clinicians can confirm the diagnosis. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) and in the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), schizoaffective disorder is defined differently, but, diagnostically, the disorder falls on a spectrum between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia and can be divided into bipolar and depressive types. Next, clinicians can evaluate predictors of outcome. Outcomes can be predicted by previous functioning, number of previous episodes, persistence of psychotic symptoms, and level of cognitive impairment. Then, clinicians can use evidence from clinical trials to guide selection of acute and maintenance phase treatment. Although data are limited, direct and indirect evidence from clinical trials support pharmacologic and psychoeducational interventions. In bipolar type schizoaffective disorder, evidence supports the use of an atypical antipsychotic and a mood stabilizer or atypical antipsychotic monotherapy. In the depressive type of the disorder, the combination of an atypical antipsychotic and an antidepressant is probably the best choice, but an atypical antipsychotic and a mood stabilizer could also be used. In both types of the disorder, patient psychoeducation can be beneficial in the maintenance phase of treatment. Adherence to treatment is essential for optimal outcome, and, besides patient psychoeducation, long-acting injectable antipsychotics and psychoeducation for caregivers may also improve adherence. In refractory cases, electroconvulsive therapy is an option.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^94abaaee]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Responders to lamotrigine have a predominantly depressive polarity as well as comorbid anxiety. 420, 421 Lamotrigine monotherapy is not appropriate for patients with frequent manic episodes, as it has limited efficacy in preventing mania.

Quetiapine has been shown to be effective in preventing manic, depressive and mixed episodes in patients with index manic, depressive and mixed episodes, and thus may be particularly valuable in those with mixed features. 422 Asenapine appears to be effective in preventing both mania and depression, although the magnitude of prophylactic efficacy is greater for mania relative to depression. In a randomized open trial of carbamazepine versus lithium, responders to carbamazepine were more likely to have an atypical illness, BDII or schizoaffective disorder. 405

Data to differentiate anti‐psychotic medication responders from non‐responders are lacking.

Overall, some of these possible predictors can have clinical utility, but not all are practical. For instance, it is difficult to evaluate a pre‐treatment course in patients who started their treatment after one or two episodes (practice recommended by most treatment guidelines), and biomarkers are intriguing but lack sufficient replication and are not readily available.

In patients with a history of a rapid cycling course, as indicated in previous sections, factors associated with rapid cycling must be addressed. These include discontinuation of stimulants and antidepressants and treating hypothyroidism if present. With regard to treatment options, the evidence suggests that monotherapy with a single mood stabilizer is often ineffective and patients may require a combination of mood stabilizers to achieve mood stability.

### Duloxetine for the long-term treatment of major depressive disorder in patients aged 65 and older: an open-label study [^b1cb3ce5]. BMC Geriatrics (2004). Low credibility.

However, these acute placebo-controlled trials of duloxetine were of 9 weeks duration or less. An NIH consensus panel has recommended that geriatric patients be given continuing antidepressant treatment for at least 6 months for a first episode and for at least 1 year for recurrent episodes, while some investigators suggest that maintenance treatment in the elderly be extended to 2 years. In order to evaluate the long-term tolerability, safety, and efficacy of duloxetine, a one-year open-label trial in depressed patients was undertaken. This report examines the subset of patients aged 65 and older who participated in the study. While patients in this study received doses of 80 mg/d or 120 mg/d, it should be noted that the approved dose range for duloxetine for the treatment of MDD is 40–60 mg/d.

### Efficacy and safety of duloxetine 60 mg and 120 mg daily in patients hospitalized for severe depression: a double-blind randomized trial [^f3bb4d2a]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess whether hospitalized patients with severe depression and potential suicidal ideation/behavior have earlier and better response to duloxetine 120 mg daily than 60 mg daily.

Method

Adults from 34 sites in 4 countries with severe major depressive disorder, defined by DSM-IV criteria, who were demonstrating Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores ≥ 30, 6-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-6) scores ≥ 12, and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S) ≥ 4 and hospitalized ≥ 2 weeks underwent double-blind treatment with either duloxetine 60 mg (n = 167) or 120 mg (n = 171) daily for 8 weeks. Patients treated with 60 mg/d who did not respond had their doses titrated up to 120 mg/d. Primary outcome was the difference in baseline to week 4 change in MADRS scores between the groups. Secondary outcomes were baseline to week 8 changes in MADRS and HDRS-6 scores, response and remission, CGI-S scores, CGI-Improvement scores, Patient Global Impressions-Improvement, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores, and Reasons For Living inventory results. Safety was also assessed. The study was conducted between February 9, 2007, and August 26, 2008.

Results

There was no significant difference in mean baseline to week 4 MADRS score change between the 60-mg (-20.1) and 120-mg (-19.9) groups (P = 0.88). At week 4, 96/166 (60 mg) and 106/170 (120 mg) patients responded and maintained responses at week 8 by further decreasing mean MADRS scores to 5.8 (60 mg) and 5.6 (120 mg). At week 8, 226/336 (67.3%) patients achieved remission, with no difference demonstrated between groups. Most secondary efficacy measures were significantly reduced from baseline to week 8 within each group and did not differ between groups. Treatment-emergent adverse events observed with > 10% frequency in both groups were headache and nausea.

Conclusions

Duloxetine 60-mg and 120-mg doses were equally effective and demonstrated no significant differences in treating severe depressive symptoms in hospitalized patients. The safety and tolerability profile of duloxetine in both dosages did not differ and was similar to those reported in previous duloxetine studies.

### Duloxetine versus other anti-depressive agents for depression [^caf4b8ca]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Although pharmacological and psychological interventions are both effective for major depression, in primary and secondary care settings antidepressant drugs remain the mainstay of treatment. Amongst antidepressants many different agents are available. Duloxetine hydrochloride is a dual reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine and has been licensed by the Food and Drug Administration in the US for major depressive disorder (MDD), generalised anxiety disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia and chronic musculoskeletal pain.

Objectives

To assess the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of duloxetine in comparison with all other antidepressant agents in the acute-phase treatment of major depression.

Search Methods

MEDLINE (1966 to 2012), EMBASE (1974 to 2012), the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to March 2012. No language restriction was applied. Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were hand-searched. Pharmaceutical company marketing duloxetine and experts in this field were contacted for supplemental data.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials allocating patients with major depression to duloxetine versus any other antidepressive agent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and a double-entry procedure was employed. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability.

Main Results

A total of 16 randomised controlled trials (overall 5735 participants) were included in this systematic review. Of these, three trials were unpublished. We found 11 studies (overall 3304 participants) comparing duloxetine with one selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (six studies versus paroxetine, three studies versus escitalopram and two versus fluoxetine), four studies (overall 1978 participants) comparing duloxetine with a newer antidepressants (three with venlafaxine and one with desvenlafaxine, respectively) and one study (overall 453 participants) comparing duloxetine with an antipsychotic drug which is also used as an antidepressive agent, quetiapine. No studies were found comparing duloxetine with tricyclic antidepressants. The pooled confidence intervals were rather wide and there were no statistically significant differences in efficacy when comparing duloxetine with other antidepressants. However, when compared with escitalopram or venlafaxine, there was a higher rate of drop out due to any cause in the patients randomised to duloxetine (odds ratio (OR) 1.62; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 2.62 and OR 1.56; 95% CI 1.14 to 2.15, respectively). There was also some weak evidence suggesting that patients taking duloxetine experienced more adverse events than paroxetine (OR 1.24; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.55).

Authors' Conclusions

Duloxetine did not seem to provide a significant advantage in efficacy over other antidepressive agents for the acute-phase treatment of major depression. No differences in terms of efficacy were found, even though duloxetine was worse than some SSRIs (most of all, escitalopram) and newer antidepressants (like venlafaxine) in terms of acceptability and tolerability. Unfortunately, we only found evidence comparing duloxetine with a handful of other active antidepressive agents and only a few trials per comparison were found (in some cases we retrieved just one trial). This limited the power of the review to detect moderate, but clinically meaningful differences between the drugs. As many statistical tests have been used in the review, the findings from this review are better thought of as hypothesis forming rather than hypothesis testing and it would be very comforting to see the conclusions replicated in future trials. Most of included studies were sponsored by the drug industry manufacturing duloxetine. As for all other new investigational compounds, the potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias should be borne in mind. In the present review no trials reported economic outcomes. Given that several SSRIs and the great majority of antidepressants are now available as generic formulation (only escitalopram, desvenlafaxine and duloxetine are still on patent), more comprehensive economic estimates of antidepressant treatment effect should be considered to better inform healthcare policy.

### Duloxetine for the long-term treatment of major depressive disorder in patients aged 65 and older: an open-label study [^5321dbf9]. BMC Geriatrics (2004). Low credibility.

It is important to consider all of the safety findings described here in light of the dosing and design requirements of the study. The doses used in this open-label study were up to 2-fold greater than the once-daily 60 mg duloxetine dose which has been shown to provide robust efficacy in older patients in placebo-controlled trials. The dosing and other design features of the study (e.g. the intensive visit schedule) were specifically included to maximize the probability of uncovering adverse reactions to duloxetine. Furthermore, no special dosing guidelines were implemented for these elderly patients. While lower doses of many antidepressants are recommended in the elderly, especially due to concerns of adverse events among the TCAs, this can lead to the use of subtherapeutic doses and corresponding reductions in efficacy. In this study, however, the comparable adverse event profiles observed for elderly and younger age groups suggest that a duloxetine dose which has been shown to provide robust efficacy may be safely administered in depressed patients regardless of age. Only in particularly sensitive elderly patients may dosing adjustments be required.

### Use of effect size to determine optimal dose of duloxetine in major depressive disorder [^55d2f3b2]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

At effective doses, patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) treated with duloxetine have been found to experience significant symptom improvement as measured by HAMD(17) total score. In addition, duloxetine-treated patients have significantly higher remission and response rates compared with placebo. The objective of this analysis is to determine the optimal dose of duloxetine in MDD.

Materials and Methods

Effect size for duloxetine 40mg, 60mg, 80mg, and 120mg per day were estimated using all 6 acute phase III clinical trials in patients with MDD. The tolerability of duloxetine 40mg, 60mg, 80mg, and 120mg were evaluated using pooled data from the 6 studies. The primary efficacy measure in all trials was the HAMD(17) total score, from which were determined the effect size for HAMD(17) change scores, response rates (50% reduction from baseline to endpoint), and remission rates (HAMD(17) total score ≤ 7).

Results

A total of 1619 randomized patients were included in these studies, of which 632 were treated with placebo; 177 with duloxetine 40mg/day; 251 with 60mg/day; 363 with 80mg/day; and 196 with 120mg/day. An evaluation of increments in effect size between doses consistently showed that the most notable gain in effect size for efficacy was the 40-60mg/day dosage range. All dosages from 60 to 120mg were effective. The tolerability assessment indicated duloxetine at 40-120mg/day is well tolerated. Furthermore, the initial doses of 40-80mg/day were found to have comparable tolerability.

Conclusions

The effect size analyses demonstrate that duloxetine 40mg has minimum efficacy, and that duloxetine 60-120mg/day is effective in the treatment of patients with MDD. An initial dose less than 60mg/day might provide better tolerability for some patients diagnosed with MDD.

### Do social functioning and symptoms improve with continuation antidepressant treatment of persistent depressive disorder? An observational study [^6d339642]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine efficacy of continued treatment with the serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor duloxetine on symptom reduction and functional improvement in outpatients with dysthymia.

Method

Fifty outpatients with DSM-IV-TR diagnosed dysthymia who had participated in a 10 week double-blind, placebo-controlled study of duloxetine received open treatment for three months. Nineteen duloxetine responders continued duloxetine, 24 patients initially treated with placebo started open duloxetine treatment, and 7 duloxetine non-responders were treated with desvenlafaxine or bupropion, selected by clinician choice.

Results

Patients continuing duloxetine maintained symptom improvement, 84% meeting response and 63% remission criteria at week 22. Patients initially treated with placebo showed similarly high levels of response (83%) and remission (62%) at week 22, and most duloxetine non-responders subsequently responded to other antidepressants. Duloxetine-continuation patients improved modestly between weeks 10 and 22 on measures of social and cognitive functioning and temperament. Despite this improvement concurrently across several functional domains, 66.7% of patients continuing duloxetine remained in the impaired range of functioning according to the Social Adjustment Scale (SAS).

Conclusions

Continued duloxetine treatment appears to be effective in maintaining symptom response in dysthymic disorder, and has positive effects on social functioning. However, the majority of patients do not show normalization of functioning, even when controlling for remission status. Additional treatments should be considered to target residual impairments in social functioning in mood remitted patients with persistent depressive disorder.

### Duloxetine hydrochloride [^e10ab2e6]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

What is duloxetine?

Duloxetine is a prescription medicine used to treat a certain type of depression called Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Duloxetine belongs to a class of medicines known as SNRIs (or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors).

Duloxetine is also used to treat or manage:

Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)
Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain (DPNP)
Fibromyalgia (FM)
Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain

Who should not take Duloxetine?

Do Not take Duloxetine if you:

take a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI). Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist if you are not sure if you take an MAOI, including the antibiotic linezolid or intravenous methylene blue.
Do not take an MAOI within 5 days of stopping duloxetine unless directed to do so by your healthcare provider.
Do not start duloxetine if you stopped taking an MAOI in the last 14 days unless directed to do so by your healthcare provider.

People who take duloxetine close in time to an MAOI may have a serious problem called Serotonin Syndrome (see "What are the possible side effects of duloxetine?").

What should I tell my healthcare provider before taking duloxetine?

Before starting duloxetine, tell your healthcare provider if you:

have heart problems or high blood pressure
have diabetes (duloxetine treatment makes it harder for some people with diabetes to control their blood sugar)
have liver problems
have kidney problems
have glaucoma
have or had seizures or convulsions
have bipolar disorder or mania
have low sodium levels in your blood
have delayed stomach emptying
have or had bleeding problems
are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Duloxetine may harm your unborn baby. Talk to your healthcare provider about the risk to your unborn baby if you take duloxetine during pregnancy.
Tell your healthcare provider right away if you become pregnant or think you are pregnant during treatment with duloxetine.
are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Duloxetine passes into your breast milk and may harm your baby. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby while taking duloxetine.

### Should we Be treating affective symptoms, like anxiety and depression which may Be related to LUTD in patients with OAB? ICI-RS 2024 [^32dd66eb]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

In a small open‐label, single‐arm pilot study, 10 patients (median age: 72 years) with drug‐resistant OAB underwent a face‐to‐face intervention consisting of six 30‐min sessions over 6−12 weeks. Outcomes were assessed using self‐reported questionnaires and frequency voiding charts (FVC) at baseline, during, post‐intervention, and follow‐up. Two participants dropped out, but among the remaining eight, OAB Questionnaire subscale scores improved (effect size: 0.75–1.73), and mean urinary frequency decreased from 9.0 (SD: 2.1) to 6.2 (SD: 1.2) voids per day. Participants reported satisfaction with no adverse events observed.

In a study on medical therapy for affective disorders, 306 women with OAB symptoms, were treated with either duloxetine (an SNRI) or a placebo. Those on duloxetine, starting at 40 mg and increasing to 60 mg twice daily after 4 weeks, demonstrated a significant reduction in voiding episodes, increased daytime voiding intervals and reduced urgency incontinence from baseline to 12 weeks. Additionally, duloxetine significantly improved "avoidance and limiting behaviour" and "psychosocial impact" scores in the Incontinence Quality of Life (IQOL) questionnaire. Duloxetine, which is licensed for treatment of affective disorders, has been shown to improve symptoms of both depression and anxiety in adults.

Current literature suggests that treating affective disorders with psychological therapy or antidepressants may improve LUTD, particularly in patients with refractory symptoms with significant psychological comorbidities. Further research is necessary to identify which patients warrant psychiatric evaluation, which subgroups would benefit from treating affective disorders to improve their LUTD, and whether combined medical therapy is effective for managing both LUTD and affective disorders.

### Duloxetine in the treatment of major depressive disorder: a double-blind clinical trial [^dda87516]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Duloxetine hydrochloride, a dual reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine, was evaluated for therapeutic efficacy and safety/tolerability in the treatment of major depression.

Method

In an 8-week multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 173 patients (aged 18–65 years) with DSM-IV major depressive disorder were randomly allocated to receive placebo (N = 70), duloxetine (N = 70), or fluoxetine, 20 mg q.d. (N = 33). Duloxetine dose was titrated in the first 3 weeks in a forced-titration regimen from 40 mg (20 mg b.i.d.) to 120 mg/day (60 mg b.i.d.). Patients were required to have a Clinical Global Impressions (CGI)-Severity of Illness scale score of at least moderate severity (≥ 4) and a 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17) total score of at least 15. Patients could not have had any current primary DSM-IV Axis I diagnosis other than major depressive disorder, or any anxiety disorder as a primary diagnosis within the past year, excluding specific phobias. The primary efficacy measurement was the HAM-D-17 total score, and secondary measures included the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, CGI-Severity of Illness and CGI-Improvement, and Patient Global Impression of Improvement. Safety was evaluated by recording the occurrence of discontinuation rates and treatment-emergent adverse events and by measurement of vital signs and laboratory analytes.

Results

Duloxetine was superior to placebo in change on the HAM-D-17 (p = .009). Estimated probabilities of response and remission were 64% and 56%, respectively, for duloxetine, compared with 52% and 30% for fluoxetine and 48% and 32% for placebo. Duloxetine was numerically superior to fluoxetine on the primary and most of the secondary outcome measures. In general, duloxetine was well tolerated; 76% of patients achieved the maximum dose, and insomnia and asthenia were the only adverse events reported statistically significantly (p < .05) more frequently by duloxetine-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients.

Conclusion

These data indicate that duloxetine is efficacious for the treatment of major depressive disorder and is well tolerated and safe.

### Efficacy of duloxetine in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in patients with clinically significant pain symptoms [^61401b5c]. Depression and Anxiety (2008). Low credibility.

Anxiety disorders often are accompanied by painful physical symptoms. This report assessed the effectiveness of duloxetine in improving anxiety symptoms, pain severity, and patient functioning in adults diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), who presented with clinically significant pain symptoms. Data were pooled from two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies evaluating the efficacy of duloxetine 60–120 mg once daily compared with placebo in the treatment of GAD. The primary patient population for these analyses was patients with baseline Visual Analog Scale (VAS) overall pain severity score ≥ 30. Of the 798 randomized patients that had baseline VAS scores, approximately 44.4% of GAD patients were identified as having baseline VAS overall pain severity score ≥ 30 (duloxetine N = 208, placebo N = 146). Duloxetine-treated patients had significantly greater improvement compared with placebo-treated patients on anxiety symptoms (measured by Hamilton Anxiety Scale total score), on patient functioning (measured by the Sheehan Disability Scale Global Functional Impairment Score and across all Sheehan Disability Scale domains), and on all VAS pain items. Patients achieving remission at endpoint, and patients with lower scores on the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement and Patient Global Impression of Improvement scales had greater improvement in VAS pain severity scores. These results suggest that in patients with GAD who present with clinically significant pain symptoms, duloxetine is effective in reducing anxiety symptoms, pain severity, and in improving patient functioning.

### Paliperidone (Invega) [^fdc5eaa6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Adults

The acute efficacy of INVEGA (3 mg to 12 mg once daily) in the treatment of schizoaffective disorder was established in two placebo-controlled, 6-week trials in non-elderly adult subjects. Enrolled subjects 1) met DSM-IV criteria for schizoaffective disorder, as confirmed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders, 2) had a Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score of at least 60, and 3) had prominent mood symptoms as confirmed by a score of at least 16 on the Young Mania Rating Scale and/or Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. The population included subjects with schizoaffective bipolar and depressive types. In one of these trials, efficacy was assessed in 211 subjects who received flexible doses of INVEGA (3–12 mg once daily). In the other study, efficacy was assessed in 203 subjects who were assigned to one of two dose levels of INVEGA: 6 mg with the option to reduce to 3 mg (n = 105) or 12 mg with the option to reduce to 9 mg (n = 98) once daily. Both studies included subjects who received INVEGA either as monotherapy [no mood stabilizers and/or antidepressants (55%)] or as an adjunct to mood stabilizers and/or antidepressants (45%). The most commonly used mood stabilizers were valproate and lithium. The most commonly used antidepressants were SSRIs and SNRIs. INVEGA was dosed in the morning without regard to meals. Studies were carried out in the United States, Eastern Europe, Russia, and Asia.

### The relationship between cannabis use, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder: a genetically informed study [^17318c81]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Background

The relationship between psychotic disorders and cannabis use is heavily debated. Shared underlying genetic risk is one potential explanation. We investigated the genetic association between psychotic disorders (schizophrenia and bipolar disorder) and cannabis phenotypes (lifetime cannabis use and cannabis use disorder).

Methods

We used genome-wide association summary statistics from individuals with European ancestry from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, UK Biobank, and International Cannabis Consortium. We estimated heritability, polygenicity, and discoverability of each phenotype. We performed genome-wide and local genetic correlations. Shared loci were identified and mapped to genes, which were tested for functional enrichment. Shared genetic liabilities to psychotic disorders and cannabis phenotypes were explored using causal analyses and polygenic scores, using the Norwegian Thematically Organized Psychosis cohort.

Findings

Psychotic disorders were more heritable than cannabis phenotypes and more polygenic than cannabis use disorder. We observed positive genome-wide genetic correlations between psychotic disorders and cannabis phenotypes (range 0·22–0·35) with a mixture of positive and negative local genetic correlations. Three to 27 shared loci were identified for the psychotic disorder and cannabis phenotype pairs. Enrichment of mapped genes implicated neuronal and olfactory cells as well as drug-gene targets for nicotine, alcohol, and duloxetine. Psychotic disorders showed a causal effect on cannabis phenotypes, and lifetime cannabis use had a causal effect on bipolar disorder. Of 2181 European participants from the Norwegian Thematically Organized Psychosis cohort applied in polygenic risk score analyses, 1060 (48·6%) were females and 1121 (51·4%) were males (mean age 33·1 years [SD 11·8]). 400 participants had bipolar disorder, 697 had schizophrenia, and 1044 were healthy controls. Within this sample, polygenic scores for cannabis phenotypes predicted psychotic disorders independently and improved prediction beyond the polygenic score for the psychotic disorders.

Interpretation

A subgroup of individuals might have a high genetic risk of developing a psychotic disorder and using cannabis. This finding supports public health efforts to reduce cannabis use, particularly in individuals at high risk or patients with psychotic disorders. Identified shared loci and their functional implications could facilitate development of novel treatments.

### Duloxetine for the long-term treatment of major depressive disorder in patients aged 65 and older: an open-label study [^5ce29379]. BMC Geriatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Results from this open-label study of depressed patients aged 65 and older suggest that duloxetine is safe and well tolerated in long-term use. Statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements in all assessed efficacy measures were observed at each patient visit. Furthermore, the efficacy and adverse event profile of duloxetine appears to be comparable in older (age ≥ 65) and younger patients (age 18–64). These results, together with those obtained from acute phase, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, support the efficacy of duloxetine in the treatment of major depression in older patients.

### Eight-week antidepressant treatment reduces functional connectivity in first-episode drug-naïve patients with major depressive disorder [^a0fac993]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS AND MATERIALS

2.1 Participants

Sixty‐three right‐handed, first‐episode drug‐naïve patients with MDD recruited from the Outpatient Department of Peking University Sixth Hospital were assessed for eligibility. Diagnoses were confirmed on the basis of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (Sheehan et al. 1998) by experienced psychiatrists. Depressive symptom was assessed by experienced independent evaluators using the 17‐item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD). Inclusion required scoring 17 or above on the 17‐item HRSD, and being in a first episode of depression. None had comorbid intellectual disability, any other Axis I disorder or Axis II personality disorder, bipolar disorder, or comorbid lifetime or current diagnosis of psychotic disorder. Patients with alcohol dependence, substance dependence, or suffering from severe and unstable physical disease, and women in pregnancy or breast‐feeding were also excluded. We then made sure that the recruited patients suffered from MDD for < 2 years or did not have chronic depression. The absence of comorbidities further ensured that the MDD patients had not received other types of psychotropic treatment or medication. In our study, one SSRI (escitalopram) and one SNRI (duloxetine) were selected for investigation, because both SSRIs and SNRIs are the first‐line treatments for adult patients with MDD based on national guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder in China (Li & Ma, 2015). Fifty‐nine eligible patients were assigned to escitalopram treatment (n = 23) or duloxetine treatment (n = 36), based on investigators' clinical practice. Of these 59 patients, 10 discontinued treatment due to poor efficacy or intolerable adverse effects, and eight patients declined follow‐up scans. After their exclusion, 41 patients remained in the longitudinal study.

### A randomized, double-blind study of increasing or maintaining duloxetine dose in patients without remission of major depressive disorder after initial duloxetine therapy [^b2b002a5]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare efficacy of remaining on duloxetine 60 mg to increasing to 120 mg q.d. in patients without remission of major depressive disorder (MDD) after 6 weeks at 60 mg.

Method

This double-blind, parallel study was conducted in adults with MDD (DSM-IV-TR criteria). Patients initially randomly assigned to duloxetine 60 mg for 6 weeks with a 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17) score > 7 (nonremitters) were randomly reassigned to 60 mg or 120 mg duloxetine for 8 weeks. Patients with a HAM-D-17 score ≤ 7 (remitters) continued on duloxetine 60 mg. The primary objective was to compare time to remission (HAM-D-17 score ≤ 7) between rerandomized groups. Secondary objectives included evaluation of HAM-D-17 and Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology assessments and safety and tolerability evaluations in nonremitters and remitters. Patients were enrolled from November 2004 to January 2006.

Results

Nonremitters randomly reassigned to 60 mg and 120 mg achieved similar time to remission and similar improvements on efficacy measures. Remission was achieved in 30.0% and 30.5% in the 60-mg and 120-mg groups, respectively. Of the remitters, 85.5% continued to be in remission at study end. Other than a greater incidence of hyperhidrosis and chest pain in the 120-mg group, adverse events were similar between groups, as were discontinuations due to adverse events.

Conclusion

Nonremitters to 60 mg of duloxetine for 6 weeks randomly reassigned to 60 mg or 120 mg of duloxetine demonstrated continued symptom improvement in the 8-week extension. Patients randomly reassigned to 120 mg showed no advantage over those who continued on 60 mg. Duloxetine was well tolerated at both doses and had similar safety profiles.

### Duloxetine in treatment of anxiety symptoms associated with depression [^d765418b]. Depression and Anxiety (2003). Low credibility.

Most patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) have symptoms of anxiety associated with their depression. Duloxetine, a potent and balanced dual serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is effective in the treatmentof depression. We investigated its effects in treating the symptoms of anxiety in depressed patients. This investigation includes all the placebo-controlled studies of duloxetine in MDD but focuses on four trials in which duloxetine was superior to placebo on the primary outcome measure of the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD(17)) total score. Studies 1 and 2 included duloxetine at 60 mg/d (the recommended starting and therapeutic dose) and placebo. Study 3 included duloxetine 120 mg/d (administered as 60 mg b.i.d.), fluoxetine 20 mg/d, and placebo. Study 4 included duloxetine 40 mg/d (administered as 20 mg b.i.d.), duloxetine 80 mg/d (administered as 40 mg b.i.d.), paroxetine 20 mg/d, and placebo. Anxiety was assessed in all studies using the HAMD anxiety/somatization subfactor and the anxiety-psychic item (HAMD Item 10). Studies 3 and 4 also included the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA). Across the four studies, duloxetine at doses of ≥ 60 mg was compared with placebo on 10 outcomes and with either paroxetine or fluoxetine on 6 outcomes. In 8 comparisons, mean improvement for duloxetine was significantly greater than placebo at the last study visit and/or across all study visits. In 3 comparisons, the mean improvement for duloxetine was significantly greater than paroxetine or fluoxetine. In these studies, duloxetine provided rapid relief of anxiety symptoms associated with depression. Previous reports have summarized duloxetine's efficacy in treating the core emotional symptoms and painful physical symptoms associated with depression. Duloxetine's efficacy in treating a broad spectrum of symptoms associated with depression, including mood, anxiety, and painful physical symptoms, may be attributed to dual reuptake inhibition of both serotonin and norepinephrine. Efficacy in these three key symptom domains may in turn explain the high probabilities of remission (43–57%) observed in these studies.

### Anxiety does not predict response to duloxetine in major depression: results of a pooled analysis of individual patient data from 11 placebo-controlled trials [^40768035]. Depression and Anxiety (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Uncontrolled antidepressant trials suggest that anxious patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) are less responsive to antidepressant treatment than less anxious patients. The objective of this study is to determine whether specific antidepressant effects, estimated by drug-placebo differences, are reduced in anxious depression during treatment of MDD with duloxetine.

Methods

This is a retrospective secondary pooled analysis of all placebo-controlled trials of duloxetine at therapeutic doses conducted by the sponsor in outpatients with nonpsychotic unipolar MDD, using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). Anxious depression was defined by ≥ 7 on the anxiety/somatization factor of the HAMD. Response was defined as ≥ 50% improvement from baseline to endpoint on the HAMD. Remission was defined as an endpoint HAMD ≤ 7. Analyses were performed in the intent-to-treat sample with at least one post-treatment rating.

Results

Eleven trials included 2,841 patients of whom 1,326 were classified as anxious and 1,515 as nonanxious. Change on the HAMD was greater with duloxetine than placebo in both anxious (9.91 versus 7.55, P < .001) and nonanxious (6.65 versus 5.23, P < .001) patients. Level of anxiety had no effect on the drug-placebo differences. Response and remission rates were significantly greater in duloxetine than placebo-treated patients and drug-placebo differences were unaffected by anxious status. Use of HAMD items psychic and somatic anxiety to define anxious subgroups had similar outcomes.

Conclusions

Duloxetine was more effective than placebo in achieving response and remission in both anxious and nonanxious patients. Anxious status did not affect the magnitude of the drug effect.

### Duloxetine in the prevention of depressive recurrences: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^5c225740]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy of duloxetine 60–120 mg once daily in the prevention of depressive recurrence in outpatients with recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD).

Method

Eligible patients with at least 3 episodes of MDD (DSM-IV diagnosis) in the past 5 years received open-label duloxetine 60–120 mg/day for up to 34 weeks. Patients meeting response criteria were then randomly assigned to either duloxetine or placebo for up to 52 weeks of double-blind maintenance treatment. The primary outcome measure was time to recurrence of a major depressive episode. Safety and tolerability were assessed via analysis of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), vital signs, weight, and laboratory measures. Patients were recruited from 43 study centers in 5 European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Sweden) and the United States. The study was conducted from March 2005 to January 2008.

Results

A total of 288 patients were randomly assigned to duloxetine or placebo. Time to a depressive recurrence was significantly longer in duloxetine-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients (p < .001). During the double-blind maintenance phase, 33.1% of placebo-treated patients experienced a depressive recurrence compared with 14.4% of duloxetine-treated patients (p < .001). There were no significant differences between treatment groups in TEAEs, discontinuations due to adverse events, vital signs, or weight.

Conclusions

Treatment with duloxetine was associated with a longer time to depressive recurrence and a significantly lower recurrence rate compared with placebo.

### A randomized controlled trial of duloxetine versus placebo in the treatment of nonmajor chronic depression [^8662d8b2]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Numerous double-blind studies have assessed the efficacy of antidepressants in treating chronic depressive disorder, including dysthymic disorder, low-grade chronic depression. However, there are no double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors in chronic depressive disorder.

Method

Outpatients with chronic depressive disorder, but without concurrent major depressive disorder (MDD), were randomly assigned to prospective double-blind duloxetine (beginning at 30 mg/d, increased to a maximum dose of 120 mg/d) versus placebo for 10 weeks. Inclusion criteria were current DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of dysthymic disorder or depression not otherwise specified, age 18–75 years, and a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score ≥ 12. Exclusion criteria included current major depression. The study was conducted between August 2006 and December 2011. HDRS, Cornell Dysthymia Rating Scale (CDRS), Clinical Global Impressions (CGI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), Social Adjustment Scale (SAS), and other assessments were administered at each visit. We hypothesized that duloxetine would be superior to placebo in (1) 24-item HDRS total score, (2) the percentage of subjects classified as responders and remitters, and (3) secondary measures (CDRS, BDI, CGI). Response was defined as > 50% decrease in 24-item HDRS and CGI-Improvement scale score of 1 or 2 ("very much improved" or "much improved"). Remission was defined as HDRS-17 item score ≤ 4 and 0 on item 1 of the HDRS (depressed mood).

Results

65 subjects were enrolled, of whom 57 began medication. They ranged in age from 19 to 70 years (mean ± SD = 41.63 ± 11.22) and included 24 women and 33 men. Baseline 24-item HDRS score (mean ± SD) for both groups was 20.75 ± 4.92. After 10 weeks, duloxetine-treated subjects had significantly lower 24-item HDRS scores than placebo-treated subjects (time-by-drug group effect on analysis of variance: F1,55 = 9.43, P = 0.003). Responder and remitter analyses significantly favored duloxetine treatment. The response rate was 65.5% for duloxetine versus 25.0% for placebo (χ(2)(1) = 9.43, P = 0.003); and the remitter rate was 55.2% for duloxetine versus 14.3% for placebo (χ(2)(1) = 10.46, P = 0.002). After 10 weeks, duloxetine-treated subjects did not differ significantly better from placebo-treated subjects on the SAS (time-by-drug group effect on analysis of variance: F(1,46) = 0.35, P = 0.555) or on the GAF (time-by-drug group effect on analysis of variance: F(1,51) = .01, P = 0.922).

Conclusions

Results on the 24-item HDRS, CGI, and CDRS suggest that duloxetine is efficacious in acute treatment of chronic nonmajor depressive disorder. Response and remission rates also differed significantly, favoring duloxetine treatment, but BDI, GAF, and social functioning (Social Adjustment Scale) did not. Duloxetine appears to be effective in acute treatment of nonmajor chronic depression.

### Informing DSM-5: biological boundaries between bipolar I disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and schizophrenia [^38665958]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Pharmacotherapeutics

Response patterns to medication across different psychiatric diagnostic categories are complex. There is more than one clear case, for example, of medications being fully effective to treat all symptoms including mania and psychosis for BD I and ineffective to treat patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. As well, individuals exhibiting the same diagnostic profile and with similar presenting symptoms may respond differently to the same medications. There are still too few clear guideposts to predict optimal treatment response. Psychophamacological response data interpreted in isolation are inherently inferential in nature and thus, must be comprehended with caution. Interpretation must be integrated within a larger framework of research that defines underlying mediators or moderators of treatment response, such as behavioral or molecular genetic profiles, neuroanatomy or brain functioning. Importantly, in this section we have elected to discuss clinically observed and studied impacts of medications in broad use that highlight differences across current diagnostic categories. We will not discuss cellular receptor differences between these different medications as these are beyond the scope of this manuscript. For review and discussion of purported medication mechanisms, we refer you to Steven Stahl's Essential Psychopharmacology work.

One such example of different response patterns across psychotic disorders is lithium, approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1971 for treatment of mania and soon afterward considered a first-line treatment for bipolar disorder. Despite clear strong effectiveness studies in BD I, lithium utilized as monotherapy or as augmentation of antipsychotic medication for individuals with schizophrenia appears to be largely ineffective. A pivotal study analyzing recurrence of bipolar episodes following discontinuation of lithium maintenance treatment demonstrated that patients relapsed into mania or depression more quickly following lithium discontinuation than the individual's normal course of illness might predict. In other words, patients with bipolar disorder tend to show 'rebound' effects from abrupt discontinuation of lithium whereas patients with schizophrenia treated with lithium do not.

Divalproex, an anticonvulsant, was introduced by the FDA in 1995 for treatment of BD I mania. Similar to lithium, divalproex has minimal benefit in the treatment of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. In combination with olanzapine and risperidone, divalproex resulted in an accelerated, initial decrease in psychotic symptoms. However, a recent Cochrane analysis concluded that there were no available data to substantiate the use of divalproex as monotherapy in schizophrenia.

### Duloxetine in the treatment of binge eating disorder with depressive disorders: a placebo-controlled trial [^a7f4d3b7]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

This study evaluated duloxetine in the treatment of binge eating disorder (BED) with comorbid current depressive disorders.

Method

In this 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 40 patients with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV-TR BED and a comorbid current depressive disorder received duloxetine (N = 20) or placebo (N = 20). The primary outcome measure was weekly binge eating day frequency.

Results

In the primary analysis, duloxetine (mean 78.7 mg/day) was superior to placebo in reducing weekly frequency of binge eating days (p = .04), binge eating episodes (p = .02), weight (p = .04), and Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness ratings for binge eating (p = .02) and depressive disorders (p = .01). Changes in body mass index and measures of eating pathology, depression, and anxiety did not differ between the two groups.

Discussion

Duloxetine may be effective for reducing binge eating, weight, and global severity of illness in BED with a comorbid current depressive disorder, but this finding needs confirmation in larger, placebo-controlled trials.

### Duloxetine hydrochloride DR [^ef99452f]. FDA. Low credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of duloxetine hydrochloride DR PO (also known as Cymbalta):
- **1-naphthol toxicity**: use caution in patients with delayed gastric emptying, as extremely acidic conditions can facilitate the hydrolysis of duloxetine to form naphthol.
- **Acute angle-closure glaucoma**: use caution in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles.
- **Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome**: do not discontinue abruptly in patients taking the drug for a prolonged period.
- **Bleeding, hypertension**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as duloxetine has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events. Obtain BP monitoring. Recognize that the risk of bleeding is higher with concomitant use of aspirin, NSAIDs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants.
- **Decreased serum sodium**: use caution in all patients, especially in the elderly and in patients with volume depletion or taking diuretics. Discontinue duloxetine if symptomatic hyponatremia develops.
- **Exacerbation of increased blood glucose**: use caution in patients with diabetes.
- **Increased serum transaminases, jaundice, ALF**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as duloxetine has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events. Discontinue duloxetine if jaundice or other evidence of liver dysfunction occurs.
- **Manic or mixed episodes**: use caution in patients with major depressive disorder at risk for bipolar disorder. Screen patients for personal and family history of bipolar disorder before initiating duloxetine.
- **Orthostatic hypotension, syncope, falls**: use caution in elderly patients and in patients taking concomitant medications inducing orthostatic hypotension, potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, or receiving duloxetine doses > 60 mg/day. Reduce the dose or discontinue duloxetine as needed.
- **Seizure**: use caution in patients with seizure disorder.
- **Serotonin syndrome**: use extreme caution in patients taking other serotonergic drugs. Obtain monitoring in all patients.
- Urinary hesitancy, urinary retention, erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, anejaculation, anorgasmia: maintain a high level of suspicion, as duloxetine has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events.

### Long-term tolerability and effectiveness of duloxetine in the treatment of major depressive disorder [^12ed30af]. Depression and Anxiety (2008). Low credibility.

To examine the long-term safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of duloxetine in the treatment of major depressive disorder in a naturalistic study design meant to mimic clinical practice. Data were from the long-term, open-label, extension phase that followed a 12-week acute-treatment, multicenter study of adult outpatients with major depressive disorder. After the first week of the acute phase, all patients were treated with at least 60 mg daily duloxetine, which could be titrated to a maximum dose of 120 mg daily. Outcome measures were collected at monthly visits and included spontaneously reported adverse events, weight, vital signs, and the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating scale. Seventy-two of the 177 (40.7%) patients who entered the extension phase of this study completed the study. The mean duration of participation in the extension was 305 days, with total exposure ranging from 68 to 707 days. Of the 177 patients who entered the extension, only 12 or 13 (7.0%) showed clinically significant worsening of depression that led to study discontinuation. The mean 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating scale score remained below 7 throughout the extension. A total of 21/177 patients (11.9%) discontinued due to adverse events during extension treatment. The adverse events causing discontinuation during the extension, with the exception of weight gain, were generally not unique to the extension phase, with 11/21 patients (52.0%) discontinuing due to adverse events that were first reported during acute treatment. Weight gain was reported as a reason for discontinuation during extension treatment in 4/177 (2.3%) patients. In this open-label study, efficacy was maintained for most patients. The adverse events causing discontinuation during the extension phase were generally not unique to the extension phase. Few patients experienced significant weight gain.

### Duloxetine for the long-term treatment of major depressive disorder in patients aged 65 and older: an open-label study [^521bd516]. BMC Geriatrics (2004). Low credibility.

The incidence and pattern of treatment-emergent adverse events during Weeks 1 to 8 of this study were generally similar to those observed in acute-phase, placebo-controlled trials in older patients. The most frequently reported adverse events were nausea, dizziness, somnolence, constipation, and dry mouth. Most of the events were either mild or moderate in severity and transient in nature. During the last 44 weeks of the study, no adverse event occurred in more than 8% of the patient population and the incidence of each specific event was generally lower in the entire period from Weeks 9–52 than in the initial 8 weeks of the study. Thus, patients who tolerated duloxetine during the early period of the trial were likely to tolerate long-term dosing.

Administration of medication to elderly patients necessitates consideration of the physiological changes which accompany aging. Such changes can result in substantial differences in adverse event profiles between older and younger patient populations. In this study, comparisons between age groups (18–64 years vs. ≥ 65 years) of the most commonly reported treatment emergent adverse events revealed significant differences only in the rates of insomnia and headache. Furthermore, in each of these cases the higher rates were observed in the younger age group. In the absence of a placebo control arm these results must be viewed with an appropriate degree of caution, but they provide an indication that the adverse event profile for duloxetine in the elderly may be similar to that observed in younger patients.

### Citalopram augmentation for subsyndromal symptoms of depression in middle-aged and older outpatients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder: a randomized controlled trial [^198cd92b]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Subsyndromal symptoms of depression (SSD) in older outpatients with schizophrenia are common and clinically important. While many physicians prescribe antidepressants to patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder who have SSD, evidence for their effectiveness and safety has been meager. We describe a randomized placebo-controlled trial of citalopram in 198 patients.

Method

Participants in this 2-site study, conducted from September 1, 2001, to August 31, 2007, were men and women with DSM-IV schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were 40 years of age or older and who met study criteria for SSD. Patients were randomly assigned to flexible-dose treatment with citalopram or placebo augmentation of their current antipsychotic medication. Analysis of covariance was used to compare improvement in scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and Calgary Depression Rating Scale between treatment groups; secondary efficacy analyses compared improvement in several other dimensions of schizophrenia.

Results

Augmentation with citalopram was significantly more effective than with placebo in improving depressive (p = .002) and negative (p = .049) symptoms, mental functioning (p = .000), and quality of life (p = .046). There were no significant differences between citalopram and placebo in suicidal ideation, positive symptoms, cognition, general medical health, physical functioning, or symptoms of movement disorders. No adverse events were more frequent in participants receiving citalopram than in those receiving placebo, and only 4 participants from each treatment group terminated early because of side effects.

Conclusions

Subsyndromal symptoms of depression in middle aged and older patients with schizophrenia responded to treatment with citalopram with lessening of depressive symptoms and improved functioning and quality of life. It may be important for clinicians to identify and treat SSD in middle-aged and older patients with chronic schizophrenia.

### Apathy in currently nondepressed patients treated with a SSRI for a major depressive episode: outcomes following randomized switch to either duloxetine or escitalopram [^cfa9fc7c]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2012). Low credibility.

Apathy in the context of treated major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common but understudied symptom. This multicenter, double-blind, randomized study investigated whether switching from a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) to a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), compared with switching to another SSRI, improved apathy symptoms in patients who had been treated with a SSRI for MDD for ≥ 3 months, were no longer depressed (Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] total score ≤ 15), and continued to have apathy (Apathy Evaluation Scale — Clinician rated version [AES-C] total score > 30). Following 8 weeks of treatment, both the duloxetine (SNRI, 244 patients) and escitalopram (SSRI, 239 patients) groups significantly improved from baseline on the AES-C total score (least squares mean change [standard error]: duloxetine -13.9 [0.54]; escitalopram -13.5 [0.54], both P < 0.001), and on the secondary apathy, depression, and functional outcomes. There were no significant differences between the two groups on any measure, including AES-C total score (least squares mean difference [95% confidence interval]: -0.4 [-1.87 to 1.10], P = 0.612; primary objective). There was a significant within-group improvement in apathy in the subgroup who received escitalopram before and during the study. There were few differences in safety between the two groups. This study did not support the hypothesis that switching from a SSRI to a SNRI has a beneficial effect on apathy symptoms. However, given the study limitations, it is possible that more specific targeting of the noradrenergic pathway would be of benefit.

### Informing DSM-5: biological boundaries between bipolar I disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and schizophrenia [^4d2daf7e]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Response to lamotrigine in different psychotic disorders is also pertinent to a discussion about potentially merging schizophrenia and BD I. Lamotrigine was approved by the FDA in 2003 for the prevention of new episodes of mania or depression in BD I. Although early reports of adjunctive use of lamotrigine to treat schizophrenia were positive, it was, in fact, shown to be no more efficacious than placebo (as an add-on agent) in two recently conducted trials.

Finally, the use of both typical and second generation (atypical) antipsychotics in the treatment of various psychotic disorders should be considered. From the 1960s to 1980s, before lithium was approved by the FDA and widely used, typical antipsychotics, such as haloperidol or fluphenazine, were generally regarded as the only available first-line medications for the treatment of mania. Some evidence suggests that patients with BD I treated with typical antipsychotics may be more sensitive to serious side effect profiles including neuroleptic malignant syndrome than patients with schizophrenia. Because of unexpected, broad effectiveness and — at least before potential metabolic side effects were noted — comparably favorable side effect profiles, second generation antipsychotics are frequent choices in schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and BD I. At a minimum, all work reasonably well as antipsychotic agents in treating these disorders, despite acting across a range of receptor systems (for example, serotonin, dopaminergic, and so on), and having heterogenous side effect profiles.

### Duloxetine for the long-term treatment of major depressive disorder in patients aged 65 and older: an open-label study [^df71da21]. BMC Geriatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Safety measures

Safety measures included spontaneously reported adverse events, serious adverse events (events that led to outcome of death, inpatient hospitalization, cancer, severe or permanent disability, congenital abnormality, or life-threatening condition), vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and laboratory analyses. Adverse events and vital signs were collected at each visit.

Lilly reference ranges were used to define limits for abnormal laboratory values, and potentially clinically significant (PCS) changes in selected laboratory analytes. PCS changes in blood pressure were defined as follows:

(i) Low supine (or standing) systolic BP: ≤ 90 mm Hg and a decrease from baseline of ≥ 20 mm Hg;

(ii) High supine (or standing) systolic BP: ≥ 180 mm Hg and an increase from baseline of ≥ 20 mm Hg

(iii) Low supine (or standing) diastolic BP: ≤ 50 mm Hg and a decrease from baseline of ≥ 15 mm Hg;

(iv) High supine (or standing) diastolic BP: ≥ 105 mm Hg and an increase from baseline of ≥ 15 mm Hg.

Patients were considered hypertensive at baseline if they had a historical diagnosis, secondary condition, or adverse event at the baseline visit consistent with a clinical diagnosis of hypertension or high blood pressure.

ECGs were collected at baseline and Weeks 4, 28, 52 or at early discontinuation. Patients at 2 sites in Mexico and 1 site in Columbia also had ECGs over-read by a cardiologist at a central location. For these ECGs, QT intervals were corrected (QTc) using Fridericia's correction (QTcF). All other patients had ECGs read by the site for classification as either normal or abnormal. Limits for PCS QTc values were an increase in QTcF of ≥ 30 msec and any postbaseline value ≥ 450 msec for males or ≥ 470 msec for females.

Statistical analyses

Mean changes from baseline to last observation in laboratory analytes, vital signs, and ECG intervals were assessed using ANOVA with models that included investigator. Longitudinal mean changes and categorical changes (temporal patterns) were assessed via a likelihood-based repeated measures approach. Models for mean changes included investigator, visit, baseline value, and baseline-by-visit interaction.

Mean change in CGI-S score was compared between younger (age < 65) and elderly (age ≥ 65) patients using the repeated measures analysis as previously described, with age group and age group-by-visit interaction added to the model. Differences between young and elderly patients in rates of treatment emergent adverse events were assessed using Fisher's exact test.

Literature Search

The search was conducted externally by a professional information specialist, the Nottinghamshire Healthcare Foundation Trust (see Acknowledgments). A comprehensive search of major bibliographic databases was performed in the following databases: The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Global Index Medicus. The search strategy was aligned with the PICO terms, and systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials published from 2014 onwards were targetted: Pharmacological and psychological/psychosocial interventions were compared with any other interventions, placebo, or waiting list in people with psychotic disorders (including first episode psychosis, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder). The flow chart for each updated PICO question can be found in appendix figures 1–6.

Grading of the Evidence

The quality of the evidence of the studies was evaluated following the GRADE methodology. The quality assessment includes study design, and grading of risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. The quality of evidence is graded for each patient-important outcome, and afterward, the overall quality of evidence is assessed across outcomes (ie, the body of evidence). The GDG and the Steering Group select critical and important patient outcomes that will guide the evidence. According to GRADE for guideline panels, the quality of evidence indicates the level of confidence we have in an estimate of the effect and its ability to support a specific recommendation. The quality of a body of evidence is classified into 1 of 4 grades:

High: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.
Moderate: We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.
Low: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.
Very low: We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.

Mixed features

Depressive symptoms co‐occur alongside mania in 10%‐30% of cases, 200, 201 with studies suggesting mixed features are indicative of a more severe and disabling course, as well as a higher rate of suicide. 201, 202 Evidence supports the preferential use of atypical antipsychotics and divalproex in these cases, with combination therapy frequently required. 195, 203 Atypical antipsychotics such as asenapine, aripiprazole, olanzapine and ziprasidone have been shown to be equally effective in treating manic symptoms in those with classical mania as well as in mixed mania or in manic patients with mixed features. 196, 204, 205

Psychotic features (mood congruent or incongruent)

At least half of manic episodes are characterized by the presence of psychosis, 206 and theories suggest that it is a nonspecific feature which improves alongside underlying manic symptoms. 207 While the prognosis for patients experiencing mood‐congruent psychotic features may not differ from those with an absence of psychotic symptoms, limited evidence does suggest that those with mood‐incongruent features have a more severe illness with poorer long‐term prognosis. 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212 There is no evidence of superiority of any first‐line monotherapy treatment in comparison to other monotherapy options in treating patients with psychotic features. Similarly, there is no evidence that any first‐line combination therapy of lithium or divalproex plus an atypical antipsychotic is more effective than other first‐line combination therapy. 174, 193, 213, 214 However, clinical experience suggests that the combination of lithium or divalproex plus an atypical antipsychotic is more appropriate for manic patients with mood‐incongruent psychotic features (ie, other than grandiose delusions). Similarly, in patients where the diagnostic possibility of schizoaffective disorder with manic symptoms is considered, either use of an atypical antipsychotic or combination of an atypical antipsychotic with a mood stabilizer is more appropriate.

### Effectiveness of vortioxetine in elderly patients with major depressive disorder in real-world clinical practice: results from the RELIEVE study [^45e5222b]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Depression is a psychiatric disorder experienced by an estimated 280 million people worldwide. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is marked by significant impairments in psychosocial functioning, which can persist despite improvements in disease severity. Thus, in addition to alleviating depressive symptoms, improving psychosocial functioning has become a critical treatment goal for patients with MDD. Elderly people are disproportionately affected by MDD, with a global prevalence of 13.3% compared with a prevalence of approximately 5% in the general population. Because of the strong correlation between cognitive and physical impairments and depression, elderly people are at greater risk of developing depression. Furthermore, depression, other mental health conditions (e.g. schizophrenia and anxiety disorders), and perceived stress are all predictors of suicide in elderly populations. Among the elderly, women are more likely to experience depression than men, but suicide is more common in elderly men than in elderly women, with older age, male sex, and White race representing the most common demographic characteristics for suicide risk.

Cognitive dysfunction, along with physical impairments, is likely to represent a crucial factor underlying impaired psychosocial functioning in older populations. Mounting evidence has shown significant clinical differences between depressive disorders that first manifest in adolescence or early adult life (i.e. early-onset depression) compared with an initial presentation in middle age or late life (i.e. late-onset depression). Within elderly populations, patients with late-onset depression experience more extensive cognitive impairment than patients with early-onset or a history of depression. Cognitive issues, such as memory and cognitive processing alterations, can cause anxiety in elderly patients and confound depressive symptoms. Additionally, depression can also lead to cognitive deficits and precede neurodegenerative disorders such as all-cause dementia, vascular dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. The prevalence of neurological or psychiatric comorbidities can result in undertreatment of depression in elderly populations due to underdiagnosis and misrecognition of depressive symptoms.

### Are antipsychotics or antidepressants needed for psychotic depression? A systematic review and meta-analysis of trials comparing antidepressant or antipsychotic monotherapy with combination treatment [^3789eed7]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To perform a meta-analysis of antidepressant-antipsychotic cotreatment versus antidepressant or antipsychotic monotherapy for psychotic depression.

Data Sources

We performed an electronic search (from inception of databases until February 28, 2011) in PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO, without language or time restrictions. Search terms were (psychosis OR psychotic OR hallucinations OR hallucinating OR delusions OR delusional) AND (depression OR depressed OR major depressive disorder) AND (random OR randomized OR randomly).

Study Selection

Eight randomized, placebo-controlled acute-phase studies in adults (N = 762) with standardized criteria-defined psychotic depression (including Research Diagnostic Criteria, DSM-III, DSM-IV, or ICD-10) were meta-analyzed, yielding 10 comparisons. Antidepressant-antipsychotic cotreatment was compared in 5 trials with 6 treatment arms (n = 337) with antidepressant monotherapy and in 4 trials with 4 treatment arms (n = 447) with antipsychotic monotherapy.

Data Extraction

Primary outcome was study-defined inefficacy; secondary outcomes included all-cause discontinuation, specific psychopathology ratings, and side effects. Using random effects models, we calculated relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), number-needed-to-treat/harm (NNT/NNH), and effect size (ES).

Results

Antidepressant-antipsychotic cotreatment outperformed antidepressant monotherapy regarding less study-defined inefficacy (no. of comparisons = 6; n = 378; RR = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59–0.98; P = 0.03; heterogeneity [I2] = 34%) (NNT = 7; 95% CI, 4–20; P = 0.009) and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scores (no. of comparisons = 4; n = 289; ES = -0.25; 95% CI, -0.49 to -0.02; P = 0.03; I2 = 0%), with trend-level superiority for depression ratings (no. of comparisons = 5; n = 324; ES = -0.20; 95% CI, -0.44 to 0.03; P = 0.09; I2 = 10%), but not regarding psychosis ratings (no. of comparisons = 3; n = 161; ES = -0.24; 95% CI, -0.85 to 0.38; P = 0.45; I2 = 70%). Antidepressant-antipsychotic cotreatment also outperformed antipsychotic monotherapy regarding less study-defined inefficacy (no. of comparisons = 4; n = 447; RR = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.63–0.84; P < .0001; I2 = 0%) (NNT = 5; 95% CI, 4–8; P < .0001) and depression ratings (no. of comparisons = 4; n = 428; ES = -0.49; 95% CI, -0.75 to -0.23; P = 0.0002; I2 = 27%), while anxiety (P = 0.11) and psychosis (P = 0.06) ratings only trended toward favoring cotreatment. All-cause discontinuation and reported side-effect rates were similar, except for more somnolence with antidepressant-antipsychotic cotreatment versus antidepressants (P = 0.02). Only 1 open-label, 4-month extension study (n = 59) assessed maintenance/relapse-prevention efficacy of antidepressant-antipsychotic cotreatment versus antidepressant monotherapy, without group differences.

Conclusions

Antidepressant-antipsychotic cotreatment was superior to monotherapy with either drug class in the acute treatment of psychotic depression. These results support recent treatment guidelines, but more studies are needed to assess specific combinations and maintenance/relapse-prevention efficacy.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^8527f77d]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Children and adolescents with anxiety disorders — serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) can be considered among treatments offered to patients 6 to 18 years old with social anxiety, generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, and panic disorders. Medications from the SNRI class currently marketed in the United States are venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, and levomilnacipran; atomoxetine is not further addressed because the effectiveness of atomoxetine for the treatment of anxiety as the primary disorder has not been established. Duloxetine is the only SNRI to have an FDA indication for the treatment of any anxiety disorder (specifically, generalized anxiety disorder in children and adolescents 7–17 years old). For dosing, venlafaxine extended release, desvenlafaxine, and duloxetine have sufficiently long elimination half-lives to permit single daily dosing, whereas venlafaxine immediate release may require twice- or thrice-daily dosing. Adverse effects of SNRIs can include diaphoresis, dry mouth, abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, tremor, insomnia, somnolence, decreased appetite, weight loss, sustained clinical hypertension, increased blood pressure, and increased pulse; uncommon but potentially serious adverse effects include suicidal thinking and behavior (through age 24 years), behavioral activation/agitation, hypomania, mania, sexual dysfunction, seizures, abnormal bleeding, and serotonin syndrome. Venlafaxine may be associated with greater suicide risk than the other SNRIs, both venlafaxine and desvenlafaxine have been associated with overdose fatalities, and venlafaxine also has been associated with discontinuation symptoms. Duloxetine has been associated with hepatic failure and cholestatic jaundice, and duloxetine should be discontinued and not restarted in patients who develop jaundice or other evidence of clinically significant liver dysfunction; severe skin reactions can occur and accordingly duloxetine should be discontinued and not restarted at the first appearance of blisters, peeling rash, mucosal erosions, or other signs of hypersensitivity. Concomitant administration of any of the SNRIs and any of the MAOIs is contraindicated because of increased risk of serotonin syndrome; duloxetine may interact with drugs metabolized by CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, and compared to SSRIs, venlafaxine may have the least effect on the CYP450 system. At present, there is no clear role for pharmacogenomic testing in medication choice.

### The short-and long-term effect of duloxetine on painful physical symptoms in patients with generalized anxiety disorder: results from three clinical trials [^537ae3bf]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is associated with painful physical symptoms (PPS). These post hoc analyses of previous trial data assessed PPS and their response to duloxetine treatment in GAD patients. Studies 1 and 2 (n = 840) were 9- to 10-week efficacy trials; study 3 (n = 887) was a relapse prevention trial comprising a 26-week open-label treatment phase and a 26-week double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment continuation phase. Mean baseline visual analog scale scores (VAS, 0–100; n = 1727) ranged from 26 to 37 for overall pain, headache, back pain, shoulder pain, interference with daily activities, and time in pain while awake. In studies 1 and 2, improvement on all VAS scores was greater in duloxetine-treated than in placebo-treated patients (p ≤ 0.01). In study 3, pain symptoms worsened in responders switched to placebo compared with those maintained on duloxetine (p ≤ 0.02). In conclusion, duloxetine was efficacious in the short- and long-term treatment of PPS, which are common in GAD patients.

### Efficacy of adjunctive antidepressants in treating negative symptoms of schizophrenia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^63c5cb39]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Antidepressants are primarily classified into categories such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) reuptake blockers, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin antagonists and reuptake inhibitors, serotonin modulators and agonists, and NE and dopamine reuptake inhibitors. The diverse mechanisms of these drugs suggest their potential in treating schizophrenia's negative symptoms. Past research has suggested that antidepressants may influence schizophrenia's negative symptoms through their effects on γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate neurotransmitters (Pehrson et al.), as well as their action on multiple neurotransmitters like dopamine. A key characteristic of schizophrenia is the altered activity of the dopamine system in different brain regions, which gives rise to various symptom profiles. Antidepressants also target post-synaptic 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT3) receptors and presynaptic α2-adrenergic receptors and indirectly stimulate post-synaptic 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) receptor 1A (5-HT1A) receptors (de Boer,), all of which are implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Preceding evidence suggests that 5-HT3 receptor antagonists hold promise for treating schizophrenia due to their potential therapeutic benefits (Costall & Naylor).

Previous meta-analyses have indicated that the combination of antipsychotic and antidepressant treatment may be effective for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia (Galling et al; Rummel et al.). The driving factor for overall symptom improvement is the negative symptoms, rather than the reduction of positive symptoms or total symptom severity. It was also found that antidepressants have demonstrated an advantage in improving negative symptoms in studies involving the addition of first-generation antipsychotics, but this was not confirmed in studies involving the addition of second-generation antipsychotics.

However, so far, the efficacy of antidepressants in the treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia is still controversial. Although most studies have shown that antidepressants are effective in the treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia, several studies have shown that antidepressants cannot improve negative symptoms of schizophrenia (Sepehry et al; Singh et al; Usall et al.). These contradictory results may be accounted for by methodological limitations: small sample, short trial length, a range of concomitant antipsychotic regimens, or lack of exclusion of subjects with depressive symptoms. Given the current scenario, the effectiveness of antipsychotic medications in addressing the negative symptoms of schizophrenia is restricted, prompting a shift toward combined therapies, where the use of adjunctive antidepressants emerges as a beneficial strategy.
