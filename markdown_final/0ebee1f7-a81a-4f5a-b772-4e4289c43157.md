## Question

What is abdominal compartment syndrome?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the consensus diagnostic definition and thresholds that distinguish ACS from intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH). Then, I should verify the pathophysiology linking elevated pressure to multi-organ dysfunction. Next, I will review etiologies and risk factors to frame pretest probability. After that, I must confirm how to measure intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and define objective diagnostic criteria. Then, I will examine management, escalating from medical to surgical decompression. I should also consider special populations, and finally, I need to summarize outcomes and prognosis while ensuring all statements are tied to guideline-grade sources and key studies [^111YWo2x].

> Let me first confirm the consensus definition so I do not misstate it. ACS is defined by WSACS as a sustained IAP greater than 20 mmHg with new or worsening organ dysfunction or failure, which is distinct from IAH, defined as IAP at or above 12 mmHg and graded in severity; I almost said APP less than 60 mmHg was required, but wait, I should correct myself, because WSACS does not mandate APP for diagnosis even if APP can be a useful physiologic adjunct, so I need to keep APP optional and not diagnostic [^111YWo2x] [^112YMpCi] [^1128UXoZ] [^115ZsmMt].

> Hold on, I should verify pediatric thresholds because they are lower and often misapplied from adult criteria. In children, ACS is typically considered at IAP greater than 10 mmHg with associated organ dysfunction given their lower baseline IAP, so I need to ensure I use pediatric-specific cutoffs and maintain a higher index of suspicion in that population [^112KwwPW] [^115t2tGf].

> Next, I will think through the pathophysiology so the clinical manifestations make mechanistic sense. Elevated IAP compresses venous return and splanchnic arterial inflow, reducing organ perfusion; the kidney is especially vulnerable, leading to oliguria or anuria, while cardiopulmonary interactions include reduced preload, elevated intrathoracic pressure, and impaired ventilation from diaphragmatic cephalad shift, with potential secondary intracranial hypertension from impaired cerebral venous return; this polycompartment effect explains rapid multisystem decompensation, and I should emphasize the cascade because it justifies early intervention [^116qbnn7] [^113Z2wZD] [^1131iAAL] [^116v2xiV].

> I need to check etiologies and risk factors to guide when to measure IAP. Primary ACS arises from intra-abdominal catastrophes such as trauma, hemorrhage, bowel obstruction, pancreatitis, and closure under tension, whereas secondary ACS follows extra-abdominal insults with massive fluid resuscitation, capillary leak, and bowel edema; additional contributors include mechanical ventilation with auto-PEEP, tight binders, prone positioning, and reduced abdominal wall compliance, so I should stratify patients who warrant surveillance and serial measurements [^113kBuP8] [^113C3bwp] [^113mWGSn].

> Let me consider the clinical picture but avoid overreliance on the exam. A tense, distended abdomen, rising ventilatory pressures with decreased compliance, oliguria despite adequate volume, hypotension, and metabolic acidosis should trigger suspicion, yet wait, I must not jump to conclusions because physical examination has low sensitivity, so objective IAP measurement is required to confirm the syndrome and grade severity over time [^114LRMx5] [^1131iAAL] [^113x4ua6].

> I will now examine the diagnostic method to quantify IAP accurately. The reference standard is intravesical (bladder) pressure with 20–25 mL of sterile saline instilled, measured at end-expiration with the patient supine and the symphysis or iliac crest as the zero reference; I should double-check frequency and, yes, at-risk patients should have intermittent measurements every 4–6 hours, while alternative intragastric and newer continuous devices exist but require further validation before routine adoption [^111qx1kM] [^116tS9zX] [^111YWo2x].

> Let me first confirm the criteria to call it ACS rather than IAH. Documentation should show sustained IAP above 20 mmHg on serial checks plus clear evidence of new or worsening organ dysfunction, such as falling urine output, rising creatinine, hypoxemia or hypercapnia, hemodynamic compromise, or worsening acidosis; I need to ensure both elements are present before labeling ACS, and I should record the trend rather than a single transient spike [^111YWo2x] [^112YMpCi].

> Next, I should review nonoperative management to reduce IAP while preparing for definitive therapy if needed. Evacuating intraluminal contents with nasogastric and rectal decompression is prudent, and for refractory colonic pseudo-obstruction I should consider neostigmine; evacuating intraperitoneal fluid with image-guided percutaneous drainage can meaningfully lower IAP when ascites or hematoma is present; improving abdominal wall compliance with adequate analgesia and sedation, and if necessary a brief trial of neuromuscular blockade, can buy time; optimizing fluid balance with protocolized efforts to avoid a positive cumulative balance after initial resuscitation, including diuretics or ultrafiltration in stable patients, is important; and I need to remember that raising the head of bed can spuriously elevate IAP, so positioning matters in management and measurement [^113ViEZw] [^114fKsj1] [^113yMjsT] [^113CWMcb] [^116r69YP] [^114co7y1] [^114BTMYX] [^113dJe4r] [^113YUeZ4].

> But wait, I should verify when to escalate, because delays worsen outcomes. Decompressive laparotomy is indicated for overt ACS or refractory IAH with progressive organ dysfunction despite optimized medical therapy, and technique typically involves midline laparotomy with temporary abdominal closure using negative-pressure therapy, followed by concerted efforts to achieve early or at least same-hospital-stay primary fascial closure; in selected high-risk trauma scenarios, a prophylactic open abdomen may be considered, whereas routine use in contaminated sepsis without specific concern for IAH should be avoided, so I need to individualize based on risk and trajectory [^112dd65f] [^111oEGPW] [^111sbw8L] [^115U6n5k] [^111i3Ch8].

> I should double-check special populations and contexts so I do not overgeneralize. In pediatrics, lower thresholds and high mortality demand earlier measurement and escalation; in obesity and pregnancy, normal IAP may be higher and the impact of IAH/ACS is less well defined, so I need to interpret values in context; patients with severe acute pancreatitis, major burns, or transplant are at particular risk for secondary ACS and warrant routine IAP surveillance and a step-up approach with timely decompression if nonoperative measures fail [^112KwwPW] [^114o2Z7U] [^115L56bU] [^113exSsD] [^111bh46M].

> Now, I should review outcomes to set expectations and underscore the value of early action. Even with decompressive laparotomy, 28-day mortality around one-third and one-year mortality around one-half have been observed, with survivors showing early improvements in organ function that non-survivors often do not; importantly, protocolized recognition, serial IAP monitoring, and timely escalation have been associated with improved survival and more frequent primary fascial closure, so delays in diagnosis and decompression can lead to irreversible multi-organ failure [^11379Bh8] [^111we5uH] [^112879gn] [^113VQ8kP].

> Final check before summarizing: ACS is not merely a pressure threshold but a syndrome defined by sustained IAP elevation with organ dysfunction, confirmed by standardized intravesical measurements in at-risk patients; management should proceed along an evidence-informed algorithm from evacuating contents and optimizing compliance and fluid balance to decompressive laparotomy with temporary closure and early fascial restoration, applied with special attention to pediatric and high-risk populations; I need to anchor practice to WSACS and WSES guidance to minimize morbidity and mortality and to act decisively when organ dysfunction emerges [^111YWo2x] [^112dd65f] [^116tS9zX].

The **definition** of abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is sustained intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) > 20 mmHg with new organ dysfunction or failure [^111YWo2x] [^1128UXoZ]. Who is at risk: ACS is most common in **critically ill or trauma patients** [^1131iAAL] after massive resuscitation [^113kBuP8], major abdominal surgery, severe pancreatitis [^115L56bU], or burns [^111YWo2x]. Diagnosis requires serial IAP measurements — typically via the bladder [^116tS9zX] — as clinical examination alone is unreliable [^111YWo2x] [^111qx1kM].

The **initial management focus** is medical measures (sedation [^116r69YP], neuromuscular blockade [^114co7y1], nasogastric/rectal decompression [^113ViEZw], fluid restriction [^114BTMYX] [^113TvNFP], percutaneous drainage [^113CWMcb]) [^114BADYf]. If IAP remains > 20 mmHg with ongoing organ dysfunction [^112YMpCi], decompressive laparotomy is indicated [^112dd65f] [^11379Bh8]. Early recognition and intervention are critical [^115QkdUv], as mortality remains high (40–70%) even with treatment [^1131iAAL] [^1133Pxzp].

---

## Pathophysiology

The **mechanism** of ACS is sustained elevation of IAP, which reduces venous return, decreases cardiac output, increases systemic vascular resistance, and impairs organ perfusion [^113d8xnA]. This triggers a cascade of ischemia, inflammation, and multi-organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury [^113Z2wZD], respiratory failure, and cardiovascular collapse [^111YWo2x] [^1131iAAL].

---

## Risk factors and causes

For **classification**, ACS is categorized as primary, secondary, or tertiary. Primary ACS involves direct intra-abdominal injury or pathology (e.g. trauma, ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, severe pancreatitis [^115L56bU], major abdominal surgery) [^111YWo2x]. Secondary ACS results from indirect causes such as massive fluid resuscitation [^113C3bwp], severe burns, sepsis, or extra-abdominal trauma [^1131iAAL] [^111YWo2x]. Tertiary ACS refers to recurrent ACS after previous surgical decompression or open abdomen management [^111YWo2x].

---

## Clinical presentation

ACS presents with the following signs and symptoms:

- **Abdominal distension**: Firm, tense abdomen [^114LRMx5].

- **Respiratory distress**: Increased peak inspiratory pressures, hypoxia, hypercapnia [^113d8xnA].

- **Cardiovascular instability**: Hypotension, tachycardia, decreased cardiac output [^1131iAAL].

- **Renal dysfunction**: Oliguria or anuria, acute kidney injury [^113Z2wZD].

- **Neurological impairment**: Altered mental status, increased intracranial pressure [^111YWo2x].

---

## Diagnosis

The **diagnosis** of ACS relies on objective IAP measurement because clinical examination alone is unreliable [^111YWo2x] [^114LRMx5]. The gold standard is intrvesical (bladder) pressure measurement, typically performed every 4–6 hours in at-risk patients [^116tS9zX] [^111qx1kM]. ACS is defined as sustained IAP > 20 mmHg with new organ dysfunction or failure [^111YWo2x] [^1128UXoZ].

---

## Management

The **management approach** is stepwise: begin with medical management and escalate to surgical intervention if necessary [^116qbnn7]:

---

### Medical management

- **Sedation and analgesia**: Reduce abdominal wall muscle tone and improve compliance [^114co7y1] [^116r69YP].

- **Neuromuscular blockade**: Temporizing measure to reduce IAP [^114co7y1] [^114BADYf].

- **Nasogastric and rectal decompression**: Evacuate intraluminal contents [^113ViEZw].

- **Fluid management**: Avoid positive fluid balance after initial resuscitation [^114BTMYX] [^113TvNFP].

- **Percutaneous catheter drainage**: Remove intra-abdominal fluid collections [^113CWMcb] [^116v2xiV].

---

### Surgical management

For **indications and technique**, surgical management centers on decompressive laparotomy when medical measures fail and IAP remains > 20 mmHg with ongoing organ dysfunction [^112YMpCi] [^112dd65f]. Temporary open abdomen techniques, such as negative pressure wound therapy, are recommended for abdominal closure [^111oEGPW]. Early fascial closure is attempted once the patient is stabilized and IAP has normalized [^116DkUrW] [^111sbw8L].

---

## Complications

Regarding **complications**, ACS is associated with multi-organ dysfunction, including respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and cardiovascular collapse [^113d8xnA] [^113Z2wZD]. Infectious complications — such as sepsis, wound infections, and intra-abdominal abscesses — can occur [^1131iAAL], often leading to prolonged ICU stay with increased morbidity and mortality [^11379Bh8].

---

## Prognosis

The **prognosis** depends on early recognition and timely, effective management [^116qbnn7]. Mortality remains high at 40%–70%, even with appropriate treatment [^1131iAAL] [^1133Pxzp]. Early decompressive laparotomy and aggressive medical management can significantly improve outcomes [^112879gn] [^115QkdUv].

---

## Prevention

For **prevention**, key strategies include:

- **Early identification**: Recognize at-risk patients and monitor IAP regularly [^111YWo2x] [^117FLSwj].

- **Fluid management**: Avoid excessive fluid resuscitation and maintain neutral fluid balance [^114BTMYX] [^113TvNFP].

- **Open abdomen approach**: Consider prophylactic open abdomen in high-risk trauma patients [^115U6n5k] [^117Tcwkr].

- **Multidisciplinary approach**: Involve critical care, surgery, and nursing teams in management [^1131iAAL] [^116qbnn7].

---

The **bottom line**: abdominal compartment syndrome is a critical condition characterized by sustained elevated intra-abdominal pressure leading to multi-organ dysfunction. Early recognition, accurate diagnosis, and prompt management are essential to improve patient outcomes and reduce mortality [^111YWo2x].

Compartment syndromes can occur in many body regions. Abdominal compartment syndrome, initially described many years ago, has become increasingly recognized in critical care patients. The key points regarding its definition, pathophysiology, etiology, and treatment are described and discussed. Abdominal compartment syndrome is defined as an intra-abdominal pressure greater than 20 mm Hg with evidence of organ dysfunction. At-risk patients should be identified in the emergency department, and early monitoring of intra-abdominal pressure should be instituted. Interventions in the emergency department potentially contribute to the development of abdominal compartment syndrome during subsequent phases of care. Ensuring an early multidisciplinary approach in managing this complex condition is essential for the best possible patient outcome.

Management of intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) includes several strategies. In addition to decompressive laparotomy for ACS, numerous medical and minimally invasive therapies have been proposed or studied that may be beneficial for patients with IAH or ACS. Approaches of potential utility include sedation and analgesia, neuromuscular blockade, body positioning, nasogastric/colonic decompression, promotility agents, diuretics, continuous renal replacement therapies, fluid resuscitation strategies, percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD), and different temporary abdominal closure (TAC) techniques for those requiring an open abdomen.

### Abdominal compartment syndrome in acute pancreatitis: a systematic review [^1133Pxzp]. Pancreas (2014). Low credibility.

Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is a lethal complication of acute pancreatitis. We performed a systematic review to assess the treatment and outcomes of these patients. A systematic literature search for cohorts of patients with acute pancreatitis and ACS was performed. The main outcomes were the number of patients with ACS, radiologic and surgical interventions, morbidity, mortality, and methodological quality. After screening 169 articles, 7 studies were included. Three studies were prospective, and 4 studies were retrospective. The overall methodological quality of the studies was moderate to low.

The pooled data consisted of 271 patients, of whom 103 (38%) developed ACS. Percutaneous drainage of intraabdominal fluid was reported as the first intervention in 11 (11%) patients. Additional decompressive laparotomy was performed in 8 patients. Decompressive laparotomy was performed in a total of 76 (74%) patients. The median decrease in intraabdominal pressure was 15 mm Hg (range, 33–18 mm Hg). Mortality in acute pancreatitis patients with ACS was 49% versus 11% without ACS. Morbidity ranged from 17% to 90%.

Abdominal compartment syndrome during acute pancreatitis is associated with high mortality and morbidity. Studies are relatively small and have methodological shortcomings. The optimal timing and method of invasive interventions, as well as their effect on clinical outcomes, should be further evaluated.

### International cross-sectional survey on current and updated definitions of intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome [^111qx1kM]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) measurement through the intravesical route using an instillation volume of 20–25 mL of sterile saline is widely used and is currently considered a reference standard. Despite this agreement, respondents expressed divergent opinions on the optimal volume of saline. The intragastric route, using a 50–75 mL instillation volume, has been suggested as a valid alternative for IAP measurement. However, the statement failed to reach the desired agreement because respondents emphasized the need for further validation, clear guidelines, and evidence supporting its use.

Bladder or intragastric routes are traditionally the preferred techniques for continuously monitoring IAP. The WSACS guidelines recommend intermittent IAP measurement every 4–6 hours in those with suspected or confirmed intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) or abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). Recently, newer techniques of continuous IAP measurement have been tested with conflicting results. However, recent in vitro, animal, and first-in-human validation results with TraumaGuard and Serenno devices seem promising. Despite using different methods for continuous IAP measurement, the gold standard has yet to be identified.

Continuous intra-abdominal pressure (CIAP) monitoring, which offers numerous benefits that enhance care and outcomes, is essential for managing critically ill patients in the twenty-first century. CIAP allows real-time trend monitoring of the IAP, enabling clinicians to observe dynamic changes and prompt timely interventions to prevent complications. It captures the effects of body position changes on the IAP, aiding patient management.

### Secondary abdominal compartment syndrome: a potential threat for all trauma clinicians [^113C3bwp]. Injury (2007). Low credibility.

Post-injury abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is an increasingly recognized phenomenon in critical care. During the last decade, ACS has also been characterized in patients without abdominal injuries, referred to as secondary ACS. Recent investigations have better described this elusive syndrome, revealing up to 70% mortality. Regardless of the cause of the syndrome and the nature of any extra-abdominal injuries, secondary ACS is invariably associated with massive fluid resuscitation.

With a reliable predictive model and new monitoring techniques, trauma clinicians should be able to identify high-risk patients and attenuate the impact of this syndrome.

- **Geographical representation**: Figure 1 displays the geographical representation of the respondents of the cross-sectional survey.

- **Pathophysiology and measurement**: Figure 2 illustrates the respondents' agreement with statements related to the pathophysiology of intra-abdominal hypertension and measurement of intra-abdominal pressure. Key terms include MAP (mean arterial pressure), IAP (intrabdominal pressure), FG (filtration gradient), GFP (glomerular filtration pressure), APP (abdominal perfusion pressure), PTP (proximal tubular pressure), Cab (abdominal compliance), RVP (renal venous pressure), IAPei (IAP end-inspiratory), IAPee (IAP end-expiratory), HOB (head-of-bed), and RAV (respiratory-abdominal variation). Statements marked as "new" are candidate statements for future revision of guidelines.

- **Definition and management**: Figure 3 presents the respondents' agreement with statements related to the definition and management of intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome. Important abbreviations include ACS (abdominal compartment syndrome), IAH (intrabdominal hypertension), IAP (intrabdominal pressure), APP (abdominal perfusion pressure), SOFA (sequential failure organ assessment), qSOFA (quick SOFA), and TAC (temporary abdominal closure). Statements with "new" in parentheses are candidate statements for future guideline revisions.

A total of 1039 (99%) respondents provided feedback on the future of WSACS. A clear majority (n = 700, 67.4%) felt that society should continue its endeavors to foster education and training and promote research on IAH and ACS [Fig. 4]. A minority of respondents felt that WSACS should be part of another society (89, 8.5%).

Should we attempt to achieve same-hospital-stay closure of the open abdomen? As the inability to achieve primary fascial closure after damage control laparotomy has been associated with increased morbidity and reduced quality of life among critically ill adults, efforts to close the abdominal fascia before discharge could potentially lead to improved outcomes.

- **Statement**: We recommend that among ICU patients with open abdominal wounds, conscious and/or protocolized efforts be made to obtain an early or at least same-hospital-stay abdominal fascial closure (New Management Recommendation 6 [GRADE 1D]).

### Abdominal compartment syndrome in the pediatric population - case series and review of the literature [^113cqbQC]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) in children is a rare but life-threatening condition caused by increased intra-abdominal pressure leading to multi-organ dysfunction. Despite its severity, pediatric ACS remains underrecognized, with limited data available to guide diagnosis and management.

- **Aim**: This study aims to contribute to the scarce literature by summarizing our institutional experience in diagnosing and managing pediatric ACS.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review was conducted of all patients under 18 years who underwent decompressive laparotomy for ACS between 2014 and 2024 at a single tertiary pediatric center. Data included demographics, underlying conditions, surgical details, and clinical outcomes.

- **Results**: Nine children, aged one week to seven years, were diagnosed with ACS and treated surgically. Etiologies varied and included postoperative complications, sepsis, and congenital anomalies such as Hirschsprung's disease, cyanotic congenital heart disease, and imperforate anus. Surgical approaches included decompressive laparotomy with or without bowel resection and open abdomen management using a Bogota bag. Despite intensive care, the mortality rate exceeded 50% (5/9 patients).

- **Conclusions**: Pediatric ACS is a heterogeneous condition with limited published data and significant mortality. Improved awareness, early recognition of warning signs, and timely surgical decompression are critical to improving outcomes in this vulnerable population.

### Abdominal compartment syndrome after liver transplantation [^111bh46M]. Liver Transplantation (2005). Low credibility.

The abdominal compartment syndrome is a well-known complication after abdominal trauma and is increasingly recognized as a potential risk factor for renal failure and mortality after adult orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). We present a case report of a young patient who presented with acute liver failure complicated by acute pancreatitis. The patient developed an acute abdominal compartment syndrome after OLT. Transurethral measurement of intraabdominal pressure indicated an abdominal compartment syndrome associated with impaired abdominal vascular perfusion, including liver perfusion. Renal insufficiency was immediately reversed after decompressive bedside laparotomy.

The abdominal compartment syndrome is a potential source of post-transplant renal insufficiency and liver necrosis in OLT. It remains, however, a rarely described complication after liver transplantation, despite the presence of significant factors that contribute to elevated intraabdominal pressure.

Studies have reported that treatment with neostigmine may be effective at inducing colonic decompression among those with colonic pseudo-obstruction. However, no data exist on the effects of pharmacologic promotility therapy on intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) or outcomes among those with intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) or abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS).

- **Promotility agents**: We suggest that neostigmine be used for the treatment of established colonic ileus not responding to other simple measures and associated with IAH (New Management Suggestion 5 [GRADE 2D]).

### Intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome [^113Z2wZD]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Increased intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), also referred to as intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH), affects organ function in critically ill patients and may lead to abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). Although initially described in surgical patients, IAH and ACS also occur in medical patients without abdominal conditions. IAP can be easily and reliably measured in patients through the bladder using simple tools.

The effects of increased IAP are multiple, but the kidney is especially vulnerable due to its anatomic position. Although the means by which kidney function is impaired in patients with ACS is incompletely elucidated, available evidence suggests that the most important factor involves alterations in renal blood flow. IAH should be considered as a potential cause of acute kidney injury in critically ill patients; its role in other conditions, such as hepatorenal syndrome, remains to be elucidated.

Because several treatment options, both medical and surgical, are available, IAH and ACS should no longer be considered irrelevant epiphenomena of severe illness or critical care. An integrated approach targeting IAH may improve outcomes and decrease hospital costs, and IAP monitoring is a first step toward dedicated IAH management. IAH prevention, most importantly during abdominal surgery but also during fluid resuscitation, may avoid ACS altogether. However, when ACS occurs and medical treatment fails, decompressive laparotomy is the only option.

### Decompressive laparotomy for abdominal compartment syndrome [^111we5uH]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The effect of decompressive laparotomy on outcomes in patients with abdominal compartment syndrome has been poorly investigated. The aim of this prospective cohort study was to describe the effect of decompressive laparotomy for abdominal compartment syndrome on organ function and outcomes.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective cohort study in adult patients who underwent decompressive laparotomy for abdominal compartment syndrome. The primary endpoints were 28-day and 1-year all-cause mortality. Changes in intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and organ function, and laparotomy-related morbidity were secondary endpoints.

- **Results**: Thirty-three patients were included in the study (20 men), with twenty-seven being surgical admissions treated for abdominal conditions. The median (i.q.r.) Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score was 26 (20–32). Median IAP was 23 (21–27) mmHg before decompressive laparotomy, decreasing to 12 (9–15), 13 (8–17), 12 (9–15), and 12 (9–14) mmHg after 2, 6, 24, and 72 hours, respectively. Decompressive laparotomy significantly improved oxygenation and urinary output. Survivors showed improvement in organ function scores, but non-survivors did not. Fourteen complications related to the procedure developed in eight of the 33 patients. The abdomen could be closed primarily in 18 patients. The overall 28-day mortality rate was 36 percent (12 of 33), which increased to 55 percent (18 patients) at 1 year. Non-survivors were no different from survivors, except that they tended to be older and on mechanical ventilation.

- **Conclusion**: Decompressive laparotomy can lead to significant improvements in organ function and intra-abdominal pressure in patients with abdominal compartment syndrome. However, mortality remains high, and further research is needed to fully understand the benefits and risks of this intervention.

### Postoperative gastric dilatation causing abdominal compartment syndrome [^115M8GZg]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is defined as an increased intra-abdominal pressure (IAP > 20 mmHg) in combination with single or multiple organ dysfunction which was not previously present. This condition affects multiple organ systems in a graded fashion. Early identification and abdominal decompression are essential in the management and treatment of this difficult situation; otherwise, it leads to multiple organ failure and ultimately, death.

Increased intra-peritoneal volume conditions are the most common source of elevated IAP. Extrinsic compression of the abdomen by burn eschars, pneumatic anti-shock garments, tight abdominal closure, massive volume resuscitation for any reason, and inflation of the peritoneum by CO2 in laparoscopic surgery can also lead to increased IAP. We present a rare case of abdominal compartment syndrome caused by postoperative gastric dilatation in a 72-year-old woman.

The World Society of the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (WSACS) has recently developed consensus definitions outlining standards for intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) measurement as well as diagnostic criteria for intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) based on both the best available clinical evidence and expert opinion.

Acute and rapid elevation in intra-abdominal pressure exceeding 12 mmHg is considered to be pathologically elevated and has been termed intra-abdominal hypertension. IAH is graded as follows:

- **Grade I**: IAP 12–15 mmHg
- **Grade II**: IAP 16–20 mmHg
- **Grade III**: IAP 21–25 mmHg
- **Grade IV**: IAP > 25 mmHg

ACS is defined as a sustained IAP > 20 mmHg (with or without an abdominal perfusion pressure (APP) < 60 mmHg) that is associated with new organ dysfunction or failure.

The phrase "abdominal compartment syndrome" was first used by Kron et al. in the early 1980s to describe the physiological effects of intra-abdominal hypertension complicating a ruptured aortic aneurysm surgery. However, most of our knowledge about this entity has evolved over the past few years.

ACS can develop in both nonsurgical and surgical patients, either preoperatively or postoperatively. Although the incidence of ACS was found to range between 5% and 15% of trauma patients, an increased IAP (18 mmHg) was observed in up to 41% of surgical patients. ACS is most commonly diagnosed in patients sustaining abdominal or pelvic trauma, or suffering some other intra-abdominal hemorrhagic catastrophe. Less common etiologic factors include retroperitoneal hematoma or edema, bowel obstruction, ascites, and necrotizing pancreatitis.

Sustained elevation of intra-abdominal pressure causes increased…

Abdominal compartment syndrome typically occurs in patients after abdominal surgical procedures or trauma. However, it is increasingly described in conditions not related to abdominal operations, such as fluid resuscitation or burns. We report two patients who required surgical abdominal decompression for abdominal compartment syndrome that developed early after emergency coronary artery bypass graft surgery. No intraabdominal abnormalities were found at operation. Although both patients had a protracted clinical course, they survived and were discharged from the hospital.

### Perforated peptic ulcer associated with abdominal compartment syndrome [^116b7UTh]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is defined as an increased intra-abdominal pressure with adverse physiologic consequences. ACS caused by perforated peptic ulcer is rare due to early diagnosis and management. However, delayed recognition of perforated peptic ulcer accompanied by pneumoperitoneum, bowel distension, and decreased abdominal wall compliance can create a vicious circle leading to ACS.

We report a case of a perforated peptic ulcer associated with ACS in a 74-year-old man with a history of stroke and dementia. The patient presented with a distended abdomen, bilateral leg edema, and cyanosis. Laboratory tests indicated deterioration of liver and kidney function. Suspecting abdominal compartment syndrome, an imaging study was conducted to identify the cause. The results showed pneumoperitoneum, contrast stasis in the heart with decreased caliber of vessels below the abdominal aortic level, and diffuse lymphedema at the abdominal walls.

An emergent laparotomy was performed, during which a perforated peptic ulcer was found, and gastrorrhaphy was conducted. Following the urgent surgical intervention, the symptoms as well as liver and kidney function showed immediate improvement.

### Results from the International Conference of Experts on Intra-abdominal Hypertension and Abdominal Compartment Syndrome. II. Recommendations [^115msGgH]. Intensive Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) have been increasingly recognized in the critically ill over the past decade. In the absence of consensus definitions and treatment guidelines, the diagnosis and management of IAH and ACS remain variable across institutions.

An international consensus group of multidisciplinary critical care specialists convened at the second World Congress on Abdominal Compartment Syndrome to develop practice guidelines for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of IAH and ACS. Prior to the conference, the authors developed a blueprint for consensus definitions and treatment guidelines, which were refined both during and after the conference. The present article is the second installment of the final report from the 2004 International ACS Consensus Definitions Conference and is endorsed by the World Society of the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome.

The prevalence and etiological factors for IAH and ACS are reviewed. Evidence-based medicine treatment guidelines are presented to facilitate the diagnosis and management of IAH and ACS. Recommendations to guide future studies are proposed. These definitions, guidelines, and recommendations, based on best evidence and expert opinion, are proposed to assist clinicians in the management of IAH and ACS, as well as serve as a reference for future clinical and basic science research.

### Intra-abdominal hypertension and the abdominal compartment syndrome: Updated consensus definitions and clinical practice guidelines from the World Society of the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome [^115pJz8U]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

- **Invasive options**: Should we use decompressive laparotomy for IAH or ACS? Decompressive laparotomy has historically been the standard method for treating severe IAH/ACS and preventing their development in high-risk situations, such as following damage control laparotomy for significant intra-peritoneal injury. It has been reported to result in an immediate decrease in intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and improvements in organ function. However, decompressive laparotomy is associated with multiple complications, and overall reported patient mortality is considerable, reaching up to 50%, even after decompression.

- **Statement**: We recommend decompressive laparotomy in cases of overt ACS compared to strategies that do not use decompressive laparotomy in critically ill adults with ACS (Unchanged Management Recommendation 5 [GRADE 1D]).

### Intra-abdominal hypertension and the abdominal compartment syndrome: updated consensus definitions and clinical practice guidelines from the World Society of the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome [^116v2xiV]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The purpose of this paper is to update the World Society of the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (WSACS) consensus definitions and management statements relating to intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and the abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS).

- **Methods**: We conducted systematic or structured reviews to identify relevant studies related to IAH or ACS. Updated consensus definitions and management statements were derived using a modified Delphi method and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines, respectively. Quality of evidence was graded from high (A) to very low (D) and management statements from strong recommendations (desirable effects clearly outweigh potential undesirable ones) to weaker suggestions (potential risks and benefits of the intervention are less clear).

- **Results**: In addition to reviewing the consensus definitions proposed in 2006, the WSACS defined the open abdomen, lateralization of the abdominal musculature, polycompartment syndrome, and abdominal compliance, and proposed an open abdomen classification system. Recommendations included intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) measurement, avoidance of sustained IAH, protocolized IAP monitoring and management, decompressive laparotomy for overt ACS, and negative pressure wound therapy with efforts to achieve same-hospital-stay fascial closure among patients with an open abdomen. Suggestions included the use of medical therapies and percutaneous catheter drainage for the treatment of IAH/ACS, consideration of the association between body position and IAP, and attempts to avoid a positive fluid balance.

### Intra-abdominal hypertension and the abdominal compartment syndrome: Updated consensus definitions and clinical practice guidelines from the World Society of the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome [^114o2Z7U]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

In this manuscript, the WSACS presented updated consensus definitions and management statements related to IAH/ACS. It was identified that there were topics for which future review is required, including the most accurate and meaningful reference-standard locations for IAP measurement and the definition of "normal" values of IAP across various patient populations. Moreover, although the Pediatric Sub-Committee reviewed and made recommendations regarding the appropriateness of the updated consensus definitions and management statements for pediatric patients, further work in this area is needed. Similarly, normal values of IAP among obese and pregnant patients have not yet been adequately defined, and the influence of IAH and ACS in these patients is somewhat poorly understood. Thus, further work among these patient populations is urgently needed. Finally, as overt ACS becomes less common, further research must be performed to delineate what role IAH without ACS plays in gut ischemia, bacterial translocation, feeding intolerance, anastomotic and wound breakdown, and neurological dysfunction.

The GRADE system was used to formulate the updated consensus management statements. GRADE is practical in requiring clinical judgments to be made in the context of weighing potential benefits and harms, the burdens of therapy both to the patient and society, and involved costs, with the overall assessment of the quality based on the entire body of evidence, rather than any particular study.

### Intra-abdominal hypertension and the abdominal compartment syndrome [^115bRu9w]. Anaesthesia (2004). Low credibility.

The pressure within the abdominal cavity is normally slightly above atmospheric pressure. However, even small increases in intra-abdominal pressure can adversely affect renal function, cardiac output, hepatic blood flow, respiratory mechanics, splanchnic perfusion, and intracranial pressure. Although intra-abdominal pressure can be measured directly, this method is invasive. Bedside measurement is usually achieved via the urinary bladder, a cheap and easy approach that has been shown to correlate closely with direct measurements of abdominal pressure.

Significant increases in intra-abdominal pressure occur in various conditions commonly encountered in the intensive care unit, such as ruptured aortic aneurysm, abdominal trauma, and acute pancreatitis. Abdominal compartment syndrome describes the combination of increased intra-abdominal pressure and end-organ dysfunction, characterized by high mortality, with most deaths resulting from sepsis and multi-organ failure. Detecting abdominal compartment syndrome necessitates close surveillance of intra-abdominal pressure in patients at risk of developing intra-abdominal hypertension.

The only available treatment for established abdominal compartment syndrome is decompressive laparotomy. Prevention of abdominal compartment syndrome post-laparotomy through the adoption of an open abdomen approach may be preferable for patients at significant risk of developing intra-abdominal hypertension. However, this has not been demonstrated in any large trials. Most surgeons prefer to adopt…

### Nonoperative management of intraabdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome [^115Q8nLp]. World Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Intraabdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) have detrimental effects on all organ systems and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In recent years, the diagnosis and management of these syndromes have evolved tremendously, and the importance of comprehensive strategies to reduce intraabdominal pressure (IAP) has been recognized. All clinicians should be aware of the risk factors that predict the development of IAH/ACS, the appropriate measurement of IAP, and the resuscitation options for managing these highly morbid syndromes.

The nonoperative management of IAH/ACS can be summarized using five therapeutic goals:

- **Evacuate intraluminal contents**: Removal of content within the intestinal lumen.
- **Evacuate intraabdominal space-occupying lesions**: Address any lesions that occupy space within the abdominal cavity.
- **Improve abdominal wall compliance**: Strategies to enhance the flexibility and capacity of the abdominal wall.
- **Optimize fluid administration**: Correct fluid management practices to minimize increases in IAP.
- **Optimize systemic and regional tissue perfusion**: Ensure that tissues receive adequate blood supply to recover fully.

Surgical intervention through open abdominal decompression should immediately be pursued for patients with progressive IAH, end-organ dysfunction, and failure that is refractory to these nonoperative therapies. This comprehensive management strategy has been demonstrated to improve patient survival and long-term outcomes.

### Results from the international conference of experts on intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome. I. Definitions [^1128UXoZ]. Intensive Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) have been increasingly recognized in the critically ill over the past decade. The variety of definitions proposed has led to confusion and difficulty in comparing one study to another.

- **Design**: An international consensus group of critical care specialists convened at the second World Congress on Abdominal Compartment Syndrome to standardize definitions for IAH and ACS based upon the understanding of the pathophysiology surrounding these two syndromes.

- **Methods**: Prior to the conference, the authors developed a blueprint for the various definitions, which was further refined both during and after the conference. The present article serves as the final report of the 2004 International ACS Consensus Definitions Conference and is endorsed by the World Society of Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (WSACS).

- **Results**: IAH is redefined as an intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) at or above 12 mmHg. ACS is redefined as an IAP above 20 mmHg with evidence of organ dysfunction/failure. ACS is further classified as either primary or secondary based upon the duration and cause of the IAH-induced organ failure. Standards for IAP monitoring are set forth to facilitate the accuracy of IAP measurements from patient to patient.

- **Conclusions**: State-of-the-art definitions for IAH and ACS are proposed based upon medical evidence as well as expert opinion. The WSACS recommends that these definitions be used for future clinical and basic science research.

Should we use component separation to facilitate early fascial closure of the open abdomen?

The component separation technique of the abdominal wall musculature may be used to close an already open abdomen or to avoid an open abdomen without inducing intra-abdominal hypertension. An acute component separation technique is defined as one performed during the initial hospitalization.

- **Statement**: We could make no recommendation regarding use of an acute component separation technique versus not to facilitate early abdominal fascial closure.

### Abdominal compartment syndrome secondary to chronic constipation in MECP2 duplication syndrome [^111uoPgu]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is an infrequently encountered, life-threatening disorder characterized by elevated abdominal pressure with evidence of new organ dysfunction. It is rarely reported in pediatrics. We describe an extremely unusual presentation of a 13-year-old boy with long-standing constipation who developed ACS complicated by refractory septic shock and multiorgan failure. He was treated with emergent decompressive laparotomy and supportive critical care. This case highlights the need for early diagnosis and timely management of ACS to improve its outcome.

### Abdominal compartment syndrome [^113DdGK1]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Acute renal failure frequently occurs in the intensive care unit as a primary or secondary event in association with trauma, surgery, or comorbid medical disease. An increasingly common thread linking surgical and medical disease management is the abdominal compartment syndrome. In particular, the rise of early goal-directed therapy for the initial resuscitation and management of severe sepsis and septic shock is associated with an increased frequency of secondary abdominal compartment syndrome.

This paper explores the pathophysiology underpinning the abdominal compartment syndrome and its contribution to acute kidney injury and acute renal failure. It examines intra-abdominal pressure dynamics, preload limitation, and afterload augmentation. Diagnostic modalities and therapeutic interventions are addressed as means of reducing the frequency of acute kidney injury and acute renal failure in the critically ill.

### Intraabdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome-what you need to know [^113mWGSn]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Abdominal hypertension is a pathologic elevation in intraabdominal pressure most often seen in critically ill patients with a propensity for progression to abdominal compartment syndrome once organ dysfunction develops. Intraabdominal hypertension alone is an independent predictor of morbidity and mortality, but progression to abdominal compartment syndrome portends a worse prognosis with extremely high mortality rates, even after treatment. Pathologic increases in intraabdominal pressure can cause physiologic changes impacting multiple organ systems both directly and indirectly, which may lead to rapid patient deterioration.

As such, critical care providers must be able to identify high-risk patients in order to effectively monitor intraabdominal pressure and to provide expeditious, appropriate treatment for these patients when warranted. While the diagnosis of abdominal compartment syndrome is clinical, the sensitivity of physical examination alone is low, and at-risk patients should undergo intraabdominal pressure monitoring with bladder pressures measured every 4 hours. Changes in intraabdominal pressure or organ function and the time over which these changes develop dictate treatment choice.

Management strategies for intraabdominal hypertension focus on the reduction of intraabdominal volume, increasing abdominal wall compliance, and optimizing fluid balance, which is a nuanced practice in critically ill patients. There are a multitude of treatment options which may be employed to address the spectrum of intraabdominal hypertension, which ranges from asymptomatic elevations to severe cases.

Should we keep fluid balance neutral or even negative among ICU patients? An increased or positive fluid balance has been associated with third space fluid accumulation and organ dysfunction in animal models. However, it remains unknown whether strategies that target a neutral or even negative fluid balance after the initial resuscitation of critically ill patients may be linked with improved clinical outcomes.

- **Statement**: We suggest using a protocol to try to avoid a positive cumulative fluid balance in the critically ill or injured with, or at risk of, IAH/ACS after the acute resuscitation has been completed and the inciting issues have been addressed (New Management Suggestion 6 [GRADE 2C]).

### Abdominal compartment syndrome after mesenteric revascularization [^116LadLv]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) results from increased pressure within the abdominal cavity, leading to multisystem organ dysfunction. The most common cause of ACS is increased intraperitoneal volume from any source, although extrinsic compression can also cause increased intra-abdominal pressure. While ACS is well documented in trauma patients, little information exists regarding ACS in postoperative patients without traumatic injuries. We report on a patient who developed acute ACS two days after undergoing surgical revascularization for chronic mesenteric ischemia. With appropriate treatment, the patient experienced a rapid and complete recovery. We present this case of acute ACS in a postoperative patient without trauma to heighten awareness and help reduce mortality from this devastating syndrome.

In utilizing these guidelines, clinicians should be aware of ongoing developments in medical knowledge. The panelists made great efforts to review the literature broadly and remain aware of ongoing research that could influence recommendations. However, the reviewers focused on completed peer-reviewed studies that were available in the public domain. Although some studies could have been missed, we feel it unlikely that the exclusion of the results of these studies would significantly alter our recommendations. Nonetheless, it is probable that new knowledge will require future revision of this work.

Given the lack of high-quality evidence to base decision-making, this is desirable. Thus, users are reminded to use these guidelines in the context of knowing their patients, acting at the bedside, and considering new data as it becomes available.

### Recognition and management of abdominal compartment syndrome in the United Kingdom [^114KFpDH]. Intensive Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is a condition associated with high mortality if undiagnosed and untreated, commonly seen in patients managed in intensive care units. Very little is known about the causes, diagnosis, and treatment of this condition in the United Kingdom.

- **Design**: Questionnaire study.
- **Settings**: 222 intensive care units in the UK dealing with acute abdominal conditions.
- **Results**: Of the 222 units, 127 (57.2%) questionnaires were returned, including 32 from teaching hospitals and 95 from district general hospitals. Among these, 96.9% of teaching hospitals and 72.6% of district general hospitals had encountered cases of ACS. The conditions most frequently associated with ACS were small and large bowel surgery (67%), vascular surgery (62%), and trauma (60%). ACS was mainly suspected when there was a distended abdomen (98.6%), oliguria (94.5%), and increased ventilatory support (72.2%). The diagnosis was confirmed either clinically (68.4%) or by measuring intra-abdominal pressure (83.7%). The most common method for measuring intra-abdominal pressure was the intra-vesical route. The pressure threshold for diagnosing the condition was variable, ranging from 11–50 mmHg. There was significant variation in the number of patients who were decompressed.

In conclusion, fewer patients are diagnosed with ACS in district general hospitals compared to teaching hospitals. The threshold for diagnosis is variable across the UK, as is the number of patients who undergo decompression, suggesting a reluctance among many doctors to accept this condition. This study indicates a need for further evaluation and standardization in the management of ACS.

### Postinjury abdominal compartment syndrome: Are we winning the battle [^111iS434]. World Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Postinjury (primary) abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) was described more than 15 years ago as severe abdominal distension with high peak airway pressures, CO(2) retention, and oliguria, which led to unplanned re-exploration after damage-control laparotomy. Later, a more elusive type of ACS was recognized, which develops without abdominal injuries (secondary ACS). Both syndromes were recently characterized, their independent predictors were identified, and preventive strategies were developed to reduce their incidence. Once viewed as a syndrome with almost uniform mortality, systematic preventative strategies and therapeutic efforts have reduced the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality of the syndrome. This review was designed to summarize the recent advances in the management of ACS, to classify the currently available evidence, and to identify future directions of research and clinical care.

Body positioning can influence intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) by altering the zero reference for IAP measurement and/or affecting the external forces on the abdominal cavity.

- **Statement**: We suggest that the potential contribution of body position to elevated IAP be considered among patients with, or at risk of, intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) or abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). This remains as an unchanged management suggestion 3 [GRADE 2D].

### Intraabdominal hypertension, abdominal compartment syndrome, and the open abdomen [^113d8xnA]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is the end point of a process where massive interstitial swelling in the abdomen or rapid development of a space-filling lesion in the abdomen (such as ascites or a hematoma) leads to pathologically increased pressure. This results in so-called intraabdominal hypertension (IAH), causing decreased perfusion of the kidneys and abdominal viscera and potential difficulties with ventilation and maintenance of cardiac output. These effects contribute to a cascade of ischemia and multiple organ dysfunction with high mortality.

A few primary disease processes traditionally requiring large-volume crystalloid resuscitation account for most cases of IAH and ACS. Once IAH is recognized, nonsurgical steps to decrease intraabdominal pressure (IAP) can be undertaken, such as diuresis/dialysis, evacuation of intraluminal bowel contents, and sedation. However, the clinical benefit of such therapies remains largely conjectural. Surgical decompression with midline laparotomy is the standard ultimate treatment once ACS with organ dysfunction is established.

There is minimal primary literature on the pathophysiological underpinnings of IAH and ACS and few prospective randomized trials evaluating their treatment or prevention. Therefore, this concise review provides only brief summaries of these topics. Many modern studies nominally dealing with IAH or ACS are simply epidemiologic surveys on their incidence. This paper summarizes the incidence of IAH and ACS in a variety of disease states, with a particular emphasis on modern critical care paradigms.

Damage control laparotomy for non-trauma acute care surgery patients (Supplement 24; see 10.1007/s00134-013-2906-z).

While damage control techniques are being used among non-trauma acute care surgery patients (which largely includes emergency general surgery), very little evidence exists to support their use or to support prophylactic open abdominal management afterwards.

- **Statement**: We could make no recommendation regarding the prophylactic use of the open abdomen in non-trauma acute care surgery patients with physiological exhaustion versus intra-operative abdominal fascial closure and expectant intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) management.

### Intra-abdominal hypertension and the abdominal compartment syndrome: updated consensus definitions and clinical practice guidelines from the World Society of the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome [^116qbnn7]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). High credibility.

The purpose of this guideline is to update the World Society of the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (WSACS) consensus definitions and management statements concerning intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and the abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS).

- **Methods**: We conducted systematic or structured reviews to identify relevant studies relating to IAH or ACS. Updated consensus definitions and management statements were then derived using a modified Delphi method and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines, respectively. The quality of evidence was graded from high (A) to very low (D), and management statements ranged from strong recommendations (where desirable effects clearly outweigh potential undesirable ones) to weaker suggestions (where the potential risks and benefits of the intervention are less clear).

- **Results**: In addition to reviewing the consensus definitions proposed in 2006, the WSACS defined the open abdomen, lateralization of the abdominal musculature, polycompartment syndrome, and abdominal compliance, and proposed an open abdomen classification system. Recommendations included intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) measurement, avoidance of sustained IAH, protocolized IAP monitoring and management, decompressive laparotomy for overt ACS, and negative pressure wound therapy. Efforts to achieve same-hospital-stay fascial closure among patients with an open abdomen were also recommended. Suggestions included the use of medical therapies and percutaneous catheter drainage for the treatment of IAH/ACS and considering the association between body position and IAP in attempts to avoid a positive fluid balance.

### Abdominal compartment syndrome: A review [^113VQ8kP]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The aims of this review were to summarize:

1. Consensus definitions of normal and pathologic intra-abdominal pressure (IAP);
2. Techniques to measure IAP;
3. Risk factors for intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS);
4. Pathophysiology of ACS; and
5. Recommendations for management and prevention of ACS.

- **Data sources**: PubMed was searched using the following terms: ACS, IAH, IAP, and abdominal decompression.

- **Data synthesis**: ACS represents the natural progression of end-organ dysfunction caused by increased IAP and develops if IAH is not recognized and treated appropriately. Although the reported incidence of ACS is relatively low in critically ill children (0.6%-4.7%), it may be under-recognized and under-reported. The diagnosis of IAH/ACS depends on a high index of suspicion and the accurate and frequent measurement of IAP in patients at risk. Mortality from ACS remains high (50%-60%) even when decompression of the abdomen is performed early, which highlights the importance of detection and treatment of elevated IAP before end-organ damage occurs.

- **Conclusions**: Widespread awareness of the recognition and approach to management and prevention of IAH and ACS is needed among pediatric intensivists, so the outcome of these life-threatening disease processes might be improved.

### Decompressive laparotomy for abdominal compartment syndrome [^11379Bh8]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). High credibility.

The effect of decompressive laparotomy on outcomes in patients with abdominal compartment syndrome has been poorly investigated. The aim of this prospective cohort study was to describe the effect of decompressive laparotomy for abdominal compartment syndrome on organ function and outcomes.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective cohort study in adult patients who underwent decompressive laparotomy for abdominal compartment syndrome. The primary endpoints were 28-day and 1-year all-cause mortality. Changes in intra-abdominal pressure, organ function, and laparotomy-related morbidity were secondary endpoints.

- **Results**: Thirty-three patients were included in the study (20 men). Twenty-seven patients were surgical admissions treated for abdominal conditions. The median (interquartile range) Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation score was 26 (20–32). Median intra-abdominal pressure was 23 (21–27) before decompressive laparotomy, decreasing to 12 (9–15), 13 (8–17), 12 (9–15), and 12 (9–14) after 2, 6, 24, and 72 hours, respectively. Decompressive laparotomy significantly improved oxygenation and urinary output. Survivors showed improvement in organ function scores, but non-survivors did not. Fourteen complications related to the procedure developed in eight of the 33 patients. The abdomen could be closed primarily in 18 patients. The overall 28-day mortality rate was 36 percent (12 of 33), which increased to 55 percent (18 patients) at 1 year. Non-survivors were no different from survivors, except that they tended to be older and on mechanical ventilation.

- **Conclusion**: Decompressive laparotomy reduced intra-abdominal pressures and had an immediate impact on organ function.

### Pediatric critical care nurses' experience with abdominal compartment syndrome [^112KwwPW]. Annals of Intensive Care (2012). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on abdominal compartment syndrome:

- **Definition**: Abdominal compartment syndrome is a critical condition characterized by elevated intra-abdominal pressure that leads to multi-system organ dysfunction. It is defined as an intra-abdominal pressure greater than 20 mmHg with evidence of organ failure.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology involves a rapid increase in intra-abdominal pressure due to factors such as internal bleeding, inflammation, or fluid accumulation within the abdominal cavity. This elevated pressure can impede blood flow and oxygen delivery to the organs, leading to ischemia and organ dysfunction.

- **Epidemiology**: The epidemiology of abdominal compartment syndrome varies according to the patient population. It is commonly seen in critically ill patients, particularly those in the ICU.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, abdominal compartment syndrome presents with a firm, tense abdomen, increased peak inspiratory pressures, and oliguria, all of which improve after abdominal decompression.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis is significantly influenced by early recognition and intervention. If left untreated, it can lead to severe complications and an increased mortality rate.

### Postinjury abdominal compartment syndrome: from recognition to prevention [^115QkdUv]. The Lancet (2014). Low credibility.

Postinjury abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is an example of a deadly clinical occurrence that was eliminated by strategic research and focused preventions. In the 1990s, the syndrome emerged with the widespread use of damage control surgery and aggressive crystalloid-based resuscitation. Patients who previously exsanguinated on the operating table made it to intensive care units, but then developed highly lethal hyperacute respiratory, renal, and cardiac failure due to increased abdominal pressure. Among many factors, delayed hemorrhage control and preload-driven excessive use of crystalloid resuscitation were identified as modifiable predictors.

The surrogate effect of preventive strategies, including the challenge of the 40-year-old standard of large volume crystalloid resuscitation for traumatic shock, greatly reduced cases of ACS. The discoveries were rapidly translated to civilian and military trauma surgical practices and fundamentally changed the way trauma patients are resuscitated today with substantially improved outcomes.

Should we use abdominal perfusion pressure (APP) as a resuscitation endpoint? (Supplement 9; see 10.1007/s00134-013-2906-z) Abdominal perfusion pressure (APP) may be thought of as the abdominal analogue to cerebral perfusion pressure. This measure has previously been suggested as a more accurate predictor of visceral perfusion and a better endpoint for resuscitation than IAP or mean arterial pressure (MAP) alone.

- **Statement**: We could make no recommendation regarding use of APP in the resuscitation or management of the critically ill or injured.

### Paediatric abdominal compartment syndrome in a 4.6 kg infant [^1171RW2b]. BMJ Case Reports (2024).

Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) in patients with risk factors such as a history of abdominal distension and prior abdominal surgery. This is particularly true for primary ACS. In this case, the infant's abdominal X-rays were consistent with previous imaging showing a dilated bowel. The infant presented with abdominal distension, hypothermia, mild respiratory distress, and metabolic acidosis, prompting an evaluation for suspected sepsis. An NG tube was administered for decompression, intravenous fluids were initiated, and NPO status was maintained alongside an urgent surgical consultation. However, the infant decompensated within 8 hours of admission, as demonstrated by the development of hypotension, worsening acidosis, and the need for intubation and pressors.

Despite the initiation of treatments such as NPO, NG tube to suction, intravenous fluids, and antibiotics, the infant further decompensated. This necessitated intubation, fluid boluses, a PRBC transfusion, expanded antibiotic coverage, and an exploratory laparotomy to address necrotic bowel, which required small bowel resection. Three exploratory laparotomies were subsequently required for further removal of necrotic bowel, washout procedures, appendectomy, jejunostomy creation, establishment of a mucous fistula, gastrostomy tube placement, and reanastomosis.

ACS is caused by a pathological elevation of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) leading to multiple organ dysfunction and failure. The condition has a high mortality rate, making early detection and diagnosis critical for survival. ACS is defined as an increased IAP greater than 10 mm Hg in children and greater than 20 mm Hg in adults, accompanied by two of the following factors: oliguria or anuria, respiratory dysfunction, cardiovascular compromise, or neurological impairment.

### IAH/ACS: The rationale for surveillance [^117FLSwj]. World Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Surveillance for intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) should be implemented in every intensive care unit (ICU) because it has been demonstrated that surveillance is effective. Several criteria have led to the conclusion that IAH/ACS monitoring is valuable. First, IAH is a frequent problem in critically ill patients that directly affects the function of all organ systems to some degree and is associated with considerable mortality. Simple tools for intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) monitoring are available, and it can be safely applied without the need for advanced tools. Finally, both ACS and IAH can be treated with either medical or surgical interventions. The treatment for IAH/ACS should be selected based on the severity of symptoms and the cause of IAH. IAP monitoring should also be incorporated into the daily ICU management of the patient.

### Intra-abdominal hypertension and the abdominal compartment syndrome [^111YAALn]. The British Journal of Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) occurs when intra-abdominal pressure is abnormally high in association with organ dysfunction. It tends to have a poor outcome, even when treated promptly by abdominal decompression.

- **Methods**: A search of the Medline database was performed to identify articles related to intra-abdominal hypertension and ACS.

- **Results**: Currently, there is no agreed definition or management of ACS. However, it is suggested that intra-abdominal pressure should be measured in patients at risk, with values above 20 mmHg being considered abnormal in most. Abdominal decompression should be considered in patients with rising pressure and organ dysfunction, indicated by increased airway pressure, reduced cardiac output, and oliguria. Organ dysfunction often occurs at an intra-abdominal pressure greater than 35 mmHg and may start to develop between 26 and 35 mmHg. The mean survival rate of patients affected by compartment syndrome is 53 percent.

- **Conclusion**: The optimal time for intervention is not known, but the outcome is often poor, even after decompression. Most of the available information relates to victims of trauma rather than general surgical patients.

### Abdominal compartment syndrome and acute kidney injury due to excessive auto-positive end-expiratory pressure [^1133EQYk]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Abdominal compartment syndrome is an under-recognized cause of acute kidney injury in critically ill patients. We report a case of a patient with severe obstructive lung disease who, while intubated for respiratory failure, developed abdominal compartment syndrome and oliguric acute kidney injury due to air-trapping and excessive auto-positive end-expiratory pressure (auto-PEEP; also known as intrinsic PEEP). When chemical paralysis was initiated and the auto-PEEP resolved, the patient's intra-abdominal hypertension rapidly improved and kidney function recovered immediately. Abdominal compartment syndrome secondary to excessive auto-PEEP appears to be unreported in the literature; however, any process that significantly increases intrathoracic pressure conceivably could cause increased pressure to be transmitted to the abdominal compartment, resulting in organ failure. Patients undergoing mechanical ventilation, which puts them at risk of airflow obstruction and the development of intra-abdominal hypertension, should be evaluated for air-trapping and excessive auto-PEEP.

### Evaluation and management of abdominal compartment syndrome in the emergency department [^114LRMx5]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Abdominal compartment syndrome is a potentially deadly condition that can be missed in the emergency department setting. The purpose of this narrative review article is to provide a summary of the background, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of abdominal compartment syndrome with a focus on emergency clinicians.

- **Discussion**: Abdominal compartment syndrome is caused by excessive pressure within the abdominal compartment due to diminished abdominal wall compliance, increased intraluminal contents, increased abdominal contents, or capillary leak/fluid resuscitation. History and physical examination are insufficient in isolation, and the gold standard is intra-abdominal pressure measurement. It is defined as an intra-abdominal pressure greater than 20 mm Hg with evidence of end-organ injury. Management involves increasing abdominal wall compliance (e.g. analgesia, sedation, and neuromuscular blocking agents), evacuating gastrointestinal contents (e.g. nasogastric tubes, rectal tubes, and prokinetic agents), avoiding excessive fluid resuscitation, draining intraperitoneal contents (e.g. percutaneous drain), and performing decompressive laparotomy in select cases. Patients are critically ill and often require admission to a critical care unit.

- **Conclusions**: Abdominal compartment syndrome is an increasingly recognized condition with the potential for significant morbidity and mortality. It is important for clinicians to be aware of the evidence regarding the diagnosis, management, and disposition of these patients.

### What's new in the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^116GW27A]. Intensive Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

What about intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome?

The overall incidence of intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) in patients with severe acute pancreatitis (AP) is around 50–75% and 10–25%, respectively. The development of IAH and ACS in these patients has a major impact on morbidity and mortality and results from a combined effect of the inflammatory process itself and the iatrogenic aggressive fluid resuscitation. Raised intra-abdominal pressure causes upward shift of both hemidiaphragms, leading to compression atelectasis and hypercapnia. This, in combination with bilateral pleural effusions, may result in severe hypoxia.

When all non-operative measures fail to decrease intra-abdominal pressure, and especially in the setting of primary ACS, one should consider immediate midline decompressive laparotomy since this can be life-saving. Newer and less-invasive methods have been recently suggested. A subcutaneous linea alba fasciotomy (SLAF) can be performed by utilizing three short horizontal skin incisions with the peritoneum closed, avoiding a true open abdomen. SLAF needs further clinical evaluation and does result in a giant midline hernia with an associated need for surgery at a later stage.

### Decompressive laparotomy for abdominal compartment syndrome [^1174bR1B]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) is a clearly identified cause of organ dysfunction in patients who have had emergency abdominal surgery or suffered severe trauma. It is also increasingly recognized in various other patients receiving intensive care after elective surgical procedures, liver transplantation, massive fluid resuscitation for extra-abdominal trauma, severe burns, and aortic aneurysm repair. The presence of IAH on admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) is associated with the development of severe organ dysfunction, and the presence of IAH in the ICU is an independent predictor of mortality.

The clinical picture that results from sustained IAH with an intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) of 20 mmHg or higher has been described as abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). Although the pathophysiology of IAH is well understood, the treatment of ACS remains challenging. Few non-surgical options are available. IAH can be caused by intraperitoneal fluid accumulation, and percutaneous drainage may be a valid option in such situations. Gastric and rectal tubes have been used to drain air and gastrointestinal contents with some success, as have ultrafiltration, pain relief, and muscular blocking agents.

Surgical decompression of the abdomen, or decompressive laparotomy (DL), is the only available definitive treatment for ACS. Numerous case reports and case series have been published detailing results, but the exact role of DL remains unclear. Most papers focus on the description of associated para…

### Is the evolving management of intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome improving survival [^112879gn]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and management of intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome have changed significantly over the past decade with improved understanding of the pathophysiology and appropriate treatment of these disease processes. Serial intra-abdominal pressure measurements, nonoperative pressure-reducing interventions, and early abdominal decompression for refractory intra-abdominal hypertension or abdominal compartment syndrome are all key elements of this evolving strategy.

- **Study design**: This was a prospective, observational study.

- **Setting**: Conducted at a tertiary referral/level I trauma center.

- **Patients**: The study involved 478 consecutive patients requiring an open abdomen for the management of intra-abdominal hypertension or abdominal compartment syndrome.

- **Interventions**: Patients were managed by a defined group of surgical intensivists using established definitions and an evidence-based management algorithm. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify patient and management factors associated with improved survival.

- **Measurements and main results**: While patient demographics and severity of illness remained unchanged over the six-year study period, the use of a continually revised intra-abdominal hypertension/abdominal compartment syndrome management algorithm significantly increased patient survival to hospital discharge from 50% to 72% (p = .015). Clinically significant decreases in resource utilization and an increase in same-admission primary fascial closure from 59% to 81% were recognized. Development of abdominal compartment syndrome.
