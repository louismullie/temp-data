Thrombolysis and aggressive anticoagulation

Observation overnight with lactate levels

Open surgery management

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option is the most appropriate treatment for acute mesenteric occlusion among aggressive anticoagulation only, thrombolysis and aggressive anticoagulation, observation overnight with lactate levels, and open surgery management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical entity and its etiologies. Then, I should verify diagnostic priorities and what is contraindicated. Next, I will align therapy with etiology and the presence or absence of peritonitis. After that, I should compare these choices with modern guideline algorithms, including the role of endovascular therapy even if it is not listed among the options. Finally, I will synthesize a context-dependent answer and state the safest selection among the provided choices based on likely scenarios and current standards of care [^113gNhbt] [^114EHJFT].

> Let me first confirm the entity and its subtypes, because treatment hinges on etiology and bowel viability rather than a one-size-fits-all approach: acute mesenteric occlusion is encompassed by acute mesenteric ischemia with arterial embolism, arterial thrombosis, mesenteric venous thrombosis, and non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia, and mortality rises steeply with delay, so early recognition and intervention are critical [^1173aRgb] [^11663uqi] [^111rouix].

> Wait, let me verify the epidemiology before I anchor the answer too narrowly: many classic sources cite arterial embolism as about 50% of AMI, but newer series show that embolic AMI may now represent closer to 25% and appears to be decreasing, so I need to avoid assuming the mechanism without clinical or imaging context and instead tie the choice to the confirmed etiology and the presence or absence of peritonitis [^111rouix] [^1167p6KQ].

> Next, I should review diagnostic urgency because the choice to "observe" is often unsafe here; CT angiography with arterial phase is the immediate test of choice and should not be delayed by oral contrast, the maxim is "time is intestine", and relying on serial lactates overnight risks missing evolving transmural necrosis, which means observation as a strategy is inappropriate in suspected AMI unless a benign alternative diagnosis is secured and AMI has been excluded [^115U7DRB] [^115LL4M7] [^113gNhbt].

> Hold on, I should verify which option fits mesenteric venous thrombosis, since that is the one subtype where nonoperative first-line therapy is standard; for MVT without peritonitis, immediate systemic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin is first-line and often sufficient, with high recanalization rates reported, and longer-term anticoagulation is typically indicated depending on provocation and risk profile [^111M8eJp] [^114rtNpi] [^117HhNUQ] [^113hS52X].

> Let me now examine thrombolysis plus anticoagulation, because it can sound appealing but is often the wrong initial move; catheter-directed thrombolysis is not first-line in most AMI presentations, is reserved for select early cases without peritonitis or for failure of anticoagulation in venous disease, carries bleeding risk especially with necrotic bowel, and may delay definitive revascularization or necessary laparotomy, so it is not the most appropriate initial treatment in typical arterial occlusion scenarios [^114rtNpi] [^112fGEXL] [^113gNhbt].

> I will now consider the role for open surgery, and I need to be precise about the trigger: the presence of peritonitis or clear concern for bowel necrosis mandates prompt laparotomy for revascularization when feasible, assessment of bowel viability, resection of nonviable segments, and often a planned second look, because delaying operative exploration in this setting increases mortality and risks missed infarction [^113KTyYq] [^11663uqi] [^112zqt8p].

> But wait, what if we have arterial occlusion without peritonitis and an endovascular team is available; in that scenario, contemporary guidelines favor an endovascular-first approach for arterial embolic or thrombotic occlusion, given faster reperfusion, lower physiologic insult, and signals toward lower mortality and shorter length of stay in observational data, although I should not over-interpret retrospective comparisons because of patient selection and confounding, which is why the bedside decision still rests on clinical severity and local expertise [^113gNhbt] [^114EHJFT] [^114rtNpi] [^1134a1nF].

> I should double-check how each offered option maps to specific clinical contexts so I do not overgeneralize: observation is contraindicated in suspected AMI, so that choice should be eliminated; anticoagulation alone is appropriate for MVT without peritonitis; thrombolysis plus anticoagulation is not a first-line strategy for arterial occlusion and is reserved for select situations; open surgery is indicated for any AMI with peritonitis or bowel necrosis, and it is also the fallback when endovascular options are unavailable or failing [^115U7DRB] [^111M8eJp] [^114rtNpi] [^113KTyYq].

> Hmm, wait a minute, earlier I leaned on the traditional teaching that embolism is about 50% of cases, but I should acknowledge again that some recent cohorts report embolism nearer 25 percent; that variability does not change the algorithm that the presence of peritonitis drives immediate laparotomy and that arterial occlusion without peritonitis favors endovascular-first where available, while MVT without peritonitis is managed with anticoagulation, so my final selection among the given non-endovascular choices still hinges on peritonitis and etiology rather than the older or newer incidence figures [^111rouix] [^1167p6KQ] [^113gNhbt].

> Let me synthesize the answer now and make sure it is safe: among the provided options, the most appropriate treatment is open surgery when the patient has peritonitis or suspected bowel necrosis, which is the life-saving pathway if endovascular therapy is not listed or not immediately available, whereas in confirmed mesenteric venous thrombosis without peritonitis the most appropriate option is aggressive anticoagulation only; thrombolysis plus anticoagulation is not first-line, and observation is unsafe in suspected AMI, so if the question presumes the common arterial occlusive scenario requiring immediate, definitive intervention, open surgery is the correct choice among the given answers, with the caveat that an endovascular-first approach would be preferred for arterial occlusion without peritonitis if it were an option [^113KTyYq] [^113gNhbt] [^111M8eJp] [^115U7DRB].

> I should confirm supportive measures that accompany whichever procedural path is chosen so the plan is complete: institute immediate resuscitation with fluids, broad-spectrum antibiotics, early anticoagulation unless contraindicated, rapid multidisciplinary coordination, and long-term anticoagulation after revascularization when indicated, because these steps improve perfusion, reduce infectious complications, and support outcomes while definitive therapy proceeds [^1111B9HS] [^113gNhbt] [^112TqRdZ].

The most appropriate treatment for acute mesenteric occlusion is **immediate revascularization** [^113gNhbt] to restore bowel perfusion and prevent irreversible ischemia [^114EHJFT], with the choice between endovascular and open surgery depending on **clinical presentation and available expertise** [^116YvFCz].

- **Endovascular revascularization** (embolectomy, thrombolysis, angioplasty/stenting) is first-line [^113gNhbt] for arterial occlusion without peritonitis or bowel necrosis [^114EHJFT], as it is less invasive and associated with lower mortality and shorter hospital stay [^114rtNpi].

- **Open surgery** (embolectomy, bypass, or endarterectomy with bowel resection) is mandatory for patients with peritonitis [^113KTyYq] or suspected bowel necrosis, as it allows direct assessment and resection of non-viable bowel [^11663uqi].

- **Aggressive anticoagulation alone** is insufficient for arterial occlusion [^113gNhbt] but is first-line [^114rtNpi] for mesenteric venous thrombosis [^116dD6CG].

- **Observation overnight with lactate levels** is inappropriate [^1173aRgb] due to the risk of rapid progression to bowel infarction and death.

Therefore, the most appropriate treatment is **endovascular revascularization** [^114EHJFT] for stable patients without peritonitis and **open surgery** [^113KTyYq] for those with peritonitis or bowel necrosis.

Mesenteric ischemia is a serious medical condition characterized by insufficient vascular supply to the small bowel. In the acute setting, endovascular interventions, including embolectomy, transcatheter thrombolysis, and angioplasty with or without stent placement, are recommended as initial therapeutic options. For nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia, transarterial infusion of vasodilators, such as papaverine or prostaglandin E1, is the recommended initial treatment.

In the chronic setting, endovascular means of revascularization, including angioplasty and stent placement, are generally recommended, with surgical options such as bypass or endarterectomy considered alternative options. Although the diagnosis of median arcuate ligament syndrome remains controversial, diagnostic angiography can be helpful in rendering a diagnosis, with the preferred treatment option being a surgical release.

Systemic anticoagulation is recommended as initial therapy for venous mesenteric ischemia with acceptable rates of recanalization. If anticoagulation fails, transcatheter thrombolytic infusion can be considered, with possible adjunctive placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt to augment antegrade flow.

The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process supports the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals using established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment.

Non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI) should be suspected in critically ill patients with abdominal pain or distension requiring vasopressor support and evidence of multi-organ dysfunction (Recommendation 1B).

Unexplained abdominal distension or gastrointestinal bleeding may be the only signs of acute intestinal ischemia in NOMI and may be undetectable in sedated patients in the ICU in approximately 25% of cases. Patients surviving cardiopulmonary resuscitation who develop bacteremia and diarrhea (with or without abdominal pain) should be suspected of having NOMI. Right-sided abdominal pain associated with the passage of maroon or bright red blood in the stool is highly suggestive of NOMI in these patients.

Gastrointestinal perfusion is often impaired early in situations of critical illness, major surgery, or trauma, all of which are characterized by increased demands on the circulation to maintain tissue oxygen delivery. This relative mesenteric hypoperfusion is often aggravated by an underlying hypovolemic or low-flow state. In cases of intraabdominal hypertension, all of the structures within the abdominal cavity are compressed, leading to regional hypoperfusion to the organs in the splanchnic bed. Such an effect is most pronounced in the liver due to its size. Animal studies have shown that even with intraabdominal pressure of only 10 mmHg, portal venous blood flow is reduced considerably, and at 20 mmHg, the portal venous flow and hepatic arterial flow are reduced by 35% and 55%, respectively.

Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is a serious surgical emergency. It is imperative to maintain a high index of suspicion, particularly when presented with a history of abrupt onset of abdominal pain, acidosis, and organ failure. This clinical scenario should lead to immediate imaging, such as CTA, for diagnosis. Alongside rapid resuscitation and thorough assessment of the CTA, the patient should be explored surgically to assess bowel viability, restore vascular flow, and resect non-viable bowel.

In the operating room, prioritizing revascularization is essential. Traditionally, open revascularization approaches have been utilized in conjunction with damage control laparotomy. Recent advancements in early diagnosis have facilitated the implementation of endovascular techniques. While evidence on the effectiveness of endovascular interventions is limited, they offer apparent advantages over open surgery for certain patients.

Preliminary evidence indicates that outcomes improve when AMI is treated in specialized centers employing a multidisciplinary approach. Evaluating and treating these patients through an interdisciplinary team reduces the time to reperfusion to the shortest possible duration.

Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia is increasing, representing about 25% of AMI cases. If there is no evidence of necrosis on CT, the recommended treatment is resuscitation to improve organ perfusion, considering the possible use of vasodilators. Both papaverine and prostaglandin E1 are associated with decreased mortality and need for surgical intervention. Early exploration is not recommended; it should be reserved for circumstances that strongly suggest full-thickness necrosis and impending perforation. With improved perfusion, even very significant ischemic changes may be reversible. However, if the patient has recalcitrant shock, exploration via laparoscopy or laparotomy is necessary to exclude necrotic intestine. It may not be clear on initial evaluation if a patient's gut is dying because of systemic critical illness or vice versa; these situations warrant discussion of goals of care before intervention.

Venous thrombosis makes up 10% of AMI cases. The first-line treatment is systemic anticoagulation and bowel rest. Pharmacologic thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy may be useful adjuncts in patients without signs of bowel necrosis who do not have an adequate response to anticoagulation. It may be performed via percutaneous transhepatic, transjugular, or transfemoral approaches or by direct venous cannulation intraoperatively. There are no controlled studies of these techniques, and they are considered experimental at this time. Similar to patients presenting with nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia, exploration should be undertaken only in circumstances such as persistent shock or peritonitis.

### Management of chronic mesenteric ischemia: The role of endovascular therapy [^115BkuLU]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic mesenteric ischemia is an uncommon disorder that most commonly presents as abdominal pain. Surgical revascularization has traditionally been the treatment of choice. Initially, endovascular management was attempted as an alternative for high-risk patients. Over time, improvements in stent technology, techniques refinement, and increased efficiency of antiplatelet regimens have boosted the popularity of this minimally invasive approach.

This review presents the available series on endovascular treatment for chronic mesenteric ischemia, emphasizing short- and long-term outcomes, as well as morbidity and mortality results. Principles of operative technique, controversial issues, and topics of interest are also discussed.

### The implementation of a pathway and care bundle for the management of acute occlusive arterial mesenteric ischemia reduced mortality [^111yU6xb]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

It must be noted that the total annual number of patients was higher in the post-pathway time. The most important factor for this was the increased number of referrals from other hospitals. The referred patients had more often diagnostic imaging already done. Another factor is that the utilization of AMI-specific CT protocol doubled. A possible explanation for the mortality differences between groups is that, in the post-group, there were less severely ill patients referred from surrounding centers. This hypothesis was tested by comparing mortality numbers in two subgroups.

- **First subgroup**: Patients arriving with a diagnostic CT already performed in the referring hospital. The numbers, as shown in Table 3, indicate that the lower post-group mortality rate was not due to the referred patients. In fact, the mortality difference between pre-group and post-group was more evident in patients diagnosed in the study hospital.

- **Second subgroup**: Patients who underwent laparotomy, excluding the less severely ill who underwent EVT revascularization only. The significant mortality difference remained also in this subgroup. These analyses do not support the hypothesis of different patient populations as the cause of the improved prognosis.

Several recent studies focus on comparing mortality between open and endovascular management. However, revascularization technique is only a single factor affecting the outcome. Bundle strategy and attempts to affect several steps in the patient's pathway are less studied entities. The concept of intestinal stroke centers has been present.

### Emergency laparoscopy — current best practice [^111tfZtw]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Acute mesenteric ischemia is due to arterial occlusion (approximately 50% of cases), venous occlusion (15%), and non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (35%). Clinical diagnosis is usually confirmed by the use of selective mesenteric angiography or CT scanning. One of the most important factors determining the prognosis of these patients is early and prompt diagnosis. Depending on the duration and extent of ischemia, treatment consists of embolectomy or laparotomy with resection of infarcted bowel segments in cases where the patient develops signs of peritonitis. The potential role of emergency laparoscopy, therefore, relates to its diagnostic rather than its therapeutic opportunities.

Certain benefits of diagnostic laparoscopy are suggested. These patients are frequently severely dehydrated and acidotic, with significant co-morbidity, and as such, are at significant risk from contrast-dependent angiography. Conversely, diagnostic laparoscopy is relatively quick and well-tolerated, and if necessary, can be performed at the bedside in the Intensive Care Unit or emergency room. At laparoscopy, the small and large bowel can be visualized, and other conditions causing an acute abdomen may be diagnosed, enabling correct management. However, the rate of mesenteric ischemia among patients with an acute abdomen is only 1%, and laparoscopy does not guarantee correct recognition of mesenteric ischemia, particularly in early cases, nor does it allow palpation of the small bowel mesentery to detect arterial pulsation. Despite this, a few published case reports suggest potential benefits.

Early and effective revascularization can significantly reduce mortality and improve patient outcomes. In most cases, it is recommended to complete revascularization prior to making decisions on bowel resection; exceptions are discussed hereinafter. Acute mesenteric ischemia generally falls into one of four categories: arterial embolism, arterial thrombosis, NOMI (non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia), and MVT (mesenteric venous thrombosis), with the relative distribution depending on the patient population served in an individual hospital. The revascularization approach and subsequent steps depend on the type of insult and the patient's physiology. Anticoagulation should be considered at the time of diagnosis unless there is an absolute contraindication.

- **Arterial embolism**: Arterial embolism accounts for roughly 25% of all acute mesenteric ischemia diagnoses and has been decreasing in recent decades. The source of the embolus is typically the heart or the aorta; approximately 50% of patients have atrial fibrillation, and 33% have a history of previous emboli. Emboli typically lodge at points of normal anatomic vessel narrowing, and the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) is commonly involved because of its relatively large diameter and low takeoff angle. More than 20% of SMA emboli are associated with concurrent emboli, most commonly to the kidney and spleen. For arterial embolism, embolectomy is generally preferred. Although thrombolytic therapy is an option, it is not recommended as it may take hours to days to lyse the clot and risks progression of bowel ischemia. Postintervention antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy may be beneficial in the setting of small vessel disease.

### Comparison between endovascular and surgical treatment of acute arterial occlusive mesenteric ischemia [^1155wwJF]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

The optimal strategy for the initial treatment of acute occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) is debated. The aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness, timelines, and outcomes of endovascular versus open surgical treatment in patients with acute SMA occlusion. This was a preplanned substudy of the prospective observational multicenter AMESI (Acute MESenteric Ischaemia) study.

- **Methods**: Patients with SMA occlusion were divided into surgical and endovascular treatment groups. The surgical group included patients initially subjected to open surgical treatment with surgical or hybrid revascularization or intestinal resection only. The endovascular group included patients initially revascularized endovascularly and was further divided according to treatment effectiveness. Patients were also categorized according to revascularization or no revascularization, and subanalysis was performed for different revascularization methods. Baseline and outcome comparisons were made using Fisher and Mann-Whitney U tests. Risk factors for in-hospital mortality were analyzed using a logistic regression model.

- **Results**: Of 158 patients, 107 had surgical treatment and 51 had endovascular treatment. The surgical group had higher baseline illness severity scores and higher C-reactive protein and lactate values. The mortality rates in the endovascular effective, endovascular insufficient as monotherapy, and surgical groups were 2.9%, 41.2%, and 45.8%, respectively. In multivariable analysis, surgery was not an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality. The rate of arterial embolism was higher in the endovascular treatment group.

### Acute mesenteric ischaemia [^117AVtLJ]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

As soon as a diagnosis has been made (or even suspected), early initiation of resuscitation with fluids, correction of electrolytes, and starting intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics is warranted.

The patient should be assessed for age, co-morbidity, and physiological reserves. Elderly, frail, and very co-morbid patients may not be surgical candidates, nor candidates for active intervention. In these instances, a purely supportive or palliative approach should be considered after patient consideration and conversation or discussion with the next of kin, as appropriate.

For patients who are candidates for intervention, early decision-making and a clear strategy with multidisciplinary discussion (for example, gastrointestinal surgeon, vascular surgeon, and interventional radiologist) should be initiated to arrive at the optimal strategy for each patient.

For patients with NOMI, non-surgical options are needed to correct the problem. The focus is to treat underlying causes, such as stopping or reducing vasopressors, improving fluid balance, and optimizing cardiac output.

### Managing acute mesenteric ischaemia [^112TqcrE]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

A key to improving the management of acute mesenteric ischaemia (AMI) is increased awareness. This involves adequately raising and communicating suspicion, followed by early diagnosis and treatment. CT with intravenous contrast enhancement and imaging in the arterial phase, followed by early revascularization in the case of arterial occlusion, has the potential to rescue the bowel. Early systemic treatment that optimizes volume status and organ perfusion is important for all subtypes of AMI and is especially crucial for non-occlusive mesenteric ischaemia (NOMI). The selection of initial management requires a multidisciplinary approach and cannot be based solely on time.

### CIRSE standards of practice for the interventional radiology management of acute and chronic arterial mesenteric ischaemia [^1135o9bJ]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

The goals of treatment include symptom relief, improved quality of life, weight restoration, and improved survival via prevention of bowel infarction. Traditional surgical revascularization produces good outcomes, including high long-term patency rates, with primary patency reported at 91–94% at 1 year and 80–81% at 5 years. Nonetheless, endovascular revascularization is now the primary treatment method as the hospital stay is shorter and in-hospital mortality is lower. Limited evidence has not yet confirmed that long-term patency matches that of surgery, and further studies, ideally randomized controlled trials, are needed.

Relative contraindications to endovascular treatment are heavily calcified lesions and lesions caused by extrinsic compression. Surgery may also be considered in younger patients, as data suggest longer patency times after mesenteric bypass.

Median arcuate ligament syndrome (Dunbar syndrome), which results from active compression of the CA by the median arcuate ligament, is considered a contraindication to endovascular repair. However, CA stenting may be performed if the median arcuate ligament has been surgically released beforehand.

Open surgical mesenteric revascularization is generally reserved for patients in whom endovascular treatment is not considered appropriate due to unfavorable mesenteric lesions, for whom endovascular treatment has failed, or in cases of in-stent restenosis or occlusion. For patients who have undergone percutaneous stenting, endovascular re-interventions can be carried out until they are no longer possible.

### Management of acute mesenteric ischaemia in adult patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1134a1nF]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

In our analysis, a clear signal for the advantage of the endovascular approach seems to be abolished by adjusting for just two laboratory variables at baseline, available in all four applicable studies. Such an analysis, including only four studies, is of low precision, and the two laboratory variables probably do not adequately represent disease severity. Nevertheless, our results support the hypothesis that in these studies, mortality is driven by patients' severity of illness rather than the management strategy and highlight that the level of detail when reporting the results is insufficient.

In our review, it was decided not to adjust for age and comorbidities of acute mesenteric ischaemia (AMI) patients. These characteristics are commonly reported in studies, but while they may be important prognostic factors for mortality and may, in some cases, also influence the selection of the treatment strategy (e.g. initiation of end-of-life care or decision not to operate if the endovascular approach fails), they do not reflect AMI-related severity of illness.

In clinical practice, patients presenting with peritonitis due to any subtype of AMI are commonly allocated to initial surgical treatment, whereas patients with mild symptoms and occlusive arterial AMI undergo endovascular revascularization, when available. Thus, patients allocated to these two treatments differ in their severity of illness at baseline, and it is not surprising that crude analysis comparing endovascular revascularization and open surgery as initial treatment approaches shows higher mortality in the open surgery group.

### Debate: Whether an endovascular-first strategy is the optimal approach for treating acute mesenteric ischemia [^1136EQMh]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Acute mesenteric ischemia continues to be a life-threatening condition, especially in elderly patients with multiple comorbidities. The recognition and correct diagnosis of this condition are critical; delays in therapy can lead to loss of bowel or life, or both. The basic surgical principles in treating acute mesenteric ischemia have long included early recognition, resuscitation, urgent revascularization, resection of necrotic bowel, and reassessment with second-look laparotomies. Endovascular techniques now offer a less invasive alternative. However, whether an endovascular-first or open surgery-first approach is preferred in most patients remains unclear. Our discussants will attempt to clarify these issues.

### Comparison between endovascular and surgical treatment of acute arterial occlusive mesenteric ischemia [^111qe87P]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Scientific debate about the preference of endovascular versus surgical treatment as the first-line strategy in patients suffering from acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) has been ongoing in the literature for some time now. In a transatlantic "pro-con" discussion, Orr and Endean emphasized that endovascular treatment was not the best first-line option due to delays in assessment of bowel viability and restoration of mesenteric blood flow, in addition to the lack of proven survival advantage following endovascular treatment. The authors of the "con" part concluded that the main question is not whether endovascular treatment can be done, but whether it should be done.

In contrast, the "pro" part of this debate by Björck underlined results of several investigations showing improved outcomes with an endovascular strategy. Likewise, Kärkkäinen et al. reported an overall mortality of 32% with an endovascular-first strategy, and endovascular treatment was then successful in 88% of patients. Beaulieu et al. also concluded that endovascular treatment was associated with lower mortality and a shorter hospital length of stay. Similar conclusions have been reached by Naazar et al.

It should be noted, nevertheless, that the aforementioned studies were all retrospective in nature, and patients subjected to endovascular treatment pathways were commonly younger and less severely ill. Additionally, the timing of the onset of ischemia has been poorly documented in previous studies. Based on available evidence, the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guide…

Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is a life-threatening condition associated with dismal outcomes. This study sought to evaluate the evolution of presentation, treatment, and outcomes of AMI over the past two decades. AMI patients presenting at a single institution were reviewed from 1993 to 2016, with venous thrombosis patients excluded. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Patients were stratified by etiology and diagnosis date (before 2004 versus 2004 and later). Ordered logistic regression was performed for longitudinal temporal analysis.

A total of 303 patients were identified. AMI mechanisms included embolic (49%), thrombotic (29%), and non-occlusive (NOMI) (22%). The majority were women (55%), with 50% having atrial fibrillation, and 23% were on anticoagulation therapy. The mean age was 72 ± 13 years. In total, 345 procedures were performed on 242 patients, which included 321 open and 24 hybrid/endovascular procedures. Among the 189 embolic/thrombotic patients managed operatively, 45% (n = 85) underwent mesenteric revascularization, while 39 (21%) had findings of non-survivable bowel necrosis.

Among the 104 patients who did not undergo revascularization, 64 (62%) died within 30-days compared to 36 out of 85 (42%) patients who were revascularized (P = 0.01). The 30-day mortality rate was 61% and remained stable over time (P = 0.91). When stratified by AMI etiology, the thrombotic cohort had worse survival compared to embolic and NOMI patients (P = 0.04). Since 2000, there was a significant decrease in the percentage of embolic AMI events (P = 0.04).

### Acute mesenteric ischemia: Updated guidelines of the World Society of Emergency Surgery [^111rouix]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is caused by the sudden interruption of blood supply to the intestine, leading to cellular damage, intestinal necrosis, and commonly patient death if untreated. AMI may be occlusive or non-occlusive (NOMI), with the primary etiology further defined as mesenteric arterial embolism (50%), mesenteric arterial thrombosis (15–25%), or mesenteric venous thrombosis (5–15%). The overall incidence is low (0.09–0.2% of all acute admissions to emergency departments), representing an infrequent cause of abdominal pain but a common cause of emergent intestinal resection. Prompt diagnosis and intervention are essential to reduce the mortality rates that exceed 50%.

Traditionally, AMI has been treated with open surgery. Over the past two decades, the rapid development of endovascular techniques has made this approach an important alternative for patients with occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). Some studies have shown that endovascular therapy is associated with lower rates of mortality and bowel resection than the traditional, open approach.

The assessment and therapy carried out by an interdisciplinary team should keep the time-to-reperfusion interval as short as possible. In addition, advances in postoperative care have improved outcomes for patients with short bowel syndrome. Both in-hospital care and further bowel rehabilitation lead to increased survival and better long-term outcomes with an acceptable quality of life.

Introducing a clinical pathway and centers of excellence results in higher awareness of AMI and more appropriate imaging.

Early diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) can be challenging, as the symptoms often mimic other abdominal pathologies. A complete history and physical examination will help establish the differential diagnosis. Severe, poorly localized mid-abdominal pain is a hallmark of AMI; in the absence of peritonitis on examination, this constitutes the classic "pain out of proportion to physical findings". The abrupt onset of pain is consistent with acute arterial occlusion, whereas nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI) or mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT) may have a more insidious presentation. A history of postprandial pain, weight loss, and food fear is consistent with chronic mesenteric ischemia, which may progress to acute arterial thrombosis. Atrial fibrillation is a common underlying etiology of embolic AMI. Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia is due to low cardiac output, vasoconstriction, or hypovolemia. It may be seen in hospitalized critically ill patients or in patients presenting to the emergency department with severe recent illness that might have led to sepsis or dehydration. Mesenteric venous thrombosis is typically seen in patients with one or more of Virchow's triad (stasis, hypercoagulability, endothelial damage), which may be associated with diseases such as pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, portal hypertension, and liver disease. It may also be seen after splenectomy or bariatric surgery.

Laboratory tests are invariably obtained in patients with acute abdominal pain, but it is important to recognize that no biomarkers are adequately sensitive or specific enough to diagnose or exclude AMI. A complete blood count and comprehensive evaluation are necessary for accurate diagnosis and management.

### Managing acute mesenteric ischaemia [^1141Jsr5]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Use of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy depends on the subtype of AMI, with therapeutic anticoagulation being the main treatment for venous occlusive AMI. Antibiotic therapy should be administered to all patients with peritonitis undergoing bowel resection, whereas no guidance exists for patients not requiring bowel resection.

Although the time to diagnosis and intervention is very important in the management of AMI, the severity of bowel damage and the selection of an optimal management strategy cannot be determined based on time alone. The time since symptom onset or from admission to diagnosis does not inherently alter the outcome and has been shown to be similar in patients allocated to palliative compared to active treatment. Moreover, patients referred to a specialist unit had the longest time from symptoms to treatment while simultaneously having the best outcomes, with the caveat that they had lower disease severity and fewer laboratory abnormalities at admission. In addition, treatment success is influenced by the presence of collaterals and the subtype of AMI.

### Surgical management of mesenteric ischemia [^111RGgj5]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Successful management of acute mesenteric ischemia is predicated on prompt diagnosis, which still remains clinical in nature. No single radiographic test has a sensitivity or specificity reliable enough to supplant frequent and thorough physical examination and clinical judgment. Operative management requires adequate excision of clearly necrotic bowel and a high index of suspicion of borderline segments. Arterial reconstruction is best done with autogenous tissue when possible in the setting of gangrene or spillage.

While diagnosis of chronic mesenteric ischemia is far more straightforward, significant controversy still remains regarding operative management with regards to the number of vessels reconstructed, direction of the graft, and choice of conduit.

### Acute mesenteric ischemia: Guidelines of the World Society of Emergency Surgery [^112fGEXL]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Endovascular revascularization procedures may have a role in cases of partial arterial occlusion (Recommendation 1C). Several recent case series have documented the combination of endovascular techniques with pharmacologic therapy. However, it is crucial to note that the presence of bowel ischemia or infarction precludes the use of thrombolytic therapy. These techniques are primarily attempted in very early cases of acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI), and their effectiveness remains to be fully established. Additional contraindications for thrombolytic therapy include recent surgery, trauma, cerebrovascular or gastrointestinal bleeding, and uncontrolled hypertension.

In recent retrospective series involving 679 patients with AMI who underwent vascular intervention (both open and endovascular), endovascular treatment was performed in 24% of cases (165 patients). The technique was successful in 87% of these patients. Moreover, in-hospital mortality was lower compared to those who underwent open procedures (25% vs. 40%). This underscores that only patients who do not require emergent open intervention are suitable for this technical approach to revascularization.

Endovascular embolectomy may be achieved by percutaneous mechanical aspiration or thrombolysis and allows for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, with or without stenting. This is particularly feasible in case series of patients with CTA evidence of acute partial or complete occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), either the main trunk or branch, without clinical or imaging evidence of advanced bowel ischemia. Complete technical success was achieved in 28% of cases; all cases had occlusion of the main SMA.

### Management of acute mesenteric ischaemia in adult patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113xNXSo]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Guidance on managing acute mesenteric ischaemia (AMI) is largely based on expert opinion and retrospective studies pooling different subtypes of AMI. In clinical practice, management strategy is often selected based on the patient's severity of illness, whereas randomized controlled trials or even adjusted analyses comparing different strategies are rarely available. We aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effect of different management options when adjusted for the baseline severity of illness.

- **Methods**: A literature search was performed in PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus. Studies recruiting patients after the year 2000, assessing at least 10 adult patients with reliably confirmed AMI, and comparing different management approaches were considered for inclusion. Thirteen study questions on different management strategies in different subtypes of AMI were formulated a priori. We included studies reporting results of adjusted analyses or reporting any variables reflecting the severity of illness in both study groups under comparison.

- **Results**: A total of 3,324 publications were identified, 321 were selected for full-text review, and 31 were included in the review and analysis. Most of the studies comparing different management strategies of AMI did not report the severity of illness in the groups under comparison. Any variable that could be considered to reflect the severity of illness was reported in 26 studies. The available data only allowed one meta-regression analysis comparing initial endovascular revascularization.

### Local thrombolytic therapy in acute mesenteric ischemia [^1137BTex]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is a lethal disease with mortality rates ranging from 24% to 94%. This high mortality is attributed to delayed diagnosis, ineffective treatment regimens, and the condition of moribund patients. Recent advances include the use of computerized tomography angiography (CTA) for prompt diagnosis and sophisticated methods such as local thrombolytic therapy (LTT) for treatment. Multidetector CTA is a fast and accurate method, with sensitivity and specificity of 94% and 96%, respectively. This diagnostic accuracy, combined with promising treatment alternatives, mainly LTT, has led to better prognoses. Additionally, laparoscopy has proved effective as an evaluation method for acute abdomen, allowing for the diagnosis of necrotic bowel segments and tailored treatment strategies. Second-look laparoscopy is frequently employed to assess bowel viability after bowel resection or thrombolysis, further improving outcomes in acute mesenteric ischemia.

This paper aims to evaluate the experience of a referral center in managing acute mesenteric ischemia and the results of the applied algorithm.

### Diagnosis and management of acute mesenteric ischemia: What you need to know [^112JiKM9]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is associated with high mortality rates. There are multiple challenges in establishing an accurate early diagnosis and providing state-of-the-art care for AMI patients. A high index of suspicion is key for early diagnosis. Once suspicion is raised, a triphasic computed tomography angiography is the essential diagnostic tool.

Avoiding delays, using hybrid operating rooms, and employing contemporary revascularization techniques for arterial occlusive AMI can significantly improve the prognosis. Regional health care systems should direct AMI patients to centers with the capabilities to provide all aspects of care at any hour. The acute care surgeon plays a central role in performing laparotomies and bowel resections when needed, and coordinating the management flow in close collaboration with vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists to ensure prompt and effective revascularization.

A significant share of patients with arterial occlusive AMI can be managed by endovascular revascularization without the need for a laparotomy. There are no reliable tools for predicting transmural bowel necrosis; therefore, individual assessment and clinical experience are critical in decision-making when choosing between laparotomy and close observation.

During laparotomy, an atherosclerotic occlusion at the root of the superior mesenteric artery can be stented using a retrograde open mesenteric or percutaneous approach, with surgical bypass seldom needed. Hospital-specific management pathways are very useful for standardizing care.

### Mesenteric ischemia [^115Qc3Xq]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Mesenteric ischemia remains a highly lethal entity. Improving survival requires an aggressive, multidisciplinary approach. High-risk patients with severe abdominal pain and a paucity of physical findings should undergo emergent imaging in a search for this disease. Improvements in laboratory tests and advances in imaging techniques may improve the ability to diagnose mesenteric ischemia earlier in its course before irreversible damage has occurred.

Many treatment modalities are available and should be tailored to each individual case. By recognizing and preventing ischemia-reperfusion injury, the cycle of protracted complications may be broken. A decrease in mortality from mesenteric ischemia is finally occurring. Early recognition and aggressive treatment may allow clinicians to have a marked impact on patient survival.

### Open and endovascular management of acute mesenteric ischaemia: A systematic review [^116Zok6y]. World Journal of Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Acute mesenteric ischaemia (AMI) is a life-threatening surgical emergency resulting from thromboembolic occlusion of the mesenteric vasculature. Traditional management of AMI has involved open revascularization, with or without bowel resection — a procedure that carries considerable morbidity and mortality in an already unwell, compromised patient. Endovascular and more minimally invasive management approaches to AMI have been reported. Proponents of endovascular management suggest that this approach may be associated with reduced morbidity and mortality compared to open surgery.

- **Objectives**: To assess the impact of the endovascular approach for AMI on mortality and the need for subsequent laparotomy and/or bowel resection.

- **Data sources**: The search bodies PubMed and Medline were interrogated.

- **Eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions**: All studies in English with more than 10 patients examining outcomes for patients undergoing endovascular intervention for acute mesenteric ischaemia were included. All patients over 18 years presenting with a diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischaemia secondary to an arterial thromboembolic source were included. Studies examining endovascular intervention alone or endovascular and open intervention were selected.

- **Results**: The 30-day mortality for the endovascular approach from all 13 studies was 16–42%. Of the 7 comparative studies, including results of open revascularization, the 30-day mortality for patients treated with an endovascular approach was 15–39% versus 33–50% for open revascularization. Laparotomy rates post-initial endovascular intervention were examined, but details were truncated.

### The role of endovascular therapy in acute mesenteric ischemia [^113FFhfE]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

After the removal of a thrombotic clot by aspiration, thrombolysis, or angioplasty, treatment of the underlying stenotic or occlusive lesions can be achieved during the same session. Angioplasty and stenting, if performed early, have been shown to prevent intestinal infarction and obviate the need for laparotomy. The hybrid approach facilitates endovascular intervention and represents a useful technique for the management of patients with acute mesenteric ischemia who require emergency laparotomy.

Wyers et al. drew attention to the benefits of combining laparotomy (direct bowel examination to confirm viability) with endovascular intervention (to avoid the need for bypass grafting), particularly for patients who would otherwise require open surgical revascularization.

In cases of embolism, after the initial aspiration has failed, Raupach et al. currently tend to use direct surgical embolectomy of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) trunk and resection of necrotic bowel parts. This approach saves time and prevents a delayed diagnosis of bowel necrosis.

Acute embolic occlusion seems to be more suitable for thrombolytic therapy than thrombotic occlusions because emboli typically are dislodged to the periphery of the SMA in an atherosclerosis-free segment. Local pharmacologic thrombolysis has the potential to dissolve the clot completely, with minimal trauma to the occluded artery.

### Assessment and management of peripheral arterial disease: What every cardiologist should know [^113Ri2ZH]. Heart (2021). Low credibility.

Mesenteric artery disease is often associated with either acute or chronic mesenteric ischaemia, both of which are uncommon but have high mortality rates if not treated promptly. The classic symptoms of chronic mesenteric artery disease include food aversion due to postprandial abdominal pain, weight loss, and either diarrhoea or constipation. Typically, symptoms develop only when two out of the three main arterial systems — the coeliac trunk, superior mesenteric artery, and inferior mesenteric artery — are severely diseased due to the robust collateral circulation. Revascularisation is indicated for all symptomatic patients with chronic mesenteric ischaemia.

For older patients with multiple comorbidities, an endovascular approach with primary stenting is typically the first option to minimise perioperative complications. Alternatively, if a patient is a lower-risk surgical candidate, surgical repair offers more symptom relief and higher primary patency but comes at the expense of a slower recovery and longer hospital stays compared with endovascular repair.

Acute mesenteric ischaemia most commonly occurs in the superior mesenteric artery from an embolic source, although thrombotic occlusion due to atherosclerotic disease can also be seen. Mortality is very high if diagnosis or treatment is delayed. The classic presentation is acute severe abdominal pain that is out of proportion to the physical exam, characterized by a soft abdomen without rebound or guarding. While D-dimer is highly sensitive for acute mesenteric ischaemia, its specificity is poor. As there is no RCT comparing open surgery with endovascular therapy, treatment often depends on local expertise.

### Acute mesenteric ischaemia [^112p7UBe]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

The question of what treatment is appropriate and when is critical in managing acute mesenteric ischaemia (AMI). Patients with occlusive AMI require urgent intervention to first re-establish blood flow, particularly to the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), followed by resection of non-viable bowel if necessary. The SMA, being the most important artery, is the primary focus for revascularization. Due to the collateral arterial mesenteric network, it is rarely necessary to address both the SMA and the coeliac trunk.

### Endovascular techniques in acute arterial mesenteric ischemia [^116GMGAc]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Rapid developments in preoperative noninvasive imaging, as well as advanced endovascular techniques, have made endovascular treatment of acute arterial mesenteric ischemia a feasible option for many patients. Multidetector computed tomographic angiography will often provide the diagnosis and guide treatment. The use of mechanical and aspiration embolectomy, sometimes in combination with thrombolytic therapy, is often successful in offering these very sick patients a viable treatment alternative to open surgical revascularization. Underlying occlusive lesions can be addressed in the same setting.

Hybrid techniques, which involve open abdominal exploration combined with endovascular tools, have the potential to offer minimally invasive treatment to an even larger patient population. Access to a hybrid operating room is highly advantageous for these operations, as it allows for both open and endovascular interventions to be performed in the same setting. A fixed angiographic system also minimizes radiation exposure and improves imaging capabilities compared to a conventional, mobile C-arm. These tools must be used in conjunction with wise, careful clinical evaluation of the patient.

### ACR appropriateness criteria imaging of mesenteric ischemia [^115LL4M7]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Mesenteric ischemia is an uncommon condition resulting from decreased blood flow to the small or large bowel in an acute or chronic setting. Acute ischemia is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality; however, it is difficult to diagnose clinically. Therefore, a high degree of suspicion and prompt imaging evaluation are necessary. Chronic mesenteric ischemia is less common and typically caused by atherosclerotic occlusion or severe stenosis of at least two of the main mesenteric vessels. While several imaging examination options are available for the initial evaluation of both acute and chronic mesenteric ischemia, CTA of the abdomen and pelvis is overall the most appropriate choice for both conditions.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Case report: Direct revascularization in acute mesenteric ischemia by an endovascular approach [^114TAjL6]. CVIR Endovascular (2019). Low credibility.

Acute mesenteric ischemia is a relatively rare but life-threatening clinical condition, and outcomes depend on early diagnosis and prompt intervention.

- **Case presentation**: An 85-year-old man and a 75-year-old woman developed acute mesenteric ischemia due to cardiac embolism. The first patient received an insufficient dose of anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation, and the second patient discontinued her anticoagulants to avoid bleeding during a routine colonoscopy. Both patients presented with severe abdominal pain, and computed tomography showed thrombus in the superior mesenteric artery. Successful revascularization with a good clinical outcome was achieved by means of an endovascular first approach.

- **Conclusion**: This case report shows that an endovascular approach, in contrast to open surgery, not only enables the revascularization of main trunk lesions but can also facilitate revascularization of side branches. Endovascular treatment used to be limited to a selected group of patients without signs of bowel necrosis, but there is a tendency to initiate endovascular revascularization in all patients because it is associated with reduced mortality, a reduced laparotomy rate, and a reduction in the resected length of bowel.

### Comparison between endovascular and surgical treatment of acute arterial occlusive mesenteric ischemia [^116FmdE7]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is a life-threatening vascular insult that can frequently be fatal without timely intervention. However, there is an ongoing debate regarding the optimal initial treatment modality for arterial occlusion: endovascular versus surgical.

Recently published guidelines on AMI note a benefit of endovascular therapy compared to open surgery in terms of lower bowel resection rates and lower 30-day mortality rates. Nevertheless, it is important to note that all studies scrutinizing endovascular revascularization have a significant level of population heterogeneity. The authors recommend endovascular treatment in the early phases of acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI); however, acute peritonitis universally mandates open surgery. Endovascular treatment may in some instances be associated with adverse outcomes. Li et al. suggested that endovascular treatment as a primary approach did not improve outcomes compared to open surgery. These investigators documented that endovascular treatment may raise several concerns that could potentially worsen patient outcomes.

- **Concerns with endovascular treatment**: Firstly, endovascular treatment cannot preclude assessment of the viability of the gastrointestinal tract and may delay necessary bowel resection. Secondly, endovascular treatment failures may delay open revascularization and worsen outcomes. These concerns were also noted by Murphy et al. and Arthurs et al.

Another novel approach is retrograde open mesenteric stenting (ROMS), combining open and endovascular interventions and allowing inspection of gut viability.

Most often, re-exploration should be accomplished within 24–48 hours, and decisions regarding anastomosis, stoma, or additional resection can be made with plans for sequential abdominal closure.

In a review of 43 patients undergoing open mesenteric revascularization, the authors noted that 11 of the 23 patients undergoing a second-look operation required bowel resection. The bowel in these patients is often very swollen and poses a high risk for anastomotic leak. Recent studies suggest that careful hand-sewn techniques are preferable to the use of staples in this group.

These patients often suffer from acidosis, hypothermia, and coagulopathy, which require prompt and ongoing correction. Physiologic restoration is multifactorial and includes careful and limited crystalloid infusion to avoid abdominal compartment syndrome, frequent monitoring of lactate clearance and central venous oxygen saturation, and the use of viscoelastic techniques (TEG, ROTEM) to assess coagulation status and guide ongoing blood product administration. Recent evidence suggests that direct peritoneal resuscitation techniques can be useful in this scenario.

Mesenteric venous thrombosis can often be successfully treated with a continuous infusion of unfractionated heparin. (Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence 1B.)

MVT has a distinctive clinical finding on CTA scan, and when noted in a patient without findings of peritonitis, non-operative management should be considered. The first-line treatment for mesenteric venous thrombosis is anticoagulation. Systemic thrombolytic therapy is rarely indicated.

### Chronic mesenteric ischemia: How to select patients for invasive treatment [^111xYkx6]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) remains a well-described disease process that is difficult to diagnose. Since its initial description more than a century ago, a myriad of diagnostic and treatment modalities have been applied to ameliorate the classic symptoms of postprandial abdominal pain and weight loss. It is estimated that mesenteric occlusive disease affects approximately 1% to 18% of the population, with a majority of these patients manifesting no symptoms of CMI. While associated with a small prevalence, the potential economic impact of this disease process, with the increasing age of the population and the catastrophic outcomes associated with no treatment, is significant.

The primary etiology of CMI is atherosclerotic occlusive disease involving the ostia of the mesenteric arteries. Several studies have investigated the pathophysiology of the postprandial abdominal pain associated with ischemia, focusing on transport mechanisms, claudication of the intestinal musculature, and ischemia of the visceral nerves.

The process of diagnosing CMI involves assimilation of the presentation, typical history and physical examination findings, and results of imaging modalities. At the end of this diagnostic process, the decision to offer a patient surgical intervention is primarily based on symptomatology and results of duplex and other imaging modalities. There are specific criteria for which to offer symptomatic patients interventions. Patients who are asymptomatic do not need to undergo revascularization, which may disrupt collateral arterial circulation to the mesentery.

### ACR appropriateness criteria: Radiologic management of mesenteric ischemia [^1127SXXp]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Mesenteric vascular insufficiency is a serious medical condition that may lead to bowel infarction, morbidity, and mortality, with rates that may approach 50%. Recommended therapy for acute mesenteric ischemia includes aspiration embolectomy, transcatheter thrombolysis, and angioplasty with or without stenting for the treatment of underlying arterial stenosis. Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia may respond to transarterial infusion of vasodilators such as nitroglycerin, papaverine, glucagon, and prostaglandin E1.

Recommended therapy for chronic mesenteric ischemia includes angioplasty with or without stent placement. If an endovascular approach is not possible, surgical bypass or endarterectomy may be indicated. The diagnosis of median arcuate ligament syndrome is controversial, but surgical release may be appropriate depending on the clinical situation. Venous mesenteric ischemia may respond to systemic anticoagulation alone. Transhepatic or transjugular superior mesenteric vein catheterization and thrombolytic infusion can be offered depending on the severity of symptoms, the condition of the patient, and response to systemic anticoagulation.

### The role of endovascular therapy in acute mesenteric ischemia [^115UZBPy]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

A key goal of endovascular therapy in acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is to rapidly reestablish flow into the proximal arterial segments. The most appropriate therapy should be tailored according to the clinical symptoms, laboratory values, and computed tomography (CT) findings.

In some studies, primary endovascular therapy is applied with on-demand laparotomy for patients with mild or moderate clinical or laboratory signs of peritonitis. Under these conditions, thrombolysis is associated with a greater risk of major bleeding from necrotic bowel and also increases the risk of potential early surgical revision. These represent the main reasons why adjunctive therapy was not applied in some studies. Series in which patients presented with early mesenteric ischemia recommend thrombolysis. Despite modern advances in medicine, the early diagnosis of intestinal ischemia is still very difficult. In our daily practice, we often encounter patients with advanced mesenteric ischemia.

The most common percutaneous methods for AMI are aspiration thrombectomy, in which thrombus/embolus is removed by suction, and mechanical thrombectomy, which uses different automated devices for the fragmentation and removal of embolus. Mechanical thrombectomy involves aspiration of embolus and massive thrombosis using a 6-Fr guiding catheter. Other thrombectomy techniques include mechanical removal of the thrombus with the Rotarex system (Straub Medical AG, Wangs, Switzerland) or the Penumbra system, thrombolysis with a rheolytic system, or pharmacologic thrombolysis using the EKOS catheter.

Available studies show different directions of the treatment effect in adjusted analyses, such as for endovascular versus open revascularization or damage-control versus immediate definitive treatment. These results may indicate difficulties in properly adjusting the analyses and may also arise from different patient cohorts being studied. Treatment strategies may appear to be beneficial in certain populations, whereas any treatment itself is unlikely causing mortality. To address these questions, meticulous standardized reporting in future studies without subjective interpretation of results is required.

Many observational studies only summarize descriptive data without reporting the severity of illness or any adjusted comparisons. In our opinion, adding more such studies will unlikely bring any new information nor lead to progress in identifying optimal AMI management strategies based on evidence, as the patient selection process cannot be assessed. Moreover, presenting descriptive results and unadjusted analyses may even be misleading. For example, it is possible that revascularization/reperfusion of a bowel segment with already transmural damage may impair outcome, but to our knowledge, this has not been studied specifically. Accordingly, advocating the endovascular approach for the majority of patients based on results of crude analyses in studies where the groups differed at baseline may not be appropriate. The expected clear advantages of a less invasive (endovascular) over a more invasive (open surgery) approach could be lost due to patient selection. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to carefully consider patient selection criteria in future research to ensure valid and results that are reliable.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for chronic mesenteric ischemia, particularly the indications for revascularization, the SVS 2021 guidelines recommend using a shared decision-making approach between the patient and provider to discuss revascularization as a treatment option.

- **Patients with symptoms consistent with chronic mesenteric ischemia**: This includes those with occlusive disease isolated to a single mesenteric vessel, particularly the superior mesenteric artery.

- **Patients undergoing aortic reconstruction**: Both open and endovascular reconstructions should be considered for those with severe mesenteric artery occlusive disease involving the superior mesenteric artery.

- **Selected asymptomatic patients**: Consideration is also recommended for patients with severe mesenteric artery occlusive disease.

### Local thrombolytic therapy in acute mesenteric ischemia [^11529soT]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Acute mesenteric ischemia is a potentially lethal disease. Early recognition and accurate intervention remain the cornerstone of treatment. Patients may present with severe abdominal pain despite mild physical signs; therefore, clinical suspicion is mandatory for the diagnosis, though these findings may be absent in 25% of cases. In this series, all patients presented with abdominal pain, with symptoms ranging from mild discomfort to severe acute abdomen.

Duplex ultrasonography accurately identifies high-grade stenoses of the celiac artery and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and is the diagnostic modality of choice for chronic mesenteric ischemia. However, it is not suitable for diagnosing acute arterial mesenteric ischemia. It is operator-dependent, and overall diagnostic accuracy may change, especially during off-hours. Moreover, only the proximal segment of the SMA can be evaluated by duplex, as SMA emboli tend to lodge more distally, creating the potential for a false-negative result.

Although there are case reports concerning contrast-enhanced ultrasonography in acute mesenteric ischemia, acute cases usually present with overt abdominal gas and inflammatory changes, which may interfere with imaging by duplex. Thus, recent advances in optimizing CTA have shown promising results in diagnosing acute mesenteric ischemia. Helical, multidetector, and multislice CTA is a fast and accurate investigation for the diagnosis of this condition. It delineates vascular anatomy, evaluates bowel necrosis, and allows for early diagnosis. In most cases, CTA can be used as a sole diagnostic procedure.

### Acute mesenteric ischaemia: A pictorial review [^113wJyhf]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Intestinal ischaemia refers to insufficient blood flow within the mesenteric circulation to meet the metabolic demands in the bowel. It is a potentially catastrophic entity that may require emergent intervention in the acute setting. Although the clinical signs and symptoms of intestinal ischaemia are nonspecific, CT findings can be highly suggestive in the correct clinical setting.

After initial resuscitation, midline laparotomy should be performed, followed by the assessment of all areas of the intestine, with decisions for the resection of all frankly necrotic areas. The superior mesenteric artery (SMA) is easily palpated by placing fingers behind the root of the mesentery. The SMA is identified as a firm tubular structure, which may or may not have a palpable pulse. Otherwise, the SMA can also be reached by following the middle colic artery where it enters the SMA at the mesentery. Direct sharp dissection, exposing the artery from its surrounding mesenteric tissue, is required for proper exposure to perform revascularization. In cases where there is diagnostic uncertainty, an arteriogram is the study of choice; it can be done intraoperatively, especially in hybrid suites. Intraoperative duplex is a simple, rapid, repeatable, and often definitive alternative diagnostic modality.

Revascularization, when relevant, has an essential role in the multidisciplinary approach to acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI). Among the 104 patients who did not undergo revascularization, 64 (62%) died within 30 days compared to 36 out of 85 (42%) patients who were revascularized (p = 0.01).

Different techniques of blood flow restoration are used depending on the AMI pathophysiology. Embolectomy and angioplasty are well-established definitive treatments for SMA emboli. On the other hand, thrombosis of the SMA at the origin of the aorta (a common pathology in diffuse atherosclerosis) will require a bypass procedure. Bypass may be performed in either situation.

### Acute management of mesenteric emergencies: Tailoring the solution to the problem [^1128s2FJ]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) constitutes a life-threatening problem that can result in death, multiorgan failure, and severe nutritional disability. Although AMI is a rare cause of acute abdominal emergencies, affecting between 1 and 2 individuals per 10,000, the morbidity and mortality rates are high. Arterial embolic etiology composes nearly one-half of AMIs, with a sudden onset of severe abdominal pain considered the most common symptom. Arterial thrombosis is the second most common cause of AMI, presenting similarly to arterial embolic AMI, though often more severe due to anatomic differences. Veno-occlusive causes of AMI are the third most common and are associated with an insidious onset of vague abdominal pain.

Each patient is unique, and the treatment plan should be tailored to their individual needs, considering factors like the patient's age, comorbidities, overall health, and personal circumstances. A multidisciplinary approach involving specialists such as surgeons, interventional radiologists, and intensivists is recommended for the best possible outcome. Potential challenges in tailoring an optimal treatment plan for AMI may include delayed diagnosis, limited availability of specialized care, or patient factors that make some interventions less feasible. Addressing these challenges requires a proactive and collaborative approach, with regular review and adjustment of the treatment plan as needed to ensure the best possible outcome for each patient.

### The role of endovascular therapy in acute mesenteric ischemia [^115GHZ5Q]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

A comprehensive search of the English-language published literature was conducted through PubMed to identify all articles reporting acute arterial and venous mesenteric ischemia treated by endovascular therapy. The research utilized the following medical subject headings (MeSH): "endovascular therapy and acute arterial mesenteric ischemia", "endovascular therapy and mesenteric infarction", "endovascular therapy and interventional radiology and acute mesenteric ischemia", "endovascular recanalization and acute mesenteric ischemia", "thrombolysis and thromboaspiration and acute mesenteric ischemia", "stenting and angioplasty and acute mesenteric ischemia", "endovascular therapy and acute venous mesenteric ischemia and occlusion", "acute venous mesenteric ischemia and interventional radiology", "acute venous mesenteric ischemia and endovascular recanalization", and "acute venous mesenteric ischemia and thrombolysis and thromboaspiration".

- **Search and selection process**: At the first stage, only titles and abstracts were reviewed to select articles focusing on patients with acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) who had venous or arterial occlusion treated with endovascular therapies. Case reports, small series revisions, and papers that contained previously reported data were excluded. At the second stage, all selected articles were reviewed in their full-text version.

Articles were considered eligible for inclusion in the present review if at least one outcome of interest was described. In studies involving patients treated with a surgical or endovascular approach, only those treated with an endovascular approach were included.

### The role of endovascular therapy in acute mesenteric ischemia [^112VnynZ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Vascular pathologies of the small and large bowel can be of venous or arterial etiology. Mesenteric ischemia is classified as acute (caused by thromboembolism or hypoperfusion) or chronic. The development of imaging technology has gradually increased the diagnostic rate of venous or arterial mesenteric ischemia. The standard care used to be open surgical repair, but in the last 15 years, the development of endovascular procedures has introduced a minimally invasive treatment option. In both chronic and acute settings, angioplasty and stenting have been successfully described for the management of stenoses or occlusions.

Nowadays, apart from percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and stenting, other endovascular techniques are available, including the use of intra-arterial thrombolysis, vasodilators, and suction embolectomy. Endovascular therapy can potentially modify clinical outcomes in patients with acute bowel ischemia; however, given the relative infrequency of this disease, it is hard to obtain wide experience over a relatively short interval, and only small case series are available in the literature.

The objective of this study was to review the management of acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) with endovascular procedures and to determine the efficacy and recanalization rates, the incidence of complications, and the mortality, in order to provide an update on the concepts in the management of this disease.

### Acute mesenteric ischaemia [^117HhNUQ]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Treatment of mesenteric venous thrombosis aims to prevent bowel ischaemia. The first line of treatment is anticoagulation and supportive care. Anticoagulation may lead to recanalization in about 80 percent of patients.

- **Endovascular therapy**: This option is for patients who do not respond to anticoagulation and includes techniques such as aspiration thrombectomy, thrombolysis, and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt.
- **Surgical intervention**: Open surgery and bowel resection are necessary if the patient continues to deteriorate and develops peritonitis.
