## Question

Dysphagia in Parkinson's

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about dysphagia in Parkinson's disease, specifically its clinical significance and prevalence, the pathophysiology and reasons it is often silent, screening and diagnostic strategies (including when to use FEES versus VFSS and how to assess medication swallowing), treatment options such as dopaminergic optimization, nonpharmacologic therapy, diet modification, and enteral feeding, as well as prognostic implications and quality-of-life impact. They also want to know about evidence gaps and a practical, multidisciplinary algorithm, with attention to areas where the literature is conflicting or limited. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical significance and prevalence of dysphagia in PD. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and why it is often silent. Next, I will review screening and diagnostic strategies, including when to use FEES versus VFSS and how to assess medication swallowing. After that, I need to examine treatment options, including dopaminergic optimization, nonpharmacologic therapy, diet modification, and enteral feeding. I will then consider prognostic implications and quality-of-life impact. Finally, I should identify evidence gaps and propose a practical, multidisciplinary algorithm, making sure I double-check areas where the literature is conflicting or limited.

> Let me first confirm the clinical significance and prevalence. Dysphagia is highly prevalent in PD, with estimates ranging from roughly 40% to over 80% depending on the assessment method and disease stage, and it can be present even in early disease, often silently, which contributes to underdiagnosis and delayed intervention [^1145HLJ3]. Hold on, I should verify the mortality implications: aspiration pneumonia is a leading cause of death in PD, and dysphagia substantially increases that risk, with incidence of pneumonia more than threefold higher than age-matched controls and dysphagia severity being a key prognostic factor in advanced PD [^117UT799] [^112vfYPA].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology to ensure I capture the mechanisms that drive both silent aspiration and medication-related problems. The core phenotype includes insufficient pharyngeal bolus clearance with residue, pharyngolaryngeal bradykinesia, and delayed or absent swallowing reflex, with oropharyngeal "freezing" analogous to freezing of gait; these motor deficits coexist with sensory impairment and impaired cough, explaining silent aspiration and poor airway protection [^112BQd3c]. Wait, let me verify medication issues: pharyngeal residues can delay or blunt levodopa absorption, contributing to erratic motor responses, and dysphagia for medication is common and only moderately correlates with food/liquid dysphagia, so it must be assessed separately [^115KrAmg] [^112ARsoS].

> Next, I should review screening and clinical assessment. Patients frequently underreport symptoms, so clinicians must proactively screen using validated tools such as the Swallowing Disturbance Questionnaire (SDQ) and the Munich Dysphagia Test–PD (MDT-PD), while recognizing that no single tool is perfect and that clinical examination outperforms questionnaires for detecting abnormalities, especially when combined with cough testing to improve predictive value [^112bxkkE] [^115ZM8Z8]. Hold on, I should verify the role of drooling: I initially thought drooling might be an early sign of dysphagia, but wait, let me reconsider — data suggest drooling is common and related to oral-phase dysfunction and cognitive impairment, yet it is not a reliable early marker for clinically significant pharyngeal dysphagia or aspiration risk, so I should not overinterpret it [^112PM7tj].

> Now, I need to check the diagnostic gold standards and when to deploy them. FEES and VFSS are complementary first-line instrumental tests. FEES allows bedside, radiation-free, repeated assessments and direct visualization of secretion management and pharyngeal phase, whereas VFSS provides dynamic oral and esophageal phase information and is better for certain structural or motility questions. Both detect penetration/aspiration and residue with high sensitivity and specificity, and should be used when screening is positive or when silent aspiration is suspected [^116sN5Qp] [^116BHQsd]. I should confirm severity metrics: the Penetration–Aspiration Scale (PAS) is widely used, and newer tools like DIGEST and VASES aim to standardize safety and efficiency grading, though further validation in PD is ongoing [^116D6GJ4] [^1113BPee].

> Let me consider medication-specific dysphagia assessment. Because tablet/capsule swallowing can be impaired even when food/liquid swallowing appears mild, I should double-check for dysphagia for medication using FEES when clinically suspected or when MDS-UPDRS items 2.3–2.4 suggest problems, and I should counsel on formulation switches to dispersible, liquid, or non-oral routes when needed to preserve pharmacokinetics and avoid dose omissions [^115KrAmg] [^112ARsoS]. But wait, what if the patient reports "pills sticking"? That symptom should prompt instrumental evaluation rather than assuming benignity, given the potential impact on motor fluctuations and safety [^112ARsoS].

> I will now examine treatment, starting with dopaminergic optimization. The effect of levodopa on swallowing is heterogeneous and stage-dependent. A structured FEES-levodopa test comparing off versus on can identify levodopa-responsive dysphagia, with a threshold of about 30% improvement suggesting benefit from medication adjustment, while LCIG may help selected patients with pharyngeal bradykinesia and premature spillage. DBS effects are inconsistent and may be neutral or detrimental depending on frequency and phenotype, so I should individualize and monitor closely [^11226VNw] [^116D6GJ4]. Hold on, I should verify that we avoid overpromising DBS benefits for swallowing; current evidence does not support routine DBS for dysphagia treatment, and adverse effects on speech/swallowing can occur in some adjustments [^11226VNw].

> Next, I should review nonpharmacologic therapy. Traditional swallowing therapy by speech-language pathologists remains foundational, with emerging support for expiratory muscle strength training (EMST) improving swallowing safety and efficiency in PD. However, I need to acknowledge that older systematic reviews found insufficient RCT evidence, so I should present EMST as promising but not definitive pending larger trials and ensure careful patient selection and monitoring [^114AuNLe] [^115tATp9] [^1175DZHX]. Wait, let me verify the current signal: recent meta-analytic data suggest a medium pooled effect for stimulation-based therapies, including neuromuscular stimulation and acupuncture, but the evidence base remains small and heterogeneous, so I should frame these as adjuncts within a multidisciplinary plan rather than replacements for standard care [^115aB95r].

> I need to ensure diet modification is individualized and evidence-informed. Thickening liquids can reduce immediate aspiration on VFSS in some patients, but there is no robust evidence that thickened liquids reduce pneumonia risk long term, and over-thickening may worsen hydration and quality of life. Therefore, I should use the least restrictive consistency that maintains safety, consider chin-down or other postural strategies, and reassess frequently for tolerance and effectiveness [^1122nsuN] [^1158d1fY]. Hold on, I should verify that we also address pill swallowing: switching to smaller, rounder, or dispersible formulations can improve medication adherence and pharmacokinetics when solid oral forms are problematic [^112BQd3c] [^112ARsoS] [^115KrAmg].

> For advanced disease with severe dysphagia and recurrent aspiration or malnutrition, I should discuss enteral feeding candidacy early, ideally before crises. PEG can stabilize nutrition and hydration and may facilitate medication delivery, but it does not eliminate aspiration risk and may carry psychosocial burdens; survival after PEG in PD is variable, and decisions should align with patient goals, prognosis, and caregiver capacity [^112vJir9] [^115Koegn] [^112AD2E5]. Wait, let me double-check that we also plan for non-oral dopaminergic strategies when oral intake is unreliable, to avoid neuroleptic malignant-like complications from abrupt levodopa withdrawal [^112AD2E5].

> I should confirm prognostic implications to guide timing and intensity of interventions. Dysphagia severity is among the strongest predictors of poor outcomes in late-stage PD, with aspiration pneumonia the leading cause of death. Impaired cough, low BMI, dementia, and advanced Hoehn and Yahr stage further increase risk, and the onset of dysphagia marks a transition to higher mortality risk, underscoring the need for early detection and proactive management [^117UT799] [^1145HLJ3]. Hold on, I should verify that we communicate these risks clearly during advance care planning, especially as disease progresses [^117UT799].

> Next, I should review quality-of-life impact and measurement. Dysphagia degrades quality of life through mealtime anxiety, dietary restrictions, social isolation, and fear of choking. SWAL-QOL is the most commonly used patient-reported measure in PD dysphagia research, and its routine use helps quantify burden and track response to therapy, while PDQ-39 captures broader psychosocial impacts though it is not swallowing-specific [^115Koegn] [^1145HLJ3]. I need to ensure we also assess caregiver burden and mealtime participation, as these strongly modulate perceived quality of life [^115Koegn].

> I will now examine evidence gaps and standardization needs. There is a pressing need for larger, multicenter RCTs with consistent outcome measures; the newly developed Core Outcome Set for Dysphagia Interventions in PD (COS-DIP) specifies six core outcomes — penetration/aspiration, aspiration pneumonia, choking, oropharyngeal dysphagia severity, swallowing-related quality of life, and post-swallow pharyngeal residue — with recommended measurement instruments and timepoints to harmonize trials and enable meaningful comparisons [^117EzhB2] [^1127KNDN]. Wait, let me verify that current studies still show heterogeneity in outcomes and timing; yes, scoping reviews confirm variable instruments and short follow-up, reinforcing the value of COS adoption [^113WhxjQ].

> Let me synthesize a practical, multidisciplinary algorithm and double-check alignment with consensus. At each visit, screen proactively using SDQ/MDT-PD and clinical observation; if positive or if red flags exist (weight loss, recurrent pneumonias, wet voice, medication swallowing difficulty), proceed to instrumental assessment with FEES or VFSS to define phenotype and aspiration risk; concurrently evaluate medication swallowing and, if impaired, adjust formulations or routes; initiate SLP therapy with EMST where appropriate, tailor diet to the least restrictive safe consistency, and involve nutrition for malnutrition risk; reassess at 3–6 month intervals or with clinical change, and escalate to PEG when oral intake is unsafe or inadequate despite optimization, all coordinated by neurology, SLP, gastroenterology, nutrition, and palliative care as needed [^114AuNLe] [^1145HLJ3]. Hold on, I should verify that this approach also addresses levodopa pharmacokinetics and GI comorbidities like gastroparesis, which can further confound absorption and fluctuations; yes, concurrent GI management and medication timing strategies should be integrated into the plan [^116UQHbF].

> In conclusion, dysphagia in PD is common, often silent, and carries major clinical and prognostic consequences. Early, standardized screening and instrumental diagnosis, individualized therapy spanning dopaminergic optimization, SLP interventions including EMST, judicious diet modification, and timely consideration of enteral feeding, all embedded in a multidisciplinary framework and measured with core outcomes, represent best practice while we await stronger RCT evidence to refine interventions and improve long-term outcomes [^1145HLJ3] [^114AuNLe] [^117EzhB2].

Dysphagia is common in Parkinson's disease, affecting **40–80%** of patients and often appearing early, even before motor symptoms [^1145HLJ3] [^116qAJdc]. It reflects **multifactorial mechanisms**, including pharyngeal bradykinesia, impaired UES opening, and sensory deficits, and is strongly linked to aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition, and reduced quality of life [^112BQd3c] [^117UT799]. Early detection with validated questionnaires (EAT-10, SDQ) and instrumental testing (FEES, VFSS) is essential [^112bxkkE] [^116sN5Qp]. Management is multidisciplinary, combining speech therapy, dietary modification, and medication optimization; **expiratory muscle strength training (EMST)** and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) are promising adjuncts [^114AuNLe] [^115aB95r]. Dysphagia severity predicts poor prognosis, including increased mortality, underscoring the need for proactive screening and intervention [^117UT799].

---

## Prevalence and clinical significance

- **Prevalence**: Dysphagia affects 40–80% of PD patients, increasing with disease progression [^1145HLJ3].
- **Aspiration risk**: Nearly 50% of PD patients aspirate, significantly increasing pneumonia risk — a leading cause of death in PD [^112vfYPA] [^117UT799].
- **Quality of life**: Dysphagia causes anxiety, social isolation, and reduced quality of life [^115Koegn].

---

## Pathophysiology

Dysphagia in PD arises from **complex interactions** among motor, sensory, and autonomic mechanisms:

- **Motor dysfunction**: Pharyngeal bradykinesia, impaired UES opening, and delayed swallowing reflex [^112BQd3c].
- **Sensory impairment**: Reduced pharyngeal sensation, contributing to silent aspiration [^117UT799].
- **Autonomic dysfunction**: Esophageal dysmotility and gastroparesis affecting bolus transit and medication absorption [^113TYyvo].

---

## Clinical presentation

Dysphagia in PD presents with **characteristic features**:

- **Oral phase**: Difficulty initiating swallowing, prolonged mastication, drooling [^112BQd3c].
- **Pharyngeal phase**: Coughing/choking, wet voice, nasal regurgitation, silent aspiration [^112BQd3c].
- **Esophageal phase**: Sensation of food sticking, regurgitation, delayed esophageal emptying [^111tppaZ].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Early detection requires a **multimodal approach**:

| **Diagnostic tool** | **Description** | **Clinical utility** |
|-|-|-|
| EAT-10 | Patient-reported questionnaire | Screens for dysphagia symptoms [^112duRKH] |
| SDQ | Swallowing disturbance questionnaire | Detects early dysphagia [^111KM5qR] |
| FEES | Flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing | Gold standard for pharyngeal phase assessment [^116BHQsd] |
| VFSS | Videofluoroscopic swallow study | Gold standard for oral and esophageal phases [^notfound] |
| HRM | High-resolution manometry | Assesses esophageal motility [^111tppaZ] |

---

## Management strategies

Effective management requires a **multidisciplinary approach**:

- **Speech therapy**: Swallowing exercises, posture adjustments, and EMST [^1158d1fY] [^115tATp9].
- **Dietary modification**: Texture-modified diets and thickened liquids [^1122nsuN] [^1158d1fY].
- **Medication optimization**: Adjusting dopaminergic therapy and considering non-oral formulations [^11226VNw] [^116UQHbF].
- **Adjunctive therapies**: NMES and biofeedback show promise but require further research [^115aB95r] [^113fuZAa].

---

## Prognostic implications

Dysphagia significantly impacts prognosis: severity predicts **increased mortality**, primarily due to aspiration pneumonia, and is associated with faster disease progression, greater disability, and reduced survival [^117UT799] [^1145HLJ3].

---

## Current research and future directions

Current research focuses on **early detection** — developing biomarkers and validated screening tools — and on **intervention effectiveness**, including larger RCTs of EMST, NMES, and pharmacological agents. Efforts also target **standardization** of outcome measures and diagnostic protocols [^117EzhB2] [^1127KNDN].

---

Dysphagia is a **common and clinically significant** complication of Parkinson's disease, requiring early detection and multidisciplinary management. It significantly impacts quality of life and prognosis, making it a critical focus of care in PD.

### Validation of a swallowing disturbance questionnaire for detecting dysphagia in patients with Parkinson's disease [^111KM5qR]. Movement Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Underreporting of swallowing disturbances by Parkinson's disease (PD) patients may lead to delay in diagnosis and treatment, alerting the physician to an existing dysphagia only after the first episode of aspiration pneumonia. We developed and validated a swallowing disturbance questionnaire (SDQ) for PD patients and compared its findings to an objective assessment. Fifty-seven PD patients (mean age 69 ± 10 years) participated in this study. Each patient was queried about experiencing swallowing disturbances and asked to complete a self-reported 15-item "yes/no" questionnaire on swallowing disturbances (24 replied "no"). All study patients underwent a physical/clinical swallowing evaluation by a speech pathologist and an otolaryngologist. The 33 patients who complained of swallowing disturbances also underwent fiberoptic endoscopyic evaluation of swallowing (FEES). According to the ROC test, the "optimal" score (where the sensitivity and specificity curves cross) is 11 (sensitivity 80.5%, specificity 81.3%). Using the SDQ questionnaire substantially reduced Type I errors (specifically, an existing swallowing problem missed by the selected cutoff point). On the basis of the SDQ assessment alone, 12 of the 24 (50%) noncomplaining patients would have been referred to further evaluation that they otherwise would not have undergone. The SDQ emerged as a validated tool to detect early dysphagia in PD patients.

### Dysphagia for medication in Parkinson's disease [^115KrAmg]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) is common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and not only reduces patients' quality of life, but leads to serious complications such as malnutrition, and aspiration pneumonia, thereby increasing mortality. Since swallowing cannot be reliably assessed by clinical examination alone and PD patients may not notice symptoms of dysphagia, instrumental diagnostics are essential to reliably detect OD. Both, Flexible Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) and Videofluoroscopic Swallow Study (VFSS) are considered the diagnostic gold standards. However, in PD patients with fluctuating symptoms, FEES has distinct advantages, as long examination protocols and repeated examinations are easily possible since there is no radiation exposure involved.

In addition to OD during food intake, studies relying on self-reporting suggest that PD patients often experience difficulty swallowing their medications –. This frequently leads to patients or caregivers modifying the oral dosage form, e.g. dividing, dissolving, or crushing tablets and opening capsules, or even omitting the medication altogether –. Dosage form modifications can adversely affect both pharmacodynamics and -kinetics and result in inadequate efficacy, adverse events or even death. Therefore, it is not surprising that individual case reports and case series link dysphagia during medication swallowing in PD to lack of medication efficacy or to motor fluctuations such as delayed on-phenomena –. However, there have been few prospective studies systematically investigating dysphagia for medication in PD using instrumental diagnostics. Moreover, in these previous studies, dysphagia for medication was classified in a binary manner (e.g. present vs. absent), thus lacking a differentiated analysis with associations to motor complications and to dysphagia for food and liquid.

Therefore, the aims of this study were (1) to investigate the relationship between dysphagia for medication and motor complications, (2) to examine the prevalence and severity of dysphagia for medication depending on the type of tablet or capsule and in relation to OD for food and liquid, and (3) to investigate the predictive value of questions relevant to oropharyngeal dysfunction in the Movement-Disorder-Society-Unified-PD-Rating-Scale (MDS-UPDRS) in relation to dysphagia for medication. First, a two-dimensional and ordinal classification of dysphagia for medication was established based on a retrospective analysis. This classification was then used to investigate the swallowing of tablets and capsules of different sizes and shapes in 66 PD patients in a prospective study using FEES.

### Swallowing outcomes in dysphagia interventions in Parkinson's disease: a scoping review [^112gS6d6]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Research question 4: at which timepoints and at which frequency are the outcomes in these clinical trials measured?

In the outcome domains #1, #22, #35 and #38 only one studyassessed the outcomes death, aspiration pneumonia, hospitalisation and adverse events, respectively. These were measured continuously over a period of 3 months without further details provided by the authors. All remaining outcomes in the outcome area physiological/clinical were measured in the included studies one to five times either during or pre to post and/or with one to two follow-ups. The timepoints post intervention ranged from 5 min to 6 months.

The outcomes in the outcome area life impact/functioning were measured 1–36 times during, pre and/or post with follow-up assessments 2 weeks to 6 months post intervention. The outcome participant's adherence to intervention was assessed weekly over a period of 3 months, hence 36 times in 1 study. The outcome self-perception of swallowing was measured differently at varying timepoints and frequency across the included studies. For example, 1 studyassessed the outcome through the DSSafter each session, hence 13–15 times, whereas the other 4 studiesassessed it 2, 3 or 5 times. Only the outcome participant's satisfaction with the intervention was measured once during or 2 weeks post intervention.

Overall, most outcomes were measured at least pre and post intervention with frequencies from one to four times. If the outcome was measured only once this was usually during the intervention, for example, rTMS (see online supplemental file 7 for all timepoints and frequency of measurements).

### Systematic review of paramedical therapies for Parkinson's disease [^111HUkT8]. Movement Disorders (2002). Low credibility.

We evaluated the efficacy of physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and speech and language therapy in Parkinson's disease by synthesizing six Cochrane systematic reviews. All randomised, controlled trials examining the efficacy of a paramedical therapy versus control intervention and all those comparing the efficacy of two forms of active therapy in Parkinson's disease were included. Trials were identified by searching biomedical databases, reference lists, hand searching, and contacting investigators. The main outcome measures were quality of life, speech intelligibility, activities of daily living, and individual measures of motor and speech impairment. We identified 16 physiotherapy randomised controlled trials (399 patients), two occupational therapy trials (84 patients), and five speech and language therapy for dysarthria trials (154 patients). None of these studies examined nonpharmacological swallowing therapy for dysphagia. We were unable to perform meta-analysis of the results because the trials used heterogeneous therapy methods and outcome measures. The trials also had marked methodological flaws that could have introduced bias. In summary, we failed to find conclusive evidence of benefit for any form of paramedical therapy sufficient to recommend them in routine clinical practice. However, this lack of evidence is not proof of a lack of effect. Further large pragmatic randomised controlled trials are required to determine the effectiveness of paramedical therapies in Parkinson's disease.

### Perioperative management of patients with Parkinson's disease [^114ootzb]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide, leading to a wide range of disability and medical complications. Managing patients with Parkinson's disease in the perioperative hospital setting can be particularly challenging. Suboptimal management can lead to medical complications, prolonged hospital stays, and delayed recovery. This review aims to address the most important issues related to caring for patients with Parkinson's disease perioperatively who are undergoing emergent or planned general surgery. It also intends to help hospitalists, internists, and other health care providers mitigate potential in-hospital morbidity and prevent prolonged recovery. Challenges in managing patients with Parkinson's disease in the perioperative hospital setting include disruption of medication schedules, "nothing by mouth" status, reduced mobility, and medication interactions and their side effects. Patients with Parkinson's disease are more prone to immobility and developing dysphagia, respiratory dysfunction, urinary retention, and psychiatric symptoms. These issues lead to higher rates of pneumonia, urinary tract infections, deconditioning, and falls compared with patients without Parkinson's disease, as well as prolonged hospital stays and a greater need for post-hospitalization rehabilitation. Steps can be taken to decrease these complications, including minimizing nothing by mouth status duration, using alternative routes of drugs administration when unable to give medications orally, avoiding drug interactions and medications that can worsen parkinsonism, assessing swallowing ability frequently, encouraging incentive spirometry, performing bladder scans, avoiding Foley catheters, and providing aggressive physical therapy. Knowing and anticipating these potential complications allow hospital physicians to mitigate nosocomial morbidity and shorten recovery times and hospital stays.

### A multinational consensus on dysphagia in Parkinson's disease: screening, diagnosis and prognostic value [^112bxkkE]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Different clinical scales and questionnaires have been proposed for screening dysphagia in neurodegenerative diseases, though there is no agreement on the best algorithm for evaluating patients with PD.

The following clinical scale and questionnaires (evidence of class III and IV) may be used for screening of dysphagia in PD:
Swallowing disturbance questionnaire (SDQ): a self-reported questionnaire containing 15 items on swallowing disturbances. It is considered a validated tool to detect early dysphagia in patients with PD. It has a good sensitivity and specificity (80.5 and 81.3%, respectively).
Munich Dysphagia test-Parkinson's disease (MDT-PD): a self-reported questionnaire useful to screen for initial oropharyngeal symptoms and the risk of laryngeal penetration and/or aspiration in PD. It consists of 26 items divided into 4 categories. The MDT-PD is considered a sensitive and specific questionnaire; however, it was reported that compared with FEES it has a low sensitivity in detecting aspiration, though maintaining good specificity.
Swallowing Clinical Assessment Score in Parkinson's disease (SCAS-PD): a quantitative clinical scale consisting of 12 items designed to detect alterations in the oral and pharyngeal phases of swallowing in PD. Branco et al. validated this scale using the videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) as the reference diagnostic test. They showed that SCAS-PD has a high sensitivity (100%) and specificity (87.5%) and it enables to detect clinical signs of aspiration with a good concordance with the gold standard VFSS (weighted kappa concordance rate of 0.71).
Radboud Oral Motor Inventory for Parkinson's disease (ROMP): a questionnaire developed to assess three main domains: speech, swallowing, and saliva control. This scale represents a valid tool to identify swallowing difficulties in PD, though it contains a limited number of items.
Handheld Cough Testing (HCT), a novel tool for cough assessment and dysphagia screening in PD. The HCT is able to identify differences in cough airflow during reflex and voluntary cough tasks, and screen for people with dysphagia in PD with high sensitivity and specificity (90.9% sensitivity; 80.0% specificity).

Although these screening tools look promising for an early diagnosis of dysphagia in patients with PD, they are not cross-culturally validated. Therefore, there is an unmet need to translate, adapt, and cross-culturally validate screening measures.

### A multinational consensus on dysphagia in Parkinson's disease: screening, diagnosis and prognostic value [^1179rC3g]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Unmet needs, areas for future research

This consensus process identified several critical areas for the timely and correct diagnosis of dysphagia in PD that could not be properly addressed by the panel of experts due to the lack of reliable evidence. Future studies need to focus on the reliability of clinical methods to screen and assess dysphagia in PD and should better define the conditions when instrumental investigations are required. Other areas worth attention are the development of validated all-inclusive (clinical and instrumental) scales for rating dysphagia severity in PD, and of PD-specific tools to assess the impact of dysphagia on QoL.

In particular, there was agreement among the consensus participants that future research should aim to address the following additional questions:
What are the pathophysiological elements of dysphagia in PD and their neurophysiological correlates in terms of oropharyngeal sensory and motor impairment?
What is the role played by esophageal dysmotility in PD?
In which way malnutrition and dehydration in PD affect dysphagia severity and the risk of complications?
Does PEG insertion change the prognosis and QoL of patients with severe dysphagia?
Are there useful biomarkers for the early detection of PD-related dysphagia, e.g. levels of substance P in saliva?
How should we choose the best timing of clinical and instrumental evaluation in relation to the motor fluctuation of patients in specific situations (severe dyskinesias, DBS, etc.)?
Are the biomechanical or pathophysiological elements of dysphagia in PD affected by different anti-parkinsonian treatment strategies or different complications?

### Evaluation of the efficacy of a two-week EMST on dysphagia in… [^116NGbDZ]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

This study involves a routine endoscopic evaluation of swallowing to diagnose dysphagia before and after the intervention. Between the two FEES, a two-week exhalation training program takes place, which the patients perform independently following instructions from a speech and lanuage pathologist. In addition demographic and disease-specific data and two questionnaires are recorded. Main hypothesis: Two weeks of EMST will lead to a significant improvement of the endoscopic dysphagia score in patients with neurodegenerative Parkinsonian disorders with endoscopically proven oropharyngeal dysphagia. Patients with idiopathic Parkinson's syndrome as well as its differential diagnoses, multiple system atrophy and diseases from the group of 4repeat tauopathies, will be examined.

Idiopathic Parkinson's disease: More than 80% of all patients with PD develop clinically relevant dysphagia during the course of the disease. This can lead to a significant reduction in quality of life, decreased medication efficacy, malnutrition, dehydration, and ultimately aspiration pneumonia in affected patients, which is the most common cause of death in advanced PD patients. The cause of PD-associated dysphagia is a multifactorial genesis with impairment of dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic pathways of the central swallowing network and additional peripheral neuromuscular influences. For dysphagia in atypical Parkinsonian syndromes, there are no proven interventional or drug therapy options. Previous studies in patients with PD had shown efficacy of a four-week training with a special expiratory muscle strength training device. Both swallowing reliability and swallowing efficiency were improved.

Studies on the efficacy of EMST on dysphagia of atypical Parkinsonian syndromes do not yet exist. Currently, all patients with PD, MSA, or 4RT at participating study sites receive a speech and language pathology examination and endoscopic diagnostics according to a defined protocol. In addition to phoniatric and swallowing-specific examinations, an endoscopic evaluation of swallowing is routinely performed. Regarding the efficacy of EMST training on pharyngeal dysphagia in patients with PD, two randomized, placebo-controlled studies from recent years with n = 60 and n = 50 patients, respectively, have already shown an efficacy of training on both swallowing reliability and swallowing efficiency in PD patients.

### Effects of oral intake of water in patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia [^114433WX]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Oropharyngeal dysphagia is a common clinical problem, predominantly in the elderly, and is associated with numerous pathologies including, cerebrovascular accident (CVA; stroke), neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis), certain advanced cancers, particularly head and neck, and may result from a traumatic injury. Dysphagia has been most widely investigated in the context of CVA where the incidence of swallowing difficulties ranges from 40 to 70% of patients. A major complication of dysphagia is aspiration which results in morbidity due to the development of pneumonia - referred to as aspiration pneumonia. The facts that aspiration occurs in about 40–50% of CVA patients and the mortality from aspiration pneumonia has been reported to be as high as 6% in the first year after a CVA, highlight the extent of the problem. The causal relationship between aspiration and the development of pneumonia is well-established.

Likewise, it is well known that thin liquid is the most likely consistency to be aspirated. The conventional treatment options that are recommended for patients that aspirate thin liquids are limited. Although postural interventions have been shown to be beneficial, the orthodox treatment remains consumption of thickened liquids, typically to an extremely, moderately or mildly thick consistency and a diet consisting of modified solids. However, there are major concerns associated with the prescription of thickened fluids and modified solid consistencies. These are predominantly patient dissatisfaction and in certain cases non-compliance leading to medical problems associated with hydration and malnutrition.

The problems associated with patient disapproval of thickened liquids and modified solid consistency diets are well known. They have created an enduring debate related to the management of people with dysphagia who aspirate on thin liquids. In an attempt to overcome these problems an authoritative protocol was developed at the Frazier Rehab Center in Louisville, US about 25 years ago for the management of patients with dysphagia. This free water protocol provides detailed guidelines and strict procedures for allowing access of water to people with dysphagia who, have insurance coverage as well as the ability to tolerate three hours of physical rehabilitation daily for six days per week. Although the protocol is based on a solid rationale for the provision of water and is supported by scientific research, albeit limited, there is still much confusion in the clinic.

### A multinational consensus on dysphagia in Parkinson's disease: screening, diagnosis and prognostic value [^116qtMx9]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a combination of motor and non-motor dysfunction. Dysphagia is a common symptom in PD, though it is still too frequently underdiagnosed. Consensus is lacking on screening, diagnosis, and prognosis of dysphagia in PD.

Objective

To systematically review the literature and to define consensus statements on the screening and the diagnosis of dysphagia in PD, as well as on the impact of dysphagia on the prognosis and quality of life (QoL) of PD patients.

Methods

A multinational group of experts in the field of neurogenic dysphagia and/or PD conducted a systematic revision of the literature published since January 1990 to February 2021 and reported the results according to PRISMA guidelines. The output of the research was then analyzed and discussed in a consensus conference convened in Pavia, Italy, where the consensus statements were drafted. The final version of statements was subsequently achieved by e-mail consensus.

Results

Eighty-five papers were used to inform the Panel's statements even though most of them were of Class IV quality. The statements tackled four main areas: (1) screening of dysphagia: timing and tools; (2) diagnosis of dysphagia: clinical and instrumental detection, severity assessment; (3) dysphagia and QoL: impact and assessment; (4) prognostic value of dysphagia; impact on the outcome and role of associated conditions.

Conclusions

The statements elaborated by the Consensus Panel provide a framework to guide the neurologist in the timely detection and accurate diagnosis of dysphagia in PD.

### Swallowing outcomes in dysphagia interventions in Parkinson's disease: a scoping review [^113WhxjQ]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Research question 3: how are the outcomes in these clinical trials measured?

Overall, the applied OMIs show high variability. Most of the outcomes in the outcome domain #9a were measured using instrumental assessments and either validated scales or scales designed for the purpose of the according study during videofluoroscopic evaluation of swallowing (VFS) (also referred to Modified Barium Swallow Study) or Fibreoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) or measuring it in milliseconds during electromyography.

The outcomes penetration/aspiration and swallowing-related quality of life were measured the most consistently. Eight of the ten studies used the Penetration–Aspiration-Scale (PAS) by Rosenbek et al during VFS and/or FEES. One studydid not report the scale that was used to measure the outcome during VFS and another studyused a self-designed 4-point scale. The outcome swallowing-related quality of life was measured through the Swallowing Quality of Life (SWAL-QOL)Questionnaire in six studies, whereas one studyadditionally assessed this outcome through the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory. The outcome self-perception of swallowing was measured by the Swallowing Disturbance Questionnairethree times and the Dysphagia Severity Scale (DSS)and Arabic Dysphagia Handicap Indexonce each.

The outcome oropharyngeal dysphagia severity was the outcome measured most differently across all included studies. In order to assess the outcome either validated scales or self-designed scales for VFS and/or FEES, the Standardized Swallow Assessmentor a Clinical Swallow Evaluation were conducted. The OMIs of death and hospitalisation were not described and while it may seem self-explanatory, their methods of recording were not clear (see online supplemental file 6 for the applied OMIs).

### A multinational consensus on dysphagia in Parkinson's disease: screening, diagnosis and prognostic value [^111AEYH8]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Limitations of the study

Some limitations of the present work are worth mentioning. The first regards the recruitment of participants, which, in the absence of a strictly codified methodology for selection, was based on practical considerations and on their voluntary acceptance of our invitation. This approach led to the formation of an expert group with a prevalent representation of neurologists compared to other specialists, and a prevalence of Italian specialists compared to specialists from other countries. Thus, it is possible that the statements elaborated by this panel group do not reflect entirely the point of view of the wider international medical and scientific communities. It is worth noting, however, that we put in place several measures to involve as many experts in the field as possible and that, once the panel was created based on voluntary adhesion, the ruling process was supported by a thorough revision of the data available from the literature. This approach seemed the best compromise between spending more time in trying to include a larger group of experts and the need to deliver this consensus in an acceptable time frame to provide timely guidance to clinician on a critical issue in the management of PD patients. Another shortcoming of our consensus statements is that PD patients, their carers or representatives were not involved in the process. Indeed, their contribution would have certainly been relevant, especially as regards the quality of life topic.

### Non-oral dopaminergic therapies for Parkinson's disease: current treatments and the future [^114DjNin]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In the last 5 years, existing knowledge about gastrointestinal dysfunction in PD with functional consequences on the oral drug-delivery strategy in PD have been extensively researched (Figure 5). Problems such as SIBO, altered intestinal microbiota, and delayed gastric emptying have added to the difficulties of oral therapy in PD, often culminating in commonly observed motor fluctuations such as delayed "on" or early-morning "off" sometimes associated with severe non-motor symptoms as well. Dysphagia, an often underestimated problem in PD, has been linked to silent aspiration with continued oral therapy, with silent aspiration being a risk factor for pneumonia. Existing non-oral therapies have served an important unmet need in PD and now have been shown to have not just motor but also significant non-motor beneficial effects and possibly with lower rates of ICD. This review highlights some significant short and long acting non-oral therapies in development or soon to be licensed, which will enhance the armamentarium of our treatment strategies for early and advanced therapy.

### Management of gastrointestinal symptoms in Parkinson's disease: a comprehensive review of clinical presentation, workup, and treatment [^113EZ4Df]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The GI complications of PD are highly prevalent, and management thereof is a key determinant of patient quality of life. In this practical review, we summarize the clinical presentation, workup, and treatment algorithms for the variety of GI symptoms that manifest in this population. While our current toolkit, particularly when guided by the expertise of a gastroenterologist, can benefit these patients, it is also clear that far more research is needed to not only better elucidate target treatments for the unique pathogenesis of GI dysfunction in PD, but also further to achieve a greater understanding of ENS abnormalities that can guide us toward disease-modifying therapies. This is an important recently discussed goal of the National Institutes of Health, and represents an important unmet need for this substantial and long-suffering patient population.

### A multinational consensus on dysphagia in Parkinson's disease: screening, diagnosis and prognostic value [^111tppaZ]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Oro-Pharyngo-Esophageal Scintigraphy (OPES) is a useful tool for the early detection of dysphagia, but its diagnostic role in PD remains to be ascertained as only a single study has been carried out in this patient population. Although only preliminary evidence is available, swallowing evaluation with high-resolution manometry (HRM) represents another interesting diagnostic tool, capable to show subtle swallowing changes in the early stages of PD even in the absence of swallowing changes on VFSS.

The Electro-Kinesiologic Swallowing Study (EKSS) represents an additional useful diagnostic tool to explore the pathophysiological mechanisms of oropharyngeal dysphagia and provide clues for treatment selection. For example, electromyography of the cricopharyngeal muscle (i.e. the main component of the upper esophageal sphincter, UES) helps to clarify whether failure in UES opening during the pharyngeal phase of swallowing is due to persistent sphincter hyperactivity or to reduced elevation of the pharyngeal-laryngeal structures. In the former case, botulinum toxin injection into the cricopharyngeal muscle may be beneficial. However, very few centers use UES electromyography routinely, thus this examination cannot currently be considered as a standard test for dysphagia.

Gastroenterological investigations including esophageal manometry, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, acid- and reflux-related tests, and/or radiological investigations such as barium swallow should always be carried out in the presence of esophageal symptoms (e.g. dysphagia for solid foods, regurgitation, food sticking after swallowing) and/or when oropharyngeal evaluations detect findings suggestive of structural or functional deficits in the esophagus, including a Zenker's diverticulum, a neoplasm or an esophageal motility dysfunction. In recent years, pharyngo-esophageal HRM has provided useful insights into the process of swallowing by enabling the detection of esophageal dysmotility, with particular interest in upper and lower esophageal sphincters. Manometry studies, often in combination with VFSS or FEES, have shown that dysphagia in PD is associated with a high prevalence of esophageal motility disturbances. However, the impact of these alterations on swallowing and their role in influencing the clinical management of dysphagia remain to be clarified.

### Dysphagia in stroke, neurodegenerative disease, and advanced dementia [^1147n7CN]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Aspiration risk from dysphagia increases with central and peripheral neurologic disease. Stroke, microvascular ischemic disease, a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases, and advancing dementia all have unique aspects. However, there are distinct commonalities in this population. Increasing nutritional requirements to stave off oropharyngeal muscular atrophy and a sedentary lifestyle further tax the patient's abilities to safely swallow. This article reviews stroke, muscular dystrophy, myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and advanced dementia. Approaches to screening and evaluation, recognizing sentinel indicators of decline that increase aspiration risk, and options for managing global laryngeal dysfunction are also presented.

### Use of modified diets to prevent aspiration in oropharyngeal dysphagia: is current practice justified? [^1122nsuN]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Modifying diets to prevent pneumonia

Overall, there is no convincing evidence to suggest that texture modified foods and thickened fluids benefit adults with dysphagia by preventing pneumonia and its consequences. There have been few RCTs regarding the effects of thickening fluids and none regarding texture modified food. This contrasts with reasonable evidence suggesting benefits from swallow rehabilitation, including a large single-site RCT showing that a standard programme of early behavioural swallowing intervention (including active therapeutic approaches and dietary modification) from speech and language therapists (SLTs) in acute stroke patients reduced the risk of chest infections over six months compared with 'usual care' (relative risk reduction 0.56). (Usual care in this study involved patient management by the attending physicians and referral to SLTs or for a VFSS only if the physician considered it to be appropriate).

The best evidence (based on the GRADE system of rating quality of evidence) regarding the effects of thickened liquids in dysphagic patients on prevention of pneumonia comes from a large multi-centre study. Initially, Logemann et al. studied 711 patients with dementia or Parkinson's disease who aspirated on thin liquids during a VFSS and who all received three interventions - chin-down posture while taking thin fluids and nectar-thickened and honey-thickened liquids in a head-neutral position – in a randomised order during the VFSS. Half the participants aspirated on all and 25% did not aspirate on any of the interventions; 68% aspirated on chin-down, 65% on nectar-thickened and 53% on honey-thickened liquids (all pair-wise comparisons significant at p < 0.001 or more). Honey-thickened liquids were significantly less likely to prevent aspiration when presented last than when presented first in the sequence of trials, which may reflect the effects of fatigue.

Screening-tools

Questionnaires and a specific water swallow test may be used as screening tools:
The Swallowing Disturbance Questionnaire (SDQ) with a sensitivity of 80.5% and a specificity of 81.3% is simple to apply using a score of 15 dysphagia-associated questions to detect PD-related dysphagia. A score > 10 recommends further dysphagia diagnostic (max. score 44.5). Additionally, the patient-rated Radboud Oral Motor Inventory for Parkinson's disease (ROMP) questionnaire is used for assessment of speech, swallowing, and saliva control.
The Munich Dysphagia Test — Parkinson's disease (MDT-PD) with a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 71% was designed to detect milder forms of dysphagia without aspiration risk, although its usefulness as a screening tool for aspiration events is controversial. A French version is also available.
The Non-Motor Symptoms Questionnaire (NMS-Quest; Question 3: "difficulty swallowing food or drink or problems with choking") and the Movement Disorder Society — Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (MDS-UPDRS; Question 2.3 of the UPDRS II: "problems swallowing pills or eating meals") each also include one question about swallowing difficulties. However, in a recent study, NMS and MDS-UPDRS were identified as unreliable tools for detecting previous aspiration.
Normal water tests that are useful for diagnosing severe dysphagia, e.g. in stroke patients, are not reliable screening tools for PD-related dysphagia when compared with instrumental diagnostic tools. A detection of a 'wet voice' after different bolus consistencies showed a too low sensitivity to be a solid marker of penetration/aspiration in PD. Therefore, a modified water test was developed to evaluate the stimulability of drinking by using a maximum performance test (maximum swallowing volume < 20 mL, maximum swallowing speed < 10 mL/s). Nonetheless, in a more recent study, swallowing speed was found to be prone to methodological errors and not unsuitable as a screening instrument to predict aspiration in PD patients.

Instrumental diagnostic tools

Flexible Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) and Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Study are both considered to be the gold standard for evaluating oropharyngeal dysphagia. These instrumental tools should be applied in cases of unclear and severe PD-associated dysphagia, especially to detect silent aspiration as well as specific dysphagia phenotypes.

### Management of gastrointestinal symptoms in Parkinson's disease: a comprehensive review of clinical presentation, workup, and treatment [^116YbESp]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) are among the most prevalent and debilitating of complications and present unique diagnostic and management challenges. Patients with PD commonly experience dysphagia, nausea, bloating, and constipation related to pathologic involvement of the enteric nervous system. In turn, gastrointestinal complications may impact motor fluctuations and the efficacy of levodopa therapy. This review will explore the common gastrointestinal manifestations of PD with an emphasis on clinical presentation, workup, and treatment strategies.

### What to do when people with Parkinson's disease cannot take their usual oral medications [^112AD2E5]. Practical Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

People with Parkinson's disease have limited brain reserves of endogenous dopamine; thus, their medications must not be omitted or delayed as this may lead to a significant drop in brain dopamine levels. This has two main clinical consequences: first, a deterioration in disease control, with distressing symptoms such as tremor, pain, rigidity, dysphagia and immobility, and second, an increased risk of developing the life-threatening complication of neuroleptic malignant-like syndrome. Common reasons for people with Parkinson's disease being unable to take their oral medications are neurogenic dysphagia from progressive disease or concurrent illness, gastroenteritis, iatrogenic 'nil by mouth' status especially perioperatively, and impaired consciousness level. Here we outline alternative methods to give dopaminergic drugs in the acute setting to people with Parkinson's disease who cannot take their usual oral treatment, namely using dispersible preparations in thickened fluids, an enteral tube, a transdermal patch or subcutaneous injections.

### Measuring what matters in Parkinson's disease research and dysphagia: the need for core outcome sets [^1127KNDN]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Take‐Home Message

COS represent a set of outcomes that should be measured and reported as a minimum in all clinical trials relevant to the specific health condition, while still allowing researchers to include additional outcomes relevant to their research questions. For clinical trials in PD, the development and use of COS is particularly vital given the complex clinical presentation of PD. COS will ensure that the outcomes that are most important and relevant to key stakeholders are included, measured consistently across studies, and reported in a standardized way, making it easier to compare results and synthesize evidence. Together with further methodological improvements in the design of trials on dysphagia interventions, this will lead to more efficient and reliable research, increase the relevance and applicability of research to clinical practice, and help to inform clinical decision making, health policy, and the development of guidelines for the management of PD‐related symptoms. With the prevalence of PD rising and no curative treatment being available, we support Smith's position that disregarding COS is no longer acceptable, and immediate action is required. The recently developed COS for dysphagia interventions in PD (COS‐DIP) provides six core outcomes that measure what truly matters in this important aspect of PD management.

### Swallowing outcomes in dysphagia interventions in Parkinson's disease: a scoping review [^112vfYPA]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Swallowing disorders (oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD)) are a common and clinically significant symptom in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). The prevalence varies between 11% and 81% according to severity of the disease, definitions of OD and assessment tools used. Nearly 50% of people with PD experience aspiration, increasing the risk of developing pneumonia, which is a leading cause of death in people with PD.

OD interventions aim for safe, efficient and sufficient intake of food and fluids for patients while maximising quality of life (QoL) for the patient, their carers and their family. Clinical decisions on the safety and effectiveness of interventions are based on selected outcomes, thus the choice of outcomes to be measured and reported in clinical trials is critical.

Furthermore, synthesising and comparing study results to direct treatment for people with OD in PD is necessary. Two recently published systematic reviews by Gandhi and Steeleand López-Liria et al concluded that there is an ongoing significant lack of fundamental scientific evidence on the treatment of OD in PD. In an attempt to address this issue, Schindler et al established a consensus on the treatment of OD in PD. One conclusion made by the authors is that in neurodegenerative conditions such as PD, longer-term treatment effects and adverse events must also be assessed.

These three published reports demonstrate not only a deficiency of evidence on OD interventions in PD but argue that longer-term treatment effects and adverse events should be assessed consistently. Despite being intricately linked, these studies focus on the efficacy and efficiency of OD interventions themselves rather than on the outcomes that are targeted by the interventions.

### Prevalence of subclinical and clinical dysphagia in Parkinson's disease… [^113rcnuR]. ClinicalTrials (2021). Medium credibility.

In idiopathic Parkinson's disease, 50% of patients develop in the course of the disease a dysphagia and aspiration pneumonia is the leading cause of death in all parkinsonian syndromes. Dysphagia can negatively impact on the course of Parkinson's disease due to complications such as aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition, inadequate drug action, it causes a deterioration in quality of life and leads to an increase in health care costs of more than 10% Therefore, it is very important to detect subclinical dysphagia in time in Parkinson's disease and to initiate a targeted swallowing therapy. In the Neurological Rehabilitation Center Rosenhügel, patients with Parkinson's disease participate in the Parkinson rehabilitation pathway during their rehabilitation program. A part of the Parkinson rehabilitation pathway is the dysphagia pathway.

It includes a clinical swallowing examination, an instrumental assessment of swallowing, performed by a fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing and a dysphagia training. Because of the serious clinical consequences of dysphagia, the investigators decided to further evaluate the prevalence of subclinical and clinical dysphagia in Parkinson's disease and to assess the efficacy of the NRZ dysphagia pathway. Our goal is to detect and classify all Parkinson's disease patients with dysphagia and to prevent the complications of dysphagia by an early therapeutic intervention. Background: In idiopathic Parkinson's disease, 50% of patients develop in the course of the disease a dysphagia and aspiration pneumonia is the leading cause of death in all parkinsonian syndromes. Dysphagia in idiopathic Parkinson's disease is subjectively perceived and communicated only in the late stages.

Questions on screening:
When is it indicated to screen for dysphagia in patients with PD?
When should dysphagia be suspected in patients with PD?
What clinical tools should be used to screen for dysphagia in patients with PD?

Questions on diagnosis:
What clinical tools should be used to detect the presence of dysphagia?

How should severity of dysphagia be assessed?

Questions on QoL:
What is the effect of dysphagia on the QoL of patients with PD?
How should dysphagia-related QoL in patients with PD be clinically assessed?

Questions on prognosis:
Does dysphagia influence the prognosis of PD?
What factors or associated conditions can influence the prognosis of dysphagia in PD?

For each question, specific eliciting questions were formulated by the Technical Committee to stimulate and guide the discussion among the members of the WG (Supplementary material 1).

Lastly, although gastric per oral endoscopy myotomy is a novel intervention that has shown promise in open-label studies for gastroparesis, long-term sham-controlled randomized trial data are still needed before this can be routinely recommended, much less in the PD population where it has not yet been thoroughly examined.

### Dysphagia for medication in Parkinson's disease [^113aVBg9]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

When considering the subjective perception, the large tablet was perceived as more difficult to swallow than the small capsule and small tablet, while no significant difference in swallowing difficulty was detected for the large capsule vs. the other dosage forms or sizes. In addition, there tended to be a greater anxiety of swallowing larger products, although the post-hoc comparison did not reveal any significant differences between the individual dosage forms. In line with this, further studies show that patients in general subjectively prefer smaller preparations –. In contrast, another study suggests that both too small and too large preparations may be perceived as problematic. A possible reason why size may be a decisive parameter for the subjective swallowing experience could again be the stronger sensory perception, which may be perceived as unpleasant.

The examination of the relationship between OD for liquid and food an dysphagia for medication revealed a moderate correlation. Thus, patients with OD for food and liquid are also at increased risk for dysphagia for medication. However, six out of 9 patients with at least severe dysphagia for medication had mild or no OD for food and liquid and showed no penetration and aspiration. Thus, it should not be assumed across the board that patients with only mild OD for food and liquid are also capable of swallowing medications. These results are consistent with those of Buhmann et al. The authors reported that half of the subjects with dysphagia for medication also had dysphagia for liquids, whereas the other half did not. Therefore, we argue that it is useful to evaluate OD for food and liquid and dysphagia for medication separately. Then, based on the patient's individual findings, an appropriate medication strategy can be found and, if necessary and possible, a switch to oral dispensable, liquid, subcutaneous, or continuous intestinal substitutes can be recommended.

### Dysphagia for medication in Parkinson's disease [^1172CmXp]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

With regard to prevalence, our data show that dysphagia for medication is very common in PD at approx. 70% and has a comparable prevalence to OD for food and liquid. These prevalence data are higher than the previously reported studies by Buhmann et al with 28%and Fukae et al with 33%. However, in Buhmann et al. only significant impairment was designated as abnormal. In Fukae et al. only medication residue and not impaired swallowing safety was analyzed.

With regard to motor symptoms, our data show a significant, albeit weak, association between dysphagia for medication and motor complications. The causes of motor complications in PD are not yet understood in detail and are probably heterogeneous. Possibly, in addition to gastric motility disorders, dysphagia for medication may also be involved in reduced or fluctuating absorption of dopaminergic medication in the small intestine. Matching this, Fukae et al. demonstrated that tablet residue in FEES were associated with the delayed-on phenomenon in PD patients. Further, case reports suggest an association of dysphagia for medication with motor fluctuations. In addition, switching levodopa from oral to dispersible form has been shown to improve morning akinesia, delayed-on, and wearing-off phenomena in PD patients with swallowing impairment. In contrast, Buhmann et al. did not find an association between dysphagia for medication and dopaminergic response, which was scored binary based on patient history.

### Non-pharmacological interventions for lewy body dementia: a systematic review [^116VpYPD]. Psychological Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

The systematic review identified very little research on non-pharmacological interventions in Lewy body dementia. No randomised control trials focusing specifically on Lewy body dementia were identified and the majority of research consisted of case studies and case series. Of the studies identified, the best quality evidence came from a randomised control trial that focused on preventing fluid aspiration in Parkinson's disease patients with dysphagia (Logemann et al.). As already noted, however, even this study was limited by the fact that it only examined the immediate effects of interventions in an experimental context and did not assess longer term effectiveness in more naturalistic settings. Overall, given the heterogeneity of interventions, small sample sizes, and poor quality of research, no treatment recommendations can be offered.

The lack of research in this area is in contrast to the large amount of research on non-pharmacological interventions in other types of dementia (Brodaty & Arasaratnam; Livingston et al; Orgeta et al; Livingston & Cooper; Seeher & Brodaty). It is consistent, though, with what has been found in other systematic reviews on Lewy body dementia (Hindle et al; Stinton et al; Inskip et al.). Despite the lack of research, however, non-pharmacological interventions are likely to be important in the management of Lewy body dementia. As already noted, pharmacological treatment of psychotic symptoms and movement disturbances in this condition is limited by the difficulties patients have tolerating first-line medications.

### Dysphagia: evaluation and collaborative management [^113LqLSq]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Dysphagia is common but may be underreported. Specific symptoms, rather than their perceived location, should guide the initial evaluation and imaging. Obstructive symptoms that seem to originate in the throat or neck may actually be caused by distal esophageal lesions. Oropharyngeal dysphagia manifests as difficulty initiating swallowing, coughing, choking, or aspiration, and it is most commonly caused by chronic neurologic conditions such as stroke, Parkinson disease, or dementia. Symptoms should be thoroughly evaluated because of the risk of aspiration. Patients with esophageal dysphagia may report a sensation of food getting stuck after swallowing. This condition is most commonly caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease and functional esophageal disorders. Eosinophilic esophagitis is triggered by food allergens and is increasingly prevalent; esophageal biopsies should be performed to make the diagnosis. Esophageal motility disorders such as achalasia are relatively rare and may be overdiagnosed. Opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction is becoming more common. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is recommended for the initial evaluation of esophageal dysphagia, with barium esophagography as an adjunct. Esophageal cancer and other serious conditions have a low prevalence, and testing in low-risk patients may be deferred while a four-week trial of acid-suppressing therapy is undertaken. Many frail older adults with progressive neurologic disease have significant but unrecognized dysphagia, which significantly increases their risk of aspiration pneumonia and malnourishment. In these patients, the diagnosis of dysphagia should prompt a discussion about goals of care before potentially harmful interventions are considered. Speech-language pathologists and other specialists, in collaboration with family physicians, can provide structured assessments and make appropriate recommendations for safe swallowing, palliative care, or rehabilitation.

Final conclusions/practical algorithm for management

Dysfunction of the upper GIT in PD, especially oropharyngeal dysphagia, are complex syndromes occurring early in disease that often remain unnoticed until severe complications, such as aspiration pneumonia, become manifest. In the lower GIT, constipation is a widespread and debilitating symptom with the potential of leading to severe bowel complications and even cognitive dysfunction.

In closing, standardized and early diagnostic approaches together with continuous and long-term treatment are necessary to help patients (Table 2).

### Management of gastrointestinal symptoms in Parkinson's disease: a comprehensive review of clinical presentation, workup, and treatment [^116qAJdc]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) are among the most prevalent and debilitating of nonmotor complications. As many as 81% of patients with PD develop GI disturbances, with constipation, dysphagia, and nausea and vomiting among the most frequent symptoms (Fig. 1). For many patients with severe PD, the burden of GI symptoms has a greater impact on quality of life than even motor symptoms. Like with other disorders of gut-brain interaction, the relationship between GI symptoms and mental health in PD is bidirectional: A recent study found that in PD both anxiety and depression were predicted by the degree of GI symptom burden, and inversely, worse anxiety and depression significantly predicted the development of poorer GI symptoms. Over the last decades, significant attention has been paid to GI symptoms manifesting not only after a PD diagnosis, but in fact, occurring as many as 20 years prior. Indeed, our group has identified 4 main prodromal GI symptoms in a case-control study of PD, namely: dry mouth, heartburn, dysphagia, and constipation, with no significant differences between males and females (Fig. 2). Because of newer evidence in this regard, constipation was recently added to the diagnostic criteria for prodromal PD by the Movement Disorder Society Task Force on the Definition of Parkinson's Disease.

Manometric EGJOO in patients with PD with dysphagia should prompt a second confirmatory diagnostic study such as a timed barium swallow (with a 13 mm tablet) or endoFLIP. First-line therapy for EGJOO includes endoscopic pneumatic dilation with a response rate of 69.6% or potentially botulinum toxin injection to the lower esophageal sphincter with a comparably favorable response rate of 63.6%. It should be noted that the effect of botulinum toxin injection often wears off by 6 to 12 months postprocedure, and repeated injections may affect the patient's candidacy for per oral endoscopic myotomy. Of note, while these data are based on interventions performed in the general EGJOO population, a small pilot study of patients with PD with various esophageal motility disorders not limited to EGJOO (n = 3) demonstrated the feasibility and safety of botulinum toxin injection to the lower esophageal sphincter specifically among patients with PD. Indeed, botulinum toxin treatment has been used successfully in other complications of PD such as tremor, dystonia, and neurogenic bladder. – However, larger prospective studies are warranted before botulinum toxin injections could be more commonly recommended outside the standard indications in EGJOO.

Surgical or per oral endoscopic myotomy in EGJOO has to date been evaluated in small uncontrolled studies and has not been specifically evaluated in the PD population. Although well established in the treatment of achalasia, the results of myotomy in EGJOO, in general, have been variable. Nonetheless, for patients with severe symptoms and refractory to alternative treatments, these options may be discussed including the potential risks of perforation and aggravation of reflux.

### Interventions involving biofeedback to improve swallowing in people with parkinson disease and dysphagia: a systematic review [^113fuZAa]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To examine the effectiveness of biofeedback used in the treatment of adults with Parkinson disease (PD) and dysphagia, define the factors associated with biofeedback treatment outcomes, and inform a theory to guide the implementation of biofeedback in future dysphagia interventions.

Data Sources

A systematic review using a narrative synthesis approach of all published and unpublished studies were sought with no date or language restrictions. Ten electronic databases (EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, Science Direct, AMED, The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses A & I, Google Scholar) were searched from inception to April 2019. This search was updated in January 2020. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using Downs and Black checklist.

Study Selection

Four studies were included. The methodological quality of the included studies was low with a high risk of bias. Data were analyzed narratively and descriptively. Despite the heterogeneity of the included studies, the findings suggest that interventions incorporating visual biofeedback may have positive effects on swallowing-related quality of life.

Conclusions

Based on these preliminary findings, we provide directions for further research and clinical interventions that incorporate an augmentative biofeedback component of swallowing interventions in people with PD. Future studies should be rigorously designed and set appropriate biofeedback treatment in terms of types, schedules, and timing.

### Modifying the consistency of food and fluids for swallowing difficulties in dementia [^1158d1fY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

People with dementia can have feeding and swallowing difficulties (dysphagia). Modification of the consistency of food or fluids, or both, is a common management strategy. However, diet modification can affect quality of life and may lead to dehydration and malnutrition. Evidence on the benefits and risks of modifying food and fluids is mandatory to improve the care of people with dementia and dysphagia.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and adverse effects associated with modifying the consistency of food and fluids in improving oral intake and eliminating aspiration in adults with dysphagia and dementia.

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS (the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group), the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE via Ovid SP, Embase via Ovid SP, PsycINFO via Ovid SP, CINAHL via EBSCOhost, LILACS via BIREME, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) Portal on 9 May 2018. We also checked the reference lists of relevant articles to identify any additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and cluster-RCTs published in any language that measured any of the outcomes of interest. We included trials with adults with a clinical diagnosis of dementia with symptoms and signs of dysphagia confirmed on instrumental assessment. We included participants with all types, stages and severities of dementia. Control groups received either no intervention or interventions not involving diet modification or modification to sensory properties of food.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed for inclusion all potential studies identified. Data were extracted independently along with assessment of methodological quality using standard Cochrane methods. We contacted study authors for additional unpublished information.

Main Results

No trials on modification of food met the inclusion criteria. We included two studies that examined modification to fluids. Both were part of the same large multicentre trial and included people with dementia and people with or without dementia and Parkinson's disease. Participation in the second trial was determined by results from the first trial. With unpublished data supplied by study authors, we examined data from participants with dementia only. The first study, a cross-over trial, investigated the immediate effects on aspiration of two viscosities of liquids (nectar thick and honey thick) compared to regular liquids in 351 participants with dementia using videofluoroscopy. Regular liquids with a chin down head posture, as well as regular liquids without any intervention were also compared. The sequence of interventions during videofluoroscopy may have influenced response to intervention. The second study, a parallel designed RCT, compared the effect of nectar and honey thick liquids with a chin down head posture over a three-month period in a subgroup of 260 participants with dementia. Outcomes were pneumonia and adverse intervention effects. Honey thick liquids, which are more consistent with descriptors for 'spoon thick' or 'extremely thick' liquids, showed a more positive impact on immediate elimination of aspiration during videofluoroscopy, but this consistency showed more adverse effects in the second follow-up study. During the second three-month follow-up trial, there were a greater number of incidents of pneumonia in participants receiving honey thick liquids than those receiving nectar thick liquids or taking regular liquids with a chin down posture. There were no deaths classified as 'definitely related' to the type of fluids prescribed. Neither trial addressed quality of life. Risk of bias for both studies is high. The overall quality of evidence for outcomes in this review is low.

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain about the immediate and long-term effects of modifying the consistency of fluid for swallowing difficulties in dementia as too few studies have been completed. There may be differences in outcomes depending on the grade of thickness of fluids and the sequence of interventions trialled in videofluoroscopy for people with dementia. Clinicians should be aware that while thickening fluids may have an immediate positive effect on swallowing, the long-term impact of thickened fluids on the health of the person with dementia should be considered. Further high-quality clinical trials are required.

### Gastrointestinal involvement in Parkinson's disease: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management [^11226VNw]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Therapeutic management

Over the years, a number of studies have provided evidence-based recommendations for treatment of oropharyngeal dysphagia. Swallowing therapy, especially as performed by speech and language therapists, and other specific therapeutic options might help to improve oropharyngeal swallowing impairment:

Pharmacotherapy

The effects of dopaminergic medication and levodopa on swallowing function and its role in dysphagia treatment are controversially discussed –. Oropharyngeal swallowing parameters with good levodopa-responsiveness could be pharyngeal residue (especially in the valleculae), penetration, and oral as well as pharyngeal transit times. Furthermore, some studies indicate positive effects of the dopamine agonists apomorphine and transdermal rotigotine –. As such, an examination whether an improvement in swallowing function could be achieved by increasing or optimizing dopaminergic medication should be performed on a case-by-case basis, i.e. by using the FEES-Levodopa-Test. In this test, three salient parameters (premature spillage, penetration/aspiration events, and residues, each tested with liquid, semisolid, and solid food consistencies) are assessed in off- and on-stage conditions performing a specific score. A score improvement of > 30% indicates levodopa responsiveness of dysphagia. Subsequently, in such cases, optimizing dopaminergic medication should be considered. Furthermore, levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) infusion therapy might be capable of alleviating pharyngeal bradykinesia and premature bolus spillage.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS)

To date, detailed information about the effects of DBS on swallowing function in PD patients remain limited. Using stimulation of the subthalamicus nucleus (STN), low-frequency stimulations (i.e. 60 Hz) may have a beneficial effect on swallowing dysfunction in patients with freezing of gait, whereas high-frequency stimulation might result in beneficial, no, or detrimental effects. A short-term improvement (lower aspiration rate) was indicated as well but without confirmation in the long-term observation. Simultaneous STN and substantia nigra (SNr) stimulation seem to have no additional beneficial effect on dysphagia compared with conventional STN stimulation, but swallowing function does not deteriorate as a result.

Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES)

The use of NMES in PD patients seems to have no measurable benefit. A recent study using new electrode placement methods indicates increased hyoid bone movement and reduced aspiration risks, but NMES cannot be recommended for PD dysphagia treatment at the present time.

### Impact of fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing outcomes and dysphagia management in neurodegenerative diseases [^112duRKH]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

To determine the incidence of abnormal fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) findings in patients with progressive neurologic disorders and identify the most commonly implemented dysphagia management strategies.

Study Design

Retrospective Review.

Methods

A retrospective review was performed of patients with neurodegenerative disease who underwent FEES at a tertiary-care center between 2008 and 2019. Patient demographics, diagnosis, and Eating Assessment Tool-10 (EAT-10) scores were recorded. Rates of penetration, aspiration, and functional change in management (FCIM) to include dietary modifications, home exercises, swallow therapy, surgical intervention (injection augmentation or esophageal dilation), or alternative means of nutrition (i.e., percutaneous enteral gastrostomy [PEG] tube) were calculated.

Results

Two hundred nine FEES assessments were performed in 178 patients with a mean age of 64.8years (standard deviation = ± 14). The most common diagnoses were amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (32%) followed by Parkinson's disease or Parkinsonism (26%). FEES demonstrated penetration in 72.5% of patients and aspiration in 14.6%. Mean EAT-10 scores differed between patients with aspiration versus penetration versus normal FEES (24.7 vs. 14.9 vs. 13.9, respectively, P < .001). An FCIM was recommended in 88% of patients and most commonly included self-directed modifications (43%). Overall, 4.5% of patients underwent surgical intervention. A PEG tube was recommended for either supplemental or sole form of nutrition in 19% of the entire cohort.

Conclusions

Most patients with neurodegenerative diseases presenting with dysphagia demonstrated abnormal FEES findings necessitating an FCIM, suggesting early dysphagia evaluation may be warranted in this cohort. These findings correlate with worsened EAT-10 scores in patients with aspiration or penetration on FEES.

### Assessment and treatment of neurogenic dysphagia in stroke and Parkinson's disease [^113jF5Du]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Neurogenic dysphagia worsens quality of life and prognosis of patients with different neurological disorders. Management of neurogenic dysphagia can be challenging. This review provides a comprehensive overview of current evidence on screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic dysphagia in stroke and Parkinson's disease, suggesting clues for clinical practice.

Recent Findings

The pros and cons of diagnostic techniques are discussed in the light of updated evidence. Findings from recent meta-analyses of different treatment approaches, including traditional dysphagia therapy, peripheral and central neurostimulation techniques, and treatment with botulinum toxin, are critically discussed, emphasizing inconsistencies and controversial issues.

Summary

Screening tests and clinical swallow examination should be routinely performed in neurological patients at risk for dysphagia. In patients testing positive for dysphagia, first-line instrumental investigations, represented by fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing or videofluoroscopic swallow study, should be performed to confirm the presence of dysphagia, to assess its severity, and to inform the treatment. Second-line and third-line instrumental methods can be used in selected patients to clarify specific pathophysiological aspects of oropharyngeal dysphagia. Treatment strategies should be personalized, and combination of traditional dysphagia therapy with innovative treatment approaches may increase the chance of restoring effective and safe swallowing.

Relevance of dysphagia for the quality of life of patients with PD

Dysphagia negatively affects QoL in PD. The progression of swallowing difficulties may cause choking, coughing or breathing problems during the meal, and often leads to dietary restrictions and prolonged meal duration. Altogether, these changes have an important psychosocial burden for patients with PD because they may discourage or impair social activities and relationships. Swallowing problems negatively influence wellbeing, self-confidence and social integrations, which in turn result in frustration and isolation. Depression is indeed frequently associated with reduced QoL in patients with PD with swallowing disorders.

Moreover, difficulty in taking oral anti-parkinsonian therapy with consequent worsening of motor and non-motor symptoms is another problem that frequently affects patient's QoL.

In the late stages of the disease, due to severe dysphagia, PEG placement becomes mandatory when medium/long-term enteral feeding is needed to prevent malnutrition, weight loss and aspiration. This interventional procedure is often not well accepted by the patients and their caregivers and may thus have a further negative impact on QoL.

Though not specific for PD, the Swallowing Quality of Life (SWAL-QOL) is the most widely used questionnaire to assess the impact of dysphagia on the QoL of patients with PD both in the literature and in the clinical practice. SWAL-QOL assesses different aspects of the swallowing function that are experienced by the patient (i.e. food selection, social functioning, fear, eating duration, eating desire, communication) with a recall period of 1 month. The questionnaire is available and validated in several languages.

The 39-item Parkinson's disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) and the short-form 8-item Parkinson's disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8) are also used in PD to assess the psychosocial impact of dysphagia on QoL, but they are not specific for swallowing disturbances.

A limited number of studies have investigated the relationship between dysphagia severity and the impact on QoL. The severity of dysphagia significantly affects QoL and the progression of the disease, though this relationship is not linear. In the study by Leow et al. QoL deterioration was proportional to the progression of dysphagia, and the subjects who required diet modifications presented with significantly reduced SWAL-QOL scores.

### A multinational consensus on dysphagia in Parkinson's disease: screening, diagnosis and prognostic value [^1145HLJ3]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide. The prevalence of PD is estimated at 6.1 million individuals globally and will likely increase worldwide with increased life expectancy. PD is characterized by motor features such as tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia, and several non-motor features such as dysphagia, autonomic dysfunction, sleep disorders, cognitive impairment, depression, and psychosis that may occur at any time during the disease course, but become more frequent with advanced disease.

Dysphagia in PD is a manifestation of swallowing dysfunction that may involve oral, pharyngeal or esophageal phases of swallowing and may be present in every stage of the disease. Indeed, even though swallowing disorders become apparent mostly in the advanced stage of PD, they may already be present in the early stages, when they often go undetected. Dysphagia frequently worsens with disease progression and may vary with motor fluctuations. Globally, the prevalence of dysphagia in PD is estimated between 40 and 80% depending on type of assessment performed.

Dysphagia can negatively affect the quality of life (QoL) of individuals because of the progressive difficulty of oral intake (food, drinks or oral medication), weight loss, dehydration, malnutrition and limitation of social activities. Moreover, aspiration pneumonia due to swallowing dysfunction is an important and common cause of hospitalization in patients with PD, resulting in severe complications and even death.

To date, there is no generally accepted approach to the screening and the diagnosis of dysphagia in PD. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify standardized protocols for the clinical assessment and investigation of dysphagia in this population. Moreover, it is important to emphasize the need for the early identification of swallowing abnormalities in patients with PD, especially as initially they may be asymptomatic.

An established and formal methodology to provide reliable guidance in complex health issues in the absence of high-quality evidence is represented by a consensus-based process. In this process, expert professionals reach a consensus on statements aimed at providing a guide for clinical practice on the basis of the best available evidence and the group's expertise. Typically, a panel of experts, after examining the relevant scientific information and discussing the clinical issues, produce statements that reflect their shared views, in agreement with available evidence.

Summary/Practical algorithm for management

Disturbances of the upper GIT in PD, especially oropharyngeal dysphagia, are complex syndromes that occur early in disease duration but often remain unnoticed until severe complications, such as aspiration pneumonia, develop. Accordingly, standardized and early diagnostic approaches as well as focused treatment of specific dysphagia patterns are required to help affected individuals. Table 2 provides a summary of the most relevant clinical manifestations of upper GIT impairment and feasible treatment approaches.

### Dysphagia treatments in Parkinson's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115aB95r]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The majority of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) develop oropharyngeal dysphagia during the course of their disease. However, the efficacy of dysphagia treatments for these patients remains controversial. Therefore, we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate treatment efficacy based on the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Methods

Five electronic databases were systematically searched from inception date to April 2022. Two reviewers independently extracted and analyzed the data. The outcome measures were changes in swallowing-related characteristics based on instrumental swallowing assessments.

Key Results

An initial search identified 187 RCT studies of relevance. After screening, nine studies with a total sample size of 286 were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled effect size for all dysphagia treatments compared with control comparators was significant and medium (SMD [95% CI] = 0.58 [0.22, 0.94], p = 0.001; I² = 50%). Subgroup analysis revealed a significant and medium pooled effect size for stimulation treatments (brain stimulation, peripheral neurostimulation and acupuncture) (SMD [95% CI] = 0.54 [0.15, 0.92]; p = 0.006; I² = 22%). Specifically, the effect sizes for the single RCTs on neuromuscular stimulation (SMD [95% CI] = 1.58 [0.49, 2.86]; p = 0.005) and acupuncture (SMD [95% CI] = 0.82 [0.27, 1.37]; p = 0.003) were significant and large.

Conclusions and Inferences

Our results showed that overall, dysphagia treatments, particularly stimulation treatments, can potentially benefit PD patients. However, given the limited number of small RCTs for each type of treatment, the evidence remains weak and uncertain. Further large-scale, multicenter RCTs are warranted to fully explore their clinical efficacy in the PD population.

### Oropharyngeal dysphagia [^113jTLxx]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Although the aging process per se can produce measurable changes in the normal oropharyngeal swallow, these changes alone are rarely sufficient to cause clinically apparent dysphagia. The causes of oropharyngeal dysphagia in the elderly are predominantly neuromyogenic, with the most common cause being stroke. The evaluation of oropharyngeal dysphagia in the elderly involves early exclusion of structural abnormalities, detection of aspiration by videofluoroscopy which might dictate early introduction of nonoral feeding, and exclusion of underlying systemic and neuromyogenic causes that have specific therapies in their own right. Such conditions include Parkinson disease, myositis, myasthenia, and thyrotoxicosis. Management is best delivered by a multidisciplinary team involving physician, speech pathologist, nutritionist and, at times, a surgeon.

Diagnosis of dysphagia in PD

The clinical swallowing examination has a higher sensitivity to identify swallowing abnormalities compared to screening questionnaires. Thus, it is indicated in all patients with a positive screening test result. The clinical swallowing examination is performed preferably by a speech-language pathologist and includes a patient/caregiver interview, evaluation of cognition and communication abilities, oral motor assessment, and swallowing trials. For those centres who do not have a speech-language therapist with an expertise in the evaluation of neurogenic dysphagia, a referral pathway should be put in place.

The Water Swallow Test (WST) is among the most common tools used during clinical swallowing examination because of its rapidity and ease of use. The WST may detect dysphagia early in PD and identify subjects at risk of aspiration. However, it may underestimate the incidence of oropharyngeal dysphagia, since its diagnostic accuracy depends on the preservation of the cough reflex and pharyngo-laryngeal sensitivity. Therefore, the combination of the WST with clinical tests assessing voluntary and/or reflex cough function increases the positive and negative predictive value of the clinical swallowing assessment.

In addition to the above, cough testing can be useful for assessing severity of dysphagia and aspiration risk. In particular, compared to voluntary cough testing, reflexive cough testing can be more sensitive in distinguishing between patients with PD with mild (PAS 3–5) or severe dysphagia (PAS 6–8), as well as between patients with penetration above (PAS 2–3) or below (PAS 4–8) the level of the vocal folds.

Two studies have shown that reduced tongue pressure and motility are among other possible indicators of early dysphagia in PD.

Several instrumental investigations detect swallowing abnormalities with higher sensitivity than the clinical swallowing examination. Swallowing abnormalities of swallow have been observed in almost all patients using different diagnostic techniques, even in the early stages of disease in studies performed by different groups. There is no consensus on whether these investigations should be carried out in all patients with PD regardless of the presence of signs and symptoms associated with dysphagia. This represented one of the main subjects of debate during the MCC. On one hand, when considering that silent aspiration may go undetected by clinical evaluation and it may be present even in the early stages of the disease, it seems reasonable to apply instrumental investigations also in subjects with clinically safe and functional swallowing. On the other hand, it seems important to consider that some instrumental diagnostic investigations for dysphagia are not widely available. Thus, the prevailing view was to consider mandatory such evaluation only in patients with clinical signs of dysphagia (see statement below).

Several studies have evaluated the role of different investigation methods in the diagnosis of dysphagia in PD. VFSS and FEES should be used as a first approach, as they enable detection of aspiration, penetration, and residue with similar high sensitivity and specificity. VFSS directly reveals penetration/aspiration, also providing useful information when the oral and/or esophageal phase is impaired. FEES ensures an appropriate assessment of the pharyngeal phase of swallowing and the detection of penetration/aspiration phenomena, both directly (before or after the swallow, i.e. in case of premature spillage and residue, respectively) and indirectly. FEES has the advantage over VFSS of being easier to perform, even at the patient's bedside, and allows to test swallowing of real food and to assess secretion management. Moreover, as FEES does not require the use of radiation, it can be repeated even at short time intervals, thus allowing accurate follow-ups.

### Frequency and outcomes of gastrostomy insertion in a longitudinal cohort study of atypical parkinsonism [^114ouWVm]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study has some important limitations. First, swallow dysfunction was assessed by patient self‐report rather than objective imaging assessment of dysphagia. However, by analogy with studies in PD we suspect that this would result in underestimation, rather than overestimation, of the prevalence and severity of dysphagia. Second, there was inevitable attrition in longitudinal data due to disease progression and loss to follow‐up, although this still represents a large, longitudinal cohort of patients with atypical parkinsonism. Due to the relatively small numbers undergoing gastrostomy, we were unable to formally analyse changes in health‐related quality of life post‐procedure, which remains an important unmet need in such studies. Third, the study was not able to address the comorbidities present in each group, the rate of complications post‐gastrostomy such as tube blockage or site infections, or the need for tube replacement. Data on the decision‐making process around gastrostomy are also lacking as discussed earlier. Strengths of the study include the longitudinal documentation of disease milestones such as gastrostomy insertion, and recruitment from multiple centres giving a balanced perspective on current practice relating to dysphagia management. In addition, our study provides information on gastrostomy outcome in CBS, for which little evidence hitherto exists in the literature.

Screening of dysphagia in PD

Although dysphagia is a common symptom in PD, most patients with PD do not complain of swallowing difficulties even when specifically asked, because they are generally not aware of their swallowing problems.

Therefore, there is a gap in the literature on dysphagia prevalence between subjectively reported impairment (35%) and objectively confirmed swallowing impairments by screening questionnaires or clinical evaluations (85%). Indeed, signs of penetration and/or aspiration may be detected in 20% of the PD population without any complaint of swallowing difficulties.

The early diagnosis of dysphagia in PD may be challenging. However, many symptoms and signs may indicate the need for a screening. These are: increased duration of meals, difficulty in tablet swallowing and sensation of food sticking or persisting in the throat after swallowing, coughing and choking during ingestion of food and liquids, post-swallowing changes in voice (e.g. gurgling voice), weight loss or low body mass index while recurrent chest infections. Also, drooling is considered by some authors as a possible indirect marker of dysphagia, since it can be the consequence of oropharyngeal swallowing alterations. Using a modified barium swallowing videofluoroscopy, Nóbrega et al. showed that all patients with PD and drooling also presented changes in the oral phase of swallowing, whereas alterations in the pharyngeal phase were detected in 94% of subjects. Drooling also correlates with dysphagia severity and may have a negative prognostic value, as it is associated with an increased risk of salivary aspiration without any outward sign of coughing, choking, or respiratory change (silent aspiration).

A recent study conducted in patients with PD aged > 63.5 years identified the following characteristics as predictors of an increased risk to develop dysphagia: a daily levodopa equivalent dose higher than 475 mg and a PD clinical subtype characterized by early postural instability and gait difficulty.

Altogether, the data from the literature suggest that dysphagia in PD should be suspected in the presence of direct symptoms (coughing or choking when eating or drinking, wet-sounding voice when eating or drinking, sensation of food stuck in the throat and difficulty of chewing food properly), or indirect signs (congestion of the lower respiratory tract, bronchitis or pneumonia and unintentional weight loss).

In these cases, a screening evaluation should be completed regardless of PD disease stage.

The presence of different symptoms and/or signs in combination can increase the sensitivity and specificity of the screening procedures.

### Emergencies and critical issues in Parkinson's disease [^112vJir9]. Practical Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal complications

Dysphagia is common in Parkinson's disease, typically in its late stages. It results from the loss of coordination in the normal steps of deglutition as well as oropharyngeal bradykinesia. Dysphagia may cause malnutrition with weight loss, high levels of anxiety during each meal for both the patient and carer, impaired medication intake and reduced social contact. It is associated with a high rate of mortality, mainly because of aspiration pneumonia. Early suspicion is essential to avoid these complications. Signs of neurogenic dysphagia include frequent coughing, choking or nasal regurgitation during meals, as well as frequent respiratory infections and drooling. When present, video fluoroscopy and fibreoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing should be considered. Management of dysphagia involves a personalised swallowing therapy, depending on the severity. Percutaneous gastrostomy may be a possibility, but it has to be implemented with caution.

A recent review showed how to manage dysphagia that interferes with oral intake of medication. Furthermore, alternative methods of oral levodopa are provided with conversion rates to rotigotine patch from other dopamine agonists and levodopa.

Intestinal pseudo-obstruction, also known as paralytic ileus, is a serious condition that sometimes accompanies severe constipation. It seems to be relatively uncommon (2.4%). Abdominal distension, pain, nausea and vomiting characterise intestinal pseudo-obstruction, but in advanced patients with cognitive deterioration it can be difficult to diagnose, presenting with a prominent confusional state and poor response to levodopa.

During the acute phase, urgent endoscopic repositioning will be necessary. More severe cases may be complicated by intestinal perforation requiring surgical treatment. Preventive treatment of constipation with prokinetic drugs may help to prevent recurrences.

### Management of acid-related disorders in patients with dysphagia [^1113sJ2o]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Dysphagia affects a large and growing number of individuals in the United States, particularly the elderly and those who are neurologically impaired. Swallowing difficulties may be due to age-related changes in oropharyngeal and esophageal functioning as well as central nervous system diseases such as stroke, Parkinson disease, and dementia. Among institutionalized individuals, dysphagia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. An appreciation of the physiology of swallowing and the pathophysiology of dysphagia is necessary for proper patient management. Careful history, physical examination, and evaluation of radiologic and endoscopic studies should differentiate oropharyngeal and esophageal etiologies of dysphagia and distinguish mechanical (anatomic) disorders from functional (motor) disorders. A significant percentage of patients with dysphagia have concomitant acid-related disorders that are managed best with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. Three of the currently available PPIs are manufactured as capsules containing enteric-coated granules that may be mixed with soft foods or fruit juices before oral administration to those with swallowing difficulties. In addition, omeprazole and lansoprazole may be administered via gastrostomy or nasogastric feeding tubes as suspensions in sodium bicarbonate. Novel dosage formulations of lansoprazole that may be appropriate for patients with dysphagia include the commercially manufactured lansoprazole strawberry-flavored enteric-coated granules for suspension and lansoprazole orally disintegrating tablets.

Relevant trials were identified by electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, ISI-SCI, AMED, MANTIS, REHABDATA, REHADAT, GEROLIT, Pascal, LILACS, MedCarib, JICST-EPlus, AIM, IMEMR, SIGLE, ISI-ISTP, DISSABS, Conference Papers Index, Aslib Index to Theses, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, the CentreWatch Clinical Trials listing service, the metaRegister of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, CRISP, PEDro, NIDRR and NRR; and examination of the reference lists of identified studies and other reviews.

Selection Criteria

Only randomised controlled trials (RCT) were included. We did not examine any trials using drugs or surgery to treat the dysphagia. We did not examine any trials where part of the therapist's advice was to insert a nasogastric or percutaneous gastrostomy tube.

Data Collection and Analysis

Not applicable.

Main Results

No randomised controlled trials or controlled trials were found that examined the efficacy of non-pharmacological swallowing therapy for the treatment of dysphagia in Parkinson's disease. However there is one large RCT currently recruiting patients that will compare 'chin down' posture with thickened liquids in the treatment of dysphagia. The main outcomes will be the rates of aspiration and pneumonia.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is currently no evidence to support or refute the efficacy of non-pharmacological swallowing therapy for dysphagia in Parkinson's disease. Large well designed placebo-controlled RCTs are required to assess the effectiveness of swallowing therapy for dysphagia in Parkinson's disease and reported according to CONSORT guidelines. Suitable outcome measures should be chosen so that the efficacy and effectiveness of non-pharmacological swallowing therapy can be assessed and an economic analysis performed. Outcomes which have meaning to patients and carers should be used wherever possible since they need to know the value of this therapy in practical terms. The patients should be followed for at least 6 months to determine the duration of any improvement.

Introduction

Age-related physiological changes of the swallowing mechanism, the so-called presbyphagia, predominantly consist of a slowing and weakening of the different stages of deglutition: oral, pharyngeal and esophageal. These changes are not always indicative of an impairment and may even be functional to safe swallowing. In some cases, though, age-related changes could contribute to the onset of dysphagia i.e. the difficulty or impossibility in forming or moving a bolus efficiently and safely from the oral cavity to the esophagus. The most common type among older subjects is oropharyngeal dysphagia. Although some studies have identified the age as a significant single risk factor for dysphagia, changes in swallowing resulting from ageing are more frequently co-responsible for it, along with some diseases and the medicines used to treat them. Dysphagia is closely related to neurological and neurodegenerative diseases such as stroke, dementia and Parkinson's disease, but also to sarcopenia, a skeletal muscle disorder due to loss of strength and muscle mass. Medication related adverse events, i.e. xerostomia, cognitive impairment and reduction of alertness, as well as polypharmacy, i.e. taking five or more medications daily, are also important risk factors for dysphagia. In its initial stages, dysphagia may cause distress and anxiety, negatively affecting the quality of life of affected subjects. Over time it may cause many life-threatening clinical conditions, such as undernutrition and dehydration, respiratory infections, aspiration pneumonia, and even death. Nevertheless, despite the progressive aging of the population has made dysphagia an important concern for the public health, the knowledge on its prevalence and on the most appropriate methods of treatment presents still important knowledge gaps.

### A multinational consensus on dysphagia in Parkinson's disease: screening, diagnosis and prognostic value [^116D6GJ4]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinicians should keep in mind that findings from clinical and instrumental investigations of swallowing may not be entirely representative of the patient's eating and drinking performance in real life. Variables such as distractions, specific consistencies and bolus size, medications, motor fluctuations and dyskinesias may impact the testing results. Thus, it is important to observe patients in their usual eating and drinking habits, or alternatively gather this information in the case history or with questionnaires. The therapeutic effect of the anti-parkinsonian drugs on swallowing function is highly variable and can affect results from swallowing investigations. Though the dopaminergic medications might improve dysphagia in some patients, in others, they either showed no effect or negatively affected the swallowing function, also depending on the stage of the disease. Similarly, studies testing the effect of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on swallowing function have yielded conflicting findings, showing beneficial, absent or detrimental effects.

Once the diagnosis of dysphagia is provided, standardized methods to assess swallowing severity should be carried out to guide the best treatment strategy and for prognostic assessment. Most of the studies conducted in patients with PD have adopted the Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS). A few studies have used other validated scales such as the Dysphagia Outcome and Severity Scale (DOSS), and the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS).

### Consensus on the treatment of dysphagia in Parkinson's disease [^114AuNLe]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Dysphagia is common in Parkinson's disease (PD). The effects of antiparkinsonian drugs on dysphagia are controversial. Several treatments for dysphagia are available but there is no consensus on their efficacy in PD.

Objective

To conduct a systematic review of the literature and to define consensus statements on the treatment of dysphagia in PD and related nutritional management.

Methods

A multinational group of experts in the field of neurogenic dysphagia and/or Parkinson's disease conducted a systematic evaluation of the literature and reported the results according to PRISMA guidelines. The evidence from the retrieved studies was analyzed and discussed in a consensus conference organized in Pavia, Italy, and the consensus statements were drafted. The final version of statements was subsequently achieved by e-mail consensus.

Results

The literature review retrieved 64 papers on treatment and nutrition of patients with PD and dysphagia, mainly of Class IV quality. Based on the literature and expert opinion in cases where the evidence was limited or lacking, 26 statements were developed.

Conclusions

The statements developed by the Consensus panel provide a guidance for a multi-disciplinary treatment of dysphagia in patients with PD, involving neurologists, otorhinolaryngologists, gastroenterologists, phoniatricians, speech-language pathologists, dieticians, and clinical nutritionists.

### A multinational consensus on dysphagia in Parkinson's disease: screening, diagnosis and prognostic value [^117FxZnD]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

In the assignment phase, four working teams with specific roles were identified:
The Scientific Committee, comprising seven members, planned and organized the whole project and developed the questions following the Classification of Evidence Schemes of the Clinical Practice Guideline Process Manual of the American Academy of Neurology. Several clinically relevant questions were proposed by the Scientific Committee and discussed during several iterations according to the PICO format as stated in Appendix 1. The selection of the final questions to be answered in this review was also guided by the results of a preliminary literature search conducted to evaluate whether there was available evidence to support the answers. The selection of the clinical questions was ultimately driven by the following criteria: i) to identify clinically relevant, focused topics (not taking too narrow a focus nor too broad), ii) to select questions that could be answered, at least partly, on the basis of published, peer-reviewed evidence.
The Technical Committee, formed by six members, systematically reviewed the evidence, organized the results into tables, and assisted the other teams in all steps of the project;
A working group (WG) formed by nine members whose tasks were: 1) to prepare the first draft of answers to the proposed questions prior to the consensus conference and 2) to point out the research gaps in current knowledge and to propose areas for future research;
The consensus development panel, comprising six members, was responsible for defining the presentation procedures at the MCC and for the assessment of the final statements.

### Swallowing outcomes in dysphagia interventions in Parkinson's disease: a scoping review [^115iA2aV]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Outcome domains

As the taxonomy by Dodd et al was developed for clinical trials in medical research in general but not specifically for OD interventions, the outcome domains were adapted for the purpose of this scoping review. Figure 2 depicts the outcome domains from the included studies and the number of outcomes mapped accordingly.

Figure 2
Outcome domains used in clinical trials in oropharyngeal dysphagia in Parkinson's disease.

Outcome subdomains

The outcome domain #9a comprises almost three quarters of all outcomes and the outcome domain #9b includes with over 8% the second most outcomes. In order to categorise these general outcome domains more precisely, recategorising according to subdomains was necessary. Outcome domain #9a was divided into the following five subdomains: (1) saliva management, (2) swallowing-related physiology, (3) swallow efficiency, (4) swallow safety and (5) neurological status. The outcome oropharyngeal dysphagia severity remained as was. Outcome domain #9b was split into two subdomains: (1) neurological findings and (2) voice.

Research question 1: what are the outcomes of interest in clinical trials in OD in PD?

The 134 included outcomes were merged to 39 outcomes due to overlaps or being identical. Table 1 presents the 'long list of outcomes' including the outcomes, subdomains, domains and outcome areas accordingly.

Table 1
Long list of outcomes included in clinical trials in oropharyngeal dysphagia in Parkinson's disease

The outcome of most interest was penetration/aspiration measuring the depth of the entry of food and fluid into the larynx and airway. This was measured in 10 of the 19 studies. Oropharyngeal dysphagia severity was the second most often measured outcome (n = 9). The top eight outcomes of interest in the included studies are depicted in figure 3. All other outcomes were measured one or two times.

Figure 3

### Major nutritional issues in the management of Parkinson's disease [^115nPSeG]. Movement Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

As with other neurodegenerative diseases, neurologic and nutritional elements may interact affecting each other in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the long-term effects of such interactions on prognosis and outcome have not been given much attention and are poorly addressed by current research. Factors contributing to the clinical conditions of patients with PD are not only the basic features of PD, progression of disease, and the therapeutic approach but also fiber and nutrient intakes (in terms of both energy and protein content), fluid and micronutrient balance, and pharmaconutrient interactions (protein and levodopa). During the course of PD nutritional requirements frequently change. Accordingly, both body weight gain and loss may occur and, despite controversy, it seems that both changes in energy expenditure and food intake contribute. Nonmotor symptoms play a significant role and dysphagia may be responsible for the impairment of nutritional status and fluid balance. Constipation, gastroparesis, and gastro-oesophageal reflux significantly affect quality of life. Finally, any micronutrient deficiencies should be taken into account. Nutritional assessments should be performed routinely. Optimization of pharmacologic treatment for both motor and nonmotor symptoms is essential, but nutritional interventions and counseling could and should also be planned with regard to nutritional balance designed to prevent weight loss or gain; optimization of levodopa pharmacokinetics and avoidance of interaction with proteins; improvement in gastrointestinal dysfunction (e.g., dysphagia and constipation); prevention and treatment of nutritional deficiencies (micronutrients or vitamins). A balanced Mediterranean-like dietary regimen should be recommended before the introduction of levodopa; afterward, patients with advanced disease may benefit considerably from protein redistribution and low-protein regimens.

### Drooling is no early sign of dysphagia in Parkinson's disease [^112PM7tj]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Dysphagia is frequent and clinically highly relevant in Parkinson's disease (PD). For a rational dysphagia screening predictors are required. Previous investigations suggested that drooling correlates with dysphagia and may serve as its early sign. The aim of this study was to clarify the interrelationship of drooling and dysphagia.

Methods

In a controlled, cross-sectional, observational study, a total of 119 Parkinson outpatients and 32 controls were examined clinically and by flexible-endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES). Drooling, dysphagia including retained pharyngeal secretions, and cognitive function were assessed by established evaluation scales.

Key Results

Fifty percent of all PD patients but only 9% of controls had drooling (P < .001). Drooling and dysphagia were related in PD (P = .027) but the data do not support to view drooling as a hallmark symptom for critical dysphagia. Thirty-nine percent of the patients with critical aspiration had no drooling. In contrast, 41% of the patients with severe drooling had no clinically relevant dysphagia in FEES. The oral, but not the pharyngeal secretion management was impaired in PD patients and there was no clear association between drooling and pharyngeal secretion accumulation. Cognitive impaired patients had significantly more drooling (P = .005).

Conclusions & Inferences

Although frequent in PD, drooling and dysphagia are only weakly related and drooling cannot be viewed as an early sign of dysphagia. Our data further suggest that the underlying cause of drooling is located in the voluntary oral phase, which is negatively influenced by cognitive deficits.

### Gastrointestinal involvement in Parkinson's disease: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management [^112BQd3c]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Main pathological findings

The main phenotype characteristic of PD-related dysphagia is insufficient pharyngeal bolus clearing, with residues predominant located in the valleculae, in addition to pharyngolaryngeal movement disorders, above all pharyngeal bradykinesia. Silent aspiration is also a frequent clinical manifestation, even in early stages, but the risk increases with disease duration. In an analogy to freezing of gait with similar pathophysiologic mechanisms, a recent study described the presence of oropharyngeal freezing resulting in a temporally missing or delayed swallowing reflex.

Dual task situations (i.e. cognitive or somatomotor tasks) are challenging to swallowing functional reserve capacities and therefore should be integrated into standard instrumental swallowing evaluations, (Fig. 2). Furthermore, retention of medications in the hypopharynx for long periods of time may account for erratic absorption of levodopa with an insufficient or unpredictable clinical response to oral medication(Fig. 3). An association of delayed on-phenomena with pharyngeal residues could have been shown as well. In a recent study, substantially impaired ability to swallow tablets or capsules was found in 28% (n = 33/118) of patients at all stages of the disease. Capsules were the easiest to swallow, whereas oval tablets were the most difficult.

Clinical predictors

The following clinical conditions have been linked to oropharyngeal dysphagia in PD and can be considered predictors,:
Hoehn and Yahr stage ≥ III
Relevant weight loss
Body Mass Index (BMI) ≤ 20 kg/m 2
Severe drooling or sialorrhea
Dementia

Another major problem for PD patients is drooling. Sialorrhea in PD patients usually does not result from an increased production of saliva but from a reduced spontaneous swallowing rate (48/h vs. 71/h) and/or from oropharyngeal dysphagia with a reduced ability to swallow saliva. The extent of sialorrhea correlates with the severity of PD-related dysphagia.

### Stridor and dysphagia associated with subthalamic nucleus stimulation in parkinson disease [^113DAjcd]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2011). Low credibility.

Refractory symptoms in Parkinson disease show good response to deep brain stimulation (DBS). This procedure improves United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scores and reduces dyskinesias, whereas speech and swallowing dysfunction typically do not improve and may even worsen. Rarely, DBS can cause idiosyncratic dystonias of muscle groups, including those of the neck and throat. The authors describe a patient experiencing stridor and dysphagia with confirmed pulmonary restriction and aspiration following subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulator adjustment, with a resolution of symptoms and signs when the stimulator was switched off.

Gastrointestinal symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) are among the most prevalent and debilitating of complications and present unique diagnostic and management challenges. Patients with PD commonly experience dysphagia, nausea, bloating, and constipation related to pathologic involvement of the enteric nervous system. In turn, gastrointestinal complications may impact motor fluctuations and the efficacy of levodopa therapy. This review will explore the common gastrointestinal manifestations of PD with an emphasis on clinical presentation, workup, and treatment strategies.

### Emergencies and critical issues in Parkinson's disease [^113H9R4e]. Practical Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

A less frequent psychiatric complication related to levodopa is 'dopamine-dysregulation syndrome'. It comprises a levodopa dependence syndrome and involves all the typical symptoms of craving, with impulsivity, compulsivity and mood changes. Its prevalence is probably underestimated because less severe cases are rarely reported. It can coexist with impulse-control disorder and should be suspected when patients indiscriminately increase their levodopa dose without medical authorisation and exceed the required dose to restore their motor functionality. Patients may increase their levodopa dose to avoid unpleasant feelings, typically non-motor symptoms related to off episodes.

The management of dopamine-dysregulation syndrome typically involves gradually reducing the levodopa and immediately withdrawing 'booster' doses of medications, such as apomorphine subcutaneous boluses and rapid-acting levodopa formulations. Deep-brain stimulation may help to facilitate dose reduction of levodopa.

Complications related to autonomic dysfunction that may require prompt medical intervention include symptomatic orthostatic hypotension and gastrointestinal tract complications, such as dysphagia and intestinal pseudobstruction.

### A multinational consensus on dysphagia in Parkinson's disease: screening, diagnosis and prognostic value [^1168DAqY]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a combination of motor and non-motor dysfunction. Dysphagia is a common symptom in PD, though it is still too frequently underdiagnosed. Consensus is lacking on screening, diagnosis, and prognosis of dysphagia in PD.

Objective

To systematically review the literature and to define consensus statements on the screening and the diagnosis of dysphagia in PD, as well as on the impact of dysphagia on the prognosis and quality of life (QoL) of PD patients.

Methods

A multinational group of experts in the field of neurogenic dysphagia and/or PD conducted a systematic revision of the literature published since January 1990 to February 2021 and reported the results according to PRISMA guidelines. The output of the research was then analyzed and discussed in a consensus conference convened in Pavia, Italy, where the consensus statements were drafted. The final version of statements was subsequently achieved by e-mail consensus.

Results

Eighty-five papers were used to inform the Panel's statements even though most of them were of Class IV quality. The statements tackled four main areas: (1) screening of dysphagia: timing and tools; (2) diagnosis of dysphagia: clinical and instrumental detection, severity assessment; (3) dysphagia and QoL: impact and assessment; (4) prognostic value of dysphagia; impact on the outcome and role of associated conditions.

Conclusions

The statements elaborated by the Consensus Panel provide a framework to guide the neurologist in the timely detection and accurate diagnosis of dysphagia in PD.

### Developing a core outcome set for dysphagia interventions in Parkinson's disease: an international Delphi consensus study [^117EzhB2]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Objectives

To develop a core outcome set (COS) for oropharyngeal dysphagia (swallowing disorder) interventions in Parkinson's disease by agreeing core outcomes and definitions, outcome measurement instruments (OMIs) and time points of measurement for these core outcomes.

Design

International online Delphi survey and consensus meetings.

Participants

Individuals living with oropharyngeal dysphagia and Parkinson's disease, family members and caregivers, healthcare professionals and researchers in the field of oropharyngeal dysphagia and Parkinson's disease.

Methods

A long list of outcomes was generated previously through scoping reviews, online surveys and focus groups with key stakeholders. Building on this, an international three-round online Delphi survey was conducted where participants rated the importance of outcomes. In subsequent online consensus meetings, core outcomes, their definitions, OMIs and time points of measurement were agreed on.

Results

90 participants from 21 countries completed all three rounds of the Delphi survey. Of these, 35 participated in a consensus meeting. Six outcomes were agreed as the core outcomes: 'penetration/aspiration', 'aspiration pneumonia', 'choking', 'oropharyngeal dysphagia severity', 'swallowing related quality of life' and 'post swallow pharyngeal residue'.

Conclusions

The use of a COS in future oropharyngeal dysphagia intervention studies in Parkinson's disease will facilitate comparative effectiveness research and ensure that outcomes are relevant to all key stakeholders. This should help improve the evidence base for oropharyngeal dysphagia interventions in Parkinson's disease.

Registration

The study was registered prospectively with the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials Database on 24 September 2021 (www.comet-initiative.org, registration number: 1942).

### Treatment of autonomic dysfunction in parkinson disease and other synucleinopathies [^111Y9Xyp]. Movement Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system afflicts most patients with Parkinson disease and other synucleinopathies such as dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure, reducing quality of life and increasing mortality. For example, gastrointestinal dysfunction can lead to impaired drug pharmacodynamics causing a worsening in motor symptoms, and neurogenic orthostatic hypotension can cause syncope, falls, and fractures. When recognized, autonomic problems can be treated, sometimes successfully. Discontinuation of potentially causative/aggravating drugs, patient education, and nonpharmacological approaches are useful and should be tried first. Pathophysiology-based pharmacological treatments that have shown efficacy in controlled trials of patients with synucleinopathies have been approved in many countries and are key to an effective management. Here, we review the treatment of autonomic dysfunction in patients with Parkinson disease and other synucleinopathies, summarize the nonpharmacological and current pharmacological therapeutic strategies including recently approved drugs, and provide practical advice and management algorithms for clinicians, with focus on neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, supine hypertension, dysphagia, sialorrhea, gastroparesis, constipation, neurogenic overactive bladder, underactive bladder, and sexual dysfunction. © 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Medical, surgical, and physical treatments for Parkinson's disease [^116W8Sor]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Although dopamine replacement therapy remains a core component of Parkinson's disease treatment, the onset of motor fluctuations and dyskinetic movements might require a range of medical and surgical approaches from a multidisciplinary team, and important new approaches in the delivery of dopamine replacement are becoming available. The more challenging, wide range of non-motor symptoms can also have a major impact on the quality of life of a patient with Parkinson's disease, and requires careful multidisciplinary management using evidence-based knowledge, as well as appropriately tailored strategies according to the individual patient's needs. Disease-modifying therapies are urgently needed to prevent the development of the most disabling refractory symptoms, including gait and balance difficulties, cognitive impairment and dementia, and speech and swallowing impairments. In the third paper in this Series, we present the latest evidence supporting the optimal treatment of Parkinson's disease, and describe an expert approach to many aspects of treatment choice where an evidence base is insufficient.

Validation of instrumental screening and assessment tools

Despite an extensive use of PAS in the field of deglutition research, a recent systematic review including studies utilizing VFSS, confirms the existence of discrepancies in its use (difference in bolus volumes and consistencies protocols, uncertainty among clinicians when ranking PAS score, PAS reported differently as either a categorical, an ordinal or an interval variable). Recent work thus aimed to address this issue in an attempt to validate and standardize the conduction of instrumental assessments for dysphagia, for example VASES with the idea to improve intra- and inter-rater reliability of FEES. Although promising, this tool necessitates validation through comparison with other validated FEES rating scales.

Other work focused on standardization and validation in an attempt to adjust these scores to instrumental investigations. "Dynamic Imaging Grade of Swallowing Toxicity" (DIGEST) is a five-point ordinal scale that assesses global severity of pharyngeal dysphagia and takes into consideration two main aspects of swallowing which is safety (graded using PAS corrected by frequency and quantity of the aspiration/penetration events) and efficiency (graded on the basis of the amount of pharyngeal residue, taking into account the bolus consistency with which they occurred). DIGEST was originally developed for head and neck cancer patients and was adapted and later validated using FEES (DIGEST-FEES). Further studies also promoted validation of DIGEST-FEES in other cohorts of patients, in particular patients with neurogenic dysphagia (Parkinsons Disease). However, it may be argued that pharyngeal hypoesthesia and impaired secretion management may be important mechanisms in neurogenic dysphagia as well as oral dysfunction or phenotypical aspects of dysphagia. These factors are not considered in DIGEST-FEES, which may partially limit its applicability.

### Clinical efficacy and mechanism of tDCS for dysphagia in PD… [^116tjJNe]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Efficacy and Mechanism of tDCS for Dysphagia in PDClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview This study aims to verify transcranial direct current stimulation efficacy for Parkinson's disease -related dysphagia and its mechanism. Subjects are randomly split into two groups: control and experimental. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, after the completion of intervention, and at the 3-month follow-up. Swallowing function will be evaluated via gold-standard videofluoroscopic swallowing study and scales. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging or functional near-infrared spectroscopy will be measures for tracking changes in abnormal brain regions/networks. Correlations between swallowing recovery and brain function changes, plus group imaging differences, will reveal tDCS's neurophysiological mechanism.

This study aims to verify the efficacy of tDCS in treating dysphagia in PD and explore its mechanism. Subjects are randomly divided into two groups: the control group receives sham tDCS as well as the conventional dysphagia treatment, while the experimental group undergoes real tDCS combined with conventional dysphagia treatment. All subjects will be evaluated before treatment, after treatment, and 3 months later. Swallowing function in both groups will be assessed using the gold standard VFSS and swallowing scales. Additionally, techniques including amplitude of low frequency fluctuation and functional connectivity in rs-fMRI or fNIRS will be used to observe changes in abnormal brain regions and brain network connectivity before and after treatment in both groups.

This study will also explore the correlation between swallowing function recovery and the alteration of brain function, compare the imaging differences between the two groups, and thereby reveal the neurophysiological mechanism underlying tDCS in the treatment of PD-related dysphagia.

### Gastrointestinal involvement in Parkinson's disease: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management [^1144Zj66]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Growing evidence suggests an increasing significance for the extent of gastrointestinal tract (GIT) dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD). Most patients suffer from GIT symptoms, including dysphagia, sialorrhea, bloating, nausea, vomiting, gastroparesis, and constipation during the disease course. The underlying pathomechanisms of this α-synucleinopathy play an important role in disease development and progression, i.e., early accumulation of Lewy pathology in the enteric and central nervous systems is implicated in pharyngeal discoordination, esophageal and gastric motility/peristalsis impairment, chronic pain, altered intestinal permeability and autonomic dysfunction of the colon, with subsequent constipation. Severe complications, including malnutrition, dehydration, insufficient drug effects, aspiration pneumonia, intestinal obstruction, and megacolon, frequently result in hospitalization. Sophisticated diagnostic tools are now available that permit more detailed examination of specific GIT impairment patterns. Furthermore, novel treatment approaches have been evaluated, although high-level evidence trials are often missing. Finally, the burgeoning literature devoted to the GIT microbiome reveals its importance for neurologists. We review current knowledge about GIT pathoanatomy, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment in PD and provide recommendations for management in daily practice.

### Gastrointestinal dysfunction in Parkinson's disease [^113TYyvo]. The Lancet: Neurology (2003). Medium credibility.

There is growing recognition that gastrointestinal dysfunction is common in Parkinson's disease (PD). Virtually all parts of the gastrointestinal tract can be affected, in some cases early in the disease course. Weight loss is common but poorly understood in people with PD. Dysphagia can result from dysfunction at the mouth, pharynx, and oesophagus and may predispose individuals to aspiration (accidental inhalation of food or liquid). Gastroparesis can produce various symptoms in patients with PD and may cause erratic absorption of drugs given to treat the disorder. Bowel dysfunction can consist of both slowed colonic transit with consequent reduced bowel-movement frequency, and difficulty with the act of defecation itself with excessive straining and incomplete emptying. Recognition of these gastrointestinal complications can lead to earlier and potentially more effective therapeutic intervention.

### Schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease: challenges in management [^113Y4LW7]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

A 57-year-old gentleman was admitted for relapse of psychotic symptoms. He had prior diagnosis of schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. His psychotropic medications were adjusted but his neurological symptoms worsened, mainly dysphagia. His speech and mobility also posed significant problem. Neurology department was contacted for joint management. In the event of resolution of psychotic symptoms, he was transferred to the neurology department for further management. His medication for Parkinson's disease was reviewed; a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was inserted in stomach for feeding as dysphagia did not improve. He was transferred back to psychiatry unit for further adjustment in psychotropic medication in order to see a possible improvement in dysphagia. Minor adjustment was done in this regard in view of his mental health stability. Change of medication was not possible for the possible side effects and patient's compliance issue. He was discharged with adequate plans; follow-up arrangement and suggestions for further management.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^111gkonU]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Wilson disease — treatment of neurological symptoms — effective management of neurological manifestations of WD requires that treatment of the copper overload is achieved typically through pharmacotherapy, and neurological symptoms should be monitored closely when initiating D-penicillamine or trientine because these can cause paradoxical neurological decline, especially if dosing is too aggressive (initial dose too high or dose increase too rapid), with most cases thought to be due to a transient increase in NCC (or exchangeable copper), which is in equilibrium with CNS copper. Many neurological symptoms are at least partially responsive to adjunctive medical management; medications to treat parkinsonism, such as carbidopa/levodopa, are not necessarily effective, treatments for dystonia can be extremely helpful but may be limited by adverse effects, focal dystonia can often be effectively treated with botulinum toxin injection, deep brain stimulation has been tried but with only variable success, and chorea may respond to vesicular monoamine transporter-2 inhibitors such as tetrabenazine or dopamine receptor antagonists although patients with WD may develop adverse effects from neuroleptics; a multidisciplinary approach involving speech therapy, physical therapy, and occupational therapy is often helpful, and swallowing studies may identify those with dysphagia and risk of aspiration risk requiring intervention.

### A multinational consensus on dysphagia in Parkinson's disease: screening, diagnosis and prognostic value [^114Fu5Rp]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

The project was initiated by the Organizing Committee during the 2018 edition of the 'Dysphagia Update' Meeting, an international scientific event focused on neurogenic dysphagia that has been held biannually since 2008 under the patronage of the Italian Society of Neurology, the Italian Society of Neurorehabilitation, and the European Society for Swallowing Disorders. The MCC method was designed according to the US National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Program and the Methodological Handbook of the Italian National Guideline System.

The project was developed over a period of 36 months following five steps: (1) assignment phase, (2) scoping phase, (3) assessment phase, (4) face-to-face MCC, held on 27–28th September 2019, at the IRCCS Mondino Foundation, and finally (5) update of the evidence (up to February 2021) and refinement of statements by e-mail.

The core of the consensus panel was formed by Italian neurologists who met regularly at the 'Dysphagia Update' meetings. Additional specialists, also from different medical disciplines and from other Countries were invited to achieve a broad geographic and multidisciplinary representation. Participants were selected based on their recognized involvement in the care of large cohorts of PD patients and/or their involvement in research projects on PD and/or neurogenic dysphagia, and/or because of their publication record on neurogenic dysphagia in peer-reviewed journals. Participants were invited by e-mail. A single reminder was sent to those who did not reply to the first invitation. The final group was formed by 21 neurologists, 4 ENT specialists, three phoniatricians, two gastroenterologists, 4 speech-language pathologists, 2 clinical nutritionists, one radiologist and a statistician.

### Dysphagia for medication in Parkinson's disease [^112ARsoS]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Our data show that the swallowing-related items of the MDS-UPDRS can be used with moderate sensitivity and specificity to predict dysphagia for medication. Therefore, as soon as there is evidence of impairment in items 2.3 or 2.4, it may be appropriate to initiate a more detailed investigation of dysphagia for medication. Here, our results differ from those of Buhmann et al. where poor diagnostic indicators were obtained by questionnaire screening.

In conclusion, dysphagia for medication is common in PD and can affect both swallowing efficiency, i.e. the ability to swallow medications completely, and swallowing safety, i.e. the ability to protect the airway. This study indicates that dysphagia for medication is involved in the development of motor complications. Both, large and small capsules tended to be swallowed more efficiently than tablets, whereas the safety of swallowing did not depend on the type of tablet or capsule. Dysphagia for medication should be evaluated independently of normal bolus OD, as the two moderately correlate, but may differ substantially in individual cases. If there is evidence of impaired swallowing or food intake in the MDS-UPDRS items 2.3 and 2.4, further diagnostic workup is advised, as this is a predictor of dysphagia for medication with moderate sensitivity and specificity.

There are several limitations that must be considered: The classifications used are based on expert consensus and have not yet been empirically validated. In particular, the weighting of the individual severity levels of dysphagia for medication and their variability within a subject have not yet been investigated, so this classification must be regarded as provisional and will require further validation and, if necessary, modification in the future. There were no events of complete bolus aspiration in our study. This must be taken into account with regard to the statements on swallowing safety, especially with regard to the analysis on the different tablets or capsules. It is possible that complete aspiration of large product might be more dangerous compared to small products, however, this is not reflected in our data due of the rarity of such events. In addition, the texture of the medication surface was not analyzed and there was no control group of healthy subjects.

### Measuring what matters in Parkinson's disease research and dysphagia: the need for core outcome sets [^112WArYE]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the fastest‐growing neurological condition with respect to prevalence, disability, and mortality worldwide.PD is a complex disease with both motor and non‐motor symptoms. Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) may present as a motor and/or non‐motor symptomand affects more than 80% of people living with PDand can even present at an early stage of the disease. It may lead to serious physical consequences, including dehydration, and malnutrition. Due to aspiration of material into the airway, dysphagia increases the risk of developing pneumonia, which is a leading cause of death in people with PD. In late‐stage PD, dysphagia is the only relevant predictor of poor outcomes. In addition to the physical complications, dysphagia can have severe psychosocial consequences, such as reduced quality of life.

With the rising prevalence of PD, the number of people living with dysphagia in PD will increase, reinforcing the ongoing need for evidence‐based dysphagia interventions in PD. Their effectiveness should be proven by high‐quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs). RCTs are widely regarded as the most robust form of evaluating the effectiveness, efficacy, and safety of health care interventions. Clinical practice decisions, policies, and guidelines are often based on evidence from these trials. However, we believe that there are three key challenges in clinical trials in health research that may lower the evidence base and consequently prevent clinicians from making informed decisions in clinical practice, with PD being no exception.

### Nonpharmacological treatments for patients with Parkinson's disease [^1165xGeh]. Movement Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Since 2013, a number of studies have enhanced the literature and have guided clinicians on viable treatment interventions outside of pharmacotherapy and surgery. Thirty-three randomized controlled trials and one large observational study on exercise and physiotherapy were published in this period. Four randomized controlled trials focused on dance interventions, eight on treatment of cognition and behavior, two on occupational therapy, and two on speech and language therapy (the latter two specifically addressed dysphagia). Three randomized controlled trials focused on multidisciplinary care models, one study on telemedicine, and four studies on alternative interventions, including music therapy and mindfulness. These studies attest to the marked interest in these therapeutic approaches and the increasing evidence base that places nonpharmacological treatments firmly within the integrated repertoire of treatment options in Parkinson's disease.

### To restrict or not to restrict? Practical considerations for optimizing dietary protein interactions on levodopa absorption in Parkinson's disease [^116UQHbF]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Box 1 Considerations for managing diet, medications and gastrointestinal issues in PwP

Dietary Assessment
Take levodopa on an empty stomach 30 min before or 2 h after a meal.
Assess possible food-drug interactions, by recording at least a 1-day dietary recall that includes amount/type of foods and drinks consumed, timing of meals, medications, and motor fluctuations.
If motor fluctuations present, consider appropriateness of PRD with protein intake at least 0.8 g/kg/body weight. Monitor body weight and dyskinesias.
Avoid use of low-protein diets (< 0.8 g/kg/day) to prevent loss of lean body mass.
Administer levodopa with a small carbohydrate snack (i.e. crackers, toast, applesauce, etc.) to reduce nausea after administration.
High fiber diet and adequate hydration for constipation management to improve levodopa bioavailability.
Low-fat diet for gastroparesis management to improve levodopa bioavailability.
Consider dietitian referral for diet assessment and education for PwP.

Medication Dosing and Timing
Educate PwP/care partners on indication, dose, frequency, administration times, what to do if missed dose, food and drug interactions, and potential adverse effects.
Consider other formulations of levodopa delivery such as half tablets, extended-release orally disintegrating, transdermal or enterally administered to improve levodopa bioavailability.
To prevent nausea, carbidopa may reduce side effects if available. A minimum daily dose of 75 mg is required to prevent peripheral conversion. Domperidone or trimethobenzamide can also be considered.
Monitor and adjust levodopa dosage when implementing interventions that improve bioavailability to reduce dyskinesias.
Consider pharmacist referral for medication therapy management and education.

Gastrointestinal Function
Conditions such as gastroparesis, SIBO and/or constipation may impair levodopa absorption.
Change in diet habits due to poor oral health (masticatory difficulties), anosmia, ageusia, and dysphagia may challenge dietary interventions and increase risk for weight loss.
Stool softeners, bulk-producing and osmotic laxatives and suppositories should be used as needed for constipation management to improve levodopa bioavailabilty.
Consider speech language pathologist and/or gastroenterology referral(s).

### Measuring what matters in Parkinson's disease research and dysphagia: the need for core outcome sets [^112kzp6X]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

As it has been shown that the uptake increases when COS include not only recommendations on what to measure but also how to measure the core outcomes, we have also sought consensus on OMIs for each core outcome. The core outcomes and their suggested OMIs are depicted in Figure 1.

FIG. 1
Core outcomes and recommended outcome measurement instruments for dysphagia intervention studies in Parkinson's disease from Hirschwald et al.DIGEST, Dynamic Imaging Grade of Swallowing Toxicity; FEES, Fibreoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing; MBSImP, Modified Barium Swallowing Impairment Profile; PD, Parkinson's disease; VASES, Visual Analysis of Swallowing Efficiency and Safety; VFS, Videofluoroscopy. [Color figure can be viewed at]

Participants agreed that three of the six core outcomes (oropharyngeal dysphagia severity, penetration/aspiration, and post swallow pharyngeal residue) should be measured using instrumental assessments, either Videofluoroscopy (VFS) or Fibreoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES). It is noteworthy that two core outcomes (swallowing‐related quality of life and choking) are patient‐reported outcomes. Of these, choking is currently not being measured in any dysphagia intervention study in PDand most likely would not have been rated as a core outcome had we not included people with dysphagia in PD and family members/caregivers in the Delphi survey and consensus meetings. Although swallowing‐related quality of life is commonly measured using the SWAL‐QOLin dysphagia intervention studies in PD, we still lack a validated OMI for choking.

In a progressive, neurodegenerative condition like PD, it is essential to measure the potential long‐term effects of an intervention. However, most dysphagia intervention studies in PD are restricted to pre‐ and post‐treatment comparisons with only a few measuring effects up to 6 months after completion of the intervention. Given the inconsistency in when studies measure the outcomes and the lack of long‐term follow‐up, we also sought consensus on when the core outcomes should be measured as part of the COS‐DIP. The agreed timepoints of measurement are categorized as "minimum" and in addition as "advisable"(Fig. 2).

### Parkinson's disease-current treatment [^115tATp9]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose is to review the results and impact of recent studies for current and future treatment of both motor and non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD).

Recent Findings

New formulations of levodopa further optimize motor fluctuations, allowing for more on-time and less dyskinesia. On demand apomorphine continues to showcase itself as an effective and tolerable tool for treating motor off-periods. Though there are no clear treatment guidelines for PD-related constipation and sleep related disorders, several new agents for these non-motor symptoms show promising preliminary data. Expiratory muscle strength training may represent a useful and cost-effective strategy to alleviate oropharyngeal dysphagia associated with PD. There is evidence to suggest that the use of shorter pulse width and directional deep brain stimulation leads can results in a greater therapeutic window.

Summary

Though no interventions currently exist to significantly modify the disease progression of PD, new studies continue to give insight into optimal symptomatic management. Clinicians should be familiar with expanding the repertoire of tools available to treat the diverse range of symptoms and challenges associated with PD.

### Narrative review of diagnosis, management and treatment of dysphagia and sialorrhea in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^1126yskd]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Swallowing is a complex process that encompasses both volitional and reflexive activities, engaging over 30 nerves and muscles. The swallowing process can be categorized into oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal stages based on the location of the bolus. Dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, manifests through symptoms such as coughing and choking during or after a meal, difficulty in chewing, drooling, weight loss, and the risk of aspiration pneumonia. It can arise from a myriad of conditions, ranging from neurological disorders (such as stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, etc.) to psychiatric disorders and structural lesions. Given that humans typically produce over half a liter of saliva daily and subconsciously engage in swallowing approximately every 1–3 min, the function of swallowing plays a crucial role in effective saliva management. In neuromuscular diseases like ALS, dysphagia and difficulty in the management of secretions (sialorrhea) are common symptoms. It has been observed that in motor neuron diseases, the oral phase of swallowing is the most compromised, followed by the pharyngeal phase. The importance of evaluating these symptoms is emphasized by the critical role the swallowing mechanism plays in safeguarding the airway, sharing significant anatomical features with it. Some serious medical complications such as dehydration and malnutrition can also arise due to dysphagia. Furthermore, it is well-known that dysphagia increases the risk of death 7.7-fold in ALS patients. The underlying reasons for dysphagia in ALS patients are nuclear or supranuclear lesions of the hypoglossus, vagus, and glossopharyngeal nerves. These result in atrophy and weakness of the tongue along with problems in closure of the soft palate and the larynx.

To the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of recent comprehensive reviews regarding dysphagia and sialorrhea in ALS. This review aims to present an updated summary of the knowledge surrounding dysphagia in ALS, offering insights into its diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment in everyday clinical practice.

### Non-pharmacological interventions for lewy body dementia: a systematic review [^115aqK4x]. Psychological Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Lewy body dementia (consisting of dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterised by visual hallucinations, fluctuating attention, motor disturbances, falls, and sensitivity to antipsychotics. This combination of features presents challenges for pharmacological management. Given this, we sought to review evidence for non-pharmacological interventions with patients with Lewy body dementia and their carers. Bibliographic databases were searched using a wide range of search terms and no restrictions were placed on study design, language, or clinical setting. Two reviewers independently assessed papers for inclusion, rated study quality, and extracted data. The search identified 21 studies including two randomised controlled trials with available subgroup data, seven case series, and 12 case studies. Most studies reported beneficial effects of the interventions used, though the only sizeable study was on dysphagia, showing a benefit of honey-thickened liquids. Given the heterogeneity of interventions and poor quality of the studies overall, no quantitative synthesis was possible. Overall, identified studies suggested possible benefits of non-pharmacological interventions in Lewy body dementia, but the small sample sizes and low quality of studies mean no definite recommendations can be offered. Our findings underscore the clear and urgent need for future research on this topic.

- strategies to improve the safety and efficiency of swallowing to minimize the risk of aspiration, such as expiratory muscle stress

- strategies to improve speech and communication, such as attention to effort therapies.

### Frequency and outcomes of gastrostomy insertion in a longitudinal cohort study of atypical parkinsonism [^112xwrwX]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The atypical parkinsonian syndromes include multiple system atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS). These syndromes show faster progression and are less responsive to dopaminergic treatment compared with Parkinson's disease (PD). Dysphagia and dysarthria are also more common and severe in these conditions. In patients with pathologically confirmed MSA and PSP, dysphagia occurred sooner after disease onset compared with PD, and was correlated with reduced survival. Dysphagia is associated with increased mortality in both PSP and MSA.

There is a limited evidence base for the management of dysphagia in these disorders, including the prevalence and efficacy of gastrostomy insertion. Guidance on the management of dysphagia in MSA, PSP and CBS indicates that gastrostomy insertion can be considered, but the evidence is lacking for outcomes such as improved survival or quality‐of‐life (QoL). Data on the outcomes of gastrostomy in MSA, PSP and CBS are scarce. A longitudinal study in 59 patients with MSA who had dysphagia identified a mean latency to gastrostomy insertion (done in 42%) of 7 years, with average survival of 1.5 years post‐procedure. In a study of 90 patients with PSP, 20 required non‐oral feeding following aspiration pneumonia, with a mean survival of 2 years following onset of non‐oral feeding. In a retrospective analysis across two tertiary French centres, a total of 15 patients with MSA, 5 with PSP and 3 with CBS underwent gastrostomy over a 7‐year period, with a median survival of 186 days. A recent study of gastrostomy insertion for parkinsonian syndromes in two UK centres over 12 years found a median survival of around 400 days in MSA (n = 5) and PSP (n = 10) compared with 571 days in PD (n = 58).

We aimed to evaluate current practice in the UK by analysing data from a large, longitudinal, multicentre study including patient‐reported outcomes, disease‐specific rating scales and milestones of disease progression. Our objectives were to determine the rate and outcomes of gastrostomy insertion in this cohort, and the progression of dysphagia as measured by disease‐specific rating scales.

### A multinational consensus on dysphagia in Parkinson's disease: screening, diagnosis and prognostic value [^117UT799]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Prognostic value of dysphagia and prognostics factors for dysphagia in PD

In this paragraph, we focus on the impact of dysphagia on comorbidities and life expectancy of subjects with PD, and on the factors that are associated to dysphagia severity.

The incidence of aspiration pneumonia is more than three-fold higher in PD subjects than age-matched controls, and patients with dysphagia are more likely to die of pneumonia than those with normal swallowing. Presence of comorbidities (e.g. chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular disease, chronic renal or liver disease) and lower level of compliance to enteral feeding in PD patients with severe dysphagia increases the risk of pneumonia and choking. Weight loss is more frequent in patients with PD with eating problems, and the risk of malnutrition appears to be dependent on dysautonomic symptoms including dysphagia.

Survival after onset of dysphagia is poor in PD. Moreover, the severity of dysphagia represents the most important prognostic factor for the occurrence of death in the later stages of the disease. Pneumonia represents the most common cause of death in PD. Aspiration of solid food, liquids, saliva or gastric contents represents the leading cause of pneumonia in this patient population, and it is significantly associated with survival from diagnosis.

As regards the factors that may be associated to dysphagia severity, disease progression is associated with more severe swallowing difficulties. Furthermore, an impaired cough response has a negative impact on dysphagia severity. This agrees with the notion that integrity of pharyngeal–laryngeal sensitivity and cough efficiency influence the risk of aspiration pneumonia, as reflex and voluntary cough are important mechanisms of airway protection during swallowing. The association between pneumonia and reduced oral hygiene is well documented. However, we did not find any specific evidence regarding the prognostic value of reduced oral hygiene on dysphagia and/or PD outcome. Yet, it is conceivable that poor oral hygiene may have a negative impact on dysphagic patients with PD. Finally, a relationship between cognitive impairment, dysphagia severity and risk of aspiration pneumonia has been shown in PD.

### Risk factors for aspiration pneumonia after receiving liquid-thickening recommendations [^116ioVwC]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Dysphagia has become an important health issue worldwide. The prevalence of dysphagia in older individuals is reported to range from 7% to 22%. Patients with acute stroke have a higher prevalence of dysphagia (50%-80%) than those without stroke, and > 80% of patients with Parkinson's disease have dysphagia. It is associated with an increased risk of aspiration pneumonia and related mortality.

Several factors increase the risk of aspiration, such as esophageal diseases, medications, alcohol consumption, reflux, tube feeding, dementia, and impaired consciousness. In addition, laryngeal sensation is important for preventing aspiration pneumonia, as patients with laryngeal sensory deficits have a 6.8-fold higher risk of developing pneumonia than those with normal laryngeal sensation. For patients with dysphagia, compensatory strategies, such as diet and liquid modification, can be crucial for increasing eating and swallowing efficiency and reducing the risk of aspiration. Previous randomized and nonrandomized clinical trials suggested that bolus modification, such as controlling the volume and temperature of the bolus, may prevent aspiration pneumonia in patients with dysphagia. -

Thickening of liquids has become central to current dysphagia management approaches to reduce the risks of aspiration and subsequent pneumonia. - However, there is no strong evidence to conclusively state that the use of thickened liquids can reduce pneumonia in patients with dysphagia. A systematic review and meta-analysis revealed no significant difference in the risk of pneumonia between aspirating patients who consumed thin liquids and those who consumed only thickened liquids. Nevertheless, given that dysphagia is closely associated with age, physical function, frailty, polymedication, and multimorbidity, these results may have been affected by the backgrounds of patients in these various study facilities.

In our institution, since 2014, we have been guiding patients with dysphagia on the appropriate viscosity of thickened liquids. In addition, liquid modification has been recommended according to patients' swallowing functions, as assessed by videofluoroscopic swallowing studies (VFSSs). We recommend a level of thickening that is as low in viscosity as possible without penetration-aspiration. In this study, we first examined whether the frequency of liquid penetration-aspiration varied with different levels of liquid thickness. We then assessed the clinical risk factors for penetration-aspiration in our patient group. Finally, we investigated the clinical risk factors for the development of aspiration pneumonia in patients with dysphagia despite adhering to advised dietary changes, including liquid thickening, based on VFSS-assessed swallowing functions.

### Gastrointestinal involvement in Parkinson's disease: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management [^112jj7Xj]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thirty years ago, gastrointestinal tract (GIT) symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) played a subordinate role in clinical practice of most neurologists and movement disorders specialists, despite the existence of numerous very early clinical reports and neuropathological findings that clearly provided evidence of relevant GIT involvement –. Although GIT dysfunction can precede somatomotor symptoms by up to 20 years – and impact negatively on quality of life, clinicians mainly focused on the 'classical' motor symptomatology at that time. It was not until the late 1980s and early 1990s that the number of clinical studies and neuropathology publications about the complex interaction of PD and the GIT begin to increase, thereby, also stimulating the interest of clinical neurologists for this topic –. After 2000, the quest for explanations regarding the potential role of the GIT and the peripheral nervous system in the pathogenesis of PD gained momentum owing to the work by the Braak group, among others –. Thus, one finds in PubMed for the period 1960–1969 eleven (keywords 'Parkinson' and 'dysphagia') and four (keywords 'Parkinson' and 'constipation') publications, from 1970 to 1979 twenty ('Parkinson' and 'dysphagia') and seven ('Parkinson' and 'constipation') publications, as opposed to more than ten entries per year beginning in 1992 and 2003, and, alone for the year 2020, 109 articles ('Parkinson' and 'dysphagia') and 93 ('Parkinson' and 'constipation') (< and <).

Today, GIT research is a promising and still growing field of inquiry and continues to provide neurologists and movement disorders specialists with novel and valuable data that can help to better understand the complexity of PD. At this point, we still have a multitude of jigsaw puzzle pieces that must be carefully pieced together. Periodic review articles are intended to serve as the basis for future work. Here, we provide an overview of the latest knowledge, hypotheses, and debates about the pathology, pathophysiology, diagnostic methods for oropharyngeal and esophageal affection as well as impairment of the lower GIT, including a summary of current treatment strategies from an interdisciplinary standpoint. These might be helpful for neurologists, speech- and language therapists, and other clinicians in their daily work with PD patients and PD-associated GIT dysfunction.
