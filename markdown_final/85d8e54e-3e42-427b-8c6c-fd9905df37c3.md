## Question

Which antihypertensive medication is best to reduce diastolic blood pressure?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antihypertensive medication is best for reducing diastolic blood pressure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether any single drug class is superior for diastolic lowering versus systolic lowering. Then, I should verify what high-quality evidence says about class-specific effects on diastolic blood pressure. Next, I will review guideline positions on drug choice and whether they prioritize diastolic effects. After that, I need to check for any exceptions where a class might have a relatively greater diastolic effect. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded answer with dosing and monitoring considerations, and confirm safety thresholds for diastolic targets.

> Let me first confirm the core principle: across major classes, blood pressure lowering drives cardiovascular benefit, and the magnitude of benefit tracks the achieved reduction in systolic and diastolic pressure rather than the specific drug class, so there is no universally "best" class for diastolic lowering per se [^114afJ9F] [^112MMytN] [^115V4yM2].

> Wait, let me verify whether any class meaningfully outperforms others for diastolic reduction in head-to-head comparisons. The best available syntheses indicate broadly similar diastolic effects across thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and calcium channel blockers, with small within-class and dose-related differences rather than a consistent diastolic-specific winner [^113JHSek].

> Hold on, I should review the one potential exception: beta-blockers. Nonselective beta-blockers lower diastolic pressure by about 6–7 mmHg versus placebo, and when added as second-line therapy to thiazides or CCBs, they reduce diastolic pressure by roughly 4–6 mmHg depending on dose, suggesting a relatively favorable diastolic effect compared with some other classes in certain contexts, though this does not translate into superior cardiovascular outcomes in older adults or as first-line therapy [^1133KeKG] [^1127jEBr] [^1165h7n3] [^115FQHjS].

> I need to ensure I'm aligning with guidelines before drawing a conclusion. Contemporary guidelines emphasize that the choice of initial agent should be driven by comorbidity, race/ethnicity, tolerability, and patient preference, not by a putative diastolic-specific advantage; they recommend thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or dihydropyridine CCBs as first-line options, and prioritize blood pressure lowering over class selection because outcome benefits derive from the achieved BP reduction rather than the class itself [^113u9ZD3] [^115CjvEw] [^115V4yM2].

> Let me consider practical implications for isolated diastolic hypertension. I should confirm that guidelines treat isolated diastolic hypertension the same as general hypertension: initiate lifestyle measures and, if needed, pharmacotherapy with a first-line class tailored to comorbidities and risk, recognizing that most patients will require more than one drug to reach targets and that diastolic lowering is achieved through the same mechanisms and classes used for systolic control [^114PU99X].

> Next, I should review dosing and titration dynamics to set expectations for diastolic response. Standard-dose monotherapy typically lowers systolic pressure by about 8–10 mmHg and diastolic by about 5–7 mmHg, with dose doubling adding roughly 1–2 mmHg more reduction; most of the initial effect emerges within 1–2 weeks, so early titration is reasonable if tolerated, while avoiding excessive diastolic lowering [^1133UAxf] [^113JHSek].

> I will now examine diastolic targets and safety thresholds. For most adults, achieving a diastolic pressure below 80 mmHg is reasonable, but I should double-check evidence suggesting harm when diastolic falls below about 60 mmHg in treated patients with systolic already controlled, which cautions against overly aggressive diastolic lowering in high-risk populations [^11521VcP] [^111Zed9e].

> But wait, what if the clinical scenario is an older adult with wide pulse pressure and relatively isolated systolic elevation? Does that change the diastolic strategy? In that case, I should confirm that guidelines still endorse careful BP lowering with attention to symptoms and orthostatic tolerance, and that the choice of agent remains risk- and comorbidity-driven rather than diastolic-specific, with close monitoring for adverse effects as diastolic approaches lower ranges [^113u9ZD3] [^115CjvEw].

> Putting this together, I should conclude that there is no single "best" antihypertensive medication uniquely superior for reducing diastolic blood pressure. Thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and dihydropyridine CCBs are all appropriate first-line choices, and beta-blockers can be considered when there is a compelling indication or as part of combination therapy, recognizing their relatively favorable diastolic effect as add-on therapy in some settings, while prioritizing the patient's comorbidities, tolerability, and the need to achieve evidence-based BP targets safely [^113u9ZD3] [^1133UAxf] [^1127jEBr] [^115V4yM2].

There is **no single best antihypertensive** for lowering diastolic blood pressure (DBP) because all major classes reduce DBP by similar magnitudes [^113JHSek]. The choice should be **individualized** based on comorbidities, age, race, and tolerance [^115CjvEw]. Thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs are all appropriate first-line options [^113u9ZD3]; beta-blockers are less favored for initial therapy but can be used when indicated [^1124e2kh]. Combination therapy is often needed to reach DBP targets, and **lifestyle measures** (especially sodium restriction) enhance DBP lowering across drug classes [^111kNc8j] [^113Sgfei].

---

## Comparative efficacy of antihypertensive classes in lowering DBP

Multiple meta-analyses and guidelines show that the main classes — thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), ACE inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and beta-blockers — **lower DBP by similar amounts** (about 6–10 mmHg with standard-dose monotherapy) [^1133UAxf]. Within-class differences are modest and generally not clinically decisive [^notfound].

| **Drug class** | **Typical DBP reduction (mmHg)** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Thiazide diuretics | 6–10 | - Effective first-line therapy [^113u9ZD3] <br/> - Particularly beneficial in older adults and Black patients [^115CjvEw] |
| Calcium channel blockers | 6–10 | - Effective first-line therapy [^113u9ZD3] <br/> - Preferred in older adults and Black patients [^115CjvEw] |
| ACE inhibitors | 6–10 | - Effective first-line therapy [^113u9ZD3] <br/> - Preferred in patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or cardiovascular disease [^notfound] |
| ARBs | 6–10 | - Effective first-line therapy [^113u9ZD3] <br/> - Preferred in patients intolerant to ACE inhibitors [^notfound] |
| Beta-blockers | 6–8 | - Less favored as initial therapy [^1124e2kh] <br/> - Useful in patients with coronary artery disease, heart failure, or arrhythmias [^1124e2kh] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **individualized therapy** based on comorbidities, age, race, and patient tolerance [^1124e2kh]. There is no single "best" drug for DBP lowering; the choice should align with the patient's clinical profile and risk factors [^notfound].

- **Thiazide diuretics and CCBs**: Recommended as first-line therapy, particularly effective in older adults and Black patients [^115CjvEw].
- **ACE inhibitors and ARBs**: Preferred in patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or cardiovascular disease [^115CjvEw].
- **Beta-blockers**: Less favored as initial therapy but useful in patients with coronary artery disease, heart failure, or arrhythmias [^1124e2kh].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing drug choice

Several **patient-specific factors** should guide the selection of antihypertensive medication:

- **Age**: Older adults may benefit more from thiazide diuretics or CCBs [^notfound].
- **Race**: Black patients tend to respond better to thiazide diuretics and CCBs [^115CjvEw].
- **Comorbidities**: Diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease favor ACE inhibitors or ARBs [^notfound].
- **Tolerance**: Side effects and patient preferences significantly influence adherence and effectiveness [^114J7Li3].

---

## Role of combination therapy

Combination therapy is often **required** to achieve DBP targets, especially in patients with resistant hypertension. Combining two or more antihypertensive agents from different classes can provide additive or synergistic effects, enabling more effective DBP control [^111kNc8j].

---

## Lifestyle modifications and adjunctive therapies

Lifestyle modifications remain foundational in managing hypertension and can **significantly enhance** the effectiveness of antihypertensive medications [^117DKjSW]. Sodium restriction, weight loss, increased physical activity, and alcohol moderation are particularly effective in lowering DBP [^113Sgfei].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

There is **no single best antihypertensive medication** for lowering DBP; all major classes are similarly effective. The choice should be individualized based on patient-specific factors, comorbidities, and tolerance. Combination therapy and lifestyle modifications are often necessary to achieve optimal DBP control.

### Age-stratified and blood-pressure-stratified effects of blood-pressure-lowering pharmacotherapy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and death: an individual participant-level data meta-analysis [^113trU9a]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Increased blood pressure is a well known, modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and antihypertensive medications play an essential cardioprotective role. With ageing populations, one increasingly important uncertainty of the effects of blood-pressure-lowering pharmacotherapy is whether treatment should be initiated in, and continued into, older age (70 years and older), mainly when blood pressure is within the normal range.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, andcovering the period between Jan 1, 1966, and Sept 1, 2019, with no language restrictions, for randomised controlled trials investigating blood-pressure-lowering drug treatment. We searched MEDLINE using and expanding on the MeSH terms for "hypertension", "blood pressure", and "antihypertensive agents", including possible variations thereof as well as relevant antihypertensive drug classes. We identified several individual randomised controlled trials and meta-analyses with age-stratified effects of blood-pressure-lowering treatment but no reports with concurrent age and blood pressure stratification at the individual level. Additionally, evidence on treatment effects in individuals older than 85 years and with normal or mildly increased blood pressure was scarce.

Added value of this study

We gathered individual participant-level data from eligible large-scale trials of blood-pressure-lowering treatment. With access to individual participant-level data from 358 707 randomised participants from 51 trials (with 22 000 participants aged ≥ 80 years), this study enabled detailed investigation of age-stratified and blood-pressure-stratified effects on major cardiovascular events and death. We found pharmacological blood pressure reduction to be effective across a wide range of ages with no evidence that relative risk reductions for prevention of major cardiovascular events varied by baseline systolic or diastolic blood pressure levels, down to less than 120/70 mm Hg. Although we found evidence for diminishing relative risk reductions with increasing age and limited statistical power for detection of an effect in the oldest age group in isolation (90 years at the end of the study), absolute risk reductions did not follow the same pattern and appeared to be even larger in the older age groups. Stratified effects on all-cause death followed a similar pattern, with no evidence to suggest treatment increases mortality in any age group.

### Potential U.S. population impact of the 2017 ACC / AHA high blood pressure Guideline [^113nPZsi]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults provides recommendations for the definition of hypertension, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) thresholds for initiation of antihypertensive medication, and BP target goals.

Objectives

This study sought to determine the prevalence of hypertension, implications of recommendations for antihypertensive medication, and prevalence of BP above the treatment goal among U.S. adults using criteria from the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline and the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC7).

Methods

The authors analyzed data from the 2011 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (N = 9,623). BP was measured 3 times following a standardized protocol and averaged. Results were weighted to produce U.S. population estimates.

Results

According to the 2017 ACC/AHA and JNC7 guidelines, the crude prevalence of hypertension among U.S. adults was 45.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 43.6% to 47.6%) and 31.9% (95% CI: 30.1% to 33.7%), respectively, and antihypertensive medication was recommended for 36.2% (95% CI: 34.2% to 38.2%) and 34.3% (95% CI: 32.5% to 36.2%) of U.S. adults, respectively. Nonpharmacological intervention is advised for the 9.4% of U.S. adults with hypertension who are not recommended for antihypertensive medication according to the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline. Among U.S. adults taking antihypertensive medication, 53.4% (95% CI: 49.9% to 56.8%) and 39.0% (95% CI: 36.4% to 41.6%) had BP above the treatment goal according to the 2017 ACC/AHA and JNC7 guidelines, respectively.

Conclusions

Compared with the JNC7 guideline, the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline results in a substantial increase in the prevalence of hypertension, a small increase in the percentage of U.S. adults recommended for antihypertensive medication, and more intensive BP lowering for many adults taking antihypertensive medication.

### Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide [^116MEB3o]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (e.g., patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Limitation of Use

Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablet is not indicated for the initial therapy of hypertension [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

- Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablet is a combination tablet of amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (DHP CCB), valsartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), and hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic. Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes, and myocardial infarctions. (1)

Limitations of Use

Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablet is not indicated for initial treatment of hypertension.(1)

### Quinapril hydrochloride (Accupril) [^116JAr93]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension

ACCUPRIL is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which this drug principally belongs. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with ACCUPRIL.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

ACCUPRIL may be used alone or in combination with thiazide diuretics.

### Metoprolol tartrate [^1116W9PH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Hypertension

Metoprolol tartrate is indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adult patients, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including metoprolol.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits.

Metoprolol tartrate may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

1.2 Angina Pectoris

Metoprolol tartrate is indicated in the long-term treatment of angina pectoris, to reduce angina attacks and to improve exercise tolerance.

1.3 Myocardial Infarction

Metoprolol tartrate tablets are indicated in the treatment of hemodynamically stable patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction to reduce cardiovascular mortality when used alone or in conjunction with intravenous metoprolol.

### Debate on the 2025 guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in adults: emphasis on defense against the BP threshold and why we may not get there easily [^114J7Li3]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevated blood pressure (BP) is the most important noncommunicable disorder worldwide. Finding and effectively managing elevated BP is the single greatest public health benefit we can accomplish, as it will reduce premature death and enable patients to live longer free of the disabilities that target organ damage inflicts on the brain, heart, kidneys, and legs. Hypertension guidelines are an invaluable source of information on how to detect elevated BP, how to evaluate people for situations where hypertension is a symptom of other disorders, and how to apply the various treatments that lower BP effectively in patients. Determining the point at which treating high BP is more likely to result in benefit than harm is a marriage of science and art. There is no right answer to what clearly constitutes hypertension when using a systolic or diastolic BP to define it. The science shows the mathematics behind the reduction of BP and the number of lives saved and target organs preserved. The art comes into play when a decision is made that, when a systolic or diastolic BP exceeds a certain level, it becomes reasonable to intervene at that point with treatment. Caregivers play an important role in monitoring and educating patients with hypertension-especially in the detection of unintended effects of treatment, such as excessive BP lowering, symptomatic hypotension, and impacts on laboratory tests and well-being. Nonadherence to prescribed therapies is a barrier to effectively managing chronic disorders like hypertension. Having a solid foundation in the science behind the guidelines and recognizing that the application of guidelines requires some clinical judgment gleaned from balancing the risks and benefits of treatment in each individual patient, is the basis for healthy exchanges of ideas, like this pro and con series which discusses the science and furthers the art. This review has taken the con side of several issues in the latest American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2025 Hypertension Guidelines.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension — intensive blood pressure (BP) lowering and heart failure (HF) outcomes: In SPRINT, targeting an SBP < 120 mm Hg significantly reduced HF (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.45–0.84), whereas the SBP target recommended (< 130 mm Hg) is higher than SPRINT's target. In adults with diastolic hypertension (DBP ≥ 80 mm Hg) and high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, a strong body of evidence supports treatment with antihypertensive medications, and meta-analyses identify a beneficial effect of diastolic BP reduction on HF incidence.

### Trials to improve blood pressure through adherence to antihypertensives in stroke / TIA: systematic review and meta-analysis [^11536mRg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

The number of strokes and their impact on morbidity and mortality continue to increase globally because of population aging, and there is a clear opportunity for better preventive effort. Among those who survive a stroke or a transient ischemic attack (TIA), the risk of further stroke is high, ranging from 15% to 42% over 5 years. – Indeed, recurrent stroke accounts for up to 40% of all strokes.

Recurrent stroke is associated with higher mortality than first stroke, and functional recovery is often poorer, so secondary prevention matters. Lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 5 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by 2.5 mm Hg reduces the incidence of stroke by 15% to 20%, independent of prevalent vascular disease and hypertension.

However, blood pressure control after stroke is suboptimal, with up to 41% of patients having a SBP > 140 mm Hg. Blood pressure targets for secondary prevention have been recently lowered to 130/80 mm Hg, and some guidelinessuggest treating all patients with a previous stroke or TIA with antihypertensive medication regardless of blood pressure, unless contraindicated. Patient adherence to antihypertensive therapy is likely to be a major barrier to implementation of these guidelines.

In primary prevention, a range of interventions to improve adherence have been evaluated. Simplification of dosage regimen improved adherence to antihypertensive drugs although the effect on blood pressure is unclear. Where significant effects on blood pressure have been reported, notably in the Hypertension Detection and Follow‐Up study, an organized system of regular reviews was linked to medication intensification, and medication adherence was not measured. Evidence remains uncollated for people with stroke who may be particularly motivated but face special challenges in taking their medicines as prescribed. We performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials of interventions that included a component to improve adherence to antihypertensive drugs in adults with stroke/TIA to assess the impact of these interventions on blood pressure and adherence.

### Pharmacological blood pressure lowering for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease across different levels of blood pressure: an individual participant-level data meta-analysis [^114afJ9F]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Our study fills the aforementioned gaps in evidence and provides compelling evidence from randomised trials for the beneficial effects of blood pressure-lowering treatment across the spectrum of systolic blood pressure in people with or without a known diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. Our findings do not substantiate concerns about a J-shaped association between blood pressure and cardiovascular outcomes in observational studies, and dismiss the suggestions that blood pressure-lowering treatment is only effective when blood pressure is above a certain threshold.

These findings have important implications for clinical practice. Currently, the approach to prescribing antihypertensives depends on an individual's previous history of cardiovascular disease and blood pressure value. Although guidelines vary on the degree of their emphasis on these two risk factors, they invariably modify recommendations based on them. For instance, New Zealand has largely abandoned the approach of treating hypertension and recommends screening adults for overall cardiovascular risk as the first stage towards clinical decision making. Nonetheless, in the second stage, those ranked to be at high risk of cardiovascular disease are additionally required to have a high blood pressure to qualify for antihypertensive treatment. Most other guidelines have an even stronger reliance on blood pressure, often with explicit criteria for diagnosis of hypertension in the first stage and then consideration of treatment at the second stage in a subset of hypertensive participants. For instance, in England, blood pressure-lowering treatment for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease is not considered as relevant when baseline systolic blood pressure is less than 140 mm Hg. Most guidelines also define a floor level for reducing blood pressure, assuming that lowering blood pressure below a common threshold would be ineffective or to have an uncertain or even detrimental effect.

Our study calls for a revision of these guidelines. The finding that a fixed and modest degree of blood pressure reduction is expected to lead to similar relative reductions in risk of cardiovascular events, regardless of current blood pressure or presence of ischaemic heart disease and stroke, calls for consideration of blood pressure-lowering treatment for any individual who has a sufficiently high absolute risk of cardiovascular disease. By considering antihypertensives as a tool for reducing cardiovascular risk, rather than simply reducing blood pressure, clinicians are no longer required to make decisions according to an arbitrary and confusing classification of hypertension. The need for and the burden of exact measurement of blood pressure is also reduced. This will not only simplify decision-making, management, and communication of treatment strategies with participants but, as shown in previous modelling studies, will also lead to more efficient care compared with alternative strategies that rely more heavily on absolute blood pressure values.

### First-line combination therapy versus first-line monotherapy for primary hypertension [^113i4TjW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment of hypertension. The recommendations are not based on evidence about clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful. The actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy is unknown.

Objectives

To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Hypertension Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2016, Issue 2), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) up to February 2016. We searched in clinical studies repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs in Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, double-blind trials with at least 12 months' follow-up in adults with primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, or 130/80 mmHg or higher if participants had diabetes), which compared combination of two first-line antihypertensive drug with monotherapy as initial treatment. Trials had to include at least 50 participants per group and report mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events or serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion, evaluated the risk of bias and entered the data. Primary outcomes were mortality, serious adverse events, cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to drug-related adverse effects, reaching blood pressure control (as defined in each trial) and blood pressure change from baseline. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. We summarized data on dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals.

Main Results

We found three studies in which a subgroup of participants met our inclusion criteria. None of the studies focused solely on people initiating antihypertensive treatment so we asked investigators for data for this subgroup (monotherapy: 335 participants; combination therapy: 233 participants). They included outpatients, and mostly European and white people. Two trials included only people with type 2 diabetes, whereas the other trial excluded people treated with diabetes, hypocholesterolaemia or cardiovascular drugs. The follow-up was 12 months in two trials and 36 months in one trial. Certainty of evidence was very low due to the serious imprecision, and for using a subgroup not defined in advance. Confidence intervals were extremely wide for all important outcomes and included both appreciable harm and benefit.

Authors' Conclusions

The numbers of included participants and, hence the number of events, were too small to draw any conclusion about the relative efficacy of monotherapy versus combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension. There is a need for large clinical trials that address the question and report clinically relevant endpoints.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Blood pressure intensity and diastolic hypertension — heart failure risk and targets are outlined as follows. Intensive systolic blood pressure (SBP) lowering in SPRINT, which "targeted an SBP < 120 mm Hg", "significantly reduced the incidence of HF… (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.45–0.84)", yet "the SBP target recommended (< 130 mm Hg) is higher than that used in SPRINT". For diastolic hypertension, "In adults with diastolic hypertension (DBP ≥ 80 mm Hg) and a high risk of CVD, a strong body of evidence supports treatment with antihypertensive medications", and meta-analyses "have identified a similar beneficial effect of DBP reduction on the incidence of HF".

### Enalapril maleate (epaned) [^1177VaVf]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

1.1 Hypertension

EPANED is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure in adults and children older than one month [see Pediatric Use (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14)].

Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including this drug.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in Black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

EPANED is effective alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents, especially thiazide-type diuretics. The blood pressure lowering effects of EPANED and thiazides are approximately additive.

1.2 Heart Failure

EPANED is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic heart failure, usually in combination with diuretics and digitalis. In these patients, EPANED increases survival and decreases the frequency of hospitalization.

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of nonselective β-blockers for primary hypertension [^1133KeKG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Beta-blockers are one of the classes of drugs frequently used to treat hypertension. Quantifying the blood pressure (BP) lowering effects of nonselective beta-blockers provides important information that aids clinical decision making.

Objectives

To quantify the dose-related effects of nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (beta-blockers) on systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) as compared with placebo in people with primary hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials up to October 2013.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel or cross-over trials. Studies had to contain a nonselective beta-blocker monotherapy arm with a fixed dose. Participants enrolled into the studies had to have primary hypertension at baseline. Duration of studies had to be between three and 12 weeks.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (GW and AL) independently confirmed the inclusion of studies and extracted the data.

Main Results

We included 25 RCTs that evaluated the BP lowering effects of seven nonselective beta-blockers in 1264 people with hypertension. Among the 25 RCTs, four were parallel studies and 21 were cross-over studies. Overall, nonselective beta-blockers lowered systolic BP and diastolic BP compared with placebo. Nonselective beta-blockers, in the recommended dose range, did not showed a convincing dose-response relationship by direct comparison. The once (1x) and twice (2x) starting dose subgroups contained the largest sample size. The estimate of BP lowering efficacy for nonselective beta-blockers by combining the 1x and 2x starting dose subgroup was -10 mmHg (95% CI -11 to -8) for systolic BP and -7 mmHg (95% CI -8 to -6) for diastolic BP (low-quality evidence). Nonselective beta-blockers starting at the 1x recommended starting doses lowered heart rate by 12 beats per minute (95% CI 10 to 13) (low-quality evidence). The dose-response relationship in heart rate was evident by both direct and indirect comparison. Due to imprecision, there was no clear evidence of an effect of nonselective beta-blockers on pulse pressure in any dose subgroups except for a small reduction with the 2x starting dose (-2.2 mmHg, 95% CI -3.7 to -0.7) (very low quality evidence). The point estimates in the 1x, four times (4x) and eight times (8x) starting dose subgroups were similar to the 2x starting dose subgroup. Therefore, it would appear that if nonselective beta-blockers do lower pulse pressure, the magnitude is likely to be about 2 mmHg. There were very limited data (two studies) on withdrawals due to adverse effects (risk ratio (RR) 0.84; 95% CI 0.38 to 1.82).

Authors' Conclusions

In people with mild-to-moderate hypertension, nonselective beta-blockers lowered peak BP by a mean of -10/-7 mmHg (systolic/diastolic) and reduced heart rate by 12 beats per minute. Propranolol and penbutolol were the two drugs that contributed to most of the data for nonselective beta-blockers. This estimate is likely exaggerated due to the presence of extreme outliers and other sources of bias. If we removed the extreme outliers from the analysis, the estimate for non-selective beta-blockers was lower (-8/-5 mmHg (systolic/diastolic)). Nonselective beta-blockers did not show a convincing graded dose-response in the recommended dose range for systolic BP and diastolic BP, while higher dose nonselective beta-blockers provided greater reduction of heart rate. Using higher dose nonselective beta-blockers might cause more side effects, such as bradycardia, without producing an additional BP lowering effect. The effect of nonselective beta-blockers on pulse pressure was likely small, at about 2 mmHg.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^115CjvEw]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately. Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes. Although this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of high BP and should meet the clinical needs of most patients, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115Nnm1n]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Risk-based thresholds for initiation of blood pressure (BP) treatment in adults — algorithm: If the patient has an average BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg, initiate antihypertensive medications to lower BP and reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk for primary or secondary prevention of CVD. If BP is below this level, in those with existing clinical CVD (coronary heart disease [CHD], stroke, heart failure [HF]), initiate antihypertensive medications to lower BP and reduce CVD risk if average systolic BP (SBP) ≥ 130 mm Hg or diastolic BP (DBP) ≥ 80 mm Hg for secondary prevention of CVD. If there is no existing CVD, but the patient has diabetes or chronic kidney disease (CKD), or has increased short-term risk defined as a 10-year PREVENT-CVD risk ≥ 7.5%, initiate antihypertensive medications to lower BP and reduce CVD risk if average SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 80 mm Hg for primary prevention of CVD. If none of these apply, initiate antihypertensive medications to lower BP if average SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 80 mm Hg after 3–6 months of lifestyle intervention. In older adults who may be frail or have a limited life expectancy, a clinician-patient assessment of potential benefits and harms of BP lowering should be pursued to align care with patient goals.

### Amlodipine besylate (Norvasc) [^111UepAZ]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

1.1 Hypertension

NORVASC®is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including NORVASC.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits.

### Antihypertensive drug effects on long-term blood pressure: an individual-level data meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials [^113q3WiE]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Current clinical practice guidelines typically recommend a gradual intensification of antihypertensive treatment over several weeks and monitoring of its response for the treated individual. However, there is no clear guidance as to the expected change in BP on initiating treatment. To gauge treatment response without a counterfactual or 'standard' to compare against is difficult because of the multitude of other causes of BP change. Estimates of longitudinal BP changes in our study may help mitigate exaggerated attributions of change in BP to treatment, while providing reassurance about achievable reductions in various groups of 'at-risk' individuals. Clinical guidelines also typically define specific BP targets that should be achieved for hypertension to be considered as 'controlled', although target levels set by different national guidelines vary. While setting a target has practical advantages, it assumes that it is achievable on full implementation of the guidelines. However, population BP follows a distribution, with mean systolic BP≈130 mm Hg in Western populations and over 60% by age ≥ 60 years have values > 140 mm Hg. Among the most intensive treatment strategies in the clinical outcome trials were able to achieve an average of 10–15 mm Hg systolic BP reductions within a few months to several years (eg, SPRINT achieved 15 mm Hg systolic BP reduction (online supplemental figure S5). With current evidence-based treatment recommendations, achieving a controlled BP for people with very high BP (eg, > 150 mm Hg systolic), would be difficult to attain with the trialled regimens of pharmacologic treatment. We do not imply that physiologically larger BP reductions are unachievable but rather intend to flag the limited evidence on pharmacological BP reductions of over 20 mm Hg in the long term. The achieved BP reduction estimated in our pooled analysis has implications not just for patients but also for healthcare providers whose performance will be assessed based on their patients achieving 'controlled' BP. Alternative monitoring strategies, such as the number of prescribed antihypertensivesfor an individual as opposed to using a single BP target for all, are needed. Some translational implications of this study are described further in the online supplemental file 1 – clinical perspectives.

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of β-blockers as second-line therapy for primary hypertension [^1127jEBr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Beta-blockers are one of the more commonly prescribed classes of anti-hypertensive drugs, both as first-line and second-line.

Objectives

To quantify the effect on systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate and withdrawals due to adverse effects of beta-blocker therapy when given as a second-line drug in adult patients with primary hypertension.

Search Strategy

CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966-Aug 2009), EMBASE (1988-Aug 2009) and bibliographic citations of articles and reviews were searched.

Selection Criteria

Double-blind, randomized controlled trials comparing a beta-blocker in combination with a drug from another class of anti-hypertensive drugs compared with that drug alone for a duration of 3 to 12 weeks in patients with primary hypertension were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently extracted the data and assessed trial quality of each included study.

Main Results

20 double-blind RCTs evaluated the BP lowering efficacy of beta-blockers as second-line drug in 3744 hypertensive patients (baseline BP of 158/102 mmHg; mean duration of 7 weeks). The BP reduction from adding a beta-blocker as the second drug was estimated by comparing the difference in BP reduction between the combination and monotherapy groups. A reduction in BP was seen with adding a beta-blocker to thiazide diuretics or calcium channel blockers at doses as low as 0.25 times the manufacturer's recommended starting dose. The BP lowering efficacy of beta-blockers as a second drug was 6/4 mmHg at 1 times the starting dose and 8/6 mmHg at 2 times the starting dose. Beta-blockers reduced heart rate by 10 beats/min at 1 to 2 times the starting dose. Beta-blockers did not statistically significantly increase withdrawals due to adverse effects but this was likely due to the lack of reporting of this outcome in 35% of the included RCTs.

Authors' Conclusions

Addition of a beta-blocker to diuretics or calcium-channel blockers reduces BP by 6/4mmHg at 1 times the starting dose and by 8/6 mmHg at 2 times the starting dose. When the blood pressure lowering effect of beta-blockers from this review was compared to that of thiazide diuretics from our previous review (Chen 2009), second-line beta-blockers reduce systolic BP to the same extent as second-line thiazide diuretics, but reduce diastolic BP to a greater degree. The different effect on diastolic BP means that beta-blockers have little or no effect on pulse pressure whereas thiazides cause a significant dose-related decrease in pulse pressure. This difference in the pattern of BP lowering with beta-blockers as compared to thiazides might be the explanation for the fact that beta-blockers appear to be less effective at reducing adverse cardiovascular outcomes than thiazide diuretics, particularly in older individuals.

Achieved net BP reduction by follow-up period

Figure 2 (additional details in online supplemental table S9) illustrates the varying estimates of the difference in BP between comparison groups at specific follow-up times. Consistent with the patterns of absolute BP levels, the estimated difference in BP achieved between the active and control groups tended to be lower in earlier than in later follow-up periods. For BP-lowering intensity trials, the difference in mean reductions in systolic and diastolic BP within 6 months from baseline were −4.2 (95% CI −4.4 to −4.0) mm Hg and −2.0 (95% CI −2.2 to −1.9) mm Hg, respectively, and over −10 mm Hg and −5 mm Hg reductions, respectively, based on measures taken at later follow-up periods. Similar patterns were seen for placebo-controlled trials (and BP difference trials, details shown in online supplemental figure S3), although this group achieved smaller magnitudes in mean BP reduction across all follow-up periods. Mean reductions were least for drug class comparison trials.

### Blood pressure targets in adults with hypertension [^1148paiZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the first update of this review first published in 2009. When treating elevated blood pressure, doctors usually try to achieve a blood pressure target. That target is the blood pressure value below which the optimal clinical benefit is supposedly obtained. "The lower the better" approach that guided the treatment of elevated blood pressure for many years was challenged during the last decade due to lack of evidence from randomised trials supporting that strategy. For that reason, the standard blood pressure target in clinical practice during the last years has been less than 140/90 mm Hg for the general population of patients with elevated blood pressure. However, new trials published in recent years have reintroduced the idea of trying to achieve lower blood pressure targets. Therefore, it is important to know whether the benefits outweigh harms when attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard target.

Objectives

The primary objective was to determine if lower blood pressure targets (any target less than or equal to 135/85 mm Hg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard blood pressure targets (less than or equal to 140/ 90 mm Hg) for the treatment of patients with chronic arterial hypertension. The secondary objectives were: to determine if there is a change in mean achieved systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP associated with "lower targets" as compared with "standard targets" in patients with chronic arterial hypertension; and to determine if there is a change in withdrawals due to adverse events with "lower targets" as compared with "standard targets", in patients with elevated blood pressure.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to May 2019: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2019, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing patients allocated to lower or to standard blood pressure targets (see above).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (JAA, VL) independently assessed the included trials and extracted data. Primary outcomes were total mortality; total serious adverse events; myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, end stage renal disease, and other serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were achieved mean SBP and DBP, withdrawals due to adverse effects, and mean number of antihypertensive drugs used. We assessed the risk of bias of each trial using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: This update includes 11 RCTs involving 38,688 participants with a mean follow-up of 3.7 years. This represents 7 new RCTs compared with the original version. At baseline the mean weighted age was 63.1 years and the mean weighted blood pressure was 155/91 mm Hg. Lower targets do not reduce total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.05; 11 trials, 38,688 participants; high-certainty evidence) and do not reduce total serious adverse events (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.08; 6 trials, 18,165 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). This means that the benefits of lower targets do not outweigh the harms as compared to standard blood pressure targets. Lower targets may reduce myocardial infarction (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.96; 6 trials, 18,938 participants, absolute risk reduction (ARR) 0.4%, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 250 over 3.7 years) and congestive heart failure (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.92; 5 trials, 15,859 participants, ARR 0.6%, NNTB 167 over 3.7 years) (low-certainty for both outcomes). Reduction in myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure was not reflected in total serious adverse events. This may be due to an increase in other serious adverse events (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.59; 6 trials. 18,938 participants, absolute risk increase (ARI) 3%, number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 33 over four years) (low-certainty evidence). Participants assigned to a "lower" target received one additional antihypertensive medication and achieved a significantly lower mean SBP (122.8 mm Hg versus 135.0 mm Hg, and a lower mean DBP (82.0 mm Hg versus 85.2 mm Hg, than those assigned to "standard target".

Authors' Conclusions

For the general population of persons with elevated blood pressure, the benefits of trying to achieve a lower blood pressure target rather than a standard target (≤ 140/90 mm Hg) do not outweigh the harms associated with that intervention. Further research is needed to see if some groups of patients would benefit or be harmed by lower targets. The results of this review are primarily applicable to older people with moderate to high cardiovascular risk. They may not be applicable to other populations.

### Antihypertensive drug effects on long-term blood pressure: an individual-level data meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials [^115SPTjv]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clinical guidelines for managing hypertension have invariably lowered the recommended blood pressure (BP) targets for patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease, informed by evidence from large-scale randomised clinical trials (RCTs) and their meta-analyses showing substantial reductions in cardiovascular risk with more intensive BP-lowering treatment and independently of baseline BP values. For most hypertensive patients, the lowered BP targets inevitably lead to a larger gap between their usual BP and the recommended target value, requiring more intensive pharmacological treatment.

Attributing changes to treatment based on repeated measures of BP of an individual patient can be unreliable since measurements are subject to random fluctuations, regression to the mean, non-pharmacological effects and other sources of variability that can exceed true variability in treatment response. However, it would be useful to have reliable information about the expected effects of drug treatment on BP levels over time from randomised comparisons to help interpret BP readings such as those obtained during clinical encounters. To date, randomised evidence on the effect of antihypertensive drugs on BP has come from efficacy trials with small numbers of highly selected participants and short follow-up durations. Pooled evidence from RCTs using information from individual participants' repeated BP measurements currently does not exist, which might explain why there is no guidance on the expected magnitudes of BP reduction with the various proposed treatment strategies and whether these reductions are expected to vary among people with different characteristics.

We addressed this evidence gap by using information from 52 trials involving 363 684 participants with individual-level data on repeated BP measurements over several yearsto conduct a meta-analysis to quantify the unconfounded effects of BP-lowering drugs on BP over time and examine these effects across different subgroups.

### Blood pressure and the new ACC / AHA hypertension guidelines [^115GPRbD]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The ACC/AHA hypertension guidelines cover virtually all aspects of the diagnosis, evaluation, monitoring, secondary causes as well as drug and non-drug treatment of hypertension. Substantial and appropriate emphasis has been given to the strategies necessary for accurate measurement of blood pressure in any setting where valid blood pressure measurements are desired. Most "errors" made during blood pressure measurement bias readings upwards resulting in over-diagnosis of hypertension and, amongst those already on drug therapy, underestimating the true magnitude of blood pressure lowering resulting in over-treatment. Hypertension is diagnosed when blood pressure is consistently ≥ 130 and/or ≥ 80 mm Hg. However, the majority of patients with hypertension between 130–139/80–89 mm Hg (stage 1 hypertension) do not qualify for immediate drug therapy. The guideline breaks new ground with some of its recommendations. Absolute cardiovascular risk is utilized, for the first time, to determine high-risk status when BP 130–139/80–89 mm Hg (Stage 1 hypertension) and high-risk patient characteristics/co-morbidities are absent including age 65 and older, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, known cardiovascular disease; high-risk individuals initiate drug therapy when BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg. The exception amongst high-risk individuals is for secondary stroke prevention in drug naïve individuals as drug therapy is initiated when blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mm Hg. Non-high risk individuals will initiate drug therapy when BP is ≥ 140/90 mm Hg. Irrespective of blood pressure threshold for initiation of drug therapy, the target BP is minimally < 130/80 mm Hg in most. However, target BP is < 130 systolic amongst those 65 and older as the committee made no recommendation for a DBP target. Treatment should be initiated with two drugs having complementary mechanisms of action when blood pressure is > 20/10 mm Hg above goal.

Antihypertensive Drug Treatment Strategy

As outlined in Tables 6–8, both guidelines recommend use of agents from the following 4 drug classes: diuretics, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in adults with no compelling indication for selection of a specific BP-lowering medication.

The ACC/AHA indicates a preference for the longer-acting thiazide-type diuretic chlorthalidone compared with other diuretic agents because chlorthalidone was the diuretic used in many of the landmark event–based randomized clinical trials. Both guidelines advise combination therapy in most adults with hypertension (usually, an initial combination of ACE inhibitors or ARB, a diuretic, and/or a CCB). The ACC/AHA specifically recommends combination therapy for Black patients and for adults with more severe hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg and an average SBP/DBP > 20/10 mm Hg above their target BP). In addition, the ACC/AHA guideline recommends that initial antihypertensive drug therapy in Black patients should include a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB. The ESC/ESH guideline also recommends that initial treatment in most Black patients should be with a 2-drug combination, comprising a diuretic and CCB, either in combination with each other or with an ACE inhibitor or ARB. The ACC/AHA notes that single-pill combinations improve treatment adherence but may contain lower-than-optimal doses of the thiazide diuretic component. The ESC/ESH recommends a core drug combination treatment strategy for most patients including patients with uncomplicated hypertension, patients with HMOD, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, or peripheral artery disease. This strategy comprises initial dual combination therapy (ACE inhibitors or ARB and CCB or diuretic), preferably in a single-pill combination, followed, if still above target BP, by triple therapy (ACE inhibitors or ARB, CCB and diuretic) using a single-pill combination, followed if still above the target by the addition of spironolactone or other diuretic, α-blocker, or β-blocker and consideration of referral to a specialist center. Both guidelines recommend against simultaneous use of ACE inhibitors and ARB. Likewise, both guidelines provide specific advice on choice of BP-lowering medications in adults with hypertension and various comorbidities/conditions, and in special patient groups, as well. In the ESC/ESH guidelines, β-blockers are considered to be first-line antihypertensive drugs in patients with a specific indication for their use, because, in comparison with other BP-lowering drugs, β-blockers are usually equivalent in preventing major cardiovascular events with the exception of less efficacy for stroke prevention. Therefore, their use is primarily recommended in specific (most importantly cardiac) indications and in pregnant women or women planning pregnancy.

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: a World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^116K17V8]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a major cause of cardiovascular disease and deaths worldwide especially in low- and middle-income countries. Despite the availability of safe, well-tolerated, and cost-effective blood pressure (BP)-lowering therapies, < 14% of adults with hypertension have BP controlled to a systolic/diastolic BP < 140/90 mmHg. We report new hypertension treatment guidelines, developed in accordance with the World Health Organization Handbook for Guideline Development. Overviews of reviews of the evidence were conducted and summary tables were developed according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach. In these guidelines, the World Health Organization provides the most current and relevant evidence-based guidance for the pharmacological treatment of nonpregnant adults with hypertension. The recommendations pertain to adults with an accurate diagnosis of hypertension who have already received lifestyle modification counseling. The guidelines recommend BP threshold to initiate pharmacological therapy, BP treatment targets, intervals for follow-up visits, and best use of health care workers in the management of hypertension. The guidelines provide guidance for choice of monotherapy or dual therapy, treatment with single pill combination medications, and use of treatment algorithms for hypertension management. Strength of the recommendations was guided by the quality of the underlying evidence; the tradeoffs between desirable and undesirable effects; patient's values, resource considerations and cost-effectiveness; health equity; acceptability, and feasibility consideration of different treatment options. The goal of the guideline is to facilitate standard approaches to pharmacological treatment and management of hypertension which, if widely implemented, will increase the hypertension control rate world-wide.

### Higher blood pressure targets for hypertension in older adults [^114EkVCh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an update of the original Cochrane review, published in 2017. Eight out of 10 major antihypertensive trials in adults, 65 years of age or older, attempted to achieve a target systolic blood pressure (BP) of < 160 mmHg. Collectively, these trials demonstrated cardiovascular benefit for treatment, compared to no treatment, for older adults with BP > 160 mmHg. However, an even lower BP target of < 140 mmHg is commonly applied to all age groups. Yet the risk and benefit of antihypertensive therapy can be expected to vary across populations, and some observational evidence suggests that older adults who are frail might have better health outcomes with less aggressive BP lowering. Current clinical practice guidelines are inconsistent in target BP recommendations for older adults, with systolic BP targets ranging from < 130 mmHg to < 150 mmHg. The 2017 review did not find compelling evidence of a reduction in any of the primary outcomes, including all-cause mortality, stroke, or total serious cardiovascular adverse events, comparing a lower BP target to a higher BP target in older adults with hypertension. It is important to update this review to explore if new evidence exists to determine whether older adults might do just as well, better, or worse with less aggressive pharmacotherapy for hypertension.

Objectives

To assess the effects of a less aggressive blood pressure target (in the range of < 150 to 160/95 to 105 mmHg), compared to a conventional or more aggressive BP target (of < 140/90 mmHg or lower) in hypertensive adults, 65 years of age or older.

Search Methods

For this update, Cochrane Hypertension's Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to June 2024: Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, and Embase Ovid, and the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials. We also contacted authors of relevant papers requesting information on further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials of hypertensive older adults (≥ 65 years) that spanned at least one year, and reported the effect on mortality and morbidity of a higher or lower systolic or diastolic BP treatment target. Higher BP targets ranged from systolic BP < 150 to 160 mmHg or diastolic BP < 95 to 105 mmHg; lower BP targets were 140/90 mmHg or lower, measured in an ambulatory, home, or office setting.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened and selected trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and certainty of the evidence, and extracted data. We combined data for dichotomous outcomes using the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous outcomes, we used mean difference (MD). Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, institutionalisation, and serious cardio-renal vascular adverse events. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular mortality, non-cardiovascular mortality, unplanned hospitalisation, each component of cardiovascular serious adverse events separately (including cerebrovascular disease, cardiac disease, vascular disease, and renal failure), total serious adverse events, total minor adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse effects, systolic BP achieved, and diastolic BP achieved.

Main Results

With the addition of one new trial, we included four trials in this updated review (16,732 older adults with a mean age of 70.3 years). Of these, one trial used a combined systolic and diastolic BP target and compared a higher target of < 150/90 mmHg to a lower target of < 140/90 mmHg, and two trials utilised a purely systolic BP target, and compared a systolic BP < 150 mmHg (1 trial) and a systolic BP < 160 mmHg (1 trial), to a systolic BP < 140 mmHg. The fourth and newest trial also utilised a systolic BP target, but also introduced a lower limit for systolic BP. It compared systolic BP in the target range of 130 to 150 mmHg to a lower target range of 110 to 130 mmHg. The evidence shows that treatment to the lower BP target over two to four years may result in little to no difference in all-cause mortality (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.37; 4 studies, 16,732 participants; low-certainty evidence), but the lower BP target does reduce stroke (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.67; 4 studies, 16,732 participants; high-certainty evidence), and likely reduces total serious cardiovascular adverse events (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.45; 4 studies, 16,732 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Adverse effects were not available from all trials, but the lower BP target likely does not increase withdrawals due to adverse effects (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.33; 3 studies, 16,008 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

When comparing a higher BP target, in the range of < 150 to 160/95 to 105 mmHg, to a lower BP target of 140/90 or lower, over two to four years of follow-up, there is high-certainty evidence that the lower BP target reduces stroke, and moderate-certainty evidence that the lower BP target likely reduces serious cardiovascular events. The effect on all-cause mortality is unclear (low-certainty evidence), and the lower BP target likely does not increase withdrawals due to adverse effects (moderate-certainty evidence). Although additional research is warranted in those who are 80 years of age and older, and those who are frail (in whom risks and benefits may differ), conventional BP targets may be appropriate for the majority of older adults.

### The effects of blood pressure reduction and of different blood pressure-lowering regimens on major cardiovascular events according to baseline blood pressure: meta-analysis of randomized trials [^1145QTQV]. Journal of Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The benefits of reducing blood pressure are well established, but there remains uncertainty about whether the magnitude of the effect varies with the initial blood pressure level. The objective was to compare the risk reductions achieved by different blood pressure-lowering regimens among individuals with different baseline blood pressures.

Methods

Thirty-two randomized controlled trials were included and seven comparisons between different types of treatments were made. For each comparison, the primary prespecified analysis included calculation of summary estimates of effect using random-effects meta-analysis for major cardiovascular events in four groups defined by baseline SBP (< 140, 140–159, 160–179, and ≥ 180 mmHg).

Results

There were 201 566 participants among whom 20 079 primary outcome events were observed. There was no evidence of differences in the proportionate risk reductions achieved with different blood pressure-lowering regimens across groups defined according to higher or lower levels of baseline SBP (all P for trend > 0.17). This finding was broadly consistent for comparisons of different regimens, for DBP categories, and for commonly used blood pressure cut-points.

Conclusion

It appears unlikely that the effectiveness of blood pressure-lowering treatments depends substantively upon starting blood pressure level. As the majority of patients in the trials contributing to these overviews had a history of hypertension or were receiving background blood pressure-lowering therapy, the findings suggest that additional blood pressure reduction in hypertensive patients meeting initial blood pressure targets will produce further benefits. More broadly, the data are supportive of the utilization of blood pressure-lowering regimens in high-risk patients with and without hypertension.

### Blood pressure-lowering efficacy of antihypertensive drugs and their combinations: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials [^1133UAxf]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

We aimed to quantify the blood pressure-lowering efficacy of antihypertensive drugs and their combinations from the five major drug classes.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials involving adult participants randomly assigned to receive angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, β blockers, calcium channel blockers, or diuretics. Eligibility criteria included follow-up duration between 4 weeks and 26 weeks, antihypertensive drug treatment fixed in all participants for at least 4 weeks before follow-up blood pressure assessment; and availability of clinic blood pressure for the calculation of mean difference in systolic blood pressure between treatment groups. Crossover trials with less than 2 weeks' washout between the crossover periods were excluded. Eligible studies published between database inception and Dec 31, 2022 were identified from searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and Epistemonikos; searches were updated to include studies published between Jan 1, 2023, and Feb 28, 2025. The primary outcome was placebo-corrected reduction in systolic blood pressure. Blood pressure-lowering efficacy was estimated using fixed-effects meta-analyses standardised to mean baseline blood pressure across included trials. Drug regimens were categorised into low, moderate, and high intensity, corresponding to systolic blood pressure-lowering efficacy of < 10 mm Hg, 10–19 mm Hg, and ≥ 20 mm Hg, respectively, from a baseline of 154 mm Hg. A model was developed to calculate efficacy for any combination of antihypertensives and validated on external trials of dual and triple combination antihypertensives. The study protocol was registered on the International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (INPLASY202410036).

Findings

We analysed 484 trials including 104176 participants (mean age 54 years [SD 8], 57422 [55%] men, 46754 [45%] women, and mean baseline systolic blood pressure 154/100 mm Hg). Mean follow-up duration was 8·6 weeks (SD 5·2). On average, monotherapy at standard dose reduced systolic blood pressure by 8·7 mm Hg (95% CI 8·2–9·2), and each doubling in dose conferred an additional 1·5 mm Hg (1·2–1·7) reduction. Dual combinations at one standard dose conferred a 14·9 mm Hg (95% CI 13·1–16·8) reduction in systolic blood pressure, with each doubling of doses of both drugs conferring an additional reduction of 2·5 mm Hg (1·4–3·7). Each 10 mm Hg decrease in baseline systolic blood pressure reduced pressure-lowering efficacy by 1·3 mm Hg (1·0–1·5) for monotherapies, although differences between drug classes were observed. Among 57 monotherapies at standard dose, 45 (79%) were classified as low intensity. Of 189 different drug-dose dual combinations, 110 (58%) were classified as moderate intensity, and 21 (11%) as high intensity. There were considerable differences in dose-response and baseline blood pressure-response relationships between and within drug classes. The efficacy model showed a high correlation between predicted and observed systolic blood pressures when validated on external trials (r = 0·76, p < 0·0001).

Interpretation

These analyses provide robust estimates of the expected blood pressure-lowering effect for any combination of antihypertensive drugs, allowing their efficacy to be classified into low, moderate, and high intensity.

### Blood pressure-lowering effects of statins: who benefits? [^115h8YWD]. Journal of Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate if the effect of statins on blood pressure is similar in patients grouped by use of antihypertensive medication, level of blood pressure, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C).

Methods

Blood pressure was compared in statins users (n = 995) and nonusers (n = 9536) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. The overall effect of statins and their interactions with antihypertensive medication, blood pressure, and HDL-C were estimated using multiple linear and quantile regression.

Results

Adjusted systolic blood pressure was on average 1.8 mmHg lower in statins users than in nonusers (P = 0.05). Although statins had no significant effect among nonusers, it decreased systolic blood pressure by 3.3 mmHg among users of antihypertensive medication (interaction P = 0.02). The effect of statins on systolic blood pressure was similar in individuals with HDL-C levels above and below the median (49 mg/dl). Statins also lowered diastolic blood pressure by an average of 1.9 mmHg (P < 0.01), regardless of antihypertensive medication use. Among individuals with high HDL-C statins did not lower diastolic blood pressure, whereas in those with low HDL-C diastolic blood pressure was reduced by 3.4 mmHg. The effect of statins on systolic and diastolic blood pressure increased with higher blood pressure and changed little with adjustment for total cholesterol.

Conclusion

Statins lower blood pressure by cholesterol-independent mechanisms, and the reduction is larger in individuals with higher blood pressure and those with low HDL-C. Statins may be beneficial in preventing hypertension and may contribute to better blood pressure control in hypertensive patients.

### Aliskiren [^114E4ZpV]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Aliskiren tablets are a renin inhibitor (RI) indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adults and in pediatric patients weighing 50 kg or greater who are at least 6 years of age, to lower blood pressure.

Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions.

1.1 Hypertension

Aliskiren tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adults and in pediatric patients weighing 50 kg or greater who are at least 6 years of age and older to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with aliskiren tablets.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality have also been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (e.g., patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

### Pharmacotherapy for hypertension in adults 60 years or older [^1158JMbp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

This is the third update of a review that was originally published in 1998 and updated in 2009 and 2019. Hypertension increases with age, most rapidly over age 60. It is important to know the benefits and harms of antihypertensive treatment for hypertension in this age group, as well as separately for people 60 to 79 years old and for people 80 years or older.

Objectives

Primary objective
- To assess the effects of antihypertensive drug treatment as compared with placebo or no treatment on all-cause mortality for people 60 years and older with hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) > 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > 90 mmHg, or both. Secondary objectives
- To assess the effects of antihypertensive drug treatment as compared with placebo or no treatment on cardiovascular-specific morbidity and mortality in people 60 years and older with hypertension defined as SBP > 140 mmHg or DBP > 90 mmHg, or both.
- To assess the rate of withdrawal due to adverse effects of antihypertensive drug treatment as compared with placebo or no treatment in people 60 years and older with hypertension defined as SBP > 140 mmHg or DBP > 90 mmHg, or both.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) up to June 2024: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, WHO ICTRP, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted the authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Eligibility Criteria

RCTs of at least one year's duration comparing antihypertensive drug therapy versus placebo or no treatment and providing morbidity and mortality data for people 60 years and older with hypertension defined as blood pressure greater than 140/90 mmHg.

Outcomes

Outcomes assessed were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality, coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality, and withdrawal due to adverse effects.

Risk Of Bias

Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias in the included studies using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool.

Synthesis Methods

We used RevMan for data synthesis and analyses. We based quantitative analyses of outcomes on intention-to-treat results. We used risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to combine outcomes across trials using a fixed-effect model.

Included Studies

This update identified no new trials and no ongoing trials. Overall, 16 trials (N = 26,795) in healthy ambulatory adults 60 years or older (mean age 73.8 years) with moderate to severe systolic and/or diastolic hypertension (average 182/95 mmHg) met the inclusion criteria. Most of these trials evaluated first-line thiazide diuretic therapy for a mean treatment duration of 3.8 years.

Synthesis Of Results

Antihypertensive drug treatment reduced all-cause mortality (10% with treatment versus 11% with control; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.97; 13 studies, 25,932 participants; high-certainty evidence); probably reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (10% with treatment versus 14% with control; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.77; 15 studies, 26,747 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); probably reduced cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity (3.4% with treatment versus 5.2% with control; RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.74; 13 studies, 26,042 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); and probably reduced coronary heart disease mortality and morbidity (3.7% with treatment versus 4.8% with control; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.88; 11 studies, 24,559 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Withdrawals due to adverse effects may have increased with treatment (16% with treatment versus 5.4% with control; RR 2.91, 95% CI 2.56 to 3.30; 4 studies, 11,310 participants; low-certainty evidence). In a sensitivity analysis of the three trials restricted to people with isolated systolic hypertension, reported benefits were similar. We cannot rule out that the observed reduction in all-cause mortality was due mostly to a reduction in the 60- to 79-year-old participant subgroup compared with those 80 years or older. The RR for all-cause mortality in those 60 to 79 years old was 0.86 (95% CI 0.79 to 0.95; 9 studies, 19,017 participants) compared with 0.97 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.10; 8 studies, 6701 participants) in the 80 years or older subgroup, though the test for subgroup difference showed no evidence of a difference. The reduction in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity was due in large part to a reduction in cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity. The most common reason for downgrading the certainty of evidence was risk of bias, in particular incomplete outcome data and selective outcome reporting.

Authors' Conclusions

Treating healthy adults 60 years or older with moderate to severe systolic or diastolic hypertension, or both, with antihypertensive drug therapy reduced all-cause mortality and probably reduced cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity, and coronary heart disease mortality and morbidity. Most of the evidence pertains to a primary prevention population using a thiazide as first-line treatment. Given that no new or ongoing trials were identified in this update, the certainty of existing evidence is moderate or high, and we do not expect new trials in the future, this review is considered stable and will no longer be updated.

### The impact of JNC-VI guidelines on treatment recommendations in the US population [^115XhywC]. Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Using epidemiological and clinical trial evidence, the sixth report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-VI) updated previous guidelines to suggest that in addition to blood pressure, decisions on initial treatment should emphasize absolute cardiovascular disease risk. We estimated the impact of using cardiovascular disease risk on treatment recommendations for the US population using data from 16 527 participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. In the US population ≥ 20 years of age, 36% (62 million) had high-normal blood pressure or greater (systolic/diastolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mm Hg/ ≥ 85 mm Hg) or were taking antihypertensive medication. Of this population, 5.1% (3.2 million) were stratified into risk group A (no cardiovascular disease risk factors or prevalent cardiovascular disease), 66.3% (41.4 million) into risk group B (≥ 1 major risk factor), and 28.6% (17.9 million) into risk group C (diabetes mellitus, clinical cardiovascular disease, target organ damage). Also, 26% of this group (16.2 million) had high-normal blood pressure and were in risk groups A or B, a context in which vigorous lifestyle modification is recommended in the JNC-VI guidelines. Additionally, 11% (7.0 million) had high-normal blood pressure (systolic/diastolic, 130 to 139 mm Hg/85 to 89 mm Hg, respectively) or stage-1 hypertension (140 to 159 mm Hg/90 to 99 mm Hg), and at least 1 factor, placing them in risk group C, but they were not currently on antihypertensive medication. JNC-VI, but not previous JNC guidelines, specifically recommends drug therapy as initial treatment for these patients. We conclude that JNC-VI refines cardiovascular risk and enfranchises more Americans to undertake more aggressive risk reduction maneuvers.

### Cardiovascular risk in patients with treated isolated diastolic hypertension and isolated low diastolic blood pressure [^115E4bpW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Hypertension affects around 30% of adults globallyand is associated with an increased cardiovascular risk.SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) revealed that intensive treatment targeting systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 120 mm Hg was superior to standard treatment targeting SBP < 140 mm Hg in reducing cardiovascular events by 25% and all‐cause death by 27%. Consequently, the 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guideline revised the blood pressure (BP) treatment target to < 130/80 mm Hg.

For the patients on antihypertensive treatment, while the association between high SBP and cardiovascular risk is well established, the potential harms posed by elevated diastolic BP (DBP) is still debated, especially when SBP achieves the target. This condition is known as treated isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH). Most studies examining the ACC/AHA definition of IDH have not found its correlation with cardiovascular disease, except in Asian populations and young adults. The focus of these studies was primarily on treatment‐naive individuals, leaving this correlation for antihypertensive drug–treated patients uncertain. Additionally, concerns also exist regarding the potential negative impact of excessive reduction of DBP, which could offset the cardiovascular benefits of reducing SBP.

The 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guideline recommended a DBP target range of 70 to 80 mm Hg for all risk levels, while the ACC/AHA guideline did not specify a lower limit of DBP for antihypertensive drug–treated patients. However, these recommendations were primarily based on expert opinion rather than empirical evidence. It remains unknown whether high or extremely low DBP is associated with increased cardiovascular risk in antihypertensive drug–treated patients with normalized SBP.

To answer this question, we conducted a secondary analysis of SPRINT to determine if treated IDH and treated isolated low DBP (ILDBP) were associated with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in patients with on‐treatment SBP < 130 mm Hg.

### Telmisartan (Micardis) [^112RJRUs]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Hypertension

MICARDIS is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which this drug principally belongs.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

MICARDIS may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension [^116nKqcH]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to choice of antihypertensives, initial therapy, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate combination BP-lowering treatment in most patients with confirmed HTN (BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg) as initial therapy. Prefer combining a renin-angiotensin system blocker (either an ACEi or an ARB) with a dihydropyridine CCB or diuretic. Avoid initiating combination treatment in patients aged ≥ 85 years, and patients with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, moderate-to-severe frailty, or elevated BP (SBP 120–139 mmHg or DBP 70–89 mmHg) with a concomitant indication for treatment.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

HEMICLOR is a thiazide-like diuretic indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adults, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions (1.1).

1.1 Hypertension

HEMICLOR is indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adults, to lower blood pressure.

Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which this drug principally belongs.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic blood pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

HEMICLOR may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensives.

### Management of stage 1 hypertension in adults with a low 10-year risk for cardiovascular disease: filling a guidance gap: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^114jixjA]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

High blood pressure (BP) is the leading cause of worldwide cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Patients and clinicians dealing with hypertension have benefited from the evidence of event-based randomized controlled clinical trials. One result from those trials has been the development of evidence-based guidelines. The commitment to using evidence from these event-based randomized trials has been a cornerstone in the development of guideline treatment recommendations. However, in some situations, evidence from event-based trials is not available to guideline writers or clinicians for assistance in treatment decision making. Such is the case for the management of many patients with stage 1 hypertension. The purpose of this scientific statement is to provide information complementary to the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines for the patient with untreated stage 1 hypertension (systolic BP/diastolic BP, 130–139/80–89 mmHg) with a 10-year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease < 10% who fails to meet the systolic BP/diastolic goal (< 130/80 mmHg) after 6 months of guideline-recommended lifestyle therapy. This statement provides evidence from sources other than event-based randomized controlled clinical trials and offers therapy options for consideration by clinicians.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^113oyPSN]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Adults with high blood pressure or hypertension — adapted recommendations specify that in adults with elevated blood pressure (BP) or hypertension, including those requiring antihypertensive medications, nonpharmacological interventions are recommended to reduce BP, including weight loss, a heart-healthy dietary pattern, sodium reduction, dietary potassium supplementation, increased physical activity with a structured exercise program, and limited alcohol. In adults with an estimated 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk of 10% or higher and an average systolic BP (SBP) of 130 mm Hg or higher or an average diastolic BP (DBP) of 80 mm Hg or higher, use of BP-lowering medications is recommended for primary prevention of CVD. In adults with confirmed hypertension and a 10-year ASCVD event risk of 10% or higher, a BP target of less than 130/80 mm Hg is recommended. In adults with hypertension and chronic kidney disease, treatment to a BP goal of less than 130/80 mm Hg is recommended. In adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension, antihypertensive drug treatment should be initiated at a BP of 130/80 mm Hg or higher, with a treatment goal of less than 130/80 mm Hg. In adults with an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk < 10% and an SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher or a DBP of 90 mm Hg or higher, initiation and use of BP-lowering medication are recommended. In adults with confirmed hypertension without additional markers of increased ASCVD risk, a BP target of less than 130/80 mm Hg may be reasonable.

### Treatment blood pressure targets for hypertension [^115tJF58]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

When treating elevated blood pressure, doctors need to know what blood pressure (BP) target they should try to achieve. The standard of clinical practice for some time has been ≤ 140–160/ 90–100 mmHg. New guidelines are recommending BP targets lower than this standard. It is not known whether attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard reduces mortality and morbidity.

Objectives

To determine if lower BP targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard BP targets (≤ 140–160/ 90–100 mmHg).

Search Strategy

Electronic search of MEDLINE (1966–2008), EMBASE (1980–2008), and CENTRAL (up to June 2008); references from review articles, clinical guidelines, and clinical trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing patients randomized to lower or to standard BP targets and providing data on any of the primary outcomes below.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers (JAA, MIP) independently assessed the included trials and data entry. Primary outcomes were total mortality; total serious adverse events; total cardiovascular events; myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure and end stage renal disease. Secondary outcomes were achieved mean systolic and diastolic BP and withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Main Results

No trials comparing different systolic BP targets were found. Seven trials (22,089 subjects) comparing different diastolic BP targets were included. Despite a -4/-3 mmHg greater achieved reduction in systolic/diastolic BP, p < 0.001, attempting to achieve "lower targets" instead of "standard targets" did not change total mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86–1.15), myocardial infarction (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74–1.09), stroke (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79–1.25), congestive heart failure (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.59–1.32), major cardiovascular events (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83–1.07), or end-stage renal disease (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.81–1.27). The net health effect of lower targets cannot be fully assessed due to lack of information regarding all total serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse effects in 6 of 7 trials. A sensitivity analysis in diabetic patients and in patients with chronic renal disease also did not show a reduction in any of the mortality and morbidity outcomes with lower targets as compared to standard targets.

Authors' Conclusions

Treating patients to lower than standard BP targets, ≤ 140–160/90–100 mmHg, does not reduce mortality or morbidity. Because guidelines are recommending even lower targets for diabetes mellitus and chronic renal disease, we are currently conducting systematic reviews in those groups of patients.

### Prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in adults: synopsis of the 2017 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association hypertension guideline [^116VRena]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Description

In November 2017, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) released a clinical practice guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure (BP) in adults. This article summarizes the major recommendations.

Methods

In 2014, the ACC and the AHA appointed a multidisciplinary committee to update previous reports of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. The committee reviewed literature and commissioned systematic reviews and meta-analyses on out-of-office BP monitoring, the optimal target for BP lowering, the comparative benefits and harms of different classes of antihypertensive agents, and the comparative benefits and harms of initiating therapy with a single antihypertensive agent or a combination of 2 agents.

Recommendations

This article summarizes key recommendations in the following areas: BP classification, BP measurement, screening for secondary hypertension, nonpharmacologic therapy, BP thresholds and cardiac risk estimation to guide drug treatment, treatment goals (general and for patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and advanced age), choice of initial drug therapy, resistant hypertension, and strategies to improve hypertension control.

### Riboflavin supplements for blood pressure lowering in adults [^113Ttn3U]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Rationale

Higher blood pressure is strongly related to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. There has been interest in riboflavin (vitamin B 2) as a potential intervention to lower blood pressure, particularly for those with a common genetic polymorphism in the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase enzyme (MTHFR).

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of riboflavin supplements compared to placebo or no additional treatment for lowering systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Clarivate Web of Science, Clarivate Food Science & Technology Abstracts and two clinical trials registries. There were no restrictions on language, publication year, or publication status. The latest search date was 24 October 2024. We also handsearched the reference lists of included studies.

Eligibility criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in adults that evaluated oral riboflavin supplements compared with an inactive control (e.g. placebo or no additional treatment) and measured at least one of the critical outcomes. We did not include trials that evaluated multivitamins containing riboflavin. Participants in both the intervention and control groups were able to receive standard medical therapy for hypertension prior to and during the trial.

Outcomes

The critical outcomes were systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure. The important outcomes were antihypertensive medication, adverse events and biomarkers of riboflavin status.

Risk of bias

We used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies for the following outcomes: systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, antihypertensive medication and adverse events.

Synthesis methods

We used standard Cochrane methods. For the critical outcomes, which were continuous, we calculated mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used a fixed‐effect meta‐analysis to pool data for each outcome where possible. We conducted subgroup analyses, including by MTHFR C677T genotype.

Included studies

We included four RCTs, which contributed 374 total participants for quantitative synthesis, although the number of participants included for each outcome varied. Most included studies for most outcomes had an overall high risk of bias.

Synthesis of results

The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of riboflavin on systolic blood pressure (MD −1.94 mmHg, 95% CI −5.74 to 1.86 mmHg; P = 0.32; 3 studies, 320 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and diastolic blood pressure (MD −3.03 mmHg, 95% CI −5.97 to −0.09 mmHg; P = 0.04; 2 studies, 271 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).

No RCTs reported data on changes in dose or number of antihypertensive medications. One RCT (54 participants) reported data on adverse events by intervention group; there were two adverse events in the riboflavin group and one in the control group. Low‐certainty evidence suggests that riboflavin may result in little to no difference in adverse events.

Authors' conclusions

The evidence for the effect of oral riboflavin supplements on systolic and diastolic blood pressure is very uncertain. The evidence comes from four RCTs, three of which had an overall high risk of bias. Large, well‐conducted trials are needed for high‐certainty evidence of the effect of riboflavin for blood pressure lowering.

### Aprocitentan (Tryvio) [^114b3nvf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

TRYVIO, in combination with other antihypertensive drugs, is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure (BP) in adult patients who are not adequately controlled on other drugs. Lowering BP reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes. There are no controlled trials demonstrating reduction of risk of these events with TRYVIO.

Control of high BP should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve BP goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is BP reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher BPs, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from BP reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower BP goal.

### How quickly should we titrate antihypertensive medication? Systematic review modelling blood pressure response from trial data [^113JHSek]. Heart (2011). Low credibility.

Context

There are no evidence syntheses available to guide clinicians on when to titrate antihypertensive medication after initiation.

Objective

To model the blood pressure (BP) response after initiating antihypertensive medication. Data sources electronic databases including Medline, Embase, Cochrane Register and reference lists up to December 2009.

Study Selection

Trials that initiated antihypertensive medication as single therapy in hypertensive patients who were either drug naive or had a placebo washout from previous drugs.

Data Extraction

Office BP measurements at a minimum of two weekly intervals for a minimum of 4 weeks. An asymptotic approach model of BP response was assumed and non-linear mixed effects modelling used to calculate model parameters.

Results and Conclusions

Eighteen trials that recruited 4168 patients met inclusion criteria. The time to reach 50% of the maximum estimated BP lowering effect was 1 week (systolic 0.91 weeks, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.10; diastolic 0.95, 0.75 to 1.15). Models incorporating drug class as a source of variability did not improve fit of the data. Incorporating the presence of a titration schedule improved model fit for both systolic and diastolic pressure. Titration increased both the predicted maximum effect and the time taken to reach 50% of the maximum (systolic 1.2 vs. 0.7 weeks; diastolic 1.4 vs. 0.7 weeks).

Conclusions

Estimates of the maximum efficacy of antihypertensive agents can be made early after starting therapy. This knowledge will guide clinicians in deciding when a newly started antihypertensive agent is likely to be effective or not at controlling BP.

### Evaluation of optimal diastolic blood pressure range among adults with treated systolic blood pressure less than 130 mm Hg [^111Zed9e]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this study, lowering DBP to less than 60 mm Hg was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with high cardiovascular risk and an treated SBP of less than 130 mm Hg. The finding that a DBP value between 70 and 80 mm Hg was an optimal target for this patient population merits consideration and further study.

### Antihypertensive drug effects on long-term blood pressure: an individual-level data meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials [^115BYPeE]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Characteristics of trials and participants in the BPLTTC

The 52 included trials comprised of nine BP-lowering intensity trials, 21 placebo-controlled trials and 29 drug class comparison trials (table 1), mostly conducted between 1990 and 2009 (eight trials conducted after 2009). Seven trials included both comparisons between drug classes as well as either intensity of BP-lowering or between active treatment and placebo. On average, the trials had 4 years of follow-up and eight BP measurements collected after baseline.

Table 1
Characteristics of trials and participants

The trials included 363 684 randomised participants (42% women) with a mean age of 65 years at baseline, including 6% aged ≥ 80 years. The mean baseline systolic/diastolic BP was 152/87 mm Hg (73% with ≥ 140 mm Hg systolic and 46% with ≥ 90 mm Hg diastolic BP) across all trials, with higher values for drug class comparison trials than the other designs (table 1). At baseline, 49% of all participants had had a history of cardiovascular disease and a third a history of diabetes. Baseline BP was higher for older persons, in women and among those with lower body mass index, without cardiovascular disease or diabetes and no prior use of antihypertensive medications, as compared with their counterparts (online supplemental table S2). Further details about study methods, design and risk of bias assessment for each trial are shown in online supplemental table S3 to S7).

### Antihypertensive drug effects on long-term blood pressure: an individual-level data meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials [^117H4iuL]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The analysis of individual-level data of 363 684 randomised participants of 52 large-scale RCTs, the largest of such meta-analysis to date, provides evidence to the overall and stratified effects of antihypertensive treatment on relatively long-term BP reduction. The magnitude of BP reduction varied by time after randomisation and the intended trial intervention. The predicted maximum effect of intervention became apparent about a year from randomisation, with some gradual attenuation several years later during follow-up. The net achieved BP reduction varied by trial design, with BP-lowering intensity trials achieving the largest mean reduction of over 11 mm Hg systolic BP after the first year of treatment. The effects were evident across patient subgroups, as defined by their baseline BP, age, sex, body size, history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes and prior use of antihypertensive treatment.

Randomised evidence on the expected effect of antihypertensive drugs on BP has been largely based on published information from efficacy trials. In a meta-analysis of 354 trials (N≈56 000), half-standard dosages of one, two or three antihypertensive drugs led to systolic BP reductions of 6.7 mm Hg, 13.3 mm Hg and 19.9 mm Hg, respectively, from a pretreatment systolic/diastolic BP of 150/90 mm Hg. Our study is not directly comparable with this work, but it is notable that, in our study, the mean BP reductions were less pronounced than their estimates and that the full effects became evident only after a several months after initiating therapy. This discrepancy could be due to a number of reasons. Their meta-analysis included trials with relatively short follow-up duration (around 2–16 weeks), with some trials having potentially restricted their analysis to fully adherent participants. In contrast, we included large-scale trials with 4-year mean follow-up and performed analysis as per intention to treat. By design, many trials included in our study focused on achieving a target BP level or reduction, so the maximal physiologically feasible effect on BP reduction may not have been achieved. A substantial proportion of participants were on antihypertensive drugs at baseline, which could have further underestimated the magnitude of achieved BP reduction, although it should not have an impact on the net between-group BP reductions.

### Pulse pressure changes with six classes of antihypertensive agents in a randomized, controlled trial [^114JQnoE]. Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Pulse pressure has been more strongly associated with cardiovascular outcomes, especially myocardial infarction and heart failure, than has systolic, diastolic, or mean arterial pressure in a variety of populations. Little is known, however, of the comparative effects of various classes of antihypertensive agents on pulse pressure. In retrospective analyses of the Veterans Affairs Single-Drug Therapy for Hypertension Study, we compared changes in pulse pressure with 6 classes of antihypertensive agents: 1292 men with diastolic blood pressure of 95 to 109 mm Hg on placebo were randomized to receive hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, captopril, clonidine, diltiazem, prazosin, or placebo. Drug doses were titrated to achieve a goal diastolic blood pressure of < 90 mm Hg during a 4- to 8-week medication titration phase. Pulse pressure change (placebo subtracted) was assessed from baseline to the end of the 3-month titration and 1-year maintenance. Mean baseline systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressures were 152, 99, and 53 mm Hg, respectively. Reductions in pulse pressure during titration were greater (P < 0.001) with clonidine (6.7 mm Hg) and hydrochlorothiazide (6.2 mm Hg) than with captopril (2.5 mm Hg), diltiazem (1.6 mm Hg), and atenolol (1.4 mm Hg); reduction with prazosin (3.9 mm Hg) was similar to all but clonidine. After 1 year, pulse pressure was reduced significantly more (P < 0.001) with hydrochlorothiazide (8.6 mm Hg) than with captopril and atenolol (4.1 mm Hg with both); clonidine (6.3 mm Hg), diltiazem (5.5 mm Hg), and prazosin (5.0 mm Hg) were intermediate. These data show that classes of antihypertensive agents differ in their ability to reduce pulse pressure. Whether these differences affect rates of cardiovascular events remains to be determined.

### Blood pressure-lowering medications, sodium reduction, and blood pressure [^113Sgfei]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Both blood pressure-lowering medication and sodium reduction are effective in hypertension control, but whether the effect of sodium reduction differ across blood pressure-lowering medications is unclear. This study aims to evaluate the dose-response effect of sodium intake reduction on blood pressure in treated hypertensive individuals and the impact of different classes of blood pressure-lowering drugs.

Methods

We searched multiple databases and reference lists up to July 9, 2024. Randomized controlled trials with a duration of ≥ 2 weeks comparing the effect of different levels of sodium intake (measured by 24-hour urinary sodium excretion) on blood pressure in hypertensive individuals treated with constant blood pressure-lowering medications were included. Instrumental variable meta-analyses based on random-effects models were conducted to evaluate the dose effect of sodium reduction on blood pressure. Subgroup analyses were performed based on the class of blood pressure-lowering drugs, age, baseline sodium and blood pressure levels, and study duration.

Results

We included 35 studies (median duration of 28 days) with a total of 2885 participants. For every 100 mmol reduction in 24-hour urinary sodium excretion, systolic blood pressure decreased by 6.81 mmHg (95% CI, 4.96–8.66), diastolic blood pressure decreased by 3.85 mmHg (95% CI, 2.26–5.43), and mean arterial pressure decreased by 4.83 mmHg (95% CI, 3.22–6.44). The dose-response effects varied across classes of blood pressure-lowering medications, with greater effects observed in the β-blockers, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, and dual therapy groups. No significant subgroup differences were observed across subgroups defined by age, baseline 24-hour urinary sodium excretion, blood pressure levels, or study duration.

Conclusions

Pooled evidence suggests a dose-response relationship between sodium reduction and blood pressure in treated individuals with hypertension, influenced by the class of blood pressure-lowering medications.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension treatment thresholds and use of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk — In all adults with hypertension, initiation of medications to lower blood pressure (BP) is recommended when average SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg, and initiation of medications to lower BP is recommended when average DBP is ≥ 90 mm Hg. In adults with hypertension and clinical CVD, initiation of medications to lower BP is recommended when average SBP is ≥ 130 mm Hg, and when average DBP is ≥ 80 mm Hg, to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and total mortality.

### Candesartan cilexetil [^114P2BPE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Hypertension

Candesartan cilexetil is indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adults and in children 1 to < 17 years of age, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which this drug principally belongs.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Candesartan cilexetil may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.

### Review of hypertension treatment… [^117DKjSW]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension, defined as persistent systolic blood pressure at least 130 mm Hg or diastolic BP at least 80 mm Hg, affects approximately 116 million adults in the US and more than 1 billion adults worldwide. Hypertension is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease events and death. Observations First-line therapy for hypertension is lifestyle modification, including weight loss, healthy dietary pattern that includes low sodium and high potassium intake, physical activity, and moderation or elimination of alcohol consumption. The BP-lowering effects of individual lifestyle components are partially additive and enhance the efficacy of pharmacologic therapy. The decision to initiate antihypertensive medication should be based on the level of BP and the presence of high atherosclerotic CVD risk.

First-line drug therapy for hypertension consists of a thiazide or thiazidelike diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide or chlorthalidone, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker such as enalapril or candesartan, and a calcium channel blocker such as amlodipine and should be titrated according to office and home SBP/DBP levels to achieve in most people an SBP/DBP target. Randomized clinical trials have established the efficacy of BP lowering to reduce the risk of CVD morbidity and mortality. An SBP reduction of 10 mm Hg decreases risk of CVD events by approximately 20% to 30%. Despite the benefits of BP control, only 44% of US adults with hypertension have their SBP/DBP controlled to less than 140/90 mm Hg.

Conclusions and Relevance Hypertension affects approximately 116 million adults in the US and more than 1 billion adults worldwide and is a leading cause of CVD morbidity and mortality. First-line therapy for hypertension is lifestyle modification, consisting of weight loss, dietary sodium reduction and potassium supplementation, healthy dietary pattern, physical activity, and limited alcohol consumption. When drug therapy is required, first-line therapies are thiazide or thiazidelike diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers.

### Losartan does more than lower blood pressure… [^113kZPGb]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Even with successful reduction of blood pressure, hypertensive patients have significantly increased rates of cardiovascular disease. Left ventricular hypertrophy is believed to be the crucial factor in this continued risk of morbidity and mortality and, in theory, blockage of angiotensin II could reverse LVH. Angiotensin II blocking drugs such as losartan could therefore have direct cardioprotective effects in addition to the effect of lowering blood pressure. Dahlöf and colleagues compared rates of cardiovascular morbidity and death in patients treated with losartan and patients treated with conventional antihypertensive therapy consisting of atenolol and diuretics. The 4, 605 patients assigned to losartan were closely matched to the 4, 588 assigned to atenolol therapy. Eighty-four percent of patients assigned to losartan remained on that drug throughout the study compared with 80 percent of those assigned to atenolol.

Both regimens successfully reduced blood pressure, with systolic blood pressure falling by 29. 1 and
30. 2 mm Hg in the losartan and atenolol groups, respectively. Diastolic pressure was reduced by 16. 8 mm Hg with losartan and by
16. 6 mm Hg with atenolol. The mean blood pressures at the last visit were 144/81 mm Hg for losartan and 145/80 for atenolol. In the losartan group, 49 percent of patients achieved target systolic blood pressure compared with 46 percent of those assigned to atenolol. For diastolic pressures the figure was 89 percent of both groups. Heart rates decreased significantly more in patients assigned to atenolol. The trend toward lower total mortality was in favor of losartan, and patients treated with losartan also had a 25 percent lower incidence of new-onset diabetes. Adverse events associated with therapy were significantly less common with losartan.

The authors conclude that losartan was significantly better than atenolol in reducing cardiovascular death, stroke, and myocardial infarction and has other advantages, including a reduced incidence of diabetes. Since both medications effectively reduced blood pressure, they suggest that angiotensin II blockade has direct protective actions on the cardiovascular system. Finally, they point to evidence that the effects of angiotensin II inhibitors may be particularly effective in patients with diabetes, nephropathy, and other conditions that further increase risk to the cardiovascular system. Can we anticipate these becoming first-line drugs for hypertension. — a. d. w.

### Azilsartan kamedoxomil (Edarbi) [^115kbshK]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Edarbi is indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adults, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes, including the class to which this drug principally belongs. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with Edarbi.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Edarbi may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.

### Blood pressure targets for hypertension in older adults [^113ZCV8W]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Eight out of 10 major antihypertensive trials in older adults attempted to achieve a target systolic blood pressure (BP) less than 160 mmHg. Collectively these trials demonstrated benefit for treatment, as compared to no treatment, for an older adult with BP greater than 160 mmHg. However an even lower BP target of less than 140 mmHg is commonly applied to all age groups. At the present time it is not known whether a lower or higher BP target is associated with better cardiovascular outcomes in older adults.

Objectives

To assess the effects of a higher (less than 150 to 160/95 to 105 mmHg) BP target compared to the lower BP target of less than 140/90 mmHg in hypertensive adults 65 years of age or older.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to February 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials, of at least one year's duration, conducted on hypertensive adults aged 65 years or older, which report the effect on mortality and morbidity of a higher systolic or diastolic BP treatment target (whether ambulatory, home, or office measurements) in the range of systolic BP less than 150 to 160 mmHg or diastolic BP less than 95 to 105 mmHg as compared to a lower BP treatment target of less than 140/90 mmHg or lower.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened and selected trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We combined data for dichotomous outcomes using the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and for continuous outcomes we used mean difference (MD). Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, institutionalisation, and cardiovascular serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular mortality, non-cardiovascular mortality, unplanned hospitalisation, each component of cardiovascular serious adverse events separately (including cerebrovascular disease, cardiac disease, vascular disease, and renal failure), total serious adverse events, total minor adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse effects, systolic BP achieved, and diastolic BP achieved.

Main Results

We found and included three unblinded randomised trials in 8221 older adults (mean age 74.8 years), in which higher BP targets of less than 150/90 mmHg (two trials) and less than 160/90 mmHg (one trial) were compared to a lower target of less than 140/90 mmHg. Treatment to the two different BP targets over two to four years failed to produce a difference in any of our primary outcomes, including all-cause mortality (RR 1.24 95% CI 0.99 to 1.54), stroke (RR 1.25 95% CI 0.94 to 1.67) and total cardiovascular serious adverse events (RR 1.19 95% CI 0.98 to 1.45). However, the 95% confidence intervals of these outcomes suggest the lower BP target is probably not worse, and might offer a clinically important benefit. We judged all comparisons to be based on low-quality evidence. Data on adverse effects were not available from all trials and not different, including total serious adverse events, total minor adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

At the present time there is insufficient evidence to know whether a higher BP target (less than150 to 160/95 to 105 mmHg) or a lower BP target (less than 140/90 mmHg) is better for older adults with high BP. Additional good-quality trials assessing BP targets in this population are needed.

### Antihypertensive drug effects on long-term blood pressure: an individual-level data meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials [^112LTHhh]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for BP management in specific patient groups also remains controversial. The US guidelines suggest similar recommendations for people with and without pre-existing cardiovascular disease, but the UK guidelines use a higher BP threshold for people without cardiovascular disease due to lack of any direct evidence of efficacy in this patient group. Although there were some variations in the treatment effects in our stratified analyses, which were likely an artefact of trial design, BP reductions were evident across a wide range of baseline BP and other personal characteristics. Unsurprisingly, there was little difference in magnitude of BP reduction between comparison arms of drug comparison trials (overall and across subgroups). The BP values substantially fell from baseline in both arms, which is likely due to regression to the mean given the high baseline BP of patients in these trials. The extent to which the estimated BP reductions will have an impact on existing evidence base, which have either been based on published information on average BP differences for each trialor have not adjusted for achieved BP differences between trials, requires further investigation.

A number of limitations need to be considered when interpreting our findings. Investigators or data custodians of some eligible trials could not be contacted (particularly for older trials) or were unwilling to take part in the collaboration. Nevertheless, the trials included in our collaboration generally have low risk of bias. Short-term effects of BP-lowering agents are well established, and our findings extend these effects over a relatively longer period of follow-up of 4 years on average (few trials had over 5 years of follow-up). We could not compare drug classes based on standardised dosages, as most treatment interventions allowed titration or addition of other drug classes to achieve specific treatment goals (online supplemental table S3). Investigators were allowed to add non-study antihypertensive treatment in some trials, which could have led to the dilution of treatment effects between trial arms or subgroups. Adherence to treatment had fallen towards the end of follow-up in most trials (online supplemental table S5), which could partly explain why treatment effects were lower in these latter follow-up periods. We did not have full access to individual-level information about use of non-study drugs nor on adherence to treatment to be able to quantify their effects. Yet an important strength of our study is that it permitted comparison across subgroups while maintaining the advantage of the random allocation to treatment groups.

### Riboflavin supplements for blood pressure lowering in adults [^11349Kkz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Higher blood pressure is strongly related to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. There has been interest in riboflavin (vitamin B 2) as a potential intervention to lower blood pressure, particularly for those with a common genetic polymorphism in the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase enzyme (MTHFR).

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of riboflavin supplements compared to placebo or no additional treatment for lowering systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Clarivate Web of Science, Clarivate Food Science & Technology Abstracts and two clinical trials registries. There were no restrictions on language, publication year, or publication status. The latest search date was 24 October 2024. We also handsearched the reference lists of included studies.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in adults that evaluated oral riboflavin supplements compared with an inactive control (e.g. placebo or no additional treatment) and measured at least one of the critical outcomes. We did not include trials that evaluated multivitamins containing riboflavin. Participants in both the intervention and control groups were able to receive standard medical therapy for hypertension prior to and during the trial.

Outcomes

The critical outcomes were systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure. The important outcomes were antihypertensive medication, adverse events and biomarkers of riboflavin status.

Risk Of Bias

We used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies for the following outcomes: systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, antihypertensive medication and adverse events.

Synthesis Methods

We used standard Cochrane methods. For the critical outcomes, which were continuous, we calculated mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used a fixed-effect meta-analysis to pool data for each outcome where possible. We conducted subgroup analyses, including by MTHFR C677T genotype.

Included Studies

We included four RCTs, which contributed 374 total participants for quantitative synthesis, although the number of participants included for each outcome varied. Most included studies for most outcomes had an overall high risk of bias.

Synthesis Of Results

The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of riboflavin on systolic blood pressure (MD -1.94 mmHg, 95% CI -5.74 to 1.86 mmHg; P = 0.32; 3 studies, 320 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and diastolic blood pressure (MD -3.03 mmHg, 95% CI -5.97 to -0.09 mmHg; P = 0.04; 2 studies, 271 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No RCTs reported data on changes in dose or number of antihypertensive medications. One RCT (54 participants) reported data on adverse events by intervention group; there were two adverse events in the riboflavin group and one in the control group. Low-certainty evidence suggests that riboflavin may result in little to no difference in adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence for the effect of oral riboflavin supplements on systolic and diastolic blood pressure is very uncertain. The evidence comes from four RCTs, three of which had an overall high risk of bias. Large, well-conducted trials are needed for high-certainty evidence of the effect of riboflavin for blood pressure lowering.

### Evaluation of optimal diastolic blood pressure range among adults with treated systolic blood pressure less than 130 mm Hg [^11521VcP]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the safe and optimal diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ranges among adults with treated systolic blood pressure (SBP) of less than 130 mm Hg?

Findings

In this cohort study of 7515 patients from 2 randomized clinical trials who had treated SBP of less than 130 mm Hg, a DBP of less than 60 mm Hg was associated with increased cardiovascular risk and a DBP between 70 and 80 mm Hg was associated with lower cardiovascular risk.

Meaning

The findings suggest that a DBP of less than 60 mm Hg may be harmful and a DBP between 70 and 80 mm Hg is an optimal target for patients with treated SBP of less than 130 mm Hg; this topic merits further study.

### Beta-blockers for hypertension [^1165h7n3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Degree of reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure achieved by beta‐blocker therapy in relation to each comparator treatment

Compared to placebo, first‐line beta‐blockers plus supplementary antihypertensive drugs reduced systolic blood pressure by about 11 mmHg and diastolic blood pressures by about 6 mmHg (Table 6). However, compared to diuretics, CCBs, or RAS inhibitors, the mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures at the end of the trials were 0 to 2 mmHg higher in the beta‐blocker group (Table 6).

### Association between baseline diastolic blood pressure and the efficacy of intensive vs standard blood pressure-lowering therapy [^11421LVU]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is there an interaction between baseline diastolic blood pressure and intensification of blood pressure–lowering therapy for survival and cardiovascular outcomes?

Findings

In this cohort study of 14 094 patients from 2 large randomized clinical trials, baseline DBP of 80 and 90 mm Hg were associated with significant reductions in the risk of a composite cardiovascular end point that included cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. The same was not true for the outcome of all-cause death.

Meaning

The findings of this study suggest that further work is needed to determine whether blood-pressure lowering therapy should be intensified in patients whose diastolic blood pressure is low.

1.1 Hypertension

ATACAND is indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adults and in children 1 to < 17 years of age, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which this drug principally belongs.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to choice of antihypertensives, initial therapy, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate ACEis, ARBs, dihydropyridine CCBs, and diuretics (thiazides and thiazide-like drugs such as chlorthalidone and indapamide) as first-line treatment options to lower BP, given their demonstrated effectiveness in reducing BP and CVD events.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Effects of Intensive Systolic Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment in Reducing Risk of Vascular Events (ESPRIT) — randomization to intensive treatment targeting office systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 120 mm Hg was associated with better cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes compared with standard treatment, with hazard ratio (HR) 0.88 [95% CI: 0.78–0.99]. In aggregate, these data indicate that the benefit of treatment clearly outweighs the potential harm at a threshold of ≥ 130 mm Hg for SBP for secondary prevention of CVD. In adults with hypertension and clinical CVD (coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure), initiation of medications to lower blood pressure is recommended when average diastolic BP (DBP) is ≥ 80 mm Hg to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and total mortality.

Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

High-value care in hypertension for adults aged 60 years or older — most patients with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 150 mm Hg or greater who receive antihypertensive medications will benefit, with acceptable harms and costs, from treatment to a blood pressure (BP) target of less than 150/90 mm Hg. When prescribing drug therapy, clinicians should select generic formulations over brand-name drugs, which have similar efficacy, reduced cost, and therefore better adherence, and clinicians should consider the patient's treatment burden. Because some patients may have falsely elevated readings in clinical settings ("white-coat hypertension"), it is important to ensure accurate BP measurement before initiating or changing treatment of hypertension, and the most accurate measurements come from multiple BP measurements made over time.

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^115RaCrb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is the first update of the review published in 2017. Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

Objectives

To determine if 'lower' blood pressure targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with 'standard' blood pressure targets (≤ 140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

Search Methods

For this updated review, the Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to February 2018: Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (from 1982), along with the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that included more than 50 participants per group and provided at least six months' follow-up. Trial reports had to present data for at least one primary outcome (total mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality). Eligible interventions involved lower targets for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (≤ 135/85 mmHg) compared with standard targets for blood pressure (≤ 140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg). Participants were adults with documented hypertension and adults receiving treatment for hypertension with a cardiovascular history for myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease, or angina pectoris.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed search results and extracted data using standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included six RCTs that involved a total of 9484 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). All RCTs provided individual participant data. We found no change in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.23) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29; moderate-quality evidence). Similarly, we found no differences in serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; low-quality evidence) or total cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization, or death from congestive heart failure) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; low-quality evidence). Studies reported more participant withdrawals due to adverse effects in the lower target arm (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; very low-quality evidence). Blood pressures were lower in the lower target group by 8.9/4.5 mmHg. More drugs were needed in the lower target group, but blood pressure targets were achieved more frequently in the standard target group.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no evidence of a difference in total mortality, serious adverse events, or total cardiovascular events between people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease treated to a lower or to a standard blood pressure target. This suggests that no net health benefit is derived from a lower systolic blood pressure target. We found very limited evidence on adverse events, which led to high uncertainty. At present, evidence is insufficient to justify lower blood pressure targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. More trials are needed to examine this topic.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Choice of initial monotherapy versus initial combination therapy — stage-based recommendations are: In adults with stage 2 hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] ≥ 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure [DBP] ≥ 90 mm Hg), initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy with 2 first-line agents of different classes, ideally in a single-pill combination (SPC), is recommended (1 B-R). In adults with stage 1 hypertension (SBP 130–139 mm Hg and DBP 80–89 mm Hg), initiation with a single first-line antihypertensive drug is reasonable, with dosage titration and sequential addition of other agents as needed to achieve BP control (2a C-EO). In adults with hypertension, simultaneous use of an ACEi, ARB, and/or renin inhibitor in combination is not recommended due to the potential for harm (3: Harm A). Pharmacologically, most patients require ≥ 2 antihypertensive medications to achieve BP control.

### On-treatment diastolic blood pressure and prognosis in systolic hypertension… [^117Lg8Ku]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

These findings support the hypothesis that antihypertensive treatment can be intensified to prevent cardiovascular events when systolic BP is not under control in older patients with systolic hypertension, at least until diastolic BP reaches 55 mm Hg. However, a prudent approach is warranted in patients with concomitant coronary heart disease, in whom diastolic BP should probably not be lowered to less than 70 mm Hg. A large meta-analysis of individual patient data from 7 trials3–10 showed a higher incidence of cardiovascular death with lower on-treatment diastolic BP, but this relationship was also observed for noncardiovascular death and similar relationships existed in the control patients; thus, the worse prognosis of lower diastolic BP could not be solely ascribed to antihypertensive treatment. Patients were randomized to active medication or matched placebo groups.

Active treatment consisted of nitrendipine, which could be combined with or replaced by enalapril maleate or hydrochlorothiazide or both drugs, to reduce the sitting systolic BP by 20 mm Hg or more and to less than 150 mm Hg. The major findings of the present study in older patients with isolated systolic hypertension are that lowering of diastolic BP with active antihypertensive treatment, to as low as about 55 mm Hg, does not seem to increase cardiovascular mortality, whereas low diastolic BP is associated with higher noncardiovascular mortality. When older patients with isolated systolic hypertension are treated with antihypertensive drugs, not only systolic but also diastolic BPs are reduced. 8, 12, 17, 21 It has been argued that patients with isolated systolic hypertension and, thus, by definition having low diastolic BP, would be particularly vulnerable to the consequences of treatment-induced further lowering of diastolic BP.

1 This is an important issue of clinical relevance because diastolic BP may reach very low values in these patients before systolic BP is normalized. First-line treatment in the SHEP trial was a diuretic, with the possible addition of the β-blocker atenolol or reserpine for better BP control; in the Syst-Eur Trial, treatment was started with the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker nitrendipine, to which the converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide could be added.

### Effects of blood pressure lowering on outcome incidence in hypertension: 2. effects at different baseline and achieved blood pressure levels – overview and meta-analyses of randomized trials [^113FqzEG]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Relevant clinical questions not approached by randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of blood pressure (BP)-lowering treatment can be explored by meta-analyses stratified by clinical criteria.

Objectives

Investigating whether all grades of hypertension benefit from BP-lowering treatment and which are the target BP levels to maximize outcome reduction.

Methods

Of the 68 RCTs of intentional and nonintentional BP-lowering, those without baseline antihypertensive drugs were stratified by the average baseline SBP and DBP (hypertension grades 1, 2, and 3). RCTs with or without baseline treatment were considered for investigating the effects of mean achieved SBP/DBP across three SBP cutoffs and two DBP cutoffs. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) (random-effects model), standardized to 10/5mmHg SBP/DBP reduction, and absolute risk reductions of seven fatal and nonfatal outcomes were calculated. Differences between relative and absolute risk reductions in the different strata of baseline or achieved SBP/DBP were evaluated by trend or heterogeneity analyses.

Results

In 32 RCTs (104,359 individuals), significant outcome reductions were found independently of the hypertension grade, with no trend toward risk ratio changes with increasing baseline BP. A secondary analysis limited to RCTs on grade 1 hypertension at low-to-moderate risk showed significant outcome reductions [risk ratio: stroke 0.33 (0.11–0.98), coronary events 0.68 (0.48–0.95), and death 0.53 (0.35–0.80)]. In 32 RCTs (128,232 individuals), relative and absolute outcome reductions were significant for the SBP differences across 150 and 140mmHg cutoffs. Below 130mmHg, only stroke and all-cause death were significantly reduced. Absolute outcome reduction showed a significant trend to decrease, the lower the SBP cutoff considered. In 29 RCTs (107,665 individuals), outcomes were significantly reduced across DBP cutoffs of 90 and 80mmHg. After excluding RCTs with baseline DBP less than 90mmHg, only stroke reduction was significant at achieved DBP less than 80mmHg.

Conclusion

Meta-analyses favor BP-lowering treatment even in grade 1 hypertension at low-to-moderate risk, and lowering SBP/DBP to less than 140/90mmHg. Achieving less than 130/80mmHg appears safe, but only adds further reduction in stroke.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^115hfUxF]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — new evidence on systolic and diastolic targets: Prior guidance recommended an office blood pressure (BP) target of < 140/90 mmHg with no obvious incremental benefit of lowering BP to < 130/80 mmHg, but newer RCTs and meta-analyses refine thresholds. In post hoc analyses, compared with 130–139 mmHg, lowering systolic BP (SBP) to < 130 mmHg was generally not associated with further benefit on major cardiovascular (CV) events, and reducing SBP to < 120 mmHg increased the incidence of CV events and death. The SPRINT trial compared SBP targets < 140 vs < 120 mmHg in > 9000 high-risk patients (excluding diabetes or previous stroke), where achieved SBP 121 vs 136 mmHg yielded a 25% reduction in major CV events and a 27% reduction in all-cause death, though interpretation is influenced by unattended automated office BP measurement and the possibility that SPRINT BP values correspond to conventional office SBPs in the 130–140 and 140–150 mmHg ranges. Meta-analyses stratified achieved SBP into 149–140 mmHg, 139–130 mmHg, and < 130 mmHg, and one analysis found every 10 mmHg SBP reduction reduced major CV events and death down to baseline SBP 130–139 mmHg, with benefit also reported when baseline SBP was < 130 mmHg and achieved values < 120 mmHg; however, the incremental benefit decreased as targets were lowered, and more intensive targets must be weighed against an increased risk of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events. Notably, < 50% of patients treated for hypertension currently achieve a target office SBP of < 140 mmHg.

The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults provides recommendations for the definition of hypertension, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) thresholds for initiation of antihypertensive medication, and BP target goals.

Objectives

This study sought to determine the prevalence of hypertension, implications of recommendations for antihypertensive medication, and prevalence of BP above the treatment goal among US adults using criteria from the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline and the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC7).

Methods

The authors analyzed data from the 2011 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (N = 9 623). BP was measured 3 times following a standardized protocol and averaged. Results were weighted to produce US population estimates.

Results

According to the 2017 ACC/AHA and JNC7 guidelines, the crude prevalence of hypertension among US adults was 45.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 43.6% to 47.6%) and 31.9% (95% CI: 30.1% to 33.7%), respectively, and antihypertensive medication was recommended for 36.2% (95% CI: 34.2% to 38.2%) and 34.3% (95% CI: 32.5% to 36.2%) of US adults, respectively. Nonpharmacological intervention is advised for the 9.4% of US adults with hypertension who are not recommended for antihypertensive medication according to the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline. Among US adults taking antihypertensive medication, 53.4% (95% CI: 49.9% to 56.8%) and 39.0% (95% CI: 36.4% to 41.6%) had BP above the treatment goal according to the 2017 ACC/AHA and JNC7 guidelines, respectively.

Conclusions

Compared with the JNC7 guideline, the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline results in a substantial increase in the prevalence of hypertension, a small increase in the percentage of US adults recommended for antihypertensive medication, and more intensive BP lowering for many adults taking antihypertensive medication.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task Force on Clinical practice guidelines [^111fZQun]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Adults with high blood pressure or hypertension — nonpharmacological and pharmacologic treatment — in adults with elevated blood pressure (BP) or hypertension, including those requiring antihypertensive medications, nonpharmacological interventions are recommended to reduce BP, including weight loss, a heart-healthy dietary pattern, sodium reduction, dietary potassium supplementation, increased physical activity with a structured exercise program, and limited alcohol. In adults with an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk of 10% or higher and an average systolic BP (SBP) of 130 mm Hg or higher or an average diastolic BP (DBP) of 80 mm Hg or higher, use of BP-lowering medications is recommended for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^115FQHjS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a review published in 2009. Sustained moderate to severe elevations in resting blood pressure leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review attempted to answer that question.

Objectives

To quantify the mortality and morbidity effects from different first-line antihypertensive drug classes: thiazides (low-dose and high-dose), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), and alpha-blockers, compared to placebo or no treatment. Secondary objectives: when different antihypertensive drug classes are used as the first-line drug, to quantify the blood pressure lowering effect and the rate of withdrawal due to adverse drug effects, compared to placebo or no treatment.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials (RCT) of at least one year duration, comparing one of six major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment, in adult patients with blood pressure over 140/90 mmHg at baseline. The majority (over 70%) of the patients in the treatment group were taking the drug class of interest after one year. We included trials with both hypertensive and normotensive patients in this review if the majority (over 70%) of patients had elevated blood pressure, or the trial separately reported outcome data on patients with elevated blood pressure.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), total cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. We used a fixed-effect model to to combine dichotomous outcomes across trials and calculate risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We presented blood pressure data as mean difference (MD) with 99% CI.

Main Results

The 2017 updated search failed to identify any new trials. The original review identified 24 trials with 28 active treatment arms, including 58,040 patients. We found no RCTs for ARBs or alpha-blockers. These results are mostly applicable to adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and mean duration of follow-up was three to five years. High-quality evidence showed that first-line low-dose thiazides reduced mortality (11.0% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97); total CVS (12.9% with control versus 9.0% with treatment; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.76), stroke (6.2% with control versus 4.2% with treatment; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.77), and coronary heart disease (3.9% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.84). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line high-dose thiazides reduced stroke (1.9% with control versus 0.9% with treatment; RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.61) and total CVS (5.1% with control versus 3.7% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.82), but did not reduce mortality (3.1% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.05), or coronary heart disease (2.7% with control versus 2.7% with treatment; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.20). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line beta-blockers did not reduce mortality (6.2% with control versus 6.0% with treatment; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.07) or coronary heart disease (4.4% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.03), but reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97) and total CVS (7.6% with control versus 6.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line ACE inhibitors reduced mortality (13.6% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95), stroke (6.0% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.82), coronary heart disease (13.5% with control versus 11.0% with treatment; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.94), and total CVS (20.1% with control versus 15.3% with treatment; RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.85). Low-quality evidence showed that first-line calcium channel blockers reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 1.9% with treatment; RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.84) and total CVS (8.0% with control versus 5.7% with treatment; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.87), but not coronary heart disease (3.1% with control versus 2.4% with treatment; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.09), or mortality (6.0% with control versus 5.1% with treatment; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.09). There was low-quality evidence that withdrawals due to adverse effects were increased with first-line low-dose thiazides (5.0% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 2.38, 95% CI 2.06 to 2.75), high-dose thiazides (2.2% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 4.48, 95% CI 3.83 to 5.24), and beta-blockers (3.1% with control versus 14.4% with treatment; RR 4.59, 95% CI 4.11 to 5.13). No data for these outcomes were available for first-line ACE inhibitors or calcium channel blockers. The blood pressure data were not used to assess the effect of the different classes of drugs as the data were heterogeneous, and the number of drugs used in the trials differed.

Authors' Conclusions

First-line low-dose thiazides reduced all morbidity and mortality outcomes in adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. First-line ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective, but the evidence was of lower quality. First-line high-dose thiazides and first-line beta-blockers were inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides.

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^1135WgQD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

Objectives

To determine if 'lower' blood pressure targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with 'standard' blood pressure targets (≤ 140 to 160/ 90 to 100 mmHg) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to February 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also searched the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Literature Database (from 1982) and contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with more than 50 participants per group and at least six months follow-up. Trial reports needed to present data for at least one primary outcome (total mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality). Eligible interventions were lower target for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (≤ 135/85 mmHg) compared with standard target for blood pressure (≤ 140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg). Participants were adults with documented hypertension or who were receiving treatment for hypertension and cardiovascular history for myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease or angina pectoris.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed search results and extracted data using standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included six RCTs that involved a total of 9795 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). Five RCTs provided individual patient data for 6775 participants. We found no change in total mortality (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.22) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.21; moderate-quality evidence). Similarly, no differences were found in serious adverse events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.11; low-quality evidence). There was a reduction in fatal and non fatal cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization or death from congestive heart failure) with the lower target (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.98; ARR 1.6% over 3.7 years; low-quality evidence). There were more participant withdrawals due to adverse effects in the lower target arm (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; very low-quality evidence). Blood pressures were lower in the lower' target group by 9.5/4.9 mmHg. More drugs were needed in the lower target group but blood pressure targets were achieved more frequently in the standard target group.

Authors' Conclusions

No evidence of a difference in total mortality and serious adverse events was found between treating to a lower or to a standard blood pressure target in people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease. This suggests no net health benefit from a lower systolic blood pressure target despite the small absolute reduction in total cardiovascular serious adverse events. There was very limited evidence on adverse events, which lead to high uncertainty. At present there is insufficient evidence to justify lower blood pressure targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. More trials are needed to answer this question.

### Prexxartan [^115nKNbi]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

1.1 Hypertension

PREXXARTAN is indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adults and children six years and older, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which valsartan principally belongs. There are no controlled trials in hypertensive patients demonstrating risk reduction with valsartan.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (e.g., patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

PREXXARTAN may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.

### Valsartan (Diovan) [^1153mpGx]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Hypertension

Diovan®is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure in adults and pediatric patients one year of age and older. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes, including the class to which valsartan principally belongs. There are no controlled trials in hypertensive patients demonstrating risk reduction with Diovan.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

### A simplified approach to the treatment of uncomplicated hypertension: a cluster randomized, controlled trial [^114AzAnR]. Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Notwithstanding the availability of antihypertensive drugs and practice guidelines, blood pressure control remains suboptimal. The complexity of current treatment guidelines may contribute to this problem. To determine whether a simplified treatment algorithm is more effective than guideline-based management, we studied 45 family practices in southwestern Ontario, Canada, using a cluster randomization trial comparing the simplified treatment algorithm with the Canadian Hypertension Education Program guidelines. The simplified treatment algorithm consisted of the following: (1) initial therapy with a low-dose angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/diuretic or angiotensin receptor blocker/diuretic combination; (2) up-titration of combination therapy to the highest dose; (3) addition of a calcium channel blocker and up-titration; and (4) addition of a non-first-line antihypertensive agent. The proportion of patients treated to target blood pressure (systolic blood pressure < 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg for patients without diabetes mellitus or systolic blood pressure < 130 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure < 80 mm Hg for diabetic patients) at 6 months was analyzed at the practice level. The proportion of patients achieving target was significantly higher in the intervention group (64.7% versus 52.7%; absolute difference: 12.0%; 95% CI: 1.5% to 22.4%; P = 0.026). Multivariate analysis of patient-level data showed that assignment to the intervention arm increased the chance of reaching the target by 20% (P = 0.028), when adjusted for other covariates. In conclusion, the Simplified Treatment Intervention to Control Hypertension Study indicates that a simplified antihypertensive algorithm using initial low-dose fixed-dose combination therapy is superior to guideline-based practice for the management of hypertension.

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^113QhbJd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the second update of the review first published in 2017. Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

Objectives

To determine if lower blood pressure targets (135/85 mmHg or less) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard blood pressure targets (140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg or less) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

Search Methods

For this updated review, the Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to November 2019: Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (from 1982), along with the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs with more than 50 participants per group that provided at least six months' follow-up. Trial reports had to present data for at least one primary outcome (total mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality). Eligible interventions involved lower targets for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (135/85 mmHg or less) compared with standard targets for blood pressure (140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg or less). Participants were adults with documented hypertension and adults receiving treatment for hypertension with a cardiovascular history for myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease, or angina pectoris.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed search results and extracted data using standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We included six RCTs that involved 9484 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). All RCTs provided individual participant data. None of the included studies was blinded to participants or clinicians because of the need to titrate antihypertensives to reach a specific blood pressure goal. However, an independent committee blinded to group allocation assessed clinical events in all trials. Hence, we assessed all trials at high risk of performance bias and low risk of detection bias. Other issues such as early termination of studies and subgroups of participants not predefined were also considered to downgrade the quality evidence. We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.23; 6 studies, 9484 participants; moderate-quality evidence) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29; 6 studies, 9484 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Similarly, we found there may be little to no differences in serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; 6 studies, 9484 participants; low-quality evidence) or total cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization, or death from congestive heart failure) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; 6 studies, 9484 participants; low-quality evidence). The evidence was very uncertain about withdrawals due to adverse effects. However, studies suggest more participants may withdraw due to adverse effects in the lower target group (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; 2 studies, 690 participants; very low-quality evidence). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings were lower in the lower target group (systolic: mean difference (MD) -8.90 mmHg, 95% CI -13.24 to -4.56; 6 studies, 8546 participants; diastolic: MD -4.50 mmHg, 95% CI -6.35 to -2.65; 6 studies, 8546 participants). More drugs were needed in the lower target group (MD 0.56, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.96; 5 studies, 7910 participants), but blood pressure targets were achieved more frequently in the standard target group (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.24; 6 studies, 8588 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality and cardiovascular mortality between people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease treated to a lower compared to a standard blood pressure target. There may also be little to no difference in serious adverse events or total cardiovascular events. This suggests that no net health benefit is derived from a lower systolic blood pressure target. We found very limited evidence on withdrawals due to adverse effects, which led to high uncertainty. At present, evidence is insufficient to justify lower blood pressure targets (135/85 mmHg or less) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. Several trials are still ongoing, which may provide an important input to this topic in the near future.

### Blood pressure targets for hypertension in people with diabetes mellitus [^1134KvG7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

When treating elevated blood pressure (BP), doctors often want to know what blood pressure target they should try to achieve. The standard blood pressure target in clinical practice for some time has been less than 140–160/90–100 mmHg for the general population of people with elevated blood pressure. Several clinical guidelines published in recent years have recommended lower targets (less than 130/80 mmHg) for people with diabetes mellitus. It is not known whether attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard target reduces mortality and morbidity in those with elevated blood pressure and diabetes.

Objectives

To determine if 'lower' BP targets (any target less than 130/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity compared with 'standard' BP targets (less than 140–160/90–100 mmHg) in people with diabetes.

Search Methods

We searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for related reviews. We conducted electronic searches of the Hypertension Group Specialised Register (January 1946 - October 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 9), MEDLINE (January 1946 - October 2013), EMBASE (January 1974 - October 2013) and ClinicalTrials.gov. The most recent search was performed on October 4, 2013. Other search sources were the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), and reference lists of all papers and relevant reviews.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing people with diabetes randomized to lower or to standard BP targets as previously defined, and providing data on any of the primary outcomes below.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed and established the included trials and data entry. Primary outcomes were total mortality; total serious adverse events; myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure and end-stage renal disease. Secondary outcomes were achieved mean systolic and diastolic BP, and withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Main Results

We found five randomized trials, recruiting a total of 7314 participants and with a mean follow-up of 4.5 years. Only one trial (ACCORD) compared outcomes associated with 'lower' (< 120 mmHg) or 'standard' (< 140 mmHg) systolic blood pressure targets in 4734 participants. Despite achieving a significantly lower BP (119.3/64.4 mmHg vs 133.5/70.5 mmHg, P < 0.0001), and using more antihypertensive medications, the only significant benefit in the group assigned to 'lower' systolic blood pressure (SBP) was a reduction in the incidence of stroke: risk ratio (RR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.88, P = 0.009, absolute risk reduction 1.1%. The effect of SBP targets on mortality was compatible with both a reduction and increase in risk: RR 1.05 CI 0.84 to 1.30, low quality evidence. Trying to achieve the 'lower' SBP target was associated with a significant increase in the number of other serious adverse events: RR 2.58, 95% CI 1.70 to 3.91, P < 0.00001, absolute risk increase 2.0%. Four trials (ABCD-H, ABCD-N, ABCD-2V, and a subgroup of HOT) specifically compared clinical outcomes associated with 'lower' versus 'standard' targets for diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in people with diabetes. The total number of participants included in the DBP target analysis was 2580. Participants assigned to 'lower' DBP had a significantly lower achieved BP: 128/76 mmHg vs 135/83 mmHg, P < 0.0001. There was a trend towards reduction in total mortality in the group assigned to the 'lower' DBP target (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.01), mainly due to a trend to lower non-cardiovascular mortality. There was no difference in stroke (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.05), in myocardial infarction (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.40) or in congestive heart failure (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.92), low quality evidence. End-stage renal failure and total serious adverse events were not reported in any of the trials. A sensitivity analysis of trials comparing DBP targets < 80 mmHg (as suggested in clinical guidelines) versus < 90 mmHg showed similar results. There was a high risk of selection bias for every outcome analyzed in favor of the 'lower' target in the trials included for the analysis of DBP targets.

Authors' Conclusions

At the present time, evidence from randomized trials does not support blood pressure targets lower than the standard targets in people with elevated blood pressure and diabetes. More randomized controlled trials are needed, with future trials reporting total mortality, total serious adverse events as well as cardiovascular and renal events.

### Hypertension: empirical evidence and implications in 2014 [^1156dYbN]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

High blood pressure (HBP) or hypertension (HTN) is one of the leading causes of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Despite this fact, there is widespread agreement that the treatment of HBP, over the last half century, has been a great achievement. However, after the release of the new Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure-8 (JNC-8) guidelines, there have been heated debates with regard to what are the most evidence-based blood pressure goals. While JNC-8 claims that the goal blood pressure for otherwise healthy patients with mild hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140–159mmHg and diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90–99mmHg) should be < 140/90mmHg; a recent Cochrane meta-analysis is in direct conflict with these recommendations. Indeed, a 2012 Cochrane meta-analysis indicated that there is no evidence that treating otherwise healthy mild hypertension patients with antihypertensive therapy will reduce CV events or mortality. Additionally, the Cochrane meta-analysis showed that antihypertensive therapy was associated with a significant increase in withdrawal due to adverse events. Thus, the current evidence in the literature does not support the goals set by the JNC-8 guidelines. In this review we discussed the strengths and limitations of both lines of evidence and why it takes an evidence-based medication to reduce CV events/mortality (eg, how a goal blood pressure is achieved is more important than getting to the goal). As medications inherently cause side effects and come at a cost to the patient, the practice of evidence-based medicine becomes exceedingly important. Although the majority of HTN studies claim great advantages by lowering HBP, this review finds severe conflicts in the findings among the various HTN studies, as well as serious epistemological, methodological and statistical problems that cast doubt to such claims.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^117YFQeQ]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

VA/DoD hypertension guideline key questions on pharmacologic therapy describe targets and drug choices. Key Question 5 addresses "Antihypertensive pharmacologic therapy to a specific systolic blood pressure goal or range or with the goal of reduction in blood pressure", and Key Question 6 addresses "Antihypertensive pharmacologic therapy to a specific diastolic blood pressure goal or range or with the goal of blood pressure reduction". Key Question 7 lists initial options — "thiazide-type diuretics, ACEIs, ARBs, CCBs, beta blockers" — and add-on therapy options including "spironolactone, a MRA, aka aldosterone antagonist [AA], etc". Key Question 8 specifies initial combination regimens such as "thiazide-type diuretic + ACEI, thiazide-type diuretic + ARB, thiazide-type diuretic + beta blocker, thiazide-type diuretic + CCB, ACEI + CCB, ARB + CCB" and notes that "Interventions were not limited to combination within one tablet". Key Question 9 addresses "Addition of a fourth drug (any)" and that initial triple therapy "should include (all in maximum tolerated doses): long-acting dihydropyridine CCB, renin-angiotensin system blocker (ACEI or ARB), thiazide-type diuretic".

### Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide [^1121eUPP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Essential hypertension:

For patients with essential hypertension in whom other measures are considered inadequate or inappropriate;
In hypertensive patients for the treatment of a diuretic-induced hypokalemia when other measures are considered inappropriate;
Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes, including the classes to which this drug principally belongs. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^1174mEMA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Sustained elevated blood pressure, unresponsive to lifestyle measures, leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review answers that question.

Primary Objective

To quantify the benefits and harms of the major first-line anti-hypertensive drug classes: thiazides, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, alpha-blockers, and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB).

Search Strategy

Electronic search of MEDLINE (Jan. 1966-June 2008), EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane clinical trial register, using standard search strategy of the hypertension review group with additional terms.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials of at least one year duration comparing one of 6 major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment. More than 70% of people must have BP > 140/90 mmHg at baseline.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. Risk ratio (RR) and a fixed effects model were used to combine outcomes across trials.

Main Results

Of 57 trials identified, 24 trials with 28 arms, including 58,040 patients met the inclusion criteria. Thiazides (19 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83, 0.96), stroke (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.57, 0.71), CHD (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75, 0.95) and CVS (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.66, 0.76). Low-dose thiazides (8 RCTs) reduced CHD (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61, 0.84), but high-dose thiazides (11 RCTs) did not (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85, 1.20). Beta-blockers (5 RCTs) reduced stroke (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72, 0.97) and CVS (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81, 0.98) but not CHD (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78, 1.03) or mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86, 1.07). ACE inhibitors (3 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72–0.95), stroke (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52–0.82), CHD (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70–0.94) and CVS (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67–0.85). Calcium-channel blocker (1 RCT) reduced stroke (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41, 0.84) and CVS (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57, 0.87) but not CHD (RR 0.77 95% CI 0.55, 1.09) or mortality (RR 0.86 95% CI 0.68, 1.09). No RCTs were found for ARBs or alpha-blockers.

Authors' Conclusions

First-line low-dose thiazides reduce all morbidity and mortality outcomes. First-line ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective but the evidence is less robust. First-line high-dose thiazides and first-line beta-blockers are inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides.

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^115xdVCE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the third update of the review first published in 2017. Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

Objectives

To determine if lower blood pressure targets (systolic/diastolic 135/85 mmHg or less) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity compared with standard blood pressure targets (140 mmHg to 160mmHg/90 mmHg to 100 mmHg or less) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

Search Methods

For this updated review, we used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was January 2022. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with more than 50 participants per group that provided at least six months' follow-up. Trial reports had to present data for at least one primary outcome (total mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality). Eligible interventions involved lower targets for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (135/85 mmHg or less) compared with standard targets for blood pressure (140 mmHg to 160 mmHg/90 mmHg to 100 mmHg or less). Participants were adults with documented hypertension and adults receiving treatment for hypertension with a cardiovascular history for myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease, or angina pectoris.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included seven RCTs that involved 9595 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). Six of seven RCTs provided individual participant data. None of the included studies was blinded to participants or clinicians because of the need to titrate antihypertensive drugs to reach a specific blood pressure goal. However, an independent committee blinded to group allocation assessed clinical events in all trials. Hence, we assessed all trials at high risk of performance bias and low risk of detection bias. We also considered other issues, such as early termination of studies and subgroups of participants not predefined, to downgrade the certainty of the evidence. We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.23; 7 studies, 9595 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29; 6 studies, 9484 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Similarly, we found there may be little to no differences in serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; 7 studies, 9595 participants; low-certainty evidence) or total cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization, or death from congestive heart failure (CHF)) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; 7 studies, 9595 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence was very uncertain about withdrawals due to adverse effects. However, studies suggest more participants may withdraw due to adverse effects in the lower target group (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; 3 studies, 801 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings were lower in the lower target group (systolic: mean difference (MD) -8.77 mmHg, 95% CI -12.82 to -4.73; 7 studies, 8657 participants; diastolic: MD -4.50 mmHg, 95% CI -6.35 to -2.65; 6 studies, 8546 participants). More drugs were needed in the lower target group (MD 0.56, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.96; 5 studies, 7910 participants), but blood pressure targets at one year were achieved more frequently in the standard target group (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.23; 7 studies, 8699 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality and cardiovascular mortality between people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease treated to a lower compared to a standard blood pressure target. There may also be little to no difference in serious adverse events or total cardiovascular events. This suggests that no net health benefit is derived from a lower systolic blood pressure target. We found very limited evidence on withdrawals due to adverse effects, which led to high uncertainty. At present, evidence is insufficient to justify lower blood pressure targets (135/85 mmHg or less) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. Several trials are still ongoing, which may provide an important input to this topic in the near future.

### Antihypertensive drug effects on long-term blood pressure: an individual-level data meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials [^113mV2US]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Our study highlights the role of pharmacological agents in effectively reducing BP over several years across individuals with a wide range of characteristics, although the achieved between-group reductions, even with the intensive BP-lowering regimens, were relatively modest. Given that large-scale trials have shown the effects of pharmacological BP reduction on improving clinical outcomes, the modest BP reductions estimated in our study should still be clinically meaningful. Indeed, the estimates of long-term BP reduction in this study could inform treatment strategies and help in setting realistic treatment goals in the pharmacologic management of raised BP.

### Height may explain sex differences in systolic blood pressure in older adults [^115yoW95]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study has important clinical implications. Despite comparable numbers and classes of antihypertensive medications, hypertension control is lower in older women than men. Thus, antihypertensive therapy must be more effective in older women to match control rates in older men. SBP was 6.4 mm Hg higher in women than men aged ≥ 75 years, and ≈70% of older women were taking 2 or fewer antihypertensive medications.

Mitigating age-related increases of SBP is especially important for women. Potentially effective options include lower SBP targets for women than men given their greater central SBP for a given brachial artery pressure.lower dietary sodium intake may be especially important for women, since women are more often salt sensitive than men and BP rises more with aging in salt-sensitive individuals. Women take statins less often than men and have higher non-HDL cholesterol values. Greater use of statins in women, especially earlier in life, could attenuate their greater age-related increases of aortic stiffness and SBP.

Improving hypertension control in older women to levels in older men would require lowering SBP 6 to 7 mm Hg. Adding an antihypertensive medication at half-standard dose lowers SBP ≈7 mm Hg. Adding a long-acting nitrate is especially effective for lowering SBP in older adults. For individuals already taking multiple antihypertensive medications, renin-guided therapy can improve BP control without increasing medication number through informed switching of medications classes. Concerns were raised that β-blocker monotherapy is less effective for reducing BP and improving cardiovascular outcomes, especially in older adults, than other first-line drugs. Based on withinand between – study comparisons, diuretics and β-blockers, often combined, were as effective as calcium channel and renin-angiotensin system blocker based therapies for lowering BP and improving cardiovascular outcomes. Treatment of wide pulse-pressure hypertension in older adults lowered SBP 2 to 4 mm Hg for each 1 mm Hg reduction in diastolic BP. – Managing treatment resistant hypertension exceeds the scope of our article and has been addressed. Older men have lower control rates than younger men and are also candidates for more effective pharmacotherapy.

### Comparison of cardiovascular events among users of different classes of antihypertension medications: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112MMytN]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Antihypertension medications have been associated with prevention of cardiovascular events, although less is known about the comparative effectiveness of different medication classes.

Objective

To compare contemporary aggregated first-in-trial cardiovascular events among patients with hypertension and no substantial comorbidities.

Data Sources

The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched for articles published between January 1, 1990, and October 24, 2017.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials that tested commonly used antihypertension medications (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, β-blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, and diuretics) and that reported selected cardiovascular outcomes for at least 6 months of follow-up.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

The analysis was conducted from October 2017 to December 2019. Two reviewers extracted the number of cardiovascular events at the end of treatment for all study groups. For each outcome, a frequentist network meta-analysis was used to compare risk reductions between medication classes (random-effects models weighted by the inverse variance). The dose-response association between a 10-mm Hg reduction of systolic blood pressure and a 5-mm Hg reduction of diastolic blood pressure and the risk of first-in-trial cardiovascular events was estimated.

Main Outcomes and Measures

First-in-trial cardiovascular events, including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and revascularization.

Results

In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, data were pooled from 46 eligible clinical trials (248 887 total participants with a mean [SD] age of 65.6 [5.8] years; 52.8% men). In the network meta-analysis, compared with placebo, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics were reported to be similarly effective in reducing overall cardiovascular events (25%), cardiovascular death (20%), and stroke (35%); angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were reported to be the most effective in reducing the risk of myocardial infarction (28%); and diuretics were reported to be the most effective in reducing revascularization (33%). In the metaregression analyses, each 10-mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure and 5-mm Hg reduction in diastolic blood pressure was significantly associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular death, stroke, and overall cardiovascular events.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this network meta-analysis of clinical trials of patients with hypertension and no substantial comorbidities, different classes of antihypertension medications were associated with similar benefits in reducing cardiovascular events. Future studies should compare the effectiveness of combinations of antihypertension medications in reducing cardiovascular events.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^114eZ6aq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension affects ≈29% of the US adult population, an estimated 72 million people, with a prevalence of > 65% in persons older than 60 years. 1, 2 It is an important risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), accounting for ≈41% of all CVD deaths. 3, 4 Indeed, there is a known graded relationship between increasing blood pressure (BP) and the risk of CVD, starting at 115/75 mm Hg. 5 Based on observational data, an increase in BP of 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic is associated with a doubling of the risk of CVD death, regardless of age. 5 Further, hypertension in middle age is known to increase the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dementia in later life, an important issue given the aging demographic in Western societies. 6 Finally, despite the fact that BP recognition and control are improving, it is concerning that nearly half of the hypertensive population remains suboptimally controlled. 2

With the 2003 Joint National Committee's seventh report (JNC 7) becoming increasingly outdated and the 2011 Institute of Medicine report calling for high‐quality evidence‐based guidelines, 7, 8 the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) was initially appointed to create an updated treatment guideline for hypertension under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Although the NIH ultimately withdrew from the guideline development process at a late stage in the development of JNC 8, the panel decided, nonetheless, to publish their recommendations independently.

The panel aimed to answer 3 questions: Does initiating antihypertensive treatment at specific BP thresholds improve health outcomes? Does treatment with antihypertensive therapy to a specific BP goal improve health outcomes? Are there differences in benefit/harm between antihypertensive drugs or drug classes on specific health outcomes? The committee focused exclusively on large, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as supporting evidence, although 5 of the 9 recommendations in the final report were ultimately based on expert opinion. Partly in response to JNC 8, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) are now in the process of developing official hypertension guidelines. In this review, we discuss the basis of each recommendation from the JNC 8 panel, provide additional insights, and compare these recommendations with guidelines from other professional societies to generate suggestions for the new AHA/ACC hypertension guideline committee.

### 2017 ACC / AHA blood pressure treatment guideline recommendations and cardiovascular risk [^116X5WYJ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) blood pressure (BP) guideline provides updated recommendations for antihypertensive medication initiation and intensification.

Objectives

Determine the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events among adults recommended and not recommended antihypertensive medication initiation or intensification by the 2017 ACC/AHA BP guideline.

Methods

The authors analyzed data for black and white REGARDS (REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke) study participants (age ≥ 45 years). Systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were measured twice at baseline (2003 to 2007) and averaged. Participants not taking (n = 14,039) and taking (n = 15,179) antihypertensive medication were categorized according to their recommendations for antihypertensive medication initiation and intensification by the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline. Overall, 4,094 CVD events (stroke, coronary heart disease, and heart failure) occurred by December 31, 2014.

Results

Among participants not taking antihypertensive medication, 34.4% were recommended pharmacological antihypertensive treatment initiation. The CVD event rate per 1,000 person-years among participants recommended antihypertensive medication initiation with SBP/DBP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg was 22.7 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 20.3 to 25.0). Among participants with SBP/DBP 130 to 139/80 to 89 mm Hg, the CVD event rate was 20.5 (95% CI: 18.5 to 22.6) and 3.4 (95% CI: 2.4 to 4.4) for those recommended and not recommended antihypertensive medication initiation, respectively. Among participants taking antihypertensive medication, 62.8% were recommended treatment intensification. The CVD event rate per 1,000 person-years among participants recommended treatment intensification was 33.6 (95% CI: 31.5 to 35.6) and 22.4 (95% CI: 20.8 to 23.9) for those with SBP/DBP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg and 130 to 139/80 to 89 mm Hg, respectively.

Conclusions

Implementing the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline would direct antihypertensive medication initiation and intensification to adults with high CVD risk.
