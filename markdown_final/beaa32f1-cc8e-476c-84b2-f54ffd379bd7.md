## Question

166/70

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and manage a blood pressure of 166/70 mmHg using current guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the measurement and excluding white-coat or measurement artifacts. Then, I should classify the blood pressure category and determine whether this is stage 2 hypertension. Next, I will assess cardiovascular risk to decide on urgency and intensity of therapy. After that, I need to check for secondary causes and hypertension-mediated organ damage. Finally, I will outline initial treatment, targets, monitoring, and special considerations like isolated systolic hypertension and low diastolic pressure, ensuring I reconcile any conflicting guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the blood pressure reading and its reliability, because I need to ensure we are not overcalling hypertension due to poor technique or white-coat effect. I should verify that the value was obtained with proper cuff size, arm at heart level, and after at least 5 minutes of rest, and I should repeat measurements on at least two separate occasions unless the reading is ≥ 180/110 mmHg, in which case prompt action is warranted [^116WENig] [^1151kXSc] [^115LpSri] [^112Toaqf].

> Wait, let me verify the classification before proceeding. 166/70 mmHg meets criteria for stage 2 hypertension because the systolic pressure is ≥ 140 mmHg, even though the diastolic pressure is < 90 mmHg, which also fits isolated systolic hypertension, and I should document this clearly in the chart [^115E4HUJ] [^114GWx56].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment intensity without risk stratification. I should calculate 10-year ASCVD risk using the PREVENT equations, and if the patient has clinical CVD, diabetes, CKD, or is already on antihypertensive therapy, they are automatically high risk and do not require a formal risk calculation, which would push me toward more intensive therapy and dual therapy if needed [^115b7hoZ] [^1114T82P].

> I need to check for secondary causes and hypertension-mediated organ damage because stage 2 hypertension, especially when newly diagnosed, warrants evaluation for contributors like sleep apnea, renal parenchymal disease, renovascular disease, primary aldosteronism, and thyroid disease, and I should look for left ventricular hypertrophy, retinopathy, proteinuria, or eGFR decline that would further elevate risk and influence targets [^114ku6PE] [^115FoRED].

> Next, I should review initial treatment decisions. For stage 2 hypertension, I should initiate lifestyle therapy and pharmacologic therapy concurrently, and if the BP is > 20/10 mmHg above goal, starting two complementary agents is reasonable, with ACE inhibitor or ARB plus a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic as common first-line combinations, and I should confirm there are no contraindications before choosing agents [^115GPRbD] [^1114T82P].

> Let me think about targets now. For most adults, I should aim for < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated, and in high-risk patients there is growing evidence supporting an SBP target < 120 mmHg when feasible, but I should monitor closely for hypotension, syncope, falls, electrolyte disturbances, and AKI when pursuing intensive targets, and I should individualize if frailty, limited life expectancy, or intolerance emerges [^113fmD4H].

> But wait, what if the diastolic pressure is too low as I lower systolic? I should double-check the diastolic nadir because observational data in patients with treated SBP < 130 mmHg suggest increased cardiovascular risk when DBP falls below 60 mmHg, whereas a DBP of 70–80 mmHg appears optimal, so I will titrate cautiously if DBP is already near 70 mmHg to avoid harm from excessive diastolic lowering [^11521VcP] [^111Zed9e].

> I should confirm the monitoring cadence. After initiating or intensifying therapy, I will reassess BP within 2–4 weeks to gauge response and tolerability, then every 3–6 months once stable, and I will consider home BP monitoring or ambulatory BP monitoring to confirm control and exclude white-coat hypertension, especially if clinic and home readings diverge by ≥ 20/10 mmHg [^1114T82P] [^116LYeQt] [^112Toaqf].

> Let me reconsider any conflicting guidance. While some older or more conservative recommendations suggested higher thresholds in older adults, contemporary ACC/AHA and ESH guidance converge on treating to < 130/80 mmHg when tolerated, with careful attention to frailty and low diastolic pressure, so I will align with the modern, risk-based approach while documenting shared decision-making if the patient prefers a less intensive target [^113fmD4H] [^111yiHyr] [^112hdz3V].

> In summary, 166/70 mmHg is stage 2 isolated systolic hypertension. I should confirm the diagnosis with proper technique and repeat measurements, assess cardiovascular risk and organ damage, initiate lifestyle plus pharmacologic therapy, consider dual therapy if > 20/10 mmHg above goal, target < 130/80 mmHg or lower if high risk and tolerated, and monitor closely for adverse effects, particularly as diastolic pressure approaches 70 mmHg, adjusting the plan based on patient response and preferences [^115E4HUJ] [^113fmD4H] [^11521VcP].

---

A blood pressure of 166/70 mmHg is **stage 2 hypertension** [^115E4HUJ] and warrants prompt evaluation and treatment to reduce cardiovascular risk [^112Toaqf]. Confirm the reading with **two or more measurements on separate visits** [^113DiYV8] or with ambulatory/home monitoring [^1135yFDZ], and initiate lifestyle changes and medication if confirmed [^112Toaqf]. Target **< 130/80 mmHg** if tolerated [^113fmD4H]; in older adults, aim for 130–139 mmHg if tolerated, and avoid SBP < 120 mmHg [^114FFvZw]. Monitor for adverse effects, especially with low DBP, and adjust therapy as needed [^11521VcP].

---

## Blood pressure classification

According to the 2025 ACC/AHA guidelines, **166/70 mmHg is stage 2 hypertension** (≥ 140/90 mmHg) [^116vxi1a].

---

## Clinical significance and cardiovascular risk

Stage 2 hypertension confers **substantial cardiovascular risk** [^115b7hoZ], including increased risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease [^114eZ6aq]. The risk increases continuously with higher BP, and effective treatment reduces these risks [^113Bc5Dp].

---

## Recommended diagnostic confirmation

Before initiating treatment, **confirm the diagnosis** using one of the following:

- **Repeated office measurements**: ≥ 2 careful readings on ≥ 2 separate occasions [^115E4HUJ].
- **Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM)**: 24-hour average ≥ 130/80 mmHg [^1135yFDZ].
- **Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM)**: Average ≥ 135/85 mmHg [^1135yFDZ].

These methods help exclude **white-coat hypertension** and ensure accurate diagnosis [^112Toaqf].

---

## Initial management strategies

### Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle modifications are **first-line** for all patients with hypertension [^1114T82P]:

- **Dietary changes**: DASH diet, reduced sodium intake, increased potassium intake.
- **Physical activity**: ≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise.
- **Weight loss**: Aim for BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m².
- **Alcohol moderation**: ≤ 1 drink/day for women, ≤ 2 drinks/day for men.
- **Smoking cessation**: Strongly recommended.

---

### Pharmacological therapy

Pharmacological therapy should be initiated for **stage 2 hypertension** in addition to lifestyle modifications [^115GPRbD]. Common first-line agents include:

- **Thiazide diuretics**: Chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide.
- **Calcium channel blockers (CCBs)**: Amlodipine or diltiazem.
- **Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis)**: Lisinopril or enalapril.
- **Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)**: Losartan or valsartan.

Combination therapy is often **required** to achieve target BP [^115GPRbD].

---

## Blood pressure targets

Recommended BP targets vary by guideline and patient population:

| **Guideline** | **General target** | **Elderly (≥ 65 years)** | **Diabetes/ckd** |
|-|-|-|-|
| ACC/AHA 2025 | < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated | 130–139 mmHg if tolerated | < 130/80 mmHg |
| ESC/ESH 2023 | < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated | 130–139 mmHg if tolerated | < 130/80 mmHg |
| JNC 8 | < 150/90 mmHg (≥ 60 years) | < 150/90 mmHg | < 140/90 mmHg |

---

For 166/70 mmHg, the **goal is to reduce SBP to < 130 mmHg** if tolerated, while monitoring DBP to avoid excessive lowering [^11521VcP].

---

## Potential risks and complications

Untreated or poorly controlled stage 2 hypertension increases the risk of:

- **Cardiovascular events**: Stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure [^1166Bgts].
- **Chronic kidney disease**: Progression to end-stage renal disease.
- **Retinopathy**: Vision impairment or blindness.
- **Peripheral vascular disease**: Limb ischemia and amputation.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring is **essential** to assess control and adjust therapy. Schedule follow-up every 3–6 months initially, then extend to every 6–12 months once stable. Use home BP monitoring or ABPM to guide adjustments and improve control [^116wFtcW].

---

## Special considerations

- **Elderly patients**: Use caution with intensive BP lowering; avoid SBP < 120 mmHg due to increased risk of adverse events [^114FFvZw].
- **Low diastolic pressure**: DBP < 60 mmHg may increase cardiovascular risk; monitor closely and adjust therapy as needed [^11521VcP].
- **Comorbidities**: Tailor therapy to individual patient characteristics, including diabetes, CKD, and cardiovascular disease [^115GPRbD].

---

A BP of 166/70 mmHg is **stage 2 hypertension** and requires prompt confirmation and treatment. Lifestyle changes and medication are indicated, with targets individualized to tolerance and comorbidities, and regular monitoring to ensure safe, effective control.

Heart failure risk factors — white coat hypertension: White coat hypertension is characterized by elevated office blood pressure but normal readings when measured outside the office with either ambulatory blood pressure monitoring or home blood pressure monitoring, and the white coat effect is usually considered clinically significant when office systolic and diastolic blood pressures are ≥ 20/10 mm Hg higher than home blood pressure monitoring or ambulatory blood pressures.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — central aortic pressure describes that various techniques allow aortic BP (central BP) to be derived from peripheral BP measurements using dedicated algorithms, and that in hypertensive patients central BP predicts cardiovascular (CV) events with a differential effect of antihypertensive drugs on central compared with brachial BP, although the incremental prognostic value of central vs. conventional clinic BP measurement remains unclear. An exception may be isolated systolic hypertension in the young, in whom peripheral BP may be disproportionately elevated relative to a normal central BP; this occurs in a small fraction of younger people, mainly men with isolated systolic hypertension, and it remains unclear whether such patients are at lower risk than suggested by their brachial office BP.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Definition and classification of high blood pressure in adults — The recommendation is COR 1, LOE B-NR that "In adults, BP should be categorized as normal, elevated, or stage 1 or 2 hypertension to prevent and treat high BP (Table 4)". Table 4 defines categories as: Normal < 120 mm Hg and < 80 mm Hg; Elevated 120 to 129 mm Hg and < 80 mm Hg; Stage 1 Hypertension 130 to 139 mm Hg or 80 to 89 mm Hg; Stage 2 Hypertension ≥ 140 mm Hg or ≥ 90 mm Hg. BP categorization is "based on an average of ≥ 2 careful readings obtained on ≥ 2 occasions", adults with SBP and DBP in 2 categories "should be designated to the higher BP category", and the table "excludes individuals who are pregnant".

2.1 Diagnosis of hypertension

The diagnosis of hypertension requires measurement of BP in the proper environment under optimum conditions. 1 It requires that the patient be relaxed in a chair for at least 5 minutes with the arm resting. In order to establish diagnosis, ≥ 2 readings of elevated BP on ≥ 2 occasions are needed. 1 White coat hypertension is more common among elderly patients possibly related to increasing arterial stiffness, thus, ambulatory or out‐of‐office blood pressure readings is important in the subgroup of patients with mildly elevated in‐office BP readings. 2, 37 The 2017 ACC has set a blood pressure reading above ≥ 130/80 mmhg to be considered hypertensive while the European Society of Hypertension guidelines have maintained a blood pressure reading of ≥ 140/90 mmhg to be considered to be hypertensive. 38, 39 Since high BP is primarily asymptomatic, structured community programs play an important role in the diagnosis and have proven effective in diagnosis patients unaware they have hypertension. 40, 41

### Advancing risk-based approaches in blood pressure management: reflections on the 2025 AHA / ACC statement [^1168APub]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

According to the 2017 Guideline, 68 million individuals had uncontrolled hypertension and were recommended for antihypertensive therapy; of these, 35 million were untreated, and 33 million were receiving treatment but had not attained target BP levels. We advocate for the application of risk stratification to guide priority interventions in both cohorts, informing optimal escalation strategies for those inadequately controlled, and prioritizing interventions to address nontreatment in the untreated population. Drawing a parallel with lipid-lowering therapy, it is both rational and evidence-based to ensure that individuals at the highest risk receive the most effective — and, where appropriate, more intensive — therapeutic regimens. We propose that BP-lowering interventions should be classified by intensity, analogous to lipid-lowering therapies: low, moderate, and high intensity, corresponding to reductions in systolic BP of < 10, 10 to 19, and ≥ 20 mm Hg, respectively. Those at the highest absolute risk should generally be prioritized for high-intensity regimens, provided adverse effects do not preclude their use. Achieving a mean SBP of ≤ 120 mm Hg is essential to maintain the majority of BP readings below 130/80 mm Hg over time, given the natural intraindividual variability in BP. Thus, all patients with untreated mean SBP > 140 mm Hg will require high-intensity regimens to attain and sustain optimal BP control and minimize cardiovascular risk. The substantial expansion of high-intensity therapy should therefore be directed primarily towards individuals at the highest absolute risk and with the greatest gap to achieving optimal BP. Given the heightened urgency in patients with high predicted risk, immediate pharmacological intervention — potentially with dual therapy — should be considered as the default strategy. Naturally, this approach must be tailored to patient preferences and tolerability; nonetheless, the evidence increasingly supports early, decisive intervention in those most likely to benefit.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^116WENig]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

VA/DoD hypertension guideline — office blood pressure measurement protocol and comparative performance indicate that to obtain the values most representative of the patient's office blood pressure, evidence supports that at least two readings be taken on each of two occasions, at least one day apart, and that blood pressure should be measured with a properly calibrated and validated sphygmomanometer and with a standard technique similar to what has been used in studies; a fully automated oscillometric manometer can be set to wait a specified rest time and take an average of several blood pressure readings with one activation, whereas a semi-automated oscillometric device takes a single reading without a rest period after activation; compared with fully automated readings, routine office readings without standard technique averaged 7.0 to 14.5 mm Hg higher, SBP readings using research quality manual or oscillometric technique averaged 7 mm Hg higher with very little difference in the one study in which the order was randomized, and when fully automated oscillometric readings were obtained there was not a significant difference in blood pressure levels when measurements were attended versus unattended.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Blood pressure target selection considerations — evidence synthesis and implementation notes state that the evidence to support an SBP goal < 130 mm Hg is strong and there is also evidence for an SBP goal < 120 mm Hg versus < 140 mm Hg, but this is based on a smaller, albeit growing, number of trials; adverse effects of intensive therapy such as hypotension, syncope, injurious falls, electrolyte abnormalities, and a reduction in eGFR are noted but are infrequent and usually mild. Overall, clinical trials provide strong support for an SBP goal < 130 mm Hg and, when feasible, SBP < 120 mm Hg, and generalization to practice underscores the need for careful monitoring of patients receiving intensive antihypertensive therapy. Individualization of the BP target may be required in patients who have difficulty tolerating treatment, have limited life expectancy, or other features warranting a less intensive approach, and clinical judgment and shared decision‑making are appropriate with careful monitoring for adverse consequences. Achievement of target BP should be based on an average of ≥ 2 readings at ≥ 2 visits, not on an individual BP measurement. For adults with hypertension who are not at high risk for CVD, on balance an SBP/DBP target of < 130/80 mm Hg seems reasonable, and shared decision‑making by clinicians, patients, and caregivers for BP goals should be utilized when the patient has a limited life expectancy or is institutionalized due to high burden of frailty or comorbidity with limited life expectancy. In adults at high risk for CVD, 8 trials compared an SBP target < 130 mm Hg to a higher SBP and a meta‑analysis that included 7 of these trials found significant reductions in CVD and all‑cause mortality with SBP < 130 mm Hg.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — general systolic BP (SBP) targets emphasizes that the evidence strongly suggests that lowering office SBP to < 140 mmHg is beneficial for all patient groups; in some patients lowering SBP to < 130 mmHg may be beneficial provided that the treatment is well tolerated, but SBP should not be targeted to < 120 mmHg.

### Optic nerve ultrasound for the detection of elevated intracranial pressure in the hypertensive patient [^113BMcvP]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

We sought to determine whether dilation of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD), as detected at the bedside by emergency ultrasound (US), could reliably correlate with patient blood pressure and whether there was a blood pressure cutoff point where you would start to see abnormal dilation in the ONSD.

Methods

This was a single-blinded, prospective, observational trial from September 2010 to April 2011. One hundred fifty patients presenting to the emergency department were enrolled. There were 3 arms to the study with 50 patients in each arm: (1) ONSD in normotensive/asymptomatic patients; (2) ONSD in hypertensive/asymptomatic patients; and (3) ONSD in hypertensive/symptomatic patients. Ocular US was conducted on all subjects.

Results

Neither the number of symptoms nor the type of symptom present in the hypertensive/symptomatic group was able to significantly predict the average ONSD before treatment (P = 0.818 and .288, respectively). There was a significant correlation between both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) with the ONSD in all hypertensive patients. The best SBP and DBP cutoff point for abnormal ONSD was 166/82 mm Hg. Decrease in ONSD observed after blood pressure treatment was not statistically significant (P = 0.073).

Conclusions

In conclusion, our study shows that practitioners can use bedside ocular US and a blood pressure cutoff point to help predict whether patients require more aggressive management of their symptomatic hypertension. Knowing the SBP and DBP readings that lead to increased ONSD and increased intracranial pressure can help guide management and treatment decisions at the bedside.

### Arm position and blood pressure: a risk factor for hypertension? [^115LpSri]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to re-evaluate the effect of arm position on blood pressure (BP) measurement with auscultatory and oscillometric methods including ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). The setting was the hospital outpatient department and the subjects chosen were normotensive and hypertensive. The effect of lowering the arm from heart level on indirect systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) measurement as well as the importance of supporting the horizontal arm were measured. In the sitting position, lowering the supported horizontal arm to the dependent position increased BP measured by a mercury device from 103 ± 10/60 ± 7 to 111 ± 14/67 ± 10 mmHg in normotensive subjects, a mean increase of 8/7 mmHg (P < 0.01). In hypertensive subjects, a similar manoeuvre increased BP from 143 ± 21/78 ± 17 to 166 ± 29/88 ± 20 mmHg, an increase of 23/10 mmHg (P < 0.01). Combined results from normotensive and hypertensive subjects demonstrate a direct and proportional association between BP (SBP and DBP) and the increase produced by arm dependency. Similar changes and associations were noted with oscillometric devices in the clinic situation. However, supporting the horizontal arm did not alter BP. Of particular interest, analysis of 13 hypertensive subjects who underwent ABPM on two occasions, once with the arm in the 'usual' position and once with the arm held horizontally for BP measurement during waking hours, demonstrated changes comparable to the other devices. The mean 12-hour BP was 154 ± 19/82 ± 10 mmHg during the former period and significantly decreased to 141 ± 18/74 ± 9 mmHg during the latter period (P < 0.01). Regression analysis of the change in SBP and DBP with arm position change again demonstrated a close correlation (r² = 0.8113 and 0.7273; P < 0.001) with the artefact being larger with higher systolic and diastolic pressures. In conclusion, arm movements lead to significant artefacts in BP measurement, which are greater, the higher the systolic or diastolic pressure. These systematic errors occur when using both auscultatory and oscillometric (clinic and ABPM) devices and might lead to an erroneous diagnosis of hypertension and unnecessary medication, particularly in individuals with high normal BP levels. Since clinical interpretations of heart level vary, the horizontal arm position should be the unambiguous standard for all sitting and standing BP auscultatory and oscillometric measurements.

Continued search for asymptomatic hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD) is emphasized, noting the need to detect HMOD at initial assessment to help "risk stratify the patient" and to review progression or regression during follow-up. It states, "The presence of HMOD demonstrates that BP is elevated and that the patient would benefit from treatment", and that "The regression of asymptomatic organ damage occurring during treatment can often indicate an improved prognosis". Blood pressure (BP) is defined on-page.

### Assessment of the white-coat effect among hypertensive patients presumed to be at goal [^116wFtcW]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Background

There are limited studies that explore the rate of existent uncontrolled hypertension versus a significant white-coat effect. Likewise, few studies have described the physician's response to the results of an ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) study.

Objective

To determine the percentage of treated hypertensive patients referred for ABPM based on discrepant office and home blood pressures who had achieved goal blood pressure and to determine the degree of white-coat effect in these patients.

Methods

Medical records of 222 consecutive patients were reviewed. Patients without a clinic visit since a medication change and those with < 70% valid readings on ABPM were excluded. The proportion of patients at their goal blood pressure during ABPM was determined. Clinic blood pressure readings prior to ABPM were compared to daytime ABPM readings to calculate the white-coat effect. The percentage of patients whose blood pressure decreased by 10% or more in the night interval versus the daytime period was calculated. Changes to antihypertensive therapy were determined for the 6-month post-ABPM period.

Results

One hundred ninety-three patients met the inclusion criteria. Mean (SD) clinic blood pressure was 158/77 (13/10) mm Hg, compared to mean daytime ABPM readings of 127/70 (12/9) mm Hg. Sixty-seven percent of patients were at goal blood pressure. The mean white-coat effect was 31/7 (16/9) mmHg and was significantly greater in patients who were at goal versus those who were not (p < 0.01). A 10% or higher overnight dip occurred in 28% of those at goal. Therapy was not escalated 6 months after ABPM in 91% of patients who were at goal during the test despite a mean post-ABPM clinic blood pressure of 151/74 mm Hg.

Conclusions

The majority of patients with incongruent clinic and home blood pressure readings were at goal after ABPM evaluation. Further study is needed regarding demographic or clinical characteristics that can be used to help predict which patients may be experiencing a significant white-coat effect and are actually at goal in an ambulatory setting.

Journal of Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to goals of treatment, BP targets, elderly, ESH 2023 guidelines recommend to consider lowering BP to < 130/80 mmHg in patients aged 65–79 years if treatment is well tolerated.

### Prevalence and clinical significance of isolated ambulatory hypertension in young subjects screened for stage 1 hypertension [^113gpwos]. Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Little is known about the clinical significance of isolated ambulatory hypertension, a condition characterized by low office but elevated ambulatory blood pressure. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and the predictive value of isolated ambulatory hypertension diagnosed after 3 months of observation for the development of sustained hypertension within a cohort of 871 never-treated stage-1 hypertensive subjects. The study end point was progression to more severe hypertension and need of antihypertensive medication. In 244 subjects (28%), clinic blood pressure declined to < 140/90 mm Hg after 3 months. Of these, 124 (14.2% of total) had low clinic and ambulatory blood pressures after 3 months (nonhypertensive subjects), whereas 120 subjects (13.8% of total) showed low clinic but elevated ambulatory blood pressure (isolated ambulatory hypertension). During the 6 years of observation, the number of end points based on multiple clinic blood pressure readings progressively increased from the nonhypertensive subjects (19%) to the subjects with isolated ambulatory hypertension (35%) and to the subjects with high clinic and high ambulatory blood pressures (65%, P < 0.0001). In an adjusted proportional hazard model, isolated ambulatory hypertension status was associated with a 2.2 (P = 0.02) increase in the risk of reaching the end point in comparison with the nonhypertensive subjects. Final ambulatory systolic blood pressure was also higher in the former than the latter (P = 0.03). Our results indicate that among subjects screened for stage 1 hypertension, individuals with isolated ambulatory hypertension after 3 months of observation have increased risk of developing sustained hypertension in later life compared with subjects in whom both clinic and ambulatory blood pressures are normal.

What are the safe and optimal diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ranges among adults with treated systolic blood pressure (SBP) of less than 130 mm Hg?

Findings

In this cohort study of 7515 patients from 2 randomized clinical trials who had treated SBP of less than 130 mm Hg, a DBP of less than 60 mm Hg was associated with increased cardiovascular risk and a DBP between 70 and 80 mm Hg was associated with lower cardiovascular risk.

Meaning

The findings suggest that a DBP of less than 60 mm Hg may be harmful and a DBP between 70 and 80 mm Hg is an optimal target for patients with treated SBP of less than 130 mm Hg; this topic merits further study.

HYPERTENSION GUIDELINE AND TREATMENT CONTROVERSIES

Hypertension care is complex. Multiple guidelines with different treatment thresholds, diagnostic criteria, and target goals introduce potential program, communication, and management complexity may have contributed to the decline in controlled BP. The 2017 AHA/ACC BP guidelineand the report from members initially appointed to the Joint National Committee (JNC-8)have been the subject of debate and inconsistent implementation by some professional organizations and clinicians. For example, the American College of Physicians (ACP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommended that patients with hypertension who are 60 years and older should be treated to a systolic BP target of < 150 mm Hg, aligning with the JNC-8 writing group recommendation, but conflicting with JNC-7 and the 2017 ACC/AHA BP guideline. It is unclear whether these inconsistencies contribute to reduced BP control. Of note, hypertension control to < 140/ < 90 mm Hg declined more in adults 40–59 years than in those 60 years and older. This finding suggests that factors other than the JNC-8 report and ACP/AAFP recommendations for a higher systolic BP target may contribute to the broad-based decline in hypertension control.

Clinical evaluation in hypertension is to establish the diagnosis and grade of hypertension, screen for potential secondary causes of hypertension, identify factors potentially contributing to the development of hypertension (lifestyle, concomitant medications, or family history), identify concomitant cardiovascular (CV) risk factors and concomitant diseases, and establish whether there is evidence of hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD) or existing CV, cerebrovascular, or renal disease.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^115CjvEw]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately. Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes. Although this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of high BP and should meet the clinical needs of most patients, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient.

### Clinical overview of hypertension and emerging treatment considerations [^115ogRoy]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Managing hypertension is a complex undertaking, where even the definition of the disorder is subject to discussion. Recently, there has been controversy concerning the most appropriate measure to determine health risks associated with hypertension. In the past, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was the prime measure for defining hypertension, but currently systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse pressure have gained favor. Evidence now suggests that all three measures should be considered as part of the hypertensive profile, with the patient's age determining the relative importance of each. Aggressive treatment of hypertension may reduce morbidity and mortality. Data from trials clearly indicate that, for all stages of hypertension, the goal should be a maximum SBP of < 150 mm Hg and a DBP of < 90 mm Hg, with DBP values as low as 70 mm Hg being safe. For individuals with diabetes mellitus, these target values should be even lower — SBP < 140 mm Hg and DBP < 80 mm Hg. As a significant number of deaths attributable to hypertension occur in patients who are not diagnosed as hypertensive but whose blood pressure (BP) is above the optimal level of 120/80 mm Hg, lowering BP levels in this group is recommended as well, with lifestyle modification being first-line therapy. Because controlling BP to < 140/90 mm Hg often requires the use of two or three agents, the tolerability of the entire regimen must be considered. However, with the multitude of antihypertensive drugs currently available, no patient's BP should remain above the 150/90 mm Hg level.

Increasing prevalence of hypertension (HTN) in children and adolescents has become a significant public health issue driving a considerable amount of research. Aspects discussed in this document include advances in the definition of HTN in 16 year or older, clinical significance of isolated systolic HTN in youth, the importance of out of office and central blood pressure measurement, new risk factors for HTN, methods to assess vascular phenotypes, clustering of cardiovascular risk factors and treatment strategies among others. The recommendations of the present document synthesize a considerable amount of scientific data and clinical experience and represent the best clinical wisdom upon which physicians, nurses and families should base their decisions. In addition, as they call attention to the burden of HTN in children and adolescents, and its contribution to the current epidemic of cardiovascular disease, these guidelines should encourage public policy makers to develop a global effort to improve identification and treatment of high blood pressure among children and adolescents.

The accurate measurement of blood pressure (BP) is essential for the diagnosis and management of hypertension. Restricted use of mercury devices, increased use of oscillometric devices, discrepancies between clinic and out-of-clinic BP, and concerns about measurement error with manual BP measurement techniques have resulted in uncertainty for clinicians and researchers. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the U.S. National Institutes of Health convened a working group of clinicians and researchers in October 2017 to review data on BP assessment among adults in clinical practice and clinic-based research. In this report, the authors review the topics discussed during a 2-day meeting including the current state of knowledge on BP assessment in clinical practice and clinic-based research, knowledge gaps pertaining to current BP assessment methods, research and clinical needs to improve BP assessment, and the strengths and limitations of using BP obtained in clinical practice for research and quality improvement activities.

Target blood pressure values in elderly patients

According to recent guidelines, treatment of hypertension in patients aged over 80 years should be initiated when BP is ≥ 160/ ≥ 90 mmHg (see Table 2). The 2018 European Guidelines recommend a BP treatment target of < 130/ < 80 mmHg in patients under 65 years of age. The DBP target is generally < 80 mmHg regardless of age or comorbidities. In contrast to previous guidelines, the current guidelines recommend that SBP should be targeted to a BP range of 130–139 mmHg. These recommendations are based on evidence indicating that the lowest risk of CV events (especially cardiovascular death and congestive heart failure) is observed at these values. The 2018 European Guidelines emphasize that these values may even be applied to patients over 80 years, provided that an SBP between 130 and 140 mmHg is well tolerated.

Table 2
Office blood pressure thresholds for treatment.

The Berlin Initiative Study examined the influence of BP lowering in patients older than 70 years. The study included 1628 patients with a mean age of 81 years who were treated with antihypertensive drugs (636 exhibited normalized BP < 140/ < 90 mmHg). Patients with a BP < 140/90 mmHg had a 26% higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1.26; 95% CI 1.04–1.54) than those whose BP above. The relative risk was further increased by 40% in patients ≥ 80 years (HR 1.40; 95% CI 1.12–1.74), and likewise in patients with previous CV events (HR 1.61; 95% CI 1.14–2.27). However, this risk amplification was not observed in patients between 70 and 79 years (HR 0.83; 95% CI 0.54–1.27). The increased risk in the elderly was particularly influenced by SBP values < 130 mmHg (Fig. 8). The association between SBP and mortality demonstrated in a U-shaped curve using 140 mmHg as reference. There was an increased risk with lower SBP values that reached statistical significance at 125 mmHg, while the numerically increased risk with higher SBP values did not reach statistical significance.

Other Limitations

There are several limitations to consider in the JNC 8 committee's approach to BP treatment (Table 2). Unlike the other professional societies' guidelines, the JNC 8 panel did not address topics outside of their chosen critical questions, specifically given the paucity of randomized trial evidence addressing such questions. While they endorsed the AHA/ACC Guideline on Lifestyle Management to Reduce Cardiovascular Risk, 50 the JNC 8 does not address lifestyle modifications or a timeline for attempting them. Another limitation is that ambulatory BP monitoring, including cut‐off values for diagnosing hypertension based on home BP readings, is not addressed.

Table 2
Recommendations for the AHA/ACC Committee

One suggestion is to confirm elevated BP with ambulatory BP monitoring, such as that recently recommended by the US Preventive Service Task Force. 51 There is in general a lack of guidance on the diagnosis of hypertension and the evaluation for secondary causes. Although the JNC 8 committee offers a titration schedule for treating hypertension, the recommendations are somewhat vague, and there is no guidance for resistant hypertension beyond referral to a hypertension specialist.

We also recommend that the AHA/ACC guideline committee focus on the benefits of the various drug classes and the situations that call for monodrug versus multidrug therapy. Another important area of focus will be the benefit of more‐intensive BP treatment, especially in the elderly and those with diabetes, and the addition of a risk‐based approach to initiating treatment (described earlier). These are all areas that can be targeted by the new AHA/ACC guideline committee.

### Commentary on the 2014 BP guidelines from the panel appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^116xjPrG]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

The recently published article "2014 Evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: Report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8)" (James et al. JAMA 311: 507–520, 2014) has generated considerable controversy. In this commentary, we evaluate the document and compare the recommendations contained within it with those of the JNC 7 and other national and international guidelines. The evidence quality rating approach followed by the article "2014 Evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: Report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8)" (James et al. JAMA 311: 507–520, 2014) disqualified nearly 98% of previous studies from review; as a result, some of the key recommendations were on the basis of expert opinion alone. We are especially concerned that the recommendation to raise the systolic/diastolic BP levels at which treatment is initiated to ≥ 150/ ≥ 90 mmHg in adults ≥ 60 years old may affect cardiovascular and renal health in these patients. Additionally, we recommend that hypertension guidelines should be updated every 3–4 years with a fresh approach to the definition of target BP levels, the use of modern technology in the diagnosis of hypertension, and the treatment of hypertension in special populations not addressed in earlier guidelines.

### Advancing risk-based approaches in blood pressure management: reflections on the 2025 AHA / ACC statement [^115b7hoZ]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Gauging the Impact of the Recommended Risk-Based Strategy

Echoing, to some extent, the 2024 European Society of Cardiology guidelines, the AHA Statement categorically exempts individuals with BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg (stage 2 hypertension) from formal risk assessment. The same exemption is extended to the BP range of 130 to 139/80 to 89 mm Hg (stage 1 hypertension) for those with established cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or any individual with ongoing antihypertensive therapy. These groups are automatically designated as high risk.

With these exemptions, a formal risk assessment strategy applies to ≈23 million individuals, of whom around 2.5 million (equivalent to 1% of US adults) are projected to exceed the PREVENT risk threshold of > 7.5% for immediate pharmacological intervention (Figure 1). These rates are roughly consistent with the application of the European Society of Cardiology guidelines to European adults, where ≈1% to 4% would be recommended for treatment based on their predicted high cardiovascular risk and moderate BP elevation.

Adults without clinical CVD at lower predicted risk (< 7.5%) — systolic management: In those at lower 10‑year predicted CVD risk based on PREVENT (< 7.5%), there are limited data about the net benefit of starting therapy at a lower threshold with an average SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg; therefore, lifestyle interventions should be encouraged first to lower blood pressure (BP). If average SBP remains ≥ 130 mm Hg after a 3‑ to 6‑month trial, initiation of antihypertensive therapy is advised as an adjunct to lifestyle interventions. Supporting evidence includes the PREVER‑Prevention trial, which demonstrated lower rates of progression to stage 2 hypertension (≥ 140/90 mm Hg) and reduced end‑organ damage after a 3‑month lifestyle intervention among participants with elevated BP (120 to 139/80 to 89 mm Hg) randomized to diuretic versus placebo in adults aged 30 to 70 years. For adults age < 30 years, initiation of therapy could be considered at an average SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg after a lifestyle trial, but data are limited. BP should continue to be monitored as BP tends to increase over time, and greater cumulative BP exposure is associated with higher risk of clinical CVD. Observational cohorts of younger adults show lower risk of subclinical CVD among those with BP < 130/80 mm Hg, and other modalities (imaging, biomarkers, or long‑term 30‑year PREVENT risk) may be useful to guide discussions; a history of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy may also identify individuals who may benefit from earlier initiation.

### How well do clinic-based blood pressure measurements agree with the mercury standard? [^111Q5fA5]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Obtaining accurate blood pressure (BP) readings is a challenge faced by health professionals. Clinical trials implement strict protocols, whereas clinical practices and studies that assess quality of care utilize a less rigorous protocol for BP measurement.

Objective

To examine agreement between real-time clinic-based assessment of BP and the standard mercury assessment of BP.

Design

Prospective reliability study.

Patients

One hundred patients with an International Classification of Diseases-9th edition code for hypertension were enrolled.

Measures

Two BP measurements were obtained with the Hawksley random-zero mercury sphygmomanometer and averaged. The clinic-based BP was extracted from the computerized medical records.

Results

Agreement between the mercury and clinic-based systolic blood pressure (SBP) was good, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.91 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.83 to 0.94); the agreement for the mercury and clinic-based diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was satisfactory, ICC = 0.77 (95% CI: 0.62 to 0.86). Overall, clinic-based readings overestimated the mercury readings, with a mean overestimation of 8.3 mmHg for SBP and 7.1 mmHg for DBP. Based on the clinic-based measure, 21% of patients were misdiagnosed with uncontrolled hypertension.

Conclusions

Health professionals should be aware of this potential difference when utilizing clinic-based BP values for making treatment decisions and/or assessing quality of care.

Office blood pressure treatment targets in hypertensive patients — It is recommended that the first objective of treatment should be to lower BP to < 140/90 mmHg in all patients and that, if the treatment is well tolerated, treated BP values should be targeted to 130/80 mmHg or lower in most patients. In patients < 65 years receiving BP-lowering drugs, it is recommended that SBP should be lowered to a BP range of 120–129 mmHg in most patients. In older patients (aged ≥ 65 years) receiving BP-lowering drugs, it is recommended that SBP should be targeted to a BP range of 130–139 mmHg, with close monitoring of adverse effects. These BP targets are recommended for patients at any level of CV risk and in patients with and without established CVD. A DBP target of < 80 mmHg should be considered for all hypertensive patients, independent of the level of risk and comorbidities.

### Thresholds for diagnosing hypertension based on automated office blood pressure measurements and cardiovascular risk [^111hYEtf]. Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

The risk of cardiovascular events in relation to blood pressure is largely based on readings taken with a mercury sphygmomanometer in populations which differ from those of today in terms of hypertension severity and drug therapy. Given replacement of the mercury sphygmomanometer with electronic devices, we sought to determine the blood pressure threshold for a significant increase in cardiovascular risk using a fully automated device, which takes multiple readings with the subject resting quietly alone. Participants were 3627 community-dwelling residents aged > 65 years untreated for hypertension. Automated office blood pressure readings were obtained in a community pharmacy with subjects seated and undisturbed. This method for recording blood pressure produces similar readings in different settings, including a pharmacy and family doctor's office providing the above procedures are followed. Subjects were followed for a mean (SD) of 4.9 (1.0) years for fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events. Adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) were computed for 10 mm Hg increments in blood pressure (mm Hg) using Cox proportional hazards regression and the blood pressure category with the lowest event rate as the reference category. A total of 271 subjects experienced a cardiovascular event. There was a significant (P = 0.02) increase in the hazard ratio of 1.66 (1.09, 2.54) at a systolic blood pressure of 135 to 144 and 1.72 (1.21, 2.45; P = 0.003) at a diastolic blood pressure of 80 to 89. A significant (P = 0.03) increase in hazard ratio of 1.73 (1.04, 2.86) occurred with a pulse pressure of 80 to 89. These findings are consistent with a threshold of 135/85 for diagnosing hypertension in older subjects using automated office blood pressure.

### Harmonization of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology / European Society of Hypertension blood pressure / hypertension guidelines [^117GgAjo]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The ACC/AHA guideline provides 106 formal recommendations and the ESC/ESH provides 122. In both guidelines, each recommendation is characterized by a class of recommendation that specifies the strength or importance of the recommendation and by a level-of-evidence designation. Both the ESC/ESH and ACC/AHA guideline committees voted on the wording and grading of each recommendation. Both guidelines provide comprehensive advice for prevention, diagnosis, evaluation, and management of high BP/hypertension. As a result, the 2 full reports are relatively long (103 pages for the ACC/AHA and 84 pages for the ESC/ESH). For ease of reading, however, the documents are divided into sections and subsections that use a similar presentation format. In addition, a variety of shorter executive summaries and brief synopses have been published. Guideline authors have published articles that expand on individual guideline topics, provide perspective for the evidence underpinning selected recommendations, and furnish quantitative estimates of potential impact based on universal application of guideline recommendations in their target populations. Last, both guidelines are complemented by publicly available slide sets, CVD risk estimation calculators, and other educational tools.

Recommendation-specific supportive text — evaluation of suspected white-coat hypertension indicates that it is reasonable to exclude white-coat hypertension using out-of-office BP monitoring for adults with high office BP (ie, SBP/DBP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg); one caveat is that adults with office SBP/DBP ≥ 160/100 mm Hg should be promptly treated and antihypertensive medication dose titrated as necessary to control BP, and the prevalence of white-coat hypertension is low among those with office BP levels in this range.

### Blood pressure targets in adults with hypertension [^1148paiZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the first update of this review first published in 2009. When treating elevated blood pressure, doctors usually try to achieve a blood pressure target. That target is the blood pressure value below which the optimal clinical benefit is supposedly obtained. "The lower the better" approach that guided the treatment of elevated blood pressure for many years was challenged during the last decade due to lack of evidence from randomised trials supporting that strategy. For that reason, the standard blood pressure target in clinical practice during the last years has been less than 140/90 mm Hg for the general population of patients with elevated blood pressure. However, new trials published in recent years have reintroduced the idea of trying to achieve lower blood pressure targets. Therefore, it is important to know whether the benefits outweigh harms when attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard target.

Objectives

The primary objective was to determine if lower blood pressure targets (any target less than or equal to 135/85 mm Hg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard blood pressure targets (less than or equal to 140/ 90 mm Hg) for the treatment of patients with chronic arterial hypertension. The secondary objectives were: to determine if there is a change in mean achieved systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP associated with "lower targets" as compared with "standard targets" in patients with chronic arterial hypertension; and to determine if there is a change in withdrawals due to adverse events with "lower targets" as compared with "standard targets", in patients with elevated blood pressure.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to May 2019: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2019, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing patients allocated to lower or to standard blood pressure targets (see above).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (JAA, VL) independently assessed the included trials and extracted data. Primary outcomes were total mortality; total serious adverse events; myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, end stage renal disease, and other serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were achieved mean SBP and DBP, withdrawals due to adverse effects, and mean number of antihypertensive drugs used. We assessed the risk of bias of each trial using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: This update includes 11 RCTs involving 38,688 participants with a mean follow-up of 3.7 years. This represents 7 new RCTs compared with the original version. At baseline the mean weighted age was 63.1 years and the mean weighted blood pressure was 155/91 mm Hg. Lower targets do not reduce total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.05; 11 trials, 38,688 participants; high-certainty evidence) and do not reduce total serious adverse events (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.08; 6 trials, 18,165 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). This means that the benefits of lower targets do not outweigh the harms as compared to standard blood pressure targets. Lower targets may reduce myocardial infarction (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.96; 6 trials, 18,938 participants, absolute risk reduction (ARR) 0.4%, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 250 over 3.7 years) and congestive heart failure (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.92; 5 trials, 15,859 participants, ARR 0.6%, NNTB 167 over 3.7 years) (low-certainty for both outcomes). Reduction in myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure was not reflected in total serious adverse events. This may be due to an increase in other serious adverse events (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.59; 6 trials. 18,938 participants, absolute risk increase (ARI) 3%, number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 33 over four years) (low-certainty evidence). Participants assigned to a "lower" target received one additional antihypertensive medication and achieved a significantly lower mean SBP (122.8 mm Hg versus 135.0 mm Hg, and a lower mean DBP (82.0 mm Hg versus 85.2 mm Hg, than those assigned to "standard target".

Authors' Conclusions

For the general population of persons with elevated blood pressure, the benefits of trying to achieve a lower blood pressure target rather than a standard target (≤ 140/90 mm Hg) do not outweigh the harms associated with that intervention. Further research is needed to see if some groups of patients would benefit or be harmed by lower targets. The results of this review are primarily applicable to older people with moderate to high cardiovascular risk. They may not be applicable to other populations.

### Conventional versus automated measurement of blood pressure in primary care patients with systolic hypertension: randomised parallel design controlled trial [^116o8Vht]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Should manual office blood pressure measurement be abandoned?

The mercury sphygmomanometer has been synonymous with blood pressure measurement for more than 100 years. Regardless of advances in alternative techniques for recording blood pressure, mercury seems destined to disappear from the workplace because of environmental concerns. Mercury is prohibited in at least two countries, and a recent report from the European Union suggests that a more widespread ban is imminent. The standard device for measuring blood pressure thus needs to be replaced, but the unknown factor is what comes next. Studies on white coat hypertension have identified a subset of about 25% of the hypertensive population who have clinically important increases in blood pressure when readings are taken in the treatment setting, especially by physicians. Even automated devices such as the BpTRU provoke a white coat response; readings are similar to manual office blood pressure if the observer remains present in the room when the reading is taken.

Studies comparing manual with automated office blood pressure have clearly shown that the increase in blood pressure associated with conventional manual office measurement can be eliminated if the three basic tenets of automated office blood pressure are followed: the patient rests alone in a quiet room, and multiple readings are taken with a fully automated device. The simple presence of an observer seems to increase blood pressure, as marked decreases in automated office blood pressure are evident within two minutes of the observer leaving the room, as seen in CAMBO and in a previous study.

The number of automated office blood pressure readings needed for the mean value to be equivalent to the awake ambulatory blood pressure depends on whether the patient rests before the first reading is taken. If current guidelines for manual office blood pressure are followed and the patient is allowed to rest for at least five minutes, only two or three readings may be needed. However, when five readings are taken at one minute intervals with devices such as the BpTRU, no antecedent period of rest is needed and mean readings are still equivalent to the awake ambulatory blood pressure. Also, readings obtained with the BpTRU are similar when taken at one or two minute intervals.

### Methods of blood pressure measurement in the ICU [^1148HtWV]. Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Minimal clinical research has investigated the significance of different blood pressure monitoring techniques in the ICU and whether systolic vs. mean blood pressures should be targeted in therapeutic protocols and in defining clinical study cohorts. The objectives of this study are to compare real-world invasive arterial blood pressure with noninvasive blood pressure, and to determine if differences between the two techniques have clinical implications.

Design

We conducted a retrospective study comparing invasive arterial blood pressure and noninvasive blood pressure measurements using a large ICU database. We performed pairwise comparison between concurrent measures of invasive arterial blood pressure and noninvasive blood pressure. We studied the association of systolic and mean invasive arterial blood pressure and noninvasive blood pressure with acute kidney injury, and with ICU mortality.

Setting

Adult intensive care units at a tertiary care hospital.

Patients

Adult patients admitted to intensive care units between 2001 and 2007.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Pairwise analysis of 27,022 simultaneously measured invasive arterial blood pressure/noninvasive blood pressure pairs indicated that noninvasive blood pressure overestimated systolic invasive arterial blood pressure during hypotension. Analysis of acute kidney injury and ICU mortality involved 1,633 and 4,957 patients, respectively. Our results indicated that hypotensive systolic noninvasive blood pressure readings were associated with a higher acute kidney injury prevalence (p = 0.008) and ICU mortality (p < 0.001) than systolic invasive arterial blood pressure in the same range (≤ 70 mm Hg). Noninvasive blood pressure and invasive arterial blood pressure mean arterial pressures showed better agreement; acute kidney injury prevalence (p = 0.28) and ICU mortality (p = 0.76) associated with hypotensive mean arterial pressure readings (≤ 60 mm Hg) were independent of measurement technique.

Conclusions

Clinically significant discrepancies exist between invasive and noninvasive systolic blood pressure measurements during hypotension. Mean blood pressure from both techniques may be interpreted in a consistent manner in assessing patients' prognosis. Our results suggest that mean rather than systolic blood pressure is the preferred metric in the ICU to guide therapy.

### Case-based applications of the 2025 AHA / ACC / multispecialty high blood pressure guideline [^111Uraa4]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension affects nearly half of all adults in the United States and is the leading, preventable cause of cardiovascular disease worldwide. The American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and 11 other professional organizations recently published an updated 2025 guideline to reflect the latest advances in the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure. To bridge the gap between this guideline update and individualized patient care, this Special Article presents 4 hypothetical cases of high blood pressure, focusing on management in the outpatient setting. These cases illustrate how to apply a risk-based approach to high blood pressure management that incorporates blood pressure levels, cardiovascular disease risk factors and the predicting risk of cardiovascular disease events cardiovascular disease equations. They also highlight notable updates in the 2025 guideline such as recommendations for lifestyle approaches, initiation of medications, blood pressure goals, primary aldosteronism screening, and management of high blood pressure before, during and after pregnancy. By contextualizing the 2025 guideline within these hypothetical case scenarios, this Special Article provides practical guidance to health care teams to offer the most up-to-date, evidence-based care of high blood pressure.

### Treatment blood pressure targets for hypertension [^115tJF58]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

When treating elevated blood pressure, doctors need to know what blood pressure (BP) target they should try to achieve. The standard of clinical practice for some time has been ≤ 140–160/ 90–100 mmHg. New guidelines are recommending BP targets lower than this standard. It is not known whether attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard reduces mortality and morbidity.

Objectives

To determine if lower BP targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard BP targets (≤ 140–160/ 90–100 mmHg).

Search Strategy

Electronic search of MEDLINE (1966–2008), EMBASE (1980–2008), and CENTRAL (up to June 2008); references from review articles, clinical guidelines, and clinical trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing patients randomized to lower or to standard BP targets and providing data on any of the primary outcomes below.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers (JAA, MIP) independently assessed the included trials and data entry. Primary outcomes were total mortality; total serious adverse events; total cardiovascular events; myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure and end stage renal disease. Secondary outcomes were achieved mean systolic and diastolic BP and withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Main Results

No trials comparing different systolic BP targets were found. Seven trials (22,089 subjects) comparing different diastolic BP targets were included. Despite a -4/-3 mmHg greater achieved reduction in systolic/diastolic BP, p < 0.001, attempting to achieve "lower targets" instead of "standard targets" did not change total mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86–1.15), myocardial infarction (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74–1.09), stroke (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79–1.25), congestive heart failure (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.59–1.32), major cardiovascular events (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83–1.07), or end-stage renal disease (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.81–1.27). The net health effect of lower targets cannot be fully assessed due to lack of information regarding all total serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse effects in 6 of 7 trials. A sensitivity analysis in diabetic patients and in patients with chronic renal disease also did not show a reduction in any of the mortality and morbidity outcomes with lower targets as compared to standard targets.

Authors' Conclusions

Treating patients to lower than standard BP targets, ≤ 140–160/90–100 mmHg, does not reduce mortality or morbidity. Because guidelines are recommending even lower targets for diabetes mellitus and chronic renal disease, we are currently conducting systematic reviews in those groups of patients.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients in the emergency department with asymptomatic elevated blood pressure [^115EK4zn]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Emergency department asymptomatic markedly elevated blood pressure — evidence and management considerations include limited trial support, short-rest effects, and cautions around rapid lowering. A 2008 Cochrane review of 15 randomized controlled trials between 1983 and 2004 found insufficient evidence to support or refute this practice, and two studies suggest that observation with ED medical intervention is reasonable. In a study of 549 asymptomatic emergency department (ED) patients with markedly elevated blood pressure (≥ 180 mm Hg systolic and/or ≥ 110 mm Hg diastolic), 175 of 549 patients (32%; 95% CI 28% to 36%) had a spontaneous decrease within 30 minutes of quiet rest, defined as less than 180/110 mm Hg with at least a 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic decrease; nonresponders treated with immediate-acting agents improved in all but 78 of 549 patients (14%; 95% CI 11% to 17%), and no serious hypertension-related or postintervention adverse events occurred on telephone follow-up 48 to 72 hours after discharge. A VA Cooperative Trial (1967) randomized 143 male patients with diastolic blood pressure of 115 mm Hg to 130 mm Hg, showing no adverse outcomes during the initial 3 months; within 4 months, 4 of 70 placebo patients (6%; 95% CI 2% to 14%) versus 0 of 73 treated patients (0%; 95% CI 0% to 5%) developed significant complications, and within 20 months adverse events occurred in 27 of 70 placebo patients (39%; 95% CI 27% to 51%) versus 2 of 73 treated patients (3%; 95% CI 0.3% to 9.5%), representing absolute risk reduction 36% and number needed to treat = 3. It is generally accepted that rapid lowering in asymptomatic patients has the potential to do harm; however, in selected social or clinical situations emergency physicians may choose to initiate treatment before discharge to gradually lower blood pressure and/or initiate long-term control, noting that a significant portion of patients' blood pressures spontaneously decrease without intervention during the 60 and 90 minutes after the initial ED measurement.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^114eZ6aq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension affects ≈29% of the US adult population, an estimated 72 million people, with a prevalence of > 65% in persons older than 60 years. 1, 2 It is an important risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), accounting for ≈41% of all CVD deaths. 3, 4 Indeed, there is a known graded relationship between increasing blood pressure (BP) and the risk of CVD, starting at 115/75 mm Hg. 5 Based on observational data, an increase in BP of 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic is associated with a doubling of the risk of CVD death, regardless of age. 5 Further, hypertension in middle age is known to increase the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dementia in later life, an important issue given the aging demographic in Western societies. 6 Finally, despite the fact that BP recognition and control are improving, it is concerning that nearly half of the hypertensive population remains suboptimally controlled. 2

With the 2003 Joint National Committee's seventh report (JNC 7) becoming increasingly outdated and the 2011 Institute of Medicine report calling for high‐quality evidence‐based guidelines, 7, 8 the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) was initially appointed to create an updated treatment guideline for hypertension under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Although the NIH ultimately withdrew from the guideline development process at a late stage in the development of JNC 8, the panel decided, nonetheless, to publish their recommendations independently.

The panel aimed to answer 3 questions: Does initiating antihypertensive treatment at specific BP thresholds improve health outcomes? Does treatment with antihypertensive therapy to a specific BP goal improve health outcomes? Are there differences in benefit/harm between antihypertensive drugs or drug classes on specific health outcomes? The committee focused exclusively on large, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as supporting evidence, although 5 of the 9 recommendations in the final report were ultimately based on expert opinion. Partly in response to JNC 8, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) are now in the process of developing official hypertension guidelines. In this review, we discuss the basis of each recommendation from the JNC 8 panel, provide additional insights, and compare these recommendations with guidelines from other professional societies to generate suggestions for the new AHA/ACC hypertension guideline committee.

Blood pressure thresholds and recommendations for treatment and follow-up — The algorithm categorizes normal BP, elevated BP, stage 1 hypertension, and stage 2 hypertension with associated actions and reassessment intervals. Normal BP (< 120/80 mm Hg) receives lifestyle therapy with reassess in 1 y, while elevated BP (120–129/ < 80 mm Hg) receives lifestyle therapy with reassess in 3–6 mo. Stage 1 Hypertension (130–139/80–89 mm Hg) begins with lifestyle therapy and reassess in 3–6 mo, then proceeds to the decision nodes "Stage 1 Hypertension? (130–139/80–89 mm Hg)" and "DM, CKD or increased short-term risk of CVD (10-year PREVENT risk ≥ 7.5%)?"; if yes, the pathway specifies BP-lowering medication AND reassess in 1 mo, followed by "BP goal met?" with "YES" leading to reassess in 3–6 mo and "NO" prompting to consider intensification of therapy while optimizing adherence.

### Association of blood pressure lowering with mortality and cardiovascular disease across blood pressure levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1166Bgts]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

High blood pressure (BP) is the most important risk factor for death and cardiovascular disease (CVD) worldwide. The optimal cutoff for treatment of high BP is debated.

Objective

To assess the association between BP lowering treatment and death and CVD at different BP levels.

Data Sources

Previous systematic reviews were identified from PubMed, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effect. Reference lists of these reviews were searched for randomized clinical trials. Randomized clinical trials published after November 1, 2015, were also searched for in PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials during February 2017.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials with at least 1000 patient-years of follow-up, comparing BP-lowering drugs vs placebo or different BP goals were included.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were extracted from original publications. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaborations assessment tool. Relative risks (RRs) were pooled in random-effects meta-analyses with Knapp-Hartung modification. Results are reported according to PRISMA guidelines.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Prespecified outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, major cardiovascular events, coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, heart failure, and end-stage renal disease.

Results

Seventy-four unique trials, representing 306 273 unique participants (39.9% women and 60.1% men; mean age, 63.6 years) and 1.2 million person-years, were included in the meta-analyses. In primary prevention, the association of BP-lowering treatment with major cardiovascular events was dependent on baseline systolic BP (SBP). In trials with baseline SBP 160 mm Hg or above, treatment was associated with reduced risk for death (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.87–1.00) and a substantial reduction of major cardiovascular events (RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.70–0.87). If baseline SBP ranged from 140 to 159 mm Hg, the association of treatment with mortality was similar (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.75–1.00), but the association with major cardiovascular events was less pronounced (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.80–0.96). In trials with baseline SBP below 140 mm Hg, treatment was not associated with mortality (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.90–1.06) and major cardiovascular events (RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.90–1.04). In trials including people with previous CHD and mean baseline SBP of 138 mm Hg, treatment was associated with reduced risk for major cardiovascular events (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84–0.97), but was not associated with survival (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.89–1.07).

Conclusions and Relevance

Primary preventive BP lowering is associated with reduced risk for death and CVD if baseline SBP is 140 mm Hg or higher. At lower BP levels, treatment is not associated with any benefit in primary prevention but might offer additional protection in patients with CHD.

The new Joint National Committee 8 (JNC-8) blood pressure guidelines were recently published, and there are some major changes from JNC-7. There are also differences between JNC-8 and hypertension guidelines created by major organizations in North America and around the world published from 2013 to the present. In the face of conflicting evidence, it is difficult for practicing clinicians to reconcile these differences and to incorporate new guidance into their practice. This commentary will identify similarities and differences between guidelines, provide some literature context in the areas of differing recommendations, and then provide advice to enhance patient care.

We studied categories of blood pressure (BP) < 120/80 mm Hg as predictors of hypertension 10 to 22 years later by logistic regression analyses with 6 covariates. There was progressively increased risk for subjects with systolic BP 100 to 109 and 110 to 119 mm Hg (vs < 100 mm Hg) or diastolic BP 70 to 74 and 75 to 79 mm Hg (vs < 70 mm Hg). These relations were similar in men, women, and several ethnic groups but stronger in subjects < 40 years old. These data suggest a definition of optimal BP of < 100/70 mm Hg, similar to usual BP levels in children < 10 years old.

Compared with group 1, group 2 had increased risk of cardiovascular mortality, total stroke, and nonfatal stroke with hazard ratios of 1.34 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.77; P = 0.04), 1.89 (95% CI 1.26 to 2.82; P = 0.002), and 1.70 (95% CI 1.06 to 2.72, P = 0.03), respectively. 45 This analysis provides indirect supportive evidence that people with CVD, including those ≥ 60 years, may benefit from an SBP target of < 140 mm Hg. In addition, SPRINT enrolled a high risk population, many with prior CVD and demonstrated benefit to an SBP target of 120 mm Hg.

When considering diastolic targets, subgroup analysis of HOT examined 3080 people with previous CVD and found a 43% reduction in stroke when comparing the groups targeting DBP ≤ 80 mm Hg versus DBP ≤ 90 mm Hg. 34 While a target DBP ≤ 80 mm Hg appears beneficial, there appears to be a J‐curve with respect to DBP targets in CVD. Analysis of the INVEST study showed clear evidence of harm at lower DBP, with a nadir in terms of events of 74 mm Hg. As DBP dropped below 70 and 60 mm Hg, mortality rates doubled and quadrupled, respectively, in patients with preexisting CVD. Therefore, while the overall level of evidence is less strong for BP targets in those with preexisting CVD and is based mainly on post‐hoc analyses of randomized trials, we agree with the new AHA/ACC/ASH statement suggesting a target of < 140/90 mm Hg with an optional lower target (< 130/80 mm Hg) for adults with known CVD.

Table 2
Reasons given by general practitioner for not increasing blood pressure treatment after patient referred by practice nurse with blood pressure above target

Reason was given for 164/166 non-intensification decisions. Numbers add up to more than 164, as in some cases two reasons were given.

Treatment to a more intensive target was associated with a significantly greater reduction in systolic blood pressure at 12 months (primary outcome) (table 3). Systolic blood pressure was reduced by 16 mm Hg in the intensive target arm and by 13 mm Hg in the standard target arm. This difference persisted when we calculated it by using the mean of the fifth and sixth readings (−3.2 (95% confidence interval −5.8 to −0.64) mm Hg) or the mean of the second to sixth readings (−3.3 (−5.8 to −0.67) mm Hg) (supplementary table A). When we took account of the missing values by using multiple imputation, the effect size was −3.2 (−5.7 to −0.65) mm Hg (see supplementary table B for results of other methods). The blood pressure target (that is, < 130 mm Hg or a 10 mm Hg reduction for those with a baseline systolic blood pressure < 140 mm Hg) at one year was achieved in 93 (51%) patients in the intensive arm. Proportions achieving a systolic blood pressure below 140 mm Hg were similar in the two arms (150/182 (82%) v 161/197 (82%); P = 0.59), as were those achieving a systolic blood pressure below 130 mm Hg (103/182 (57%) v 107/197 (54%); P = 0.36). We found no evidence of a significant difference in effectiveness of using an intensive blood pressure target in any subgroup of patients (fig 2).

### Threshold for diagnosing hypertension by automated office blood pressure using random sample population data [^1137JnEp]. Journal of Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Manual office blood pressure (BP) is still recommended for diagnosing hypertension. However, its predictive value is decreased by errors in measurement technique and the white-coat effect. The errors can be eliminated by automated office BP (AOBP) measurement taking multiple readings with the participant resting quietly alone. Therefore, use of AOBP in clinical practice requires a threshold value for hypertension diagnosis. The aim of the present study was to determine an AOBP threshold corresponding to the 140/90mmHg manual office BP using data from a large random population sample.

Methods

In 2145 participants (mean age 47.3 ± 11.3 years) randomly selected from a Brno population aged 25–64 years, BP was measured using manual mercury and automated office sphygmomanometers.

Results

Manual SBP (mean difference 6.39 ± 9.76mmHg) and DBP (mean difference 2.50 ± 6.54mmHg) were higher than the automated BP. According to polynomial regression, automated systole of 131.06 (95% confidence interval 130.43–131.70) and diastole of 85.43 (95% confidence interval 85.03–85.82) corresponded to the manual BP of 140/90mmHg. Using this cut-off, the white-coat hypertension was present in 24% of participants with elevated manual BP, whereas 10% had masked hypertension and 11% masked uncontrolled hypertension. In individuals with masked uncontrolled hypertension, only AOBP was associated with the urinary albumin-creatinine ratio, whereas there was no association with manual BP.

Conclusion

AOBP of 131/85mmHg corresponds to the manual BP of 140/90mmHg. This value may be used as a threshold for diagnosing hypertension using AOBP. However, outcome-driven studies are required to confirm this threshold.

### Blood pressure and the new ACC / AHA hypertension guidelines [^115GPRbD]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The ACC/AHA hypertension guidelines cover virtually all aspects of the diagnosis, evaluation, monitoring, secondary causes as well as drug and non-drug treatment of hypertension. Substantial and appropriate emphasis has been given to the strategies necessary for accurate measurement of blood pressure in any setting where valid blood pressure measurements are desired. Most "errors" made during blood pressure measurement bias readings upwards resulting in over-diagnosis of hypertension and, amongst those already on drug therapy, underestimating the true magnitude of blood pressure lowering resulting in over-treatment. Hypertension is diagnosed when blood pressure is consistently ≥ 130 and/or ≥ 80 mm Hg. However, the majority of patients with hypertension between 130–139/80–89 mm Hg (stage 1 hypertension) do not qualify for immediate drug therapy. The guideline breaks new ground with some of its recommendations. Absolute cardiovascular risk is utilized, for the first time, to determine high-risk status when BP 130–139/80–89 mm Hg (Stage 1 hypertension) and high-risk patient characteristics/co-morbidities are absent including age 65 and older, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, known cardiovascular disease; high-risk individuals initiate drug therapy when BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg. The exception amongst high-risk individuals is for secondary stroke prevention in drug naïve individuals as drug therapy is initiated when blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mm Hg. Non-high risk individuals will initiate drug therapy when BP is ≥ 140/90 mm Hg. Irrespective of blood pressure threshold for initiation of drug therapy, the target BP is minimally < 130/80 mm Hg in most. However, target BP is < 130 systolic amongst those 65 and older as the committee made no recommendation for a DBP target. Treatment should be initiated with two drugs having complementary mechanisms of action when blood pressure is > 20/10 mm Hg above goal.

Treatment of hypertension — Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials indicate that a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) or a 5 mmHg reduction in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is associated with reductions in all major cardiovascular (CV) events by ~20%, all-cause mortality by ~10–15%, stroke by ~35%, coronary events by ~20%, and heart failure by ~40%, and these relative risk reductions are consistent irrespective of baseline BP within the hypertensive range, the level of CV risk, comorbidities, age, sex, and ethnicity.

Hypertension definitions and treatment thresholds — VA/DoD CPG background summarizes evolving criteria and the Work Group definition. JNC 7 defined hypertension (HTN) as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 90 mm Hg, and prehypertension was classified as SBP 120–139 or DBP 80–89. The 2017 ACC/AHA defines HTN as an SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg, a DBP ≥ 80 mm Hg, or both; it removed prehypertension and added elevated blood pressure defined as an SBP of 120–129 with a DBP < 80 mm Hg. For this CPG, the Work Group defines HTN as an SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg, a DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg, or both, and also as SBP and/or DBP at or above 130/90 mm Hg, assuming proper measurement technique. The page notes that treatment benefit has not been proven for lowering slightly elevated blood pressures to a "normal" blood pressure of 115/75 mm Hg, and for those with a blood pressure above "normal" but not in the hypertensive range there is no evidence to date that there is a benefit from treatment.

### Prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in adults: synopsis of the 2017 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association hypertension guideline [^116VRena]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Description

In November 2017, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) released a clinical practice guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure (BP) in adults. This article summarizes the major recommendations.

Methods

In 2014, the ACC and the AHA appointed a multidisciplinary committee to update previous reports of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. The committee reviewed literature and commissioned systematic reviews and meta-analyses on out-of-office BP monitoring, the optimal target for BP lowering, the comparative benefits and harms of different classes of antihypertensive agents, and the comparative benefits and harms of initiating therapy with a single antihypertensive agent or a combination of 2 agents.

Recommendations

This article summarizes key recommendations in the following areas: BP classification, BP measurement, screening for secondary hypertension, nonpharmacologic therapy, BP thresholds and cardiac risk estimation to guide drug treatment, treatment goals (general and for patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and advanced age), choice of initial drug therapy, resistant hypertension, and strategies to improve hypertension control.

### The global burden of hypertension exceeds 1.4 billion people: should a systolic blood pressure target below 130 become the universal standard? [^111ZXUWj]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

In 2010, 1.4 billion people globally had hypertension, with 14% controlled to systolic blood pressure (SBP, mmHg) below 140, which contributes to 18 million cardiovascular deaths annually. Recent hypertension guidelines endorsed SBP targets below 130 or lower for all or some hypertensive patients to reduce cardiovascular events (CVEs) more than the prior SBP target less than 140. In 2016, the Australian Guideline strongly recommended target SBP below 120 for adults at very high risk for CVE or aged above 75 years. In 2017 and 2018, the Canadian Guideline recommended automated office SBP (AOSBP) below 120 in adults at high risk and aged above 75 years (grade B). In 2017, the US Guideline recommended SBP below 130 for all adults (moderate-to-high risk class I; lower-risk grade IIb). In 2018, the European Guideline recommended SBP below 140 for all adults, and, if tolerated, a SBP range of 120–129 for adults aged below 65 years and 130–139 for adults aged at least 65 years (class I). The guidelines were variably influenced by Systolic blood PRessure INTervention trial and meta-analyses indicating fewer CVE when mean in-trial SBP was below 130 versus above 130. Clinicians considering lower SBP targets should be aware that: AOSBP preceded by 5-min rest is approximately 10–15mmHg lower than usual office SBP; hypertensive patients with office SBP consistently versus intermittently below 140 have fewer CVE; benefits of mean office SBP or AOSBP below 120 remain unproven and could increase adverse events. Clinicians worldwide will do well to control SBP to below 140 in most hypertensive patients on most visits, which should lead to mean in-clinic SBP of 120–129.

Prevalence and clinical utility under the ACC/AHA 2017 definition — blood pressure (BP) is categorized "to guide research, prognosis, and treatment", and medication initiation, choice, and titration "should incorporate patients' comorbid conditions and treatment preferences"; adopting the new definition yields "Approximately 31 million additional US adults" with hypertension and "4.2 million more US adults will now have an indication for initiation of treatment with antihypertensive medication", with overall US prevalence rising from "32%" based on "BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg" to "46%" based on "BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg", the largest increase in "younger adults aged 20 to 44 years", where prevalence among men and women increases "from 11% and 10% based on BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg, respectively, to 30% and 19% based on BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg, respectively", a change attributed in large part to "lowering of the DBP threshold to 80 mm Hg", with rationale including observational evidence of "excess risk… with SBP ≥ 120 mm Hg".

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^117H73sr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

JNC 8 Recommendation 1

In the general population aged ≥ 60 years, initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower BP at systolic BP (SBP) ≥ 150 mm Hg or diastolic BP (DBP) ≥ 90 mm Hg and treat to a goal SBP < 150 mm Hg and goal DBP < 90 mm Hg.

Basis of Recommendation

This first recommendation is based on several RCTs evaluating treatment of SBP to < 140 mm Hg versus a more liberal target (140–160 mm Hg) in patients > 65 years of age. 9, 10 In the Japanese Trial to Assess Optimal Systolic Blood Pressure in Elderly Hypertensive Patients (JATOS), 4418 patients between the ages of 65 and 85 were randomized to SBP treatment goal < 140 mm Hg versus 140 to < 160 mm Hg. Despite the fact that the intensive treatment group achieved a significantly lower BP (136/75 mm Hg versus 146/78 mm Hg), the primary end point of combined CVD and renal failure did not differ significantly between the 2 groups.

One limitation of this trial, however, is that it was only powered to detect a 40% relative risk reduction (or an absolute risk reduction from 5% to 3%) in the primary end point. While a 10/3–mm Hg reduction in BP is substantial, it may not be sufficient to achieve a 40% reduction in CVD or renal failure. Also, these patients were followed for only 2 years and the main treatment drug was a long‐acting calcium channel blocker (CCB). Diuretics, widely considered first line along with CCBs in most professional society guidelines, were used in only 12% of the patients. 7, 11, 12, 13 While not reaching statistical significance, subgroup analysis suggested that intensive treatment goals may be beneficial in patients < 75 years old while adopting a more liberal strategy may be safer in those ≥ 75 years old. 10

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^114FFvZw]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — blood pressure targets: In patients (≥ 65 years), SBP should be targeted to between 130 and 140 mmHg and diastolic BP (DBP) to < 80 mmHg, and treated SBP should not be targeted to < 120 mmHg. The guideline specifies a target range because the lower safety boundary assumes greater importance when BP is targeted to lower levels, and when SBP is lowered to < 120 mmHg in patients included in randomized controlled trials (older and higher-risk patients with comorbidities and cardiovascular disease), the risk of harm appears to increase and outweigh the benefits.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Adults without clinical CVD at lower 10-year predicted CVD risk based on PREVENT (< 7.5%) — SBP management approach: There are limited data about the net benefit of initiating antihypertensive therapy at a lower threshold with an average SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg, therefore lifestyle interventions should be encouraged first to lower BP; if average SBP is ≥ 130 mm Hg after a 3- to 6-month trial, initiation of antihypertensive therapy is advised as an adjunct to lifestyle interventions. This approach is supported by the PREVER-Prevention trial, which demonstrated lower rates of progression to stage 2 hypertension (≥ 140/90 mm Hg) and reduced end-organ damage after a 3-month lifestyle intervention among participants with elevated BP (120 to 139/80 to 89 mm Hg) who were subsequently randomized to diuretic treatment versus placebo in adults aged 30 to 70 years. For adults age < 30 years, initiation of antihypertensive therapy could be considered at an average SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg after a trial of lifestyle modification, but data are limited; BP should continue to be monitored as BP tends to increase over time, and greater cumulative BP exposure is associated with higher risk of clinical CVD, and observational cohorts of younger adults demonstrate lower risk of subclinical CVD among those with BP < 130/80 mm Hg.

### Harmonization of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology / European Society of Hypertension blood pressure / hypertension guidelines [^111VK83n]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension clinical practice guidelines for management of high blood pressure/hypertension are influential documents. Both guidelines are comprehensive, were developed using rigorous processes, and underwent extensive peer review. The most notable difference between the 2 guidelines is the blood pressure cut points recommended for the diagnosis of hypertension. There are also differences in the timing and intensity of treatment, with the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline recommending a somewhat more intensive approach. Overall, there is substantial concordance in the recommendations provided by the 2 guideline-writing committees, with greater congruity between them than their predecessors. Additional harmonization of future guidelines would help to underscore the commonality of their core recommendations and could serve to catalyze changes in practice that would lead to improved prevention, awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension, worldwide.

Reflections

Although differences in guidelines are invariably highlighted, it is notable that the core advice in the ACC/AHA and ESC/ESH guidelines is remarkably similar in most important areas of practice (Table 9). Even for the area of greatest difference, the definition of hypertension, there is still considerable overlap. In both guidelines, adults with an average SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg are designated as having hypertension and treatment with a combination of lifestyle counseling and antihypertensive drug therapy is recommended. Those with an average SBP 130 to 139 mm Hg are designated as having stage 1 hypertension in the ACC/AHA and high normal BP in the ESC/ESH. However, both guidelines recommend lifestyle modification for most adults in this BP category, the addition of antihypertensive drugs only being recommended for the ≈30% of US adults with CVD or a 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 10% in the ACC/AHA guideline and only to be considered in very-high-risk patients, especially those with coronary artery disease, in the ESC/ESH CPG. For many other treatment differences, the 2 guidelines provide overall advice that is similar but sometimes discrepant in the specifics. For example, both guidelines recommend combination antihypertensive drug therapy but the specific application for this advice is somewhat different. The ESC/ESH places great emphasis on single-pill combination drug therapy, whereas the ACC/AHA encourages single-pill combinations when possible but notes that many of the combination pills available in the United States use hydrochlorothiazide rather than chlorthalidone and often use a diuretic dose that is lower than what has been used in the landmark treatment trials. Likewise, both guidelines recommend a lower BP target during treatment compared with what was advised in previous guidelines, including in older adults. Overall, the difference lies in the ESC/ESH taking a more stepped approach, first recommending achievement of an SBP/DBP < 140/90 mm Hg before targeting a lower BP, if tolerated, and identifying SBP 120 mm Hg and DBP 70 mm Hg as the lower safety boundary for BP reduction in adults 18 to 65 years of age (130 mm Hg in those with CKD). The ACC/AHA recommends a single SBP/DBP target of < 130/80 mm Hg in most adults but SBP < 130 mm Hg in older well adults, if tolerated.

Known hypertension — prospective multicenter observational data indicate that sphygmomanometric blood pressures obtained in both the office and ambulatory setting were prognostic: both office and ambulatory measurements of systolic and diastolic blood pressure significantly predicted the primary endpoint of fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular events; however, blood pressures were not obtained in the emergency setting and 3 blood pressure readings were obtained on separate visits, which is not feasible in an emergency setting.
