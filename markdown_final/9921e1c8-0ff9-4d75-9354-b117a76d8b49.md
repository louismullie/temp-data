## Question

can vitamin d deficiency cause palpitations

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether vitamin D deficiency can cause palpitations and, if so, how confident we can be in that association and what mechanisms and evidence support the link. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the strength of direct evidence that palpitations resolved with correction of vitamin D deficiency. Then, I should verify plausible mechanistic pathways, especially via hypocalcemia and autonomic dysfunction. Next, I will review supportive but indirect evidence from vasovagal syncope, atrial fibrillation, and orthostatic hypotension. After that, I need to check guideline perspectives on screening and treatment to frame clinical action. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically useful conclusion and outline practical next steps for evaluation and management.

> Let me first confirm the direct evidence. A high-credibility BMJ case report described a 40-year-old woman with severe vitamin D deficiency and symptomatic palpitations who had marked QTc prolongation and presyncope. After correcting hypocalcemia with IV calcium and repleting vitamin D, the QTc normalized and palpitations ceased, which strongly supports a causal relationship in that phenotype, mediated by hypocalcemia-induced repolarization instability [^1123gaLZ].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanism in that case. Severe vitamin D deficiency impairs intestinal calcium absorption, lowers serum calcium, and prolongs ventricular repolarization, thereby increasing the risk of long QT and torsades de pointes. Palpitations and presyncope are common prodromal symptoms in this setting, and correction of calcium and vitamin D reversed both the arrhythmogenic substrate and symptoms, which is mechanistically coherent and clinically compelling for that patient [^1123gaLZ] [^113obtx1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should consider whether this extends beyond extreme deficiency. I need to check for autonomic pathways. Vitamin D has neuroactive properties and may modulate autonomic balance; case-level and physiologic data suggest vitamin D deficiency can associate with dysautonomia phenotypes such as POTS, where palpitations are prominent, and calcitriol has improved orthostatic intolerance and palpitations in selected cases, indicating a plausible autonomic mechanism even outside frank hypocalcemia [^112jthGd] [^116SE9kk].

> Next, I should review indirect but supportive epidemiology. Multiple meta-analyses show patients with vasovagal syncope have substantially lower vitamin D levels and that vitamin D deficiency increases the odds of vasovagal syncope roughly fivefold. While syncope is not identical to palpitations, both reflect autonomic dysregulation and overlap clinically, so this strengthens the biological plausibility that vitamin D deficiency contributes to autonomic symptoms including palpitations [^113m9dy7] [^1149cgWE].

> I will now examine atrial arrhythmias. Observational syntheses suggest a modest association between vitamin D deficiency and incident atrial fibrillation, and a large nested case-control study found that treating vitamin D deficiency to at least 20–30 ng/mL for six or more months was associated with lower AF risk. However, randomized trials have been inconsistent, so causality remains uncertain and any effect is likely modest and context-dependent rather than universal [^114ZR8Nt] [^115kRn81] [^1163DJhQ].

> But wait, what if the signal is mediated by orthostatic physiology rather than primary arrhythmogenesis? I should double-check orthostatic hypotension data. In older men, vitamin D deficiency is associated with a higher risk of immediate orthostatic hypotension, which can present with palpitations on standing; this supports a hemodynamic-autonomic contribution in some patients, though it does not prove that vitamin D deficiency directly causes palpitations in all contexts [^112q9ATX] [^115Fbqzj].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to avoid overtesting. Major guidelines advise against routine 25-hydroxyvitamin D screening in asymptomatic adults, emphasizing that outcome-specific benefits tied to specific thresholds have not been established. However, in patients with symptoms such as palpitations — particularly if accompanied by suggestive features like prolonged QT, neuromuscular irritability, syncope, or orthostatic intolerance — checking vitamin D and calcium is reasonable as part of a targeted evaluation, especially when other causes are not immediately evident [^113VHJ8R] [^113obtx1] [^113mKtpB].

> Let me synthesize. Yes, vitamin D deficiency can cause palpitations, most convincingly via hypocalcemia-related repolarization abnormalities in severe deficiency, and possibly via autonomic dysregulation in broader deficiency states. The evidence spans direct case resolution, mechanistic plausibility, and supportive but heterogeneous observational data, so the confidence is high for severe deficiency with hypocalcemia and moderate for milder deficiency with autonomic symptoms, while acknowledging that palpitations are multifactorial and vitamin D is not the sole driver in most patients [^1123gaLZ] [^113m9dy7] [^114ZR8Nt].

> I should confirm practical next steps. In a patient with palpitations and suspected or confirmed vitamin D deficiency, I would check 25-hydroxyvitamin D, serum calcium corrected for albumin, magnesium, and potassium, and obtain an ECG to assess QTc. If hypocalcemia is present, I would treat urgently with calcium and vitamin D repletion, monitor for QT normalization and symptom resolution, and address reversible contributors such as medications and malabsorption, recognizing that magnesium adequacy facilitates vitamin D metabolism and may be relevant if levels are low [^1123gaLZ] [^113dopje].

> Hold on, I should verify treatment safety and thresholds. Empiric vitamin D repletion is generally safe at usual doses, with toxicity uncommon and typically linked to very high 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels; nonetheless, I need to ensure calcium is monitored during repletion, particularly in those with renal disease or high-risk phenotypes, and tailor the form and dose to absorption and comorbidities, using cholecalciferol as preferred in most adults unless rapid correction or specific indications favor calcifediol or calcitriol [^113MKBT4] [^1147pFqd].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the message is balanced. Vitamin D deficiency can cause palpitations, especially when severe enough to produce hypocalcemia and repolarization changes, and possibly via autonomic effects in broader deficiency. Evaluation and correction of deficiency are reasonable parts of a targeted workup when clinical suspicion is present, while avoiding indiscriminate screening and integrating other cardiac and noncardiac causes of palpitations into the differential [^1123gaLZ] [^113VHJ8R] [^113m9dy7].

---

Vitamin D deficiency can cause palpitations, most often via **hypocalcemia-induced QT prolongation** [^1123gaLZ] and ventricular arrhythmias [^1123gaLZ], and through **autonomic dysregulation** [^112jthGd] that increases sympathetic tone and ectopy. Palpitations typically resolve with correction of vitamin D and calcium, but persistent symptoms require evaluation for other causes. Routine screening is not recommended for asymptomatic adults [^112a2CfF]; test only if symptoms or risk factors are present [^113VHJ8R].

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking vitamin D deficiency to palpitations

Vitamin D deficiency can promote palpitations through **interconnected mechanisms**:

---

### Hypocalcemia and cardiac electrophysiology

- **Calcium homeostasis**: Vitamin D promotes intestinal calcium absorption; deficiency lowers serum calcium, increasing excitability and arrhythmias [^113obtx1].

- **QT prolongation**: Hypocalcemia prolongs ventricular repolarization, precipitating torsades de pointes and palpitations [^1123gaLZ].

- **Clinical evidence**: Severe deficiency with hypocalcemia can cause malignant QT prolongation and torsades, resolving with calcium/vitamin D therapy [^1123gaLZ].

---

### Autonomic nervous system dysregulation

Vitamin D modulates autonomic balance; deficiency may increase sympathetic tone and ectopy [^112jthGd]. Autonomic dysfunction contributes to palpitations and arrhythmias in deficiency states [^112jthGd].

---

### Structural cardiac changes

Vitamin D deficiency is associated with myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis, which may increase arrhythmic risk and palpitations [^113Uz9dq].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the association

Several studies and case reports support a link between vitamin D deficiency and palpitations:

| **Study type** | **Findings** |
|-|-|
| Case report | Severe deficiency with hypocalcemia caused prolonged QT and torsades; resolved with calcium/vitamin D [^1123gaLZ] |
| Meta-analysis | Deficiency modestly increases atrial fibrillation risk (OR 1.31) [^114ZR8Nt] |
| Observational study | Lower vitamin D is associated with higher atrial fibrillation risk [^115kRn81] |
| Case report | Calcitriol improved palpitations in POTS, suggesting autonomic effects [^116SE9kk] |

---

## Clinical manifestations and symptoms

Patients with deficiency-related palpitations may have:

- **Palpitations**: Sensation of skipped beats, fluttering, or racing [^1123gaLZ].

- **Arrhythmias**: Premature beats, atrial fibrillation, or torsades in severe hypocalcemia [^1123gaLZ].

- **Associated symptoms**: Fatigue, muscle weakness, bone pain, and neuromuscular irritability [^1144Ymwq].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

When deficiency-related palpitations are suspected, **evaluate with**:

- **Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D**: Primary marker of deficiency [^114gUrCM].

- **Serum calcium**: Assess for hypocalcemia-related arrhythmias [^116ticwd].

- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: Identify QT prolongation or arrhythmias [^116ticwd].

- **Holter monitoring**: Detect intermittent arrhythmias [^notfound].

---

## Treatment and management strategies

Management focuses on correcting deficiency and addressing arrhythmias:

- **Vitamin D supplementation**: Oral cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol; calcitriol if rapid correction is needed [^111YxQi8] [^1147pFqd].

- **Calcium supplementation**: Correct hypocalcemia to reduce arrhythmic risk [^1123gaLZ].

- **Monitoring**: Track serum calcium, vitamin D, and ECG during repletion [^notfound].

- **Address underlying causes**: Treat malabsorption, liver/renal disease, or medication-induced deficiency [^1144Ymwq].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Prognosis is **generally favorable** with correction of vitamin D and calcium, and palpitations typically resolve. Recurrence is likely if deficiency persists or underlying causes are not addressed.

---

## Preventive measures

Prevention emphasizes **moderate sun exposure**, dietary intake, and supplementation in at-risk groups (elderly, dark skin, limited sun, malabsorption) [^1126dgNJ] [^1146t9Je]. Routine screening is not recommended for asymptomatic adults [^112a2CfF]; test only if symptoms or risk factors are present [^114gUrCM].

---

Vitamin D deficiency can cause palpitations, primarily via **hypocalcemia-related QT prolongation** [^1123gaLZ] and autonomic dysregulation [^112jthGd]. Palpitations usually resolve with correction of vitamin D and calcium [^1123gaLZ] [^116SE9kk], but persistent symptoms warrant further evaluation [^notfound].

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115N7dDF]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — diet and dietary supplementation: Evidence on supplements for AF prevention is inconsistent; several studies show an inverse relationship between plasma omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid levels and prevalent AF, but with supplementation there has been no effect or a potential for greater AF. Although vitamin D supplementation is not useful on a population basis, its use in the perioperative period in deficient individuals reduces AF, and ascorbic acid has been beneficial in reducing postoperative AF in some studies, although not uniformly. The importance of weight management for AF symptoms, burden, and recurrence is increasingly recognized, and analyses of the ARIC study caution using low-carbohydrate diets, which were found to increase the risk of incident AF, regardless of the type of protein or fat used to replace carbohydrate. Promoting a healthy diet is an effective strategy for prevention of cardiovascular disease.

### Vitamin D status is not related to development of atrial fibrillation in the community [^112rAhhd]. American Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common and is an important cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Vitamin D is an emerging risk factor in cardiovascular disease, and vitamin D status is modifiable. Thus, we sought to investigate whether vitamin D status predisposed to the development of AF in a community-based sample.

Methods

We evaluated the relation between vitamin D status and development of AF in 2,930 participants of the Framingham Heart Study, Massachusetts, USA, without prevalent AF. The mean age was 65 ± 11 years, and 56% were women. Vitamin D status was assessed by measuring 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations. Multivariable Cox regression models were adjusted for AF risk factors and season.

Results

During a mean follow-up of 9.9 years, 425 participants (15%) developed AF. In Cox proportional hazards models, 25(OH)D was not associated with development of AF, with a multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio of 0.99 per SD increment in 25(OH)D levels (95% CI 0.88–1.10, P = 0.81). Also, no relation was found in models including 25(OH)D as a dichotomous variable (above and below the cohort-specific 20th percentile; p = 0.59).

Conclusion

In our community-based sample, vitamin D status was not related to incident AF. Our data suggest that vitamin D deficiency does not promote the development of AF in the ambulatory setting.

Endocrine Society vitamin D guideline — screening and thresholds state that the Society no longer endorses the target 25(OH)D level of 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) and no longer endorses specific 25(OH)D levels to define vitamin D sufficiency, insufficiency, and deficiency; the panel did not find clinical trial evidence supporting distinct 25(OH)D thresholds tied to outcome-specific benefits. The guideline also suggests against routine 25(OH)D screening (in the absence of well-established indications), including in adults and children with obesity, in adults and children with dark complexions, and during pregnancy.

### Association between vitamin D deficiency and vasovagal syncope: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111xUrTW]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

This meta‐analysis compared vitamin D levels in VVS patients and healthy controls in addition to VVS occurrence in vitamin D‐deficient subjects. It was demonstrated that VVS patients had significantly lower vitamin D levels and also VVS is higher in vitamin D‐deficient cases. Although adequate studies with a powered sample size are needed to confirm this relationship and the efficacy of vitamin D in the management of VVS, this study can guide clinicians in measuring vitamin D levels routinely in VVS patients.

### Meta-analysis of vitamin D deficiency and risk of atrial fibrillation [^114ZR8Nt]. Clinical Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There are accumulating studies investigating the association between vitamin D status and the risk of atrial fibrillation (AF). However, the results in these studies were inconsistent in regard to the role of vitamin D deficiency in predicting the development of AF.

Hypothesis

Vitamin D deficiency is associated increased risk of AF.

Methods

Using PubMed and Embase databases, we searched for records published before March 2016. Additionally, a manual search was conducted using all review articles on this topic. Of the 587 initially identified records, 8 studies with a total of 27307 patients were finally analyzed.

Results

In the categorical variable analysis, vitamin D deficiency was associated with the occurrence of AF (odds ratio: 1.31, 95% confidence interval: 1.06–1.62, P = 0.01). In the continuous variable analysis, higher vitamin D levels appear to protect against the development of AF (odds ratio: 0.92, 95% confidence interval: 0.87–0.97, P = 0.002). However, the association is weak on the pooled analysis of prospective cohort studies focused on new-onset AF (P = 0.07 and 0.04), whereas the pooled analysis of case-control studies mainly assessing for chronic AF strongly support such an association (both P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Vitamin D deficiency modestly increases the risk of AF. Further studies are needed to determine the if there is a direct causal relationship between vitamin D levels and AF and whether vitamin D supplements will prevent new-onset AF.

### Vitamin D deficiency an important, common, and easily treatable cardiovascular risk factor? [^113Uz9dq]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is a highly prevalent condition, present in approximately 30% to 50% of the general population. A growing body of data suggests that low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels may adversely affect cardiovascular health. Vitamin D deficiency activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and can predispose to hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. Additionally, vitamin D deficiency causes an increase in parathyroid hormone, which increases insulin resistance and is associated with diabetes, hypertension, inflammation, and increased cardiovascular risk. Epidemiologic studies have associated low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels with coronary risk factors and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Vitamin D supplementation is simple, safe, and inexpensive. Large randomized controlled trials are needed to firmly establish the relevance of vitamin D status to cardiovascular health. In the meanwhile, monitoring serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and correction of vitamin D deficiency is indicated for optimization of musculoskeletal and general health.

### Vitamin D deficiency is associated with orthostatic hypotension in older men: a cross-sectional analysis from the British regional heart study [^115Fbqzj]. Age and Ageing (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

orthostatic hypotension (OH) that occurs within, or at, 1 minute of standing is associated with higher risk of falls, myocardial infarction, syncope and mortality, compared to OH that occurs after 1 minute of standing. Whether vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of OH is controversial.

Methods

this was a cross-sectional analysis of 3,620 older, community-dwelling men. Multinomial, multiple logistic regression models were used to calculate the risk of OH across categories of vitamin D status (deficient [< 25 nmol/l], insufficient [≥ 25- < 50 nmol/l] and sufficient [≥ 50 nmol/l]) and parathyroid hormone quintile.

Results

men with vitamin D deficiency were more likely to have OH that occurred within 1 minute of standing in univariate logistic regression (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.40–2.53) and multinomial, multiple logistic regression (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.06–2.15), compared to men with sufficient levels of vitamin D. Vitamin D insufficiency was not associated with the risk of OH. Elevated parathyroid hormone was not associated with risk of OH.

Conclusion

the absence of an association between vitamin D insufficiency and risk of OH and the presence of an association between vitamin D deficiency and risk of OH suggest that there may be a threshold effect; it is only below a particular level of vitamin D that risk of OH is increased. In this cohort, the threshold was < 25 nmol/l. Future work should investigate whether treating vitamin D deficiency can improve postural blood pressure or if preventing vitamin D deficiency reduces the incidence of OH.

### Vitamin D intoxication and severe hypercalcaemia complicating nutritional supplements misuse [^115P4mhg]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Compared with studies among the general population, nutritional supplement misuse or abuse has been extensively documented and reviewed among athletes. The present case describes the misuse of supplements with more than 20 active agents in a middle-aged man, who was not a professional athlete, with resultant vitamin D intoxication and hypercalcaemia.

Globally, there is a growing trend of hypervitaminosis D, a clinical condition characterised by elevated serum vitamin D3 levels. This term is often used interchangeably with vitamin D intoxication; however, some reports have described hypervitaminosis D as serum vitamin D3 level ˃250 nmol/L and vitamin D intoxication as levels ˃375 nmol/L. It has been reported that hypervitaminosis D is more likely to occur in females, children, and surgical populations.

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin in the body, along with vitamins A, E, and K. As a result, it undergoes widespread adipose tissue distribution. Recommended vitamin D requirements can be obtained from the diet (eg, wild mushrooms, oily fish), from sunlight through the skin (via ultraviolet-B-mediated conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol), and are available as dietary supplements (in the form of pills). Given its slow turnover (half-life of approximately 2 months), during which vitamin D toxicity develops, symptoms can last for several weeks.

The manifestations of vitamin D intoxication (in terms of symptoms and signs) are often multisystemic and are largely derived from its resultant effects of hypercalcaemia. Neuropsychiatric features include drowsiness, confusion, apathy, psychosis, depression, stupor, and coma. Possible gastrointestinal features of vitamin D toxicity include anorexia, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, peptic ulcers, and pancreatitis. Hypertension and arrhythmias, such as shortened QT interval, ST-segment changes, and bradyarrhythmias, encompass cardiovascular signs of vitamin D intoxication. Renal system features of vitamin D intoxication include polyuria, polydipsia, dehydration, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and renal failure. Other features such as keratopathy, arthralgia, and hearing impairment or loss have also been reported with vitamin D toxicity.

### Gene-environment interactions and vitamin D effects on cardiovascular risk [^112Bjm7r]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D and its physiological role

Vitamin D plays a role in many homeostatic mechanisms in physiology, in particular in calcium metabolism. Low levels of vitamin D interfere with calcium reabsorption and are associated with increased parathormone levels (PTH). PTH and CVR are directly correlated with such a correlation being consistently observed in studies involving both primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism. The underlying pathophysiology is in turn attributed to different mechanisms, from increased cardiac damage to endothelial dysfunction. At every age, pVitD and plasma PTH levels are inversely correlated, so that reduced levels of vitamin D can cause hyperparathyroidism and thus lead to an increased risk of cardiovascular events. It is therefore possible that the CCHS and CGPS populations, being older and with a broader range of pVitD levels, presented with higher levels of PTH, leading to an increased risk of cardiovascular events. On the contrary, the Chinese cohort showed higher and more homogeneous pVitD levels, and such a stabilizing effect might have then prevented the identification of any effect on CVR.

Regarding specific circumstances for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically with respect to patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (postoperative), AAES 2016 guidelines recommend to initiate vitamin D supplementation in patients with vitamin D deficiency after apparently successful parathyroidectomy. Advise following the recommended calcium intake by the IOM Dietary Reference Intakes.

Vitamin D supplementation — evidence-to-decision considerations: Based on best estimates, the panel judged that the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D are likely small and the anticipated undesirable effects are likely trivial; the panel concluded that the costs of empiric vitamin D supplementation were negligible because vitamin D is inexpensive, and judged empiric supplementation would be feasible and acceptable to stakeholders; they did not find evidence that the effect of vitamin D is restricted to those with baseline 25(OH)D levels below a threshold and concluded that conditioning supplementation/treatment on 25(OH)D screening may create barriers, with the addition of a 25(OH)D testing requirement increasing costs and possibly decreasing acceptability for some.

### Hypovitaminosis D and severe hypocalcaemia: the rebirth of an old disease [^116Hx6Q5]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency, once thought to be eradicated, is becoming a frequent occurence in children, caused mainly by dietary insufficiency. The classical manifestation is rickets, but in infants severe hypocalcaemia may present as stridor, tetany, seizures or, rarely, heart disease. Here, we describe four infants who presented with complications of severe hypocalcaemia secondary to nutritional vitamin D deficiency. (1) Female, 4 months old, several spasms. (2) Male, 8 days old, generalised tonic-clonic seizure. (3) Male, 9 months old, tetany. (4) Male, 4 months old, cardiogenic shock. The cases highlight the importance of child vitamin D supplementation from birth and throughout childhood. We also note that the vitamin D state should be evaluated by the 25(OH)-D value and not the 1,25(OH)2-D.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113VHJ8R]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D — screening in generally healthy adults: In healthy adults, we suggest against routine screening for 25(OH)D levels. In healthy adults, 25(OH)D levels that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials, and this recommendation relates to adults who do not otherwise have established indications for testing with 25(OH)D levels (eg, hypocalcemia).

3.2 Meta‐analysis

3.2.1 Meta‐analysis of vitamin D levels in VVS patients

Random‐effect meta‐analysis was performed for vitamin D levels in VVS patients versus controls. It was shown that vitamin D levels were lower in VVS patients (SMD −1.05, 95% CI −1.54 to −0.57, p < .01, Figure 2 and Table 2). The heterogeneity was found to be high (I 2: 91.01%).

Outcomes of included studies.

3.2.2 Meta‐analysis of VVS occurrence in vitamin D deficient versus nondeficient individuals

Meta‐analysis of four studies to calculate OR for VVS occurrence showed that patients who are vitamin‐D deficient have higher odds of VVS, compared to those not (OR 5.43, 95% CI 2.40 to 12.27, p ‐value < .01, Figure 3 and Table 2). We found high heterogeneity with an I 2 of 79.65%.

3.2.3 Publication bias assessment

Funnel plots were designed for analysis of SMD for vitamin D levels and OR for VVS occurrence between individuals with vitamin D deficiency and non‐deficient cases. As shown in Supporting Information: Figure 1, no apparent asymmetry was seen in the funnel plot for the SMD meta‐analysis. Begg's and Egger's tests also did not reveal signs of publication bias (all p > .05). The funnel plot assessing bias for the OR is illustrated in Supporting Information: Figure 2 and as it is shown, there is an apparent asymmetry. Moreover, Begg's and Egger's analyses did not indicate significant bias (p = .73 and p = .38, respectively).

### Hypomagnesaemia causing functional hypoparathyroidism in rheumatic mitral stenosis leading to sudden cardiac arrest in a young woman [^112XSKj8]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 23-year-old young woman with a known history of valvular heart disease of rheumatic origin, post balloon mitral valvotomy 5 years ago, presented with fever, palpitations and breathlessness. ECG showed atrial fibrillation with fast ventricular rate. A 2D transthoracic echocardiography showed severe restenosis of mitral valve and moderate left ventricular dysfunction. She was admitted for evaluation of fever and control of the ventricular rate. She sustained cardiac arrest due to unknown cause and was resuscitated. When the patient sustained another cardiac arrest, torsades de pointes was detected on the monitor. Blood parameters showed hypomagnesaemia, hypocalcaemia and hypokalaemia, causing functional hypoparathyroidism which was treated with intravenous magnesium, oral calcium and vitamin D supplements. Timely detection of a tachyarrhythmia due to a ventricular origin was life saving, which is rarely seen in patients with rheumatic heart disease and mitral stenosis.

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113mKtpB]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation — screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults states that for asymptomatic, community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults, the USPSTF found that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency (I statement). It applies to community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults who have no signs or symptoms of vitamin D deficiency or conditions for which vitamin D treatment is recommended and does not apply to persons who are hospitalized or living in institutions such as nursing homes. Implementation notes add that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for vitamin D deficiency, and the recommendation is consistent with the 2014 USPSTF statement.

### Association between vitamin D deficiency and vasovagal syncope: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1115SxnK]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Vasovagal syncope (VVS) is the most prevalent type of syncope and its management includes pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions. Recently, studies have investigated vitamin D levels in VVS patients. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aim to review these studies to find possible associations between vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D levels with VVS. International databases including Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase were searched with keywords related to "vasovagal syncope" and "vitamin D". Studies were screened and the data were extracted from them. Random-effect meta-analysis was conducted to calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for vitamin D levels in comparison to VVS patients and controls. Also, VVS occurrence was measured and the odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI were calculated for comparison of vitamin D deficient cases and nondeficient individuals. Six studies were included with 954 cases investigated. Meta-analysis showed that patients with VVS had significantly lower vitamin D serum levels in comparison to non-VVS cases (SMD -1.05, 95% CI -1.54 to -0.57, p-value < .01). Moreover, VVS occurrence was higher in vitamin D-deficient individuals (OR 5.43, 95% CI 2.40 to 12.27, p-value < .01). Our findings which show lower vitamin D levels in VVS patients can have clinical implications in order for clinicians to pay attention to this when approaching VVS. Further randomized controlled trials are certainly warranted to assess the role of vitamin D supplementation in individuals with VVS.

### Effect of vitamin D replacement on atrial electromechanical delay in subjects with vitamin D deficiency [^114BSRLs]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Limited data are available regarding cardiac arrhythmias in vitamin D (VitD) deficiency. Therefore, we aimed to assess whether atrial electromechanical delay (AEMD) measured by tissue Doppler imaging (TDI), which is an indicator for atrial fibrillation (AF) development, is prolonged in patients with VitD deficiency as compared to the control group. The effect of vitD replacement on AEMD was also evaluated.

Methods

In this prospective study a total of 28 VitD-deficient and 56 age-, gender-, and BMI-matched VitD-sufficient healthy participants were enrolled. P-wave dispersion (PWd) was calculated on the 12-lead electrocardiogram. Both intra- and inter-AEMD were calculated by TDI. Measurements were performed at baseline in both groups and were repeated after 6-month replacement therapy in subjects with vitD deficiency.

Results

PWd and inter- and left intra-AEMD were significantly prolonged in patients with VitD deficiency compared to the control group (P < 0.001). While serum 25(OH)D levels were significantly and negatively correlated with left intra-AEMD (r = -0.657, P < 0.001), there was a positive correlation between serum 25(OH)D level and PWd (r = 0.523, P < 0.001). The serum 25(OH)D level was found as the independent predictor of the both left intra- and inter-AEMD in the multivariate linear regression analysis (β:-0.552, P < 0.001 and β:-0.555, P < 0.001, respectively). The serum 25(OH)D level was significantly increased after replacement therapy. While inter-AEMD was significantly decreased (P = 0.013), there was no change in PWD and left and right intra-AEMD (P > 0.05) following replacement therapy.

Conclusion

PWd and left intra- and inter-AEMD are increased in patients with VitD deficiency. The serum 25(OH)D level was found as an independent predictor for AEMD in patients with VitD deficiency. Also a significant decrement was observed in inter-AEMD following vitD replacement therapy. Studies with longer follow-up are needed to investigate whether vitD-deficient patients with prolonged AEMD develop clinical arrhythmia and vitD replacement reduces the risk of atrial arrhythmias.

### Morphological effect of vitamin D deficiency on globular substances in mice [^114ARXRr]. Otology & Neurotology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Many authors, including us, elucidated that vitamin D deficiency was a risk factor for benign paroxysmal position vertigo. We speculated vitamin D deficiency was likely to intervene otoconia formation by globular substance (GS).

Methods

Kunming mice were randomly divided into three groups: vitamin D sufficient group (12-wk standard control diet), vitamin D deficiency group (16-wk vitamin D deficiency diet), and vitamin D supplement group (16-wk vitamin D deficiency diet and followed 8-wk standard control diet). At 12, 16, and 24weeks, blood was collected for measuring vitamin D and macula utriculi were obtained for research under scanning electron microscope (SEM). We randomly selected 10 SEM photographs of macula utriculi in each mouse, counted cilium and GS, and measured diameters of counted GS. The ratio of the number of GS to cilium in each SEM photograph was defined as density of GS.

Results

The diameter and density of GS were larger and higher in vitamin D deficiency group than sufficient group (p < 0.05; p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in density and diameters of GS between vitamin D deficiency and supplement group. The rough and grainy surface became smoother and smoother along with vitamin D deficiency, and reappeared after vitamin D supplement for 8weeks.

Conclusion

GS secreted as a precursor of mature otoconia is affected by vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D supplementation can mitigate the effects in mice. The density of GS, a quantitative method we designed, can quantify GS well.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^112bpWTs]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Sources of vitamin D and cutaneous synthesis — "Most circulating vitamin D is synthesized from skin exposure to ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation", and "Vitamin D synthesis by the skin is the main source of this prohormone for most people", with forms distinguished because "Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) is plant derived, whereas vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is synthesized by animals". Mechanistically, "7-Dehydrocholesterol (provitamin D) is a relatively rigid, 4-ringed structure" in epidermal membranes and "Exposure to UV-B in the wavelengths of 290 to 315 nm initiates the synthesis of vitamin D", after which "Previtamin D isomerizes to vitamin D and then is transferred to extracellular space and dermal capillaries, where it binds with vitamin D–binding protein (DBP)". The complex is "transported to the liver for 25-hydroxylation to 25(OH)-D (calcidiol)", with subsequent renal steps whereby "25(OH)-D is released into the circulation and transported to the kidney bound to DBP for 1α-hydroxylation to 1,25(OH)2-D and for 24-hydroxylation to 24,25-dihydroxy vitamin D [24,25(OH)2-D]", noting that "1,25(OH)2-D (calcitriol) is the active form of vitamin D" and that "Nuclear receptors for 1,25(OH)2-D are present in > 30 tissues".

### 1-α hydroxylation defect in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: remission with calcitriol supplementation [^116SE9kk]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

A 37-year-old woman presented with a history of reactive hypoglycaemia, non-classic adrenal hyperplasia (NCAH), osteopenia and fibromyalgia. After several months of palpitations, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) was diagnosed by tilt table studies. Her heart rate (HR) reached 191 bpm at 60 degrees from horizontal. Investigation suggested increase in epinephrine and norepinephrine levels in response to tilt table. Her 25(OH) vitamin D level measured by immunoextraction radioimmunoassay was 35 pg/ mL (normal 9–54 pg/ml) while her 1,25(OH)(2) vitamin D3 level was 24 pg/ml (normal 30–67 pg/ml). Accordingly, she was started on calcitriol 0.25 mcg orally daily. At her next visit after 5 months, she reported remarkable improvement in her palpitations and had been working full time for the past 4 months. HR both seated and upright was 72 bpm. After 3 months, her 1,25(OH)(2) vitamin D3 level on calcitriol was 40 pg/ml. The authors suggest that 1-α hydroxylation defects should be sought and treated, if present, with calcitriol in patients with POTS.

### Association between vitamin D deficiency and vasovagal syncope: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113m9dy7]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Vasovagal syncope (VVS) is the most prevalent type of syncope and its management includes pharmacologic and non‐pharmacologic interventions. Recently, studies have investigated vitamin D levels in VVS patients. In this systematic review and meta‐analysis, we aim to review these studies to find possible associations between vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D levels with VVS. International databases including Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase were searched with keywords related to "vasovagal syncope" and "vitamin D". Studies were screened and the data were extracted from them. Random‐effect meta‐analysis was conducted to calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for vitamin D levels in comparison to VVS patients and controls. Also, VVS occurrence was measured and the odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI were calculated for comparison of vitamin D deficient cases and nondeficient individuals. Six studies were included with 954 cases investigated. Meta‐analysis showed that patients with VVS had significantly lower vitamin D serum levels in comparison to non‐VVS cases (SMD −1.05, 95% CI −1.54 to −0.57, p ‐value < .01). Moreover, VVS occurrence was higher in vitamin D‐deficient individuals (OR 5.43, 95% CI 2.40 to 12.27, p ‐value < .01). Our findings which show lower vitamin D levels in VVS patients can have clinical implications in order for clinicians to pay attention to this when approaching VVS. Further randomized controlled trials are certainly warranted to assess the role of vitamin D supplementation in individuals with VVS.

It reports that "an estimated 97.5% of the population will have their vitamin D needs met at a serum level of 20 ng/mL (49.9 nmol/L) and risk for deficiency, relative to bone health, begins to occur at levels less than 12 to 20 ng/mL (29.9–49.9 nmol/L)". Additionally, a report based on 2014 survey data found that 5% of persons 1 year or older had very low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels (< 12 ng/mL) and 18% had levels between 12 and 19 ng/mL.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of cardiovascular disease: are we ready for that? [^114iKVgf]. Atherosclerosis (2015). Low credibility.

A general concept of clinical benefit of vitamin D supplementation has emerged from the evidence in prevention of osteoporosis. From the cardiovascular point of view, clinical benefit of such supplementation remains less clear. Studies in vitro and in animal models demonstrated the expression of vitamin D receptors in endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle and cardiomyocytes. Vitamin D has been directly implicated in endothelium-mediated vasodilation, anti-coagulant activity and inhibition of the inflammatory response. Indirectly, it may favor the reduction of blood pressure, myocardial hypertrophy and ventricular arrhythmias. In contrast to these mechanistic findings, cross-sectional, longitudinal and small clinical trials have not been consistent in demonstrating association between cardiovascular events and vitamin D. Besides, methodological issues in the tests for serum levels of vitamin D may also contribute to this puzzle. Hence, in the current state of knowledge, it may be too early to consider or to rule out vitamin D as a tool to either estimate or mitigate residual cardiovascular risk. In this review, we discuss recent advances and potential limitations in mechanistic and clinical evidences that are outlining the framework of interaction between vitamin D and cardiovascular risk.

### Evaluation of pupillary functions in adult vitamin D deficiency patients [^113njFuw]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is a major health problem affecting more than one billion people worldwide. The average daily intake of vitamin D in a large proportion of the population is generally insufficient to maintain normal vitamin D levels. Studies have reported that many cells have vitamin D receptors and that vitamin D also has effects on non-skeletal tissues. Furthermore, VDD has been associated with numerous acute and chronic diseases including neurologic disorders, autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular diseases, malignancies and diabetes mellitus.

Autonomic nervous system dysfunction is a clinical condition that may lead to various symptoms resulting from unbalanced functioning of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Vitamin D is a hormone that provides balance in the autonomic nervous system and has a regulatory role in the neuronal system. Although there is no definite information on the relationship between VDD and autonomic dysfunction, literature studies provide important evidence related to autonomic dysfunctions by reporting gastrointestinal and cardiac dysfunctions in VDD.

Direct and indirect pupillary reflexes are regulated by sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. A robust anatomical structure and a functional autonomic system are needed for healthy miosis and mydriasis. Pupillary reflexes can be evaluated subjectively by the clinician and can be measured objectively with new generation automatic pupillometry devices. Clinically unobservable changes in pupil diameter can be measured with pupillometry devices.

In our study, pupillometric examinations were performed in adult patients with vitamin D (25(OH)-D) levels below normal and compared with healthy controls.

### Cardiac, bone and growth plate manifestations in hypocalcemic infants: revealing the hidden body of the vitamin D deficiency iceberg [^1153bcG1]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Patient 3

A five-month old British Pakistani girl presented to ED with cough, difficulty in breathing and poor feeding. She was born at 35 weeks with a birth weight of 1.75 Kg (9th centile) and required admission to the neonatal unit for 6 days to establish oral feeding. At presentation, she was found to be pale, irritable, tachypnoeic and tachycardic. She had faltering growth (fall across ≥ 2 weight centiles) with a weight of 4.5 kg (< 0.4th centile) and length 58 cm (on 0.4th centile). She was diagnosed with bronchiolitis. Only the faltering growth triggered further investigations which identified hypocalcemia (1.96 mmol/L). Further evaluation of hypocalcemia revealed raised ALP and PTH, and low 25OHD of 12.5 nmol/L (Table 1) and rickets on knee radiograph (Fig. 1f). An echocardiogram performed in view of persistent tachycardia, systolic murmur and cardiomegaly on chest radiograph (Fig. 1e) revealed a structurally normal heart with a severely dilated left ventricle (LVEF of 25%, FS of 15%, global hypokinesia and severe mitral regurgitation), confirming hypocalcemic dilated cardiomyopathy. She was commenced on oral calcium supplements (500 mg/day in divided doses) and cholecalciferol (initially 3000 IU daily, later increased to 6000 IU daily) and transferred to our tertiary center for specialist cardiology care. She was commenced on diuretics and ACE inhibitors.

Nobody had informed mother of the need for vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy and infancy. Her 3 year old sibling had normal 25OHD levels, however mum was deficient with a raised PTH (Table 1).

Summary of family investigations

Overall, five of the nine tested family members had vitamin D deficiency (25OHD < 30 nmol/L) and three had insufficiency (< 50 nmol/L). Six of the 9 members had elevated PTH and ALP levels (biochemical signs of osteomalacia) and received treatment doses of vitamin D. All family members were advised to commence lifelong supplementation.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114gUrCM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to provide guidelines to clinicians for the evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency with an emphasis on the care of patients who are at risk for deficiency.

Participants

The Task Force was composed of a Chair, six additional experts, and a methodologist. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Consensus Process

Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions during several conference calls and e-mail communications. The draft prepared by the Task Force was reviewed successively by The Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee, Clinical Affairs Core Committee, and cosponsoring associations, and it was posted on The Endocrine Society web site for member review. At each stage of review, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated needed changes.

Conclusions

Considering that vitamin D deficiency is very common in all age groups and that few foods contain vitamin D, the Task Force recommended supplementation at suggested daily intake and tolerable upper limit levels, depending on age and clinical circumstances. The Task Force also suggested the measurement of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level by a reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test in patients at risk for deficiency. Treatment with either vitamin D(2) or vitamin D(3) was recommended for deficient patients. At the present time, there is not sufficient evidence to recommend screening individuals who are not at risk for deficiency or to prescribe vitamin D to attain the noncalcemic benefit for cardiovascular protection.

UNDERLYING MECHANISM

Medication and malabsorption

High-dose diuretics are used on a regular base in PAH to prevent fluid retention. Long-term use of furosemide in patients with LHF results in a thiamine deficiency, which is an important vitamin for energy and carbohydrate regulation. Whether thiamine and proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-related vitamin deficiencies are relevant in PAH is currently unknown. A recent study among 343 geriatric patients, shows hypomagnesemia as a consequence of long-term use of PPI and other medications, such as vitamin K antagonists. The number of drugs used was inversely and linear related to the plasma level of magnesium. Hypomagnesemia is closely associated with cardiovascular disease and events. Whether hypomagnesemia is relevant in PAH is not investigated jet. Symptoms of hypomagnesemia are: muscle cramps, palpitations and cardiovascular disease. A frequent used drug in the treatment of PAH is prostacyclin and a common side effect is diarrhea. Prostacyclin activates adenylate cyclase, which increases cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). cAMP causes secretion of chlorine from interstitial tissue to the gut lumen along with sodium and water. Fluid and electrolyte proliferation in the intestinal lumen leads to diarrhea, which causes malabsorption. Selexipag, a prostacyclin analogue, gives identical side effects.

Gastrointestinal edema and fluid retention

PAH-patients suffer from fluid retention, due to RVF, which leads to venous congestion and a low cardiac output (CO) and has as a consequence a low systemic BP. To prevent fluid retention at the kidney level, diuretics are standard in the treatment of RVF. Although it is likely that a strict diet based on fluid and salt restriction has beneficial effects on the management of RVF, this has not been studied until now. Finally, high-glucose and insulin levels have been shown to increase salt and water retention and are closely associated with kidney dysfunction and PAH.

Diagnoses given before receiving POTS diagnosis.

Number of replies: 116. POTS indicates postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.

In assessing overall physician performance, 73.4% patients were seen by doctors who were able to recognize a physical illness before the diagnosis of POTS but did not provide further management planning or therapeutic options. Up to 74.9% of patients had doctors who said that they had never heard of POTS, despite the patient already having been given the clinical diagnosis somewhere else. As many as 17.5% of patients suggested to their providers that their diagnosis might be POTS before the provider brought it up with them (Table 4). Up to 26% of patients subsequently felt that their doctors listened to them when explaining POTS, 20.1% felt their doctors believed the information was irrelevant, and 8.4% felt their doctors did not listen to them. Female patients were more likely to have "some doctors listen to them while others did not" (48.2% versus 17.6%, P = 0.02). Those providers most frequently diagnosing POTS included cardiologists (66.8%), neurologists (11.9%), and primary care providers, such as pediatricians or family practitioners (8.8%) (Figure 6). Once diagnosed, > 80% of patients reported that they were diagnosed with another condition besides their POTS, with migraine, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, vitamin D deficiency, gastroparesis, and mast cell activation syndrome among the most common comorbidities, present in 20% to 40% of patients (Figure 7). Over 80% of patients reported other health conditions in addition to POTS, with female patients reporting more comorbid diagnoses than male patients (84.1% versus 61.3%, P = 0.003).

### Association between vitamin D deficiency and vasovagal syncope: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1167pErs]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This study is the first systematic review to date assessing the association between vitamin D levels and VVS. With the inclusion of six studies, our findings implied that levels of vitamin D are significantly lower in VVS patients in comparison with healthy individuals and also there is a higher chance of VVS in vitamin D‐deficient patients. These highlight the addressing of vitamin D levels in VVS patients and also emphasize that further studies such as observational studies evaluating vitamin D levels in VVS patients and also randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess vitamin D supplementation in VVS patients with vitamin D deficiency are warranted.

Vitamin D deficiency is very common, with about 1 billion people suffering worldwide. In line, a study conducted on 8−18 years old children in the United States found that the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 77.6%. In line, it has been reported that 78.4% of Chinese children had vitamin D insufficiency. Noteworthy, five of our included studies assessed children as their population while Kovalchuk et al. found a rate of 60% deficiency ed in 40 children with VVS. The main contributing risk factors causing vitamin D deficiency are vegetarian individuals, breastfeeding or pregnant women, less exposure to sunlight, and older adults with a higher prevalence of gastrointestinal and renal disease.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^1114pUyw]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency in children — clinical stages and manifestations: The clinical presentation of vitamin D–deficiency rickets includes symptoms and signs of bone deformity and/or pain and may be associated with hypocalcemia and associated clinical features. The disease can be divided into 3 stages; the first stage is characterized by osteopenia and subclinical or overt hypocalcemia, followed in the second stage by rising PTH levels, and in the final stage bone changes become more severe with hypocalcemia again evident. Symptoms range from none to irritability, delay in gross motor development, and bone pain, and signs include widening of the wrists and ankles, genu varum or valgum, prominence of the costochondral junctions (rachitic rosary), delayed closure of fontanelles, craniotabes, and frontal bossing. Vitamin D deficiency presenting as hypocalcemic seizures or tetany is reported more frequently in infancy and adolescence than in childhood; hypocalcemic children may have apneic spells, stridor or wheezing, hypotonia, muscular weakness, and brisk reflexes, and severe deficiency may be associated with cardiomyopathy related to hypocalcemia that normalizes with treatment.

### Alcoholic cardiomyopathy: an update [^115gxkpC]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Nutritional factors

Chronic alcohol consumption often leads to malnutrition and deficiencies in essential nutrients like thiamine (vitamin B1), folate, or magnesium. These deficiencies were thought to be instrumental in AC pathogenesis in the past, but both animal and human models controlled by dietary and anthropometric variables have verified that the cardiac-depressant effect of alcohol is independent of these nutritional factors. For instance, beriberi (severe vitamin B1 deficiency) causes heart failure with increased cardiac output, as opposed to AC, and clinical manifestations usually correspond to fluid retention in the context of right-sided heart failure.

Another nutritional factor classically involved in the pathophysiology of AC was cobalt excess. The 'Quebec beer drinkers' cardiomyopathy' was related to cobalt supplementation to beer that was made in the past. It was described as a form of DCM with severe pericardial effusion, low cardiac output, and purplish skin coloration. Although initially attributed to alcohol, cobalt turned out to be entirely responsible of the disease as cobalt was found to compete at the cellular level with calcium and magnesium and appeared to alter both fatty acid metabolism and the pyruvate pathway. This syndrome disappeared completely when cobalt was removed from the brewing process.

Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of alcohol-induced cardiomyopathy

There are no specific cardiac signs and symptoms in AC as compared with other forms of DCM. Onset symptoms can include acute shortness of breath, orthopnoea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, although some patients may have a sub-acute clinical presentation showing dyspnoea on exertion. Low cardiac output symptoms including fatigue and weakness may be present. In more chronic cases, signs of right-sided heart failure as oedema, jugular venous distention, and hepatomegaly start to develop. Jugular venous pressure can help with the differential diagnosis of cirrhosis in these patients (in the absence of tense ascites that can increase intrathoracic pressure).

Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias are common in AC and patients can present with palpitations or dizziness, as well as cardiogenic syncope. Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia in AC, with a similar prevalence as compared with iDCM. Of note, in a modern series of patients with AC, Guzzo-Merello et al.reported 34% of atrial fibrillation within AC patients compared with 24% in non-alcohol-related DCM. Regarding ventricular arrhythmia, alcohol intake does not seem to worsen the prognosis on ventricular arrhythmias in patients with AC compared with those with iDCM.

### Effect of monthly high-dose vitamin D supplementation on cardiovascular disease in the vitamin D assessment study: a randomized clinical trial [^117KEdCo]. JAMA Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Cohort studies have reported increased incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among individuals with low vitamin D status. To date, randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation have not found an effect, possibly because of using too low a dose of vitamin D.

Objective

To examine whether monthly high-dose vitamin D supplementation prevents CVD in the general population.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Vitamin D Assessment Study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that recruited participants mostly from family practices in Auckland, New Zealand, from April 5, 2011, through November 6, 2012, with follow-up until July 2015. Participants were community-resident adults aged 50 to 84 years. Of 47 905 adults invited from family practices and 163 from community groups, 5110 participants were randomized to receive vitamin D3 (n = 2558) or placebo (n = 2552). Two participants retracted consent, and all others (n = 5108) were included in the primary analysis.

Interventions

Oral vitamin D3 in an initial dose of 200 000 IU, followed a month later by monthly doses of 100 000 IU, or placebo for a median of 3.3 years (range, 2.5–4.2 years).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the number of participants with incident CVD and death, including a prespecified subgroup analysis in participants with vitamin D deficiency (baseline deseasonalized 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels < 20 ng/mL). Secondary outcomes were myocardial infarction, angina, heart failure, hypertension, arrhythmias, arteriosclerosis, stroke, and venous thrombosis.

Results

Of the 5108 participants included in the analysis, the mean (SD) age was 65.9 (8.3) years, 2969 (58.1%) were male, and 4253 (83.3%) were of European or other ethnicity, with the remainder being Polynesian or South Asian. Mean (SD) baseline deseasonalized 25(OH)D concentration was 26.5 (9.0) ng/mL, with 1270 participants (24.9%) being vitamin D deficient. In a random sample of 438 participants, the mean follow-up 25(OH)D level was greater than 20 ng/mL higher in the vitamin D group than in the placebo group. The primary outcome of CVD occurred in 303 participants (11.8%) in the vitamin D group and 293 participants (11.5%) in the placebo group, yielding an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.02 (95% CI, 0.87–1.20). Similar results were seen for participants with baseline vitamin D deficiency and for secondary outcomes.

Conclusions and Relevance

Monthly high-dose vitamin D supplementation does not prevent CVD. This result does not support the use of monthly vitamin D supplementation for this purpose. The effects of daily or weekly dosing require further study.

### Vitamin D deficiency is associated with sudden cardiac death, combined cardiovascular events, and mortality in haemodialysis patients [^1166gNAS]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin D deficiency is observed in the vast majority of haemodialysis patients, and there is accumulating evidence that vitamin D, beyond its effects on bone and mineral metabolism, is also crucial for cardiovascular health and protection against infectious diseases. – In general, vitamin D from either ultraviolet B-induced synthesis in the skin or from nutritional intake is hydroxylated to 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] in the liver. 25(OH)D circulates in up to 1000-fold higher concentrations than the most potent vitamin D metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D, calcitriol]. The renal production of 1,25(OH)2D is tightly controlled by homoeostatic mechanisms but becomes significantly dependent on substrate availability when circulating 25(OH)D are low. In addition, various extrarenal tissues including the myocardium and vasculature have been shown to express 1α-hydroxylase and are thus capable of producing large amounts of 1,25(OH)2D. Of note, locally produced 1,25(OH)2D, the synthesis of which is dependent on circulating 25(OH)D levels, exerts its effects predominantly in an autocrine and paracrine manner thereby regulating approximately 3% of the human genome. –

### Effect of vitamin D supplementation on cardiac-metabolic risk factors in elderly: a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials [^111fmMP3]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study suggests that VDS may improve TC, TG, and insulin concentration in the elderly, especially in short-term intervention duration and in patients with vitamin D deficiency and diabetes. Although the number of studies on this issue is minimal, nonetheless, the finding of this study will enhance our understanding of the importance of vitamin D in the elderly population as well as potentially provide the best evidence-based practical interventions to improve vitamin D-related cardiac-metabolic diseases in the elderly people. Due to, the high heterogeneity between included studies the study results must be interpreted with caution, and large and well-designed RCTs are necessary to validate the review findings.

### Vitamin D deficiency is associated with orthostatic hypotension in older men: a cross-sectional analysis from the British regional heart study [^112q9ATX]. Age and Ageing (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

orthostatic hypotension (OH) that occurs within, or at, 1 minute of standing is associated with higher risk of falls, myocardial infarction, syncope and mortality, compared to OH that occurs after 1 minute of standing. Whether vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of OH is controversial.

Methods

this was a cross-sectional analysis of 3,620 older, community-dwelling men. Multinomial, multiple logistic regression models were used to calculate the risk of OH across categories of vitamin D status (deficient [< 25 nmol/l], insufficient [≥ 25– < 50 nmol/l] and sufficient [≥ 50 nmol/l]) and parathyroid hormone quintile.

Results

men with vitamin D deficiency were more likely to have OH that occurred within 1 minute of standing in univariate logistic regression (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.40–2.53) and multinomial, multiple logistic regression (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.06–2.15), compared to men with sufficient levels of vitamin D. Vitamin D insufficiency was not associated with the risk of OH. Elevated parathyroid hormone was not associated with risk of OH.

Conclusion

the absence of an association between vitamin D insufficiency and risk of OH and the presence of an association between vitamin D deficiency and risk of OH suggest that there may be a threshold effect; it is only below a particular level of vitamin D that risk of OH is increased. In this cohort, the threshold was < 25 nmol/l. Future work should investigate whether treating vitamin D deficiency can improve postural blood pressure or if preventing vitamin D deficiency reduces the incidence of OH.

### Effects of vitamin D supplementation and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels on the risk of atrial fibrillation [^115kRn81]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

The effects of vitamin D (Vit-D) deficiency and Vit-D treatment (VDT) on atrial fibrillation (AF) remain inconclusive. This study sought to determine the effects of VDT and nontreatment on AF risk in Vit-D-deficient patients without a previous history of AF. In this nested case-control study, 39,845 individuals with low 25-hydroxy-Vit-D ([25-OH]D) levels (< 20 ng/ml) were divided into group-A (untreated, levels ≤ 20 ng/ml), group-B (treated, levels 21 to 29 ng/ml), and group-C (treated, levels ≥ 30 ng/ml). The risk of AF was compared utilizing propensity score-weighted Cox proportional hazard models. Among the individuals receiving VDT for ≥ 6 months, the risk of AF was significantly lower in group-B (hazard ratio [HR] 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80 to 0.98, p = 0.03] and group-C (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.0.95, p = 0.007] than in group-A. A subgroup analysis of men > 65 years showed individuals with hypertension had a significantly lower risk of AF in group-C than in group-B (HR 0.79, CI 0.65 to 0.94, p = 0.02) and group-A (HR 0.78, CI 0.64 to 0.96, p = 0.012). A similar result was found in men > 65 years with diabetes mellitus in group-C compared with group-B (HR 0.69, CI 0.51 to 0.93, p = 0.012) and group-A (HR 0.63, CI 0.47 to 0.84, p = 0.002). In what is, to best of our knowledge, the largest observational study to date of patients with Vit-D deficiency and no previous history of AF, (25-OH)D level of > 20 ng/ml with VDT for ≥ 6 months was associated with a significantly lower risk of AF. Additionally, men > 65 years with hypertension or diabetes mellitus had a further decrease in AF risk when the (25-OH)D levels were ≥ 30 ng/ml.

### A case of hypoparathyroidism with cardiovascular complications: interventricular septal dissecting aneurysm in a middle-aged woman [^116ticwd]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 45-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of repeated paroxysmal chest tightness and palpitations for over a year, which worsened during the last 5 h. The patient reported experiencing chest tightness and palpitations over a year ago without obvious triggers, primarily presenting as paroxysmal precordial distension that lasted approximately 3–5 min per episode, with no clear alleviating or aggravating factors. In the past 5 h, the chest tightness symptoms significantly worsened, accompanied by palpitation discomfort, numbness in the limbs, and tingling sensations. She had a history of thyroid surgery, hyperlipidemia, and hospitalization for numbness and weakness of the limbs more than 10 years before presentation; however, the specific details were not available. She denied living in an epidemic area or having contact with dogs in the past. Physical examination revealed that her pulse was 81 beats per minute, and she had clear consciousness, with a surgical scar of approximately 5 cm in length on the neck. Furthermore, she had dry and flaky skin on the hands and feet, clear breath sounds in both lungs, no dry or moist rales, and no enlarged heart borders. Her heart rate was 81 beats per minute, and she had a regular heart rhythm, with no murmurs heard in any valve auscultation area. She tested positive for the Chvostek and Trousseau signs. Moreover, no significant abnormal findings were observed in pulmonary, abdominal, and neurological examinations. After admission, the following parameters were measured and recorded: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 4.63 mmol/L; apolipoprotein B, 1.20 g/L; calcium, 1.42 mmol/L; phosphorus, 1.74 mmol/L; vitamin D3, 17.42 ng/mL; PTH, < 1.000 pg/mL; bone gamma-carboxyglutamic acid, 20.29 ng/mL; serum calcitonin, 7.11 pg/mL; lactate dehydrogenase, 362 U/L; creatine kinase, 320 U/L; and creatine kinase isoenzyme, 17.8 U/L (Table 1). Routine blood, thyroid function, autoimmune rheumatism, hydatid cyst fluid antigen, and indirect hemagglutination tests; myoglobin, troponin, and plasma-dimer assays; and other biochemical tests revealed no abnormalities. Meanwhile, electrocardiography revealed sinus rhythm, ST–T changes and a long QTc interval (Fig. 1). Thyroid ultrasound revealed a left thyroid mixed nodule (C-TIRADS grade 3). No significant abnormality was detected in the bilateral parathyroid areas, but primary HypoPT could not be excluded. Cardiac ultrasound revealed an internal echolucent chamber in the ventricular septum-inferior wall, suggesting the possibility of dissecting aneurysm formation without excluding congenital possibilities. Thus, further examination was recommended. Left ventricular systolic function was normal (Fig. 2). Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the aorta and abdominal aortic revealed that the ventricular septum-inferior wall aneurysm was possibly a dissecting aneurysm (Fig. 3); moreover, stenosis of the abdominal aortic was observed. No abnormalities were detected on whole-abdomen computed tomography. Parathyroid and myocardial imaging indicated no findings of hyperparathyroidism and reduced blood flow in the left ventricular anterior interventricular septum myocardium. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identified possible ventricular septum-inferior wall dissecting aneurysm formation (Fig. 4). Coronary angiography revealed diffuse sclerosis and stenosis of approximately 30–40% of the proximal-to-middle segment of the left anterior descending artery and limited stenosis of approximately 50% of the middle segment of the left circumflex artery and right coronary artery. Blood flow was TIMI grade 3 in all areas, with no other significant stenosis identified.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114L9QtN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society vitamin D guideline — scope and methods: The objective is to develop clinical guidelines for the use of vitamin D (cholecalciferol [vitamin D3] or ergocalciferol [vitamin D2]) to lower disease risk in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing. Background notes associations between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations and multiple conditions, while acknowledging that the optimal vitamin D intake and the role of testing for 25(OH)D for disease prevention remain uncertain. Methods state that the panel defined "empiric supplementation" as vitamin D intake that exceeds Dietary Reference Intakes and is implemented without 25(OH)D testing, used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess certainty and guide recommendations, and clarify that the process was not designed to replace current Dietary Reference Intakes for vitamin D.

### Association between vitamin D deficiency and vasovagal syncope: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113ykiUT]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

2.5 Statistical analysis

We used the random‐effect meta‐analysis to compare vitamin D levels between VVS patients and controls by calculating the standardized mean difference (SMD) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). To compare the rate of VVS between vitamin D‐deficient and non‐vitamin D‐deficient individuals, we calculated the odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI using the random‐effects DerSimonian‐Laird model. As there was a zero event in one of the studies, outcome, rare event analysis by Peto's method was performed. A p Value of less than.05 was considered statistically significant. For the age variable, we used the formulas proposed by Luo et al.and Wan et al.to recalculate the mean and standard deviation (SD) from the median and interquartile range (IQR). Mean and SDs were merged in appropriate conditions using the Cochrane Handbook.

The degree of heterogeneity between the samples was assessed based on Cochrane's Q. Higgins' I‐squared test was used to determine the heterogeneity by different percentages of variation — low: 0%−25%, moderate: 26%−75%, and high: 75%−100%. The publication bias was assessed visually by inspecting funnel plots. Moreover, Egger's and Begg's, statistical tests were used for publication bias. All analyses in this study were performed using STATA version 17.0 (Stata Corp).

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^1163DJhQ]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular risk

Convergent evidence from MR studies and RCTs suggests that vitamin D supplementation does not decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), especially in vitamin D–replete adults. This conclusion may also apply to those with vitamin D deficiency based on subgroup analyses of the ViDA and VITAL trials. However, both studies recruited very few participants with severe vitamin D deficiency, rendering these conclusions uncertain. These null findings were corroborated by a meta-analysis of 21 RCTs. Nonetheless, more recent findings might suggest some small benefits. A detailed analysis of the ViDA trial found some modest benefits on central (but not peripheral) blood pressure, but the implications of this observation are limited because of the small scale of this ViDA substudy. The FIND trial failed to note a reduction in the number of major CV events, which was one of the two primary end points; however, subsequent exploratory analyses revealed that high-dose vitamin D supplementation might result in benefits in atrial fibrillation prevention in older individuals, even in case of relatively high baseline 25(OH)D concentrations. In the D-Health trial, the overall rate of major CV — and especially the rate of myocardial infarction and coronary revascularization — was lower in the intervention group compared to the placebo group, although the absolute risk difference was small, and the CI was consistent with a null finding (hazard ratio 0.91; 95% CI, 0.81–1.01); moreover, the protective benefits could be higher in those taking CV drugs at baseline.

### 2023 HRS expert consensus statement on the management of arrhythmias during pregnancy [^113obtx1]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

QT-prolonging medications and vitamin D considerations in pregnancy include that opioids, antiarrhythmic drugs, and polypharmacy with multiple QT-prolonging drugs have been associated with excessive QT prolongation, especially in the presence of electrolyte, mineral, or vitamin D deficiencies, and these should be corrected if possible. While therapeutic response is seen in the patient, 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels themselves rarely show a major recovery until after the pregnancy, and thus repeat assessment of levels is not required. Vitamin D serves a critical function of promoting absorption of calcium and magnesium from the gut, and it can be difficult to correct these when 25-hydroxy vitamin D is low.

### Cinacalcet reverses short QT interval in familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 1 [^116J8wCv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Her daughter was aged 20yrs at diagnosis with a past medical history of syncope at 16-yrs while practicing sport but did not have any further investigations. She only complained of palpitations (even during rest) during 2 to 3 minutes, occuring 3 times monthly. She had a marked hypercalcemia (2.95 and 2.87 mmol/l) with hypophosphatemia (0.75 mmol/l, normal range: 0.81–1.45), normal high PTH 1–84 (57.5 pg/ml, NR 15.1–65.1), low vitamin D level (35 nmol/l, NR: 75–250), and CCCR < 0.01. Albumin and magnesemia were in the normal range. Parathyroid ultrasound and scintigraphy were negative. ECG revealed a short QT interval of 340 ms (corrected with Bazzet's formula) (Fig. 1).

Her son aged 19-yrs had no past medical history and presented with an asymptomatic hypercalcemia (2.88 mmol/l and 2.85 mmol/l). Serum phosphate was normal (0.96 mmol/l), PTH was in the upper range limit (56.6 pg/ml), vitamin D was low (31 nmol/l) and CCCR was decreased (0.006). ECG showed atrial extrasystoles and a short QT interval (340 ms).

Testing all the family members for mutations of KCNH2, KCNQ1, KCNJ2, CACNA1C, CACNB2 and CACNA2D1 to identify a genetic cause of the short QT interval syndrome, did not identify any pathogenic variants. Other secondary causes of a shortened QT interval were also absent (hyperkaliemia, acidosis, hyperthermia, intake of drugs, e.g. digoxin). Transthoracic echocardiography was normal in the 3 cases.

A multidisciplinary meeting confirmed that the ECG modifications could be the source of severe heart arrhythmias with a risk of sudden death. Because oral hyperhydration was ineffective in controlling hypercalcemia in the patients, a decision to treat these patients with calcimimetic was taken after performing a functional test to ensure a response to the treatment.

Key points

Men with vitamin D deficiency had increased risk of OH that occurred within 1 minute of standing.
Vitamin D insufficiency and elevated PTH were not statistically significantly associated with risk of OH.
The controversy in this area of research may be explained, in part, by different definitions of vitamin D deficiency.
Thresholds to define vitamin D deficiency may need to be disease or adverse outcome-specific.
Interventional studies may clarify whether vitamin D supplementation can improve OH.

### Malignant prolongation of the QTc interval due to severe vitamin D deficiency: an unusual presentation [^1123gaLZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Long QT syndrome with Torsades de Pointes (TdP) is a life-threatening polymorphic ventricular arrhythmia. The corrected QT (QTc) prolongation > 500 milliseconds (ms) has been associated with TdP. Hypocalcaemia due to severe vitamin D deficiency is an uncommon cause of acquired long QT. We hereby present a case of a 40-year-old woman with sensorineural deafness and having symptoms of palpitations and presyncope. She had a QTc interval of 556 ms (reference range, QTc 451–470 ms in adult healthy woman) on 24-hour Holter analysis. Genetic analysis for congenital long QT syndrome was negative. She was diagnosed with severe hypocalcaemia secondary to severe vitamin D deficiency. After treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate, followed by oral vitamin D and calcium supplementation, the QTc became normalised and no further episode of palpitations or presyncope occurred. The causes of vitamin D deficiency was due to inadequate exposure to sunlight and a strict vegan diet.

### Evaluation of pupillary functions in adult vitamin D deficiency patients [^112jthGd]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Vitamin D is a neuroactive steroid hormone that plays a very important role in the central nervous system and autonomic balance. Pupillary functions are an important clinical finding in which the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems can be monitored. Objective and reproducible results can be obtained by measuring pupil diameter with automatic pupillometers developed in recent years. In our study, the effects of VDI and VDD on pupillary reflexes in adults were examined with an automatic pupillometer. Accordingly, no significant difference was observed in mesopic and scotopic pupil diameters in VDI and VDD compared to healthy controls, but dynamic functions and photopic diameters were found to be impaired.

Studies have reported that vitamin D is an important component of cerebral activity in both embryonic and adult periods. Many neurologic and psychiatric diseases including sleep disorders, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease have been associated with low vitamin D levels. In these studies, the neuroprotective functions of vitamin D are mentioned. Vitamin D supplementation during embryonic and neonatal periods has also been reported to reduce the risk of some cerebral diseases.

In the literature it is reported that VDI and VDD are associated with autonomic dysfunctions. Maser et al. reported that VDD was associated with decreased parasympathetic function in a study conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Vitamin D is involved in the regulation of the enteric nervous system and affects gastric emptying. Calcitriol treatment of a patient with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome improved orthostatic intolerance and palpitations. Current studies suggest that vitamin D has important regulatory functions in the autonomic nervous system and therapeutic benefits.

Pupillometric studies have been performed in patients with vitamin A deficiency as vitamin deficiency. Palmer et al. reported that carotenoid supplementation regulated pupillary functions in a study conducted in pediatric vitamin A deficiency patients. However, to our knowledge, there is no example of a study examining the effect of VDD on pupillary functions in adults. However, Biçer et al. reported significant losses in pupillary functions in pediatric VDD patients compared to healthy controls. According to the results of our and their study, under photopic conditions, VDD patients had a larger pupil diameter compared to healthy controls. This suggests that dysautonomia affecting especially the parasympathetic nervous system may be observed due to VDD.

In conclusion, VDT is a rare but life-threatening event mostly caused by unintentional overdosing due to pharmaceutical products. The prescriber and dispenser should avoid unlicensed vitamin D products. VDT should always be considered a differential diagnosis when evaluating patients with hypercalcemia. Future studies should encompass the evaluation of concurrent conditions that increase the risk of VDT and include the evaluation of classic and nonclassic adverse events for VDT.

### Association between vitamin D deficiency and vasovagal syncope: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Rx9to]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Syncope is a common chief complaint in patients visiting emergency departments, mostly in women with a peak age of 15 years. Syncope is divided into three categories based on the cause of occurrence — reflex (neurally mediated) syncope, syncope due to orthostatic hypotension, and cardiac syncope. Vasovagal syncope (VVS), the most prevalent type of reflex syncope, is a transient loss of consciousness characterized by a sudden reduction in heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) and can be associated with negative or positive head‐up tilt test (HUTT). Diagnosis of VVS is mainly based on physical examination and careful history‐taking without the need for further neurologic examinations in typical forms of VVS; however, HUTT can be assistive in some cases. The positive HUTT is classified by VVS International Study (VASIS) criteria. These criteria categorize VVS based on BP and HR changes in HUTT which can be summarized as (1) mixed BP and HR decrease without severe bradycardia; (2A) cardioinhibitory response (BP fall before HR); (2B) severe cardioinhibitory response (HR fall before BP and/or asystole); (3) BP decrease without HR fall.

In patients with a diagnosis of VVS, the management ranges from lifestyle modifications and counterpressure maneuvers to pharmacologic prevention. Lifestyle changes are the first line of treatment in most patients.VVS triggers include but are not limited to a standing posture, heat exposure, the sight of blood, and fear. Although triggers of VVS are well‐known, there is a lack of evidence regarding predisposing factors in these patients.

Vitamin D is a key player in the pathogenesis of several diseases. Hypovitaminosis D or vitamin D deficiency (serum 25‐hydroxyvitamin D < 50 nmol/L or < 20 ng/mL) is related to prolonged hospitalization and mortality, development of chronic diseases, and worse outcomes. The exact link between vitamin D levels or hypovitaminosis D and VVS occurrence is still unknown. Some studies reported lower serum vitamin D and a higher rate of hypovitaminosis D in patients with VVS. However, this association has not been yet confirmed in a pooled analysis. In this study, we compared the vitamin D levels between VVS patients and controls. Moreover, the rate of VVS was compared between patients with vitamin D deficiency and non‐vitamin D‐deficient ones.

Potential harms — screening and treatment considerations: Screening may misclassify persons with a vitamin D deficiency because of uncertainty about the cutoff for deficiency and variability of available testing assays, which can lead to overdiagnosis or underdiagnosis. A rare but potential harm of treatment with vitamin D is toxicity characterized by marked hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypercalciuria; however, the 25(OH)D level associated with toxicity (typically > 150 ng/mL) is well above the level considered sufficient, and in general, treatment with oral vitamin D does not seem to be associated with serious harms.

A systematic search in international online databases including Scopus, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science was conducted from inception to February 2023. No limitations or filters were applied in the search. Search terms were "syncope" and "vitamin D" and other related terms which are available in Supporting Information: Table 1.

Duplicate studies were removed. Two reviewers (A. K. and A. H. B.) used titles and abstracts to select appropriate studies matching predefined inclusion criteria. Afterward, full‐length articles of included studies in the first step were evaluated to find the final included studies. Finally, we evaluated the reference list of included studies.

2.2 Inclusion and exclusion criteria

We included any clinical studies measuring vitamin D levels in VVS patients and healthy individuals. We excluded studies without controls and studies without reporting the circulating levels of vitamin D in VVS patients and healthy individuals. Moreover, non‐English abstracts, preclinical evaluations, reviews, case reports, conference abstracts, and letters were excluded.

2.3 Data extraction

Independent reviewers (A. K. and A. H. B.) extracted data from each study in a predefined sheet. Extracted items were: (1) study characteristics: study design, publication year, first author's name, and location, (2) population characteristics: patients with VVS and healthy controls' population characteristics, sample size (total, VVS, and controls), mean age, and male sex percentage, and (3) vitamin D evaluations: mean serum vitamin D levels in VVS patients and healthy controls and rate of vitamin D deficiency in each group, and (4) findings of included studies.

2.4 Quality assessment

We used the "Newcastle‐Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale" (NOS) for observational studies to evaluate the risk of bias in included studies (A. K. and A. H. B). Three categories of bias according to NOS are selection, compatibility, and outcome. On this scale, a score of ≥ 7 was considered "low risk", while 4−6 and 0−3 were regarded as "high risk" and "very high risk", respectively.

### Hypovitaminosis D and morbidity in critical illness: is there proof beyond reasonable doubt? [^115KtGAu]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is recognized to have important actions outside its well-recognized role in musculoskeletal health. These include antimicrobial action, anti-inflammatory, and cardio-protective properties. A high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and its association with adverse clinical outcomes have now been widely documented in observational studies in the critically ill. These studies of association, however, do not necessarily imply causation, as vitamin D deficiency may be merely a marker of higher illness severity and consequently poorer outcomes. This issue can be clarified only by undertaking high-quality randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation in this vulnerable population.

### Recalcitrant hypocalcaemia responding to teriparatide therapy: a clinical insight [^111eVato]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Hypocalcaemia is a common metabolic abnormality in neonates, with distinct causes based on the timing of onset. Early-onset hypocalcaemia (within 72 hours of life) is typically related to transitional physiology, prematurity, perinatal asphyxia or maternal diabetes. In contrast, late-onset hypocalcaemia (after 72 hours) is less common and may result from high phosphate intake, cow's milk-based formulas, vitamin D deficiency or resistance, maternal vitamin D deficiency, hypoparathyroidism (eg, DiGeorge syndrome), magnesium deficiency or activating mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor. Clinical manifestations of late-onset hypocalcaemia can include seizures, tetany, irritability, arrhythmias or stridor. While most cases respond to oral calcium, vitamin D and magnesium supplementation, some are refractory to conventional therapy. We report a case of refractory neonatal hypocalcaemia that showed significant improvement with teriparatide, a recombinant parathyroid hormone analogue, highlighting the potential role of advanced pharmacological agents in difficult-to-treat cases of neonatal hypocalcaemia.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115GCzBc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Screening for low vitamin D status with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) testing — definitions and utilization: Vitamin D deficiency is traditionally defined clinically as having symptoms and signs of rickets or osteomalacia, but prevalence estimates vary by laboratory threshold; if defined as 25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL (50.0 nmol/L), 24% of US adults meet the criterion, whereas if defined as < 10 ng/mL (25 nmol/L), 6% of US adults would be considered vitamin D–deficient. Test utilization has risen, with 25(OH)D testing increasing from 0.29 per 1000 person-years at risk (95% CI, 0.27–0.31) in 2008 to 1.61 per 1000 person-years at risk (95% CI, 1.59–1.62) in 2015; the panel prioritized 3 clinical questions related to screening thresholds and whether treatment should be limited to individuals below a threshold.

### Bariatric surgery: the challenges with candidate selection, individualizing treatment and clinical outcomes [^112nwRZo]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Nutritional and gastrointestinal complications after bariatric surgery

Deficiencies of iron, vitamin B12, folate, and fat-soluble vitamins can occur after bariatric surgery and are best described in RYGB, BPD and BPD-DS. Vitamin D deficiency can persist despite prescribed replacement in BPD and may tend towards secondary hyperparathyroidism. The risk of nutritional deficiencies depends on postoperative weight loss, the surgical procedure performed and patient compliance with follow up.

Vomiting is frequent after bariatric surgery but must always be considered to be pathological until proven otherwise after RYGB. An examination and appropriate radiological studies to screen for stricture, stoma stenosis or herniation must be completed. If no pathological cause is found then treatment should be conservative with replacement of fluid and electrolytes. Often, vomiting can be the result of overeating or rapid eating. The patient should be re-educated on eating habits and kept under review.

Diarrhea is reported in up to 40% following bariatric surgery. More than 30% of bariatric surgical recipients report worsening bowel function in the post-operative period and some develop fecal incontinence. The etiology of this is unclear and treatment is based on appropriate dietary modification and anti-diarrheal pharmacotherapy.

There is a variable incidence of the dumping syndrome after bariatric surgery, particularly in RYGB. Dumping syndrome remains a 'waste-basket diagnosis', with the clinical presentation generally considered to include early abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, bloating, fatigue, facial flushing, palpitations, hypotension and syncope after high glycemic index meals. These symptoms usually occur within an hour of eating. Similar symptoms that occur two or three hours after a meal include perspiration, palpitations, hunger, tremor, agitation, and syncope. These have been blamed on hypoglycemia and GLP-1, although a definitive etiology remains to be established.

### The VITAH trial VITamin D supplementation and cardiac autonomic tone in hemodialysis: a blinded, randomized controlled trial [^114haij1]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

More than 40,000 Canadians live with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) — roughly 1 out of every 1,000 people, a number that has tripled over 20 years – and require life-sustaining dialysis or transplantation. Patients with ESKD have a 20% annual mortality rate and an age-specific cardiovascular death rate that is 10–100x higher than the general population. Sudden cardiac death (SCD) accounts for more than a quarter of deaths in the hemodialysis population, making it the leading cause of death. However, as is repeatedly reflected by negative trials evaluating the effects of treatment of traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors in patients with ESKD, these deaths are not associated with typical coronary artery disease, suggesting alternative mechanisms for SCD in ESKD. As such, the pathophysiology of SCD in the ESKD population is complex and believed to require the interaction between a transient event (i.e. intermittent hemodialysis) and underlying substrate. This process induces electrical instability and ventricular arrhythmias followed by hemodynamic collapse. Two factors specific to ESKD patients that have emerged as potential contributors to this SCD-susceptible state are altered mineral metabolism, including vitamin D deficiency, and impaired cardiac autonomic tone.

### The effect of vitamin dsupplementation on atrial fibrillation in generally healthy men and women: the Finnish vitamin D trial [^111KigU7]. American Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a common cardiac arrhythmia with high morbidity risk. Observational studies suggest that vitamin D deficiency is associated with higher atrial fibrillation risk but there is limited evidence whether vitamin D supplementation could affect the risk. In these post hoc analyses from the Finnish Vitamin D Trial, we compared the incidence of atrial fibrillation with 5-year supplementation of vitamin D 3 (1600 IU/d or 3200 IU/d) vs placebo.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^113dopje]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency–associated hypocalcemia — calcium and calcitriol dosing guidance includes that hypocalcemia should be treated with calcium supplements, with parenteral calcium as calcium gluconate (10–20 mg of elemental calcium per kg intravenously slowly over 5–10 minutes, usually given as 1–2 mL/kg of 10% calcium gluconate) in cases of manifest tetany or convulsions. Recommended doses of elemental calcium are 30 to 75 mg/kg per day in 3 divided doses, and calcitriol may be necessary in doses of 20 to 100 ng/kg per day in 2 to 3 divided doses until calcium levels normalize. High doses of calcium are necessary early in the course of therapy, after which doses are reduced by half for the next 1 to 2 weeks. Once vitamin D is reduced to 400 IU/day with normal PTH and 25(OH)-D levels, calcium supplementation is usually not necessary.

### Interactions among vitamin D, atrial fibrillation, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system [^112s2rED]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) has been shown to decrease incident atrial fibrillation (AF). Vitamin D deficiency has been implicated but associations between vitamin D and AF are inconsistent. However, vitamin D deficiency results in renin and angiotensin upregulation. This study seeks to determine the relation between vitamin D deficiency and incident AF and characterize this relation in the setting of RAAS inhibition. A total of 47,062 patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] laboratory testing were retrospectively identified. Clinical information was extracted from the medical record. The primary outcome was incidence of AF. Given significant patient variation, propensity score matching was used to select comparable groups of those who initiated ACEI/ARB ("AI") versus those who did not ("NAI"). Odds ratios (ORs) for incident AF associated with ACEI/ARB initiation and 25(OH)D level were estimated using generalized linear mixed models. AI patients had less incident AF than NAI patients (OR 0.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32 to 0.39) consistent with previous studies, but 25(OH)D deficiency was not associated with incident AF (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.22). When stratified by 25(OH)D, there was a statistically significant decreased rate of AF in AI patients. Interestingly, this benefit was attenuated in 25(OH)D deficiency (deficient: OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.60 vs normal: OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.37). In conclusion, 25(OH)D deficiency was not associated with incident AF, and the benefit of ACE/ARB use was attenuated in 25(OH)D deficiency; this suggests that 25(OH)D may act as a cofactor in the mitigation of AF by RAAS inhibition.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1144Ymwq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on vitamin D deficiency:

- **Definition**: Vitamin D deficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level < 20 ng/mL and 21–29 ng/mL is considered insufficiency.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of vitamin D deficiency primarily involves inadequate cutaneous synthesis due to decreased exposure to sunlight, leading to impaired intestinal absorption of calcium and secondary hyperparathyroidism. This can result in increased bone turnover and defective mineralization of the collagenous matrix. Other mechanisms of deficiency include inadequate dietary intake, reduced gastrointestinal absorption in gastrointestinal disorders, impaired hepatic 25-hydroxylation due to certain medications or liver disease, increased metabolism of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in cancer, granulomatous diseases, or primary hyperparathyroidism, and rarely, loss of vitamin D-binding protein due to nephrotic syndrome or peritoneal dialysis.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency varies significantly by geographic region, population group, and age. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the US is estimated at 24.6%.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency include inadequate sunlight exposure, malabsorption syndromes, bariatric procedures, renal or hepatic disease, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and certain medications such as anticonvulsants and glucocorticoids. People with dark skin, residing at higher latitudes (> 33° north or south), older adults, pregnant individuals, and patients with obesity are at higher risk.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course of vitamin D deficiency can range from asymptomatic to severe, depending on the extent of the deficiency and the presence of comorbid conditions. Symptoms can include diffuse musculoskeletal pain, bone pain, and muscle weakness. In severe cases, it can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism, osteopenia, osteomalacia, and bone fractures in adults and rickets in children. Vitamin D deficiency has also been associated with an increased risk of CVDs, T2DM, preeclampsia, infections, and cognitive impairment.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of vitamin D deficiency is generally good with appropriate treatment, which typically involves supplementation with vitamin D3. However, untreated deficiency can result in long-term skeletal and extra-skeletal consequences and has been linked to an increased risk of mortality.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^1147pFqd]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency has been extensively related to the occurrence of skeletal disorders, such as rickets and osteomalacia. It can also be negatively implicated in osteopenia and osteoporosis, which must be mandatory and managed with vitamin D supplements. More recently, the interest in the putative extraskeletal effects of vitamin D have resulted in several clinical trials addressing vitamin D's influence on cancer and CV risk, respiratory effects, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, and mortality. The null results of some of these RCTs — especially the megatrials — hampered the enthusiasm around these topics. However, these trials were progressively revised, and their null results were mainly related to the enrollment of vitamin D–replete adults in whom benefit would be unlikely and the inhomogeneous methodologies in vitamin D supplementation with different forms, metabolites, and doses. Indeed, subsequent secondary analyses have progressively shown that vitamin D might be useful in reducing cancer incidence and mortality in the long term, in reducing autoimmune diseases and CV events (in particular central arterial hypertension, myocardial infarction, and atrial fibrillation) occurrence, and the development of diabetes from prediabetes forms. Nonetheless, these RCTs and the following meta-analyses were not powerful enough to evaluate these crucial subgroups, and further studies with better methodological conductions are warranted.

Regarding the different forms and metabolites used for vitamin D supplementation, oral administration is the preferred route, and parenteral administration should be reserved for special clinical situations, such as in patients with severe gastrointestinal malabsorption syndromes or after bariatric surgery. Cholecalciferol remains the preferred choice, and it is generally safe, requiring less strict monitoring. Ergocalciferol has been demonstrated to be less effective in raising 25(OH)D serum levels and, thus, should be reserved for specific clinical conditions. Calcifediol could be recommended in patients with obesity, malabsorption syndromes, CYP2R1 dysfunction, or in situations in which a quick, rapid achievement of vitamin D sufficiency is desirable. Calcitriol use should be limited for patients with limited/absent renal tubular 1-α-hydroxylase activity and in vitamin D–resistant rickets type 1, X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets, and chronic hypoparathyroidism.
