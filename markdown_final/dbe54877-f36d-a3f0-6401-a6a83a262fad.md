## Question

onychomycosis treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about onychomycosis treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and why that matters. Then, I should classify disease severity and identify patient-specific factors that influence therapy. Next, I will align treatment choices to severity and comorbidities, including oral, topical, and device-based options. After that, I should review special populations and prevention strategies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and highlight evidence gaps and stewardship considerations, making sure I verify each claim against guidelines and high-quality reviews as I go.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic foundation, because treating a dystrophic nail that is not fungal wastes time and exposes patients to unnecessary risk. I need to ensure mycologic confirmation with KOH microscopy, culture, PAS stain, or PCR before initiating therapy, and I should document the causative organism since dermatophytes, non-dermatophyte molds, and Candida respond differently to treatment, and this is consistently recommended by AAFP and BAD guidelines and supported by contemporary reviews [^10fb8681] [^dbeeb85a] [^01e3607f] [^623a44dd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment until I classify severity and consider host factors. Severity is typically gauged by the percentage of nail involvement, matrix involvement, and number of nails, and patient factors such as diabetes, immunosuppression, hepatic disease, drug interactions, pregnancy, and age meaningfully alter risk–benefit profiles and guide oral versus topical selection, so I should explicitly record these before choosing therapy [^623a44dd] [^3c41b354] [^74be3c11].

> For mild disease, generally less than 20% of the nail plate involved without matrix disease, I should consider topical monotherapy as reasonable first-line because efficacy is acceptable and systemic risk is avoided. Efinaconazole 10% once daily for 48 weeks has high-quality evidence for complete cure and mycologic cure, tavaborole 5% daily is also effective though with more application-site reactions, and ciclopirox 8% lacquer or hydrolacquer can be used when cost or access is a concern, with the caveat that complete cure rates are lower and treatment duration is long, so I need to set expectations and ensure adherence [^2b729252] [^78a439d5] [^f4c5376a] [^b3bf1663].

> Wait, let me verify the role of severity beyond 20% and the threshold for adding oral therapy. In moderate disease, roughly 20–60% involvement, topical therapy remains an option, but I should discuss combination therapy, especially if multiple nails are involved or disease is progressing, because adding oral terbinafine can improve outcomes; efinaconazole has supportive data even in more extensive disease, though complete cure is lower and longer courses may be needed, so shared decision-making about trade-offs is essential [^74be3c11] [^47053f47] [^f8fd70f4].

> For severe disease, typically more than 60% involvement or matrix involvement, I should recommend oral therapy as first-line because penetration and fungicidal activity are superior. Terbinafine 250 mg daily for 12 weeks is the preferred agent with the highest-quality evidence for mycologic and clinical cure, and I should obtain baseline liver function tests and monitor if there is hepatic risk or prolonged therapy; itraconazole is an alternative, particularly for molds or when terbinafine is contraindicated, and fluconazole is less effective but may be considered when first-line agents are not tolerated [^94a315d4] [^60b1954e] [^a1bacf7c] [^f200a6f5].

> I should double-check the role of combination therapy because I initially thought it was broadly indicated, but wait, the strongest evidence supports selective use rather than routine combination. Combination oral plus topical therapy is most compelling for patients at higher risk of failure, such as those with diabetes, immunosuppression, or severe disease, and can modestly improve complete cure and reduce relapse; sequential strategies may be used after inadequate response to monotherapy, and I need to ensure we do not overpromise benefits in mild disease where monotherapy often suffices [^79b056a0] [^2f515cd4] [^5c2e7284].

> Next, I should review device-based therapies and not overstate their utility. Lasers and photodynamic therapy show signals in small studies, but evidence quality is low and guidelines conclude insufficient evidence to recommend routine use; patients may pursue these for cosmetic improvement, but I should frame them as adjuncts or alternatives when conventional therapy is contraindicated or declined, and I should document informed consent regarding uncertain long-term efficacy [^2b729252] [^ebc4586d] [^b15b9246].

> Let me consider special populations carefully. In children, topical therapy can be effective because nails are thinner and grow faster; ciclopirox is FDA-approved from age 12 and efinaconazole and tavaborole from age 6, and pediatric studies show good mycologic and complete cure with efinaconazole and low adverse event rates, while systemic therapy, when needed, uses weight-based terbinafine or itraconazole dosing with baseline labs and monitoring, acknowledging that pediatric labeling for systemic onychomycosis treatment is limited in some regions [^63aad0b6] [^2de43613] [^fe878b40] [^f9b9152c].

> For patients with diabetes or peripheral vascular disease, I need to ensure early, effective treatment because of higher risks of secondary infection and delayed healing. Topical therapy avoids systemic toxicity but may be insufficient in moderate to severe disease, so combination therapy and close follow-up are prudent, and I should coordinate with podiatry for debridement and foot care to reduce fungal burden and improve penetration of topical agents [^5dc2e10d] [^fd7fab9e].

> I should confirm prevention and maintenance strategies because recurrence is common and often preventable. Concurrent treatment of tinea pedis, shoe and sock hygiene, and patient education reduce reinfection, and in patients with frequent relapses, intermittent topical therapy such as efinaconazole can be considered off-label for maintenance, though I must balance this with cost and adherence realities and document the rationale [^068e245b] [^aa7bb584].

> But wait, what if the patient has non-dermatophyte mold or Candida onychomycosis. I need to check that these organisms respond differently, and indeed itraconazole or fluconazole are preferred for Candida, while molds like Scopulariopsis or Fusarium are notoriously difficult and often require combination therapy with systemic plus topical agents and longer treatment durations, so I should set expectations and plan for closer monitoring and possible escalation if response is slow [^235db1e8] [^623a44dd].

> Next, I should review adherence and follow-up pragmatics because treatment failure is frequently nonbiologic. Topical regimens require daily application for nearly a year and many patients discontinue early, whereas oral therapy is shorter but may face safety concerns; shared decision-making improves satisfaction and persistence, and I should schedule checkpoints at 12, 24, and 48 weeks to reassess clinical and mycologic response and pivot therapy if there is inadequate progress [^3230f3e8] [^a01b94d8] [^3c41b354].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check it against guidelines. Confirm diagnosis mycologically, classify severity and host risk, treat mild disease with topical efinaconazole or tavaborole for 48 weeks, moderate disease with topical therapy or combination if multiple nails or progression, and severe disease with terbinafine 250 mg daily for 12 weeks with baseline LFTs when indicated, adding a topical agent for synergy and considering itraconazole if terbinafine is contraindicated or for non-dermatophyte infections, and throughout, incorporate debridement, tinea pedis treatment, and prevention counseling to optimize outcomes [^94a315d4] [^2b729252] [^3c41b354].

> Finally, I should acknowledge evidence gaps and stewardship. Many device and combination studies are small and heterogeneous, cost and access vary widely, and real-world data show underdiagnosis and undertreatment with low confirmatory testing rates; I need to advocate for guideline-concordant diagnosis, appropriate first-line therapy, and judicious use of alternatives, while educating patients that visible clearing lags mycologic cure by months and that persistence is essential to realize the full benefit of therapy [^2c54131c] [^3c41b354] [^9dff4da9].

Onychomycosis treatment should be **individualized** based on severity, comorbidities, and patient preference, with **oral terbinafine as first-line** for moderate-to-severe disease due to superior efficacy and cost-effectiveness [^a1bacf7c] [^300d6c44]. Topical efinaconazole or tavaborole are **preferred for mild disease** or when oral therapy is contraindicated, with ciclopirox as an alternative [^2b729252] [^78a439d5]. Combination therapy (oral plus topical) is reasonable for severe or refractory cases, and device-based therapies (e.g. laser) should be reserved for select patients given limited evidence [^79b056a0] [^2b729252]. Confirm the diagnosis with KOH, culture, or PCR before treatment, monitor for adverse effects, and counsel on adherence and recurrence prevention to optimize outcomes [^10fb8681] [^068e245b].

---

## Diagnostic confirmation

Before initiating therapy, **confirm onychomycosis** with laboratory testing (KOH prep, fungal culture, or PCR) to avoid treating mimics and ensure appropriate therapy [^10fb8681] [^dbeeb85a].

---

## Systemic antifungal therapy

Systemic therapy is **first-line for moderate-to-severe disease** or when multiple nails are involved [^00cb6be4].

| **Medication** | **Regimen** | **Efficacy** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Terbinafine | 250 mg daily for 12 weeks (toenails); 6 weeks (fingernails) | High mycologic and clinical cure rates | First-line; monitor LFTs if hepatic risk [^94a315d4] [^bd94b7e0] |
| Itraconazole | 200 mg daily for 12 weeks (continuous) or pulse dosing (400 mg daily for 1 week monthly × 3 for toenails; × 2 for fingernails) | Moderate efficacy | Monitor LFTs; drug interactions [^2f342c8e] [^1cb9c1c7] |
| Fluconazole | 150–450 mg weekly for 6–12 months | Lower efficacy | Alternative when others contraindicated [^f200a6f5] [^686418cc] |

---

## Topical antifungal therapy

Topicals are **preferred for mild disease** or when systemic therapy is contraindicated [^2b729252].

| **Medication** | **Regimen** | **Efficacy** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Efinaconazole 10% | Once daily for 48 weeks | High-quality evidence for complete and mycologic cure | Preferred topical; well tolerated [^2b729252] [^78a439d5] |
| Tavaborole 5% | Once daily for 48 weeks | Moderate-quality evidence for complete and mycologic cure | Alternative topical; well tolerated [^2b729252] [^78a439d5] |
| Ciclopirox 8% | Once daily for 48 weeks | Lower efficacy | Alternative; more adverse effects [^2b729252] [^78a439d5] |

---

## Combination therapy

Combination oral plus topical therapy can **improve outcomes** in severe or refractory cases, though evidence is limited; consider when monotherapy fails or disease is extensive [^79b056a0] [^2f515cd4].

---

## Device-based therapies

Laser and photodynamic therapies are **not first-line** due to limited evidence; consider only when conventional therapies are contraindicated or declined [^2b729252] [^ebc4586d].

---

## Special populations

- **Pediatric patients**: Topical therapy is effective; terbinafine is first-line systemic therapy if needed, with weight-based dosing [^fe878b40] [^86c0e1fb].
- **Immunocompromised patients**: Systemic therapy is preferred; monitor closely for adverse effects and drug interactions [^notfound].
- **Diabetic patients**: Treat aggressively due to higher risk of complications; monitor for secondary infections [^5dc2e10d].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Baseline labs**: Consider LFTs for systemic therapy, especially with hepatic risk or prolonged courses [^94a315d4] [^f200a6f5].
- **Follow-up**: Assess at 12, 24, and 48 weeks; mycologic cure may lag clinical improvement [^bd94b7e0] [^71a81608].
- **Recurrence prevention**: Treat tinea pedis, educate on hygiene, and consider maintenance topical therapy in recurrent cases [^068e245b] [^aa7bb584].

---

## Factors influencing treatment choice

- **Severity and extent**: More severe disease favors systemic therapy; mild disease favors topical therapy [^3c41b354] [^74be3c11].
- **Comorbidities**: Hepatic disease, immunosuppression, and drug interactions guide safer choices [^3c41b354] [^f200a6f5].
- **Patient preference**: Adherence, cost, and tolerance should be considered [^a01b94d8] [^59981881].

---

## Emerging therapies

Newer agents such as **fosravuconazole** and **oteseconazole** are under study and may expand options, but evidence remains limited pending larger trials [^c6f6c1aa] [^300d6c44].

---

Onychomycosis treatment should be **individualized**, with oral terbinafine as first-line for moderate-to-severe disease and topical efinaconazole or tavaborole for mild disease or when oral therapy is contraindicated. Combination therapy is reasonable for severe or refractory cases, and device-based therapies should be reserved for select patients. Confirm the diagnosis, monitor for adverse effects, and counsel on adherence and recurrence prevention to optimize outcomes.

### Improved efficacy in onychomycosis therapy [^5c2e7284]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

The success rate of onychomycosis treatment is limited by several factors, including the access of the therapeutic agent to the fungal mass, the presence of conidia, and the susceptibility of the different infectious agents to the antifungals. Different strategies used to improve efficacy of the currently available antifungal treatments, their rationale, and the published evidence of their beneficial effects are reviewed. An improved efficacy was demonstrated for some of these strategies, such as combined oral and topical antifungal therapies, whereas most of them lack clear and direct evidence of an increase in therapeutic success.

### Is severity of disease a prognostic factor for cure following treatment of onychomycosis? [^47053f47]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis is a common disease that remains a difficult disorder to treat despite the introduction of new topical agents; and not all patients are cured. Clinical experience leads us to suggest a number of host-related factors can affect the chance of cure, but studies supporting these observations are currently lacking. Although many studies, particularly on topical agents, rely on severity classification when selecting patients for inclusion, a pilot study was unable to demonstrate any prognostic value of the extension of nail involvement. In addition, no universal severity classification exists, and most studies do not report prognostic factors.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy of efinaconazole topical solution, 10% in patients with mild-to-moderate onychomycosis and determine the impact of baseline severity on treatment outcome.

Methods

Post hoc pooled analysis of two identical, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled studies in 1655 patients aged 18–70 years with a clinical and mycological diagnosis of mild-to-moderate dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis (20–50% clinical involvement). Patients were randomized (3:1) to efinaconazole 10% solution or vehicle, once-daily for 48 weeks, with 4-week post treatment follow-up. Efficacy criteria included clear nail (0% target nail plate involvement), almost clear nail (≤ 5% target nail plate involvement), and clinical treatment success (≤ 10% target nail plate involvement) at week 52. For the post hoc analysis, patients were classified as mild (20%-29% nail involvement), moderate (30%-39%), and moderately severe (40%-50%) at baseline.

Results

Overall, 25%, 23%, and 52% of patients had mild, moderate, or moderately severe disease at baseline. Baseline nail involvement did not appear to predict treatment outcomes. The proportion of patients with mild disease who had a clear nail progressively reduced by week 36 (58%) and week 48 (41%), and even further by week 52 (37%). Of the 237 patients treated with efinaconazole who were 'clear' at week 52, 37%, 24%, and 39% had mild, moderate or moderately severe disease respectively at baseline. The majority of patients (N = 634) saw at least a 50% improvement in their target toenail by week 52. Almost half of these patients (N = 312, 49.2%) were moderately severe at baseline.

Conclusions

This post hoc analysis supports previous data showing good efficacy of efinaconazole in mild onychomycosis. The relative contribution to overall efficacy results at week 52 of patients with moderate or moderately severe disease was unexpected for a topical therapy, and warrants further study, especially as they represent the majority of patients enrolled in the two studies. It is possible that comparable efficacy can be achieved in these more severe patients with longer treatment courses, or follow-up. J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(2):175–178.

### A practical guide to curing onychomycosis: how to maximize cure at the patient, organism, treatment, and environmental level [^b8c6d3e0]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal nail infection caused by dermatophytes, non-dermatophyte molds, and yeasts. Treatment of this infection can be difficult, with relapse likely to occur within 2.5 years of cure. The objective of this article is to review factors that can impact cure and to suggest practical techniques that physicians can use to maximize cure rates. Co-morbidities, as well as disease severity and duration, are among the many patient factors that could influence the efficacy of antifungal therapies. Furthermore, organism, treatment, and environmental factors that may hinder cure include point mutations, biofilms, affinity for non-target enzymes, and exposure to fungal reservoirs. To address patient-related factors, physicians are encouraged to conduct confirmatory testing and treat co-morbidities such as tinea pedis early and completely. To combat organism-focused factors, it is recommended that disruption of biofilms is considered, and drugs with multiple routes of delivery and unique mechanisms of action are prescribed when traditional agents are not effective. Extending follow-up periods, using combination treatments, and considering pulse regimens may also be of benefit. Through these practical techniques, physicians can maximize cure and limit the risk of relapse and re-infection.

### Monotherapy for toenail onychomycosis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^a1bacf7c]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail caused by dermatophytes, yeasts and nondermatophyte moulds that accounts for approximately 50% of all nail-related disease.

Objectives

This study aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of monotherapy and combination treatments for toenail onychomycosis using a network meta-analysis (NMA).

Methods

Quality of evidence was assessed using Cochrane-compliant rules and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach. Efficacy and safety outcomes were compared using a random-effects NMA to estimate pooled odds ratios (ORs) of direct and indirect comparisons among oral and topical treatments (PROSPERO 2015: CRD42018086912). There were not enough eligible combination and device-based therapy trials to include in the NMA.

Results

Of 77 randomized controlled trials, 26 were included in the ORs (8136 patients). There were no significant inconsistencies between the direct and indirect evidence. Relative effects show that the odds of mycological cure with continuous terbinafine 250 mg or continuous itraconazole 200 mg are significantly greater than topical treatments. Fluconazole, pulse regimens of terbinafine and itraconazole, and topical treatments did not differ significantly in the odds of achieving mycological cure. The ORs of adverse events occurring with oral or topical treatments were not significantly different from each other. For mycological cure, evidence was of moderate or high quality while evidence ranged from very low to high quality for adverse events.

Conclusions

Our review suggests that oral and topical treatments for toenail onychomycosis are safe and effective in producing mycological cure. What's already known about this topic? Topical treatments traditionally have lower success rates than oral treatments. Oral treatments have the advantage of shorter treatment durations, but also present challenges in cases of drug-drug interactions or immunosuppression. A network meta-analysis (NMA) gathers data from indirect evidence to gain confidence about all treatment comparisons and allows for estimation of comparative effects that have not been investigated in head-to-head randomized clinical trials (RCTs). What does this study add? This NMA of efficacy and safety includes all RCTs of oral, topical, combination and device-based treatments for toenail onychomycosis, adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement for NMA. The odds of achieving mycological cure with continuous terbinafine 250 mg or continuous itraconazole 200 mg were significantly greater than topical treatments. Fluconazole, pulse regimens of terbinafine and itraconazole, and topical treatments did not differ significantly in the odds of achieving mycological cure.

### Onychomycosis: does cure equate to treatment success? [^8923539f]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There is no general agreement as to what constitutes cure or treatment success in onychomycosis. Regulatory guidelines differ in the United States and Europe, and outcomes reported in clinical trials do not consistently report secondary endpoints. <br/>

Methods

We reviewed definitions of onychomycosis cure to develop a less stringent and more practical approach to assess improvement and treatment success. <br/>

Results

Complete cure (totally clear nail and mycologic cure) remains an important regulatory standard. Mycologic cure (negative fungal culture and negative potassium hydroxide) is the only consistently reported outcome in clinical trials, however the potential for discrepancies between microscopy and culture can be problematic. We propose a more practical approach to assessing improvement in infected nails that relies on both physician and patient input in a similar fashion to other skin diseases. <br/>

Conclusions

Treatment success should be based on both physician and patient assessment of improvement in the affected toenails and negative fungal culture. <br/> <br/> <em> J Drugs Dermatol. </em> 2016;15(5):626–632.

### How to improve cure rates for the management of onychomycosis [^5558bd94]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

To improve the treatment of onychomycosis clinicians need to identify correctly the causative organism, choose a therapy that is effective against the pathogen, and take into consideration the pharmacokinetics (eg, bioavailability, drug interactions) of the oral agent. In addition, variations of the standard regimens may need to be considered (ie, booster or supplemental therapy). To reduce the recurrence of onychomycosis, once mycologic cure has been achieved, clinicians should educate their patients about proper foot care. Familiarity with the symptoms and signs of tinea pedis and onychomycosis may enable patients to seek appropriate care when the disease is at an early stage.

### Effect of onychomycosis and treatment on patient-reported quality-of-life outcomes: a systematic review [^06c616f9]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis is the most common nail disorder, often causing physical, emotional, and aesthetic consequences. The effect of both the condition itself and treatment on quality of life has not been well studied.

Objective

The objectives of this study were to systematically review the available literature describing the effect of onychomycosis and treatment on quality of life.

Methods

We performed a search of the onychomycosis literature published before April 13, 2020. Articles were included in the review if primary data were presented, patient-reported outcome measures were used, and onychomycosis was specifically examined.

Results

Thirty studies were included in the final analysis. Poorest quality-of-life scores were associated with women and fingernail involvement. Quality-of-life scores improved from baseline with all treatment types; there were greater improvements reported with oral treatments compared with topical ones.

Conclusions

This review affirms that onychomycosis significantly influences quality of life, warranting effective treatment. All treatments resulted in quality-of-life improvements; however, studies on oral and topical therapies were of higher quality than those evaluating devices. Increased efforts are needed to understand the effect of the disease and therapy as assessed by validated, nail-specific outcome measures that accurately assess patients' cosmetic, physical, and social difficulties.

### Oral antifungal medication for toenail onychomycosis [^60b1954e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Fungal infection of the toenails, also called onychomycosis, is a common problem that causes damage to the nail's structure and physical appearance. For those severely affected, it can interfere with normal daily activities. Treatment is taken orally or applied topically; however, traditionally topical treatments have low success rates due to the nail's physical properties. Oral treatments also appear to have shorter treatment times and better cure rates. Our review will assist those needing to make an evidence-based choice for treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral antifungal treatments for toenail onychomycosis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to October 2016: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We sought to identify unpublished and ongoing trials by correspondence with authors and by contacting relevant pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

RCTs comparing oral antifungal treatment to placebo or another oral antifungal treatment in participants with toenail onychomycosis, confirmed by one or more positive cultures, direct microscopy of fungal elements, or histological examination of the nail.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 48 studies involving 10,200 participants. Half the studies took place in more than one centre and were conducted in outpatient dermatology settings. The participants mainly had subungual fungal infection of the toenails. Study duration ranged from 4 months to 2 years. We assessed one study as being at low risk of bias in all domains and 18 studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain. The most common high-risk domain was 'blinding of personnel and participants'. We found high-quality evidence that terbinafine is more effective than placebo for achieving clinical cure (risk ratio (RR) 6.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.96 to 9.08, 8 studies, 1006 participants) and mycological cure (RR 4.53, 95% CI 2.47 to 8.33, 8 studies, 1006 participants). Adverse events amongst terbinafine-treated participants included gastrointestinal symptoms, infections, and headache, but there was probably no significant difference in their risk between the groups (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.47, 4 studies, 399 participants, moderate-quality evidence). There was high-quality evidence that azoles were more effective than placebo for achieving clinical cure (RR 22.18, 95% CI 12.63 to 38.95, 9 studies, 3440 participants) and mycological cure (RR 5.86, 95% CI 3.23 to 10.62, 9 studies, 3440 participants). There were slightly more adverse events in the azole group (the most common being headache, flu-like symptoms, and nausea), but the difference was probably not significant (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.12; 9 studies, 3441 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Terbinafine and azoles may lower the recurrence rate when compared, individually, to placebo (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.38, 1 study, 35 participants; RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.07, 1 study, 26 participants, respectively; both low-quality evidence). There is moderate-quality evidence that terbinafine was probably more effective than azoles for achieving clinical cure (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95, 15 studies, 2168 participants) and mycological cure (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.88, 17 studies, 2544 participants). There was probably no difference in the risk of adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.17; 9 studies, 1762 participants, moderate-quality evidence) between the two groups, and there may be no difference in recurrence rate (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.79, 5 studies, 282 participants, low-quality evidence). Common adverse events in both groups included headache, viral infection, and nausea. Moderate-quality evidence shows that azoles and griseofulvin probably had similar efficacy for achieving clinical cure (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.96, 5 studies, 222 participants) and mycological cure (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.51, 5 studies, 222 participants). However, the risk of adverse events was probably higher in the griseofulvin group (RR 2.41, 95% CI 1.56 to 3.73, 2 studies, 143 participants, moderate-quality evidence), with the most common being gastrointestinal disturbance and allergic reaction (in griseofulvin-treated participants) along with nausea and vomiting (in azole-treated participants). Very low-quality evidence means we are uncertain about this comparison's impact on recurrence rate (RR 4.00, 0.26 to 61.76, 1 study, 7 participants). There is low-quality evidence that terbinafine may be more effective than griseofulvin in terms of clinical cure (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.72, 4 studies, 270 participants) and mycological cure (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.90, 5 studies, 465 participants), and griseofulvin was associated with a higher risk of adverse events, although this was based on low-quality evidence (RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.82, 2 studies, 100 participants). Common adverse events included headache and stomach problems (in griseofulvin-treated participants) as well as taste loss and nausea (in terbinafine-treated participants). No studies addressed recurrence rate for this comparison. No study addressed quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

We found high-quality evidence that compared to placebo, terbinafine and azoles are effective treatments for the mycological and clinical cure of onychomycosis, with moderate-quality evidence of excess harm. However, terbinafine probably leads to better cure rates than azoles with the same risk of adverse events (moderate-quality evidence). Azole and griseofulvin were shown to probably have a similar effect on cure, but more adverse events appeared to occur with the latter (moderate-quality evidence). Terbinafine may improve cure and be associated with fewer adverse effects when compared to griseofulvin (low-quality evidence). Only four comparisons assessed recurrence rate: low-quality evidence found that terbinafine or azoles may lower the recurrence rate when compared to placebo, but there may be no difference between them. Only a limited number of studies reported adverse events, and the severity of the events was not taken into account. Overall, the quality of the evidence varied widely from high to very low depending on the outcome and comparison. The main reasons to downgrade evidence were limitations in study design, such as unclear allocation concealment and randomisation as well as lack of blinding.

### Topical and device-based treatments for fungal infections of the toenails [^2b729252]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis refers to fungal infections of the nail apparatus that may cause pain, discomfort, and disfigurement. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2007; a substantial amount of new research warrants a review exclusively on toenails.

Objectives

To assess the clinical and mycological effects of topical drugs and device-based therapies for toenail onychomycosis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers, and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of topical and device-based therapies for onychomycosis in participants with toenail onychomycosis, confirmed by positive cultures, direct microscopy, or histological nail examination. Eligible comparators were placebo, vehicle, no treatment, or an active topical or device-based treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were complete cure rate (normal-looking nail plus fungus elimination, determined with laboratory methods) and number of participants reporting treatment-related adverse events.

Main Results

We included 56 studies (12,501 participants, average age: 27 to 68 years), with mainly mild-to-moderate onychomycosis without matrix involvement (where reported). Participants had more than one toenail affected. Most studies lasted 48 to 52 weeks; 23% reported disease duration (variable). Thirty-five studies specifically examined dermatophyte-caused onychomycosis. Forty-three studies were carried out in outpatient settings. Most studies assessed topical treatments, 9% devices, and 11% both. We rated three studies at low risk of bias across all domains. The most common high-risk domain was performance bias. We present results for key comparisons, where treatment duration was 36 or 48 weeks, and clinical outcomes were measured at 40 to 52 weeks. Based on two studies (460 participants), compared with vehicle, ciclopirox 8% lacquer may be more effective in achieving complete cure (risk ratio (RR) 9.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.72 to 50.14; low-quality evidence) and is probably more effective in achieving mycological cure (RR 3.15, 95% CI 1.93 to 5.12; moderate-quality evidence). Ciclopirox lacquer may lead to increased adverse events, commonly application reactions, rashes, and nail alteration (e.g. colour, shape). However, the 95% CI indicates that ciclopirox lacquer may actually make little or no difference (RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.92; low-quality evidence). Efinaconazole 10% solution is more effective than vehicle in achieving complete cure (RR 3.54, 95% CI 2.24 to 5.60; 3 studies, 1716 participants) and clinical cure (RR 3.07, 95% CI 2.08 to 4.53; 2 studies, 1655 participants) (both high-quality evidence) and is probably more effective in achieving mycological cure (RR 2.31, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.94; 3 studies, 1716 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Risk of adverse events (such as dermatitis and vesicles) was slightly higher with efinaconazole (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.20; 3 studies, 1701 participants; high-quality evidence). No other key comparison measured clinical cure. Based on two studies, compared with vehicle, tavaborole 5% solution is probably more effective in achieving complete cure (RR 7.40, 95% CI 2.71 to 20.24; 1198 participants), but probably has a higher risk of adverse events (application site reactions were most commonly reported) (RR 3.82, 95% CI 1.65 to 8.85; 1186 participants (both moderate-quality evidence)). Tavaborole improves mycological cure (RR 3.40, 95% CI 2.34 to 4.93; 1198 participants; high-quality evidence). Moderate-quality evidence from two studies (490 participants) indicates that P-3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer) is probably more effective than the comparators ciclopirox 8% lacquer or amorolfine 5% in achieving complete cure (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.32 to 4.48), but there is probably little or no difference between the treatments in achieving mycological cure (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.37). We found no difference in the risk of adverse events (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.92; 2 studies, 487 participants; low-quality evidence). The most common events were erythema, rash, and burning. Three studies (112 participants) compared 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser to no treatment or sham treatment. We are uncertain if there is a difference in adverse events (very low-quality evidence) (two studies; 85 participants). There may be little or no difference in mycological cure at 52 weeks (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.85; 2 studies, 85 participants; low-quality evidence). Complete cure was not measured. One study (293 participants) compared luliconazole 5% solution to vehicle. We are uncertain whether luliconazole leads to higher rates of complete cure (very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates there may be little or no difference in adverse events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.16) and there may be increased mycological cure with luliconazole; however, the 95% CI indicates that luliconazole may make little or no difference to mycological cure (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.97). Commonly-reported adverse events were dry skin, paronychia, eczema, and hyperkeratosis, which improved or resolved post-treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Assessing complete cure, high-quality evidence supports the effectiveness of efinaconazole, moderate-quality evidence supports P-3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer) and tavaborole, and low-quality evidence supports ciclopirox 8% lacquer. We are uncertain whether luliconazole 5% solution leads to complete cure (very low-quality evidence); this outcome was not measured by the 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser comparison. Although evidence supports topical treatments, complete cure rates with topical treatments are relatively low. We are uncertain if 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser increases adverse events compared with no treatment or sham treatment (very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates that there is no difference in adverse events between P-3051 (ciclopirox hydrolacquer), luliconazole 5% solution, and their comparators. Ciclopirox 8% lacquer may increase adverse events (low-quality evidence). High- to moderate-quality evidence suggests increased adverse events with efinaconazole 10% solution or tavaborole 5% solution. We downgraded evidence for heterogeneity, lack of blinding, and small sample sizes. There is uncertainty about the effectiveness of device-based treatments, which were under-represented; 80% of studies assessed topical treatments, but we were unable to evaluate all of the currently relevant topical treatments. Future studies of topical and device-based therapies should be blinded, with patient-centred outcomes and an adequate sample size. They should specify the causative organism and directly compare treatments.

### Onychomycosis therapy: past, present, future [^d1f84f14]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Methods to treat onychomycosis are varied, using therapies that can be categorized as topical, oral or device-related. Since their development, oral therapies have represented the gold standard for treatment over other methods. However, efficacy with oral therapies remains limited, and safety may be an issue, leaving many patients requiring alternative treatments. With research advances, topical therapies as alternatives for onychomycosis are being investigated with greater interest as new technologies are overcoming previous limitations of topical treatments, such as lack of nail penetration. New device-related topical therapy methods are particularly noteworthy, as they may allow for shorter, more convenient treatments for patients, reducing issues with topical compliance, and, in cases of non-drug light-based therapies, they will avoid potential for drug reactions. Research in these fields is preliminary, and the impact these methods may have on the future of onychomycosis remains to be seen.

### A review of lasers and light for the treatment of onychomycosis [^55f61966]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Onychomycosis is a common fungal infection that affects many individuals. Systemic therapies are effective, but are limited by their side effects and potential for hepatotoxicity. Topical therapies have less serious side effects, yet provide only limited efficacy due to their inability to penetrate the nail plate. These limitations have led to the investigation of laser and light-based modalities as alternative treatment options for onychomycosis. This article will provide an overview and critical assessment of the field of laser and other energy-based treatments for onychomycosis.

Study Design/Materials and Methods

A literature search was conducted on laser and light-based treatments for onychomycosis.

Results

Early data are promising, however, many of these studies are small or poorly designed.

Conclusion

Further evaluation and larger studies are needed to determine the optimal light source, pulse duration, and treatment schedule for long-term success.

### Onychomycosis in children: safety and efficacy of antifungal agents [^63acf56c]. Pediatric Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is an uncommon condition in childhood, but prevalence in children is increasing worldwide. The objective was to review the efficacy and safety of systemic and topical antifungal agents to treat onychomycosis in children. Databases (Pubmed, OVID, Scopus, clinicaltrials.gov, Cochrane Library) were searched. Seven studies were selected for inclusion. Only one was a randomized controlled trial. In total, 208 children were administered antifungal agents for the treatment of onychomycosis. Four reports of mild adverse events were documented (1.9% of treated children), one of which discontinued treatment (0.5%). Limitations of this review are the lack of randomized controlled trials available in pediatric onychomycosis. These findings suggest that antifungal therapies used to treat onychomycosis in children are associated with a low incidence of adverse events. Current dosing regimens for antifungal drugs are effective and appear safe to use in children, notwithstanding that the Food and Drug Administration has not approved any of these agents for the treatment of onychomycosis in children. To our knowledge, this review is the most up-to-date, comprehensive summary of pediatric onychomycosis treatment.

### The future of onychomycosis therapy may involve a combination of approaches [^795cf6a2]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail unit, most commonly caused by the anthropophilic dermatophyte fungi. It is generally accepted that this disease is increasing in prevalence despite the introduction of new and efficacious antifungal drugs. Several studies have documented health-related quality-of-life issues associated with onychomycosis and it is clear that patient treatment is both necessary and desirable. The aetiology and pathogenesis of onychomycosis is coming under increasing scrutiny and work in this field has grown substantially in recent years. This is reflected by the increased assurance with which clinicians can now prescribe treatment and be confident of improvement in a majority of their patients. However, a significant proportion of patients, perhaps as many as 25–40% of those encountered in clinical practice, are classified as treatment failures. Clinical indicators for poor prognosis include the development of residual foci of subungual fungal growth, onycholysis and severe disease. These observations have led to a resurgence of interest in combination treatments for use in patients at risk of failure/relapse. Several types of combination can be considered, including the use of oral or topical drugs and the concomitant use of surgical techniques, all of which have a place in the treatment of onychomycosis.

### Toenail onychomycosis: current and future treatment options [^fc6ca74f]. Dermatologic Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a common disease affecting as much as 8% of the general population. Treatment of onychomycosis is challenging, complicated by low cure rates and relatively high relapse rates. This paper reviews the efficacy of current oral, topical, and surgical treatment options. Currently, the treatment of choice for toenail onychomycosis is oral terbinafine because of its high efficacy, low relapse rates, and cost-effectiveness. Oral itraconazole or fluconazole could be considered for infections caused by Candida. Topical therapies may be a useful adjunct to these systemic therapies, but are less effective when used alone. More research is needed to determine the best measures for preventing reinfection.

### Medical devices for the treatment of onychomycosis [^62ebee9f]. Dermatologic Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Device-based therapies are the most rapidly expanding area of onychomycosis treatment. Traditional pharmacotherapy of onychomycosis has a low to moderate efficacy and is associated with adverse reactions and drug interactions that limit its use in many patients. These new therapies include laser systems, photodynamic therapy, iontophoresis, and ultrasound. Device-based therapies are procedures conducted in the clinic by a trained professional, which mitigates the requirement for long-term patient compliance. In addition, the drug component of these therapies is topical, preventing the adverse events associated with systemic antifungal administration, and potentially allowing for the treatment of individuals who were previously excluded due to drug interactions. Device-based therapy is a nascent field, so clinical data is still in an emergent stage; however, preliminary clinical trials of laser, photodynamic therapy, and iontophoresis suggest that some devices may have a degree of efficacy. More studies are required to better determine their ability to treat onychomycosis.

### Onychomycosis: treatment and prevention of recurrence [^068e245b]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal nail infection caused by dermatophytes, nondermatophytes, and yeast, and is the most common nail disorder seen in clinical practice. It is an important problem because it may cause local pain, paresthesias, difficulties performing activities of daily living, and impair social interactions. The epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical presentation and diagnosis of onychomycosis were discussed in the first article in this continuing medical education series. In this article, we review the prognosis and response to onychomycosis treatment, medications for onychomycosis that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, and off-label therapies and devices. Methods to prevent onychomycosis recurrences and emerging therapies are also described.

### Therapeutic recommendations for the treatment of toenail onychomycosis in the US [^aa7bb584]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis affects around 14% of individuals in North America and Europe and is undertreated. Treatment is challenging as toenail growth can take 12&ndash;18 months, the nail plate may prevent drug penetration, and disease recurrence is common. National guidelines/consensus documents on onychomycosis diagnosis and treatment were last published more than 5 years ago and updated medical guidance is needed.

Methods

This document aims to provide recommendations for the diagnosis and pharmaceutical treatment of toenail onychomycosis following a roundtable discussion with a panel of dermatologists, podiatrists, and a microbiologist specializing in nail disease.

Results

There was a general consensus on several topics regarding onychomycosis diagnosis, confirmatory laboratory testing, and medications. Onychomycosis should be assessed clinically and confirmed with microscopy, histology, and/or culture. Terbinafine is the primary choice for oral treatment and efinaconazole 10% for topical treatment. Efinaconazole can also be considered for off-label use for maintenance to prevent recurrences. For optimal outcomes, patients should be counseled regarding treatment expectations as well as follow-up care and maintenance post-treatment.

Conclusions

This article provides important updates to previous guidelines/consensus documents to assist dermatologists and podiatrists in the diagnosis and treatment of toenail onychomycosis. J Drugs Dermatol. 2021;20(10):1076–1084. doi:10.36849/JDD.6291.

### Onychomycosis: rapid evidence review… [^00cb6be4]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

ORAL THERAPY Oral therapy is the most effective treatment for onychomycosis of any severity. 21Oral antifungals have higher cure rates and shorter treatment periods than topical therapy. 19, 22–31 Terbinafine is the most effective oral agent based on its high clinical cure rate and mycologic cure rate and should be recommended as first-line therapy. Continuous itraconazole therapy is FDA approved for toenail onychomycosis, and a pulse-dosing regimen is approved for fingernail onychomycosis. According to a five-year double-blind prospective study with 144 patients, mycologic and clinical relapse rates are significantly higher with itraconazole than with terbinafine in patients who have severe disease including 460 total patients showed that compared with vehicle, ciclopirox 8% is better at achieving complete cure at 48 weeks, although only the second study was statistically significant (study 1:

NEW TREATMENT OPTIONS Although photodynamic and plasma therapies have been explored for the treatment of onychomycosis, larger randomized trials are needed to determine their effectiveness and feasibility for use in the clinical setting. 4 Plasma therapy creates air using pulses of strong electric field that ionize air molecules, generating ozone, hydroxyl radicals, and nitric oxide, which have antifungal properties. A pilot study of 19 participants without a control group showed an overall clinical cure rate of 53. 8%.

### Clinical insights about onychomycosis and its treatment: a consensus [^74be3c11]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Recently, experience and knowledge have been gained using effective topical treatment for onychomycosis, a difficult-to-treat infection.

Methods

This project aims to help understand and improve patient-focused quality of care for fungal nail infections. A panel of dermatologists who treat onychomycosis convened on several occasions to review and discuss recent learnings in the treatment of onychomycosis. The panel developed and conducted a survey on diagnosis, treatment and prevention, discussed the results, and provided recommendations.

Results

The survey was sent out digitally to the Canadian Dermatology community. Ninety-two dermatologists completed the questionnaires, which were included in the analysis. The survey respondents and panel members agreed that the diagnosis of toe onychomycosis should be confirmed with a positive microscopic examination for fungus or a positive mycological culture when oral therapy and/or topical treatment is prescribed, except when it is not clinically feasible, in which case topical therapy could be started based on clinical presentation. The panel and survey respondents also agreed that treatment is to be based on percentage of nail involvement: less than 20% = topical efinaconazole; 20%-60% = topical efinaconazole ± oral terbinafine (for greater than 3 nails); greater than 60% = oral terbinafine ± topical therapy.

Conclusions

The current treatment paradigm for onychomycosis may have shifted from mainly oral antifungals to topical treatment, improving patient-focused quality of care. <em> J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(3):253–262. </em>.

### Efficacy of fluconazole for the treatment of onychomycosis [^686418cc]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of fluconazole for the treatment of onychomycosis.

Data Sources

Searches of MEDLINE (1966-May 2009) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-May 2009) were performed. Key search terms included fluconazole and onychomycosis. In addition, reference citations from identified publications were reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All articles in English identified from the data sources were evaluated. All studies evaluating oral fluconazole for the treatment of onychomycosis were included in the review.

Data Synthesis

Seven studies evaluating fluconazole treatment for onychomycosis were identified. One study used daily dosing and the rest used once-weekly dosing. Treatment doses ranged from 100 mg to 450 mg weekly and 150 mg daily, and durations ranged from 12 weeks to 12 months. Most of the studies evaluated the efficacy of fluconazole in patients with toenail onychomycosis due to dermatophyte infection. Fluconazole was superior to placebo, with mycologic eradication rates ranging from 36% to 100% in placebo-controlled studies. In one of the comparative studies, the mycologic cure rate was lower with fluconazole (31.2%) compared with terbinafine (75%) and itraconazole (61.1%). Common adverse events reported with fluconazole use were headache, gastrointestinal pain, and diarrhea.

Conclusions

Fluconazole is less effective than terbinafine and itraconazole in the treatment of onychomycosis. However, fluconazole may be preferred in patients unable to tolerate other oral antifungal agents due to the dosing regimen, adverse effect profile, and drug interactions.

### Cumulative meta-analysis of systemic antifungal agents for the treatment of onychomycosis [^f06ecd73]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis is a common nail disease that is often chronic, difficult to eradicate, and has a tendency to recur. The most common oral therapies for dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis include terbinafine, itraconazole and fluconazole.

Objectives

A cumulative meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for antimycotic agents was performed to determine whether the pooled estimate of the cure rates has remained consistent over the years. Furthermore, for each agent we compared the overall meta-analytical average of both mycological and clinical response rates of RCTs vs. open studies.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE (1966 to November 2002) for relevant studies evaluating the efficacy of the oral antifungal agents terbinafine, itraconazole (pulse or continuous), fluconazole and griseofulvin for treating dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis. Studies included in this meta-analysis required a standard accepted dosage regimen, treatment duration and follow-up period. To determine the cumulative meta-analytical average, studies were sequentially pooled by adding one study at a time according to the date of publication (i.e. earliest to the most recent).

Results

There were 36 studies included in the analyses. For RCTs the change in efficacy of mycological cure rates from the first trial to the overall cumulative meta-average for each drug comparator is as follows (with 95% confidence interval): terbinafine, 78 ± 6% (n = 2 studies, 79 patients) to 76 ± 3% (n = 18 studies, 993 patients) (P = 0.68); itraconazole pulse, 75 ± 10% (n = 1 study, 20 patients) to 63 ± 7% (n = 6 studies, 318 patients) (P = 0.25); itraconazole continuous, 63 ± 5% (n = 1 study, 84 patients) to 59 ± 5% (n = 7 studies, 1131 patients) (P = 0.47); fluconazole, 53 ± 6% (n = 1 study, 72 patients) to 48 ± 5% (n = 3 studies, 131 patients) (P = 0.50); and griseofulvin, 55 ± 8% (n = 2 studies, 109 patients) to 60 ± 6% (n = 3 studies, 167 patients) (P = 0.41). The cumulative meta-analytical average of mycological cure rates when comparing RCTs vs. open studies was: terbinafine, 76 ± 3% (n = 18 studies, 993 patients) vs. 83 ± 12% (n = 2 studies, 391 patients) (P = 0.0028); itraconazole pulse, 63 ± 7% (n = 6 studies, 318 patients) vs. 84 ± 9% (n = 3 studies, 194 patients) (P = 0.0001); and fluconazole, 48 ± 5% (n = 3 studies, 131 patients) vs. 79 ± 3% (n = 3 studies, 208 patients) (P = 0.0001).

Conclusions

The cumulative meta-analysis of cure rates for RCTs suggests that over time, as new RCTs have been conducted, the efficacy rates have remained consistent. The efficacy rates of open studies are substantially higher compared with RCTs and may therefore overestimate cure rates.

### Onychomycosis. treatment, quality of life, and economic issues [^59981881]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a public health concern because of its high worldwide incidence and prevalence, and its potential for spread of fungal elements to others, as well as complications such as cellulitis, bacterial infection, pain, and extensive dermatophytic infections. The incidence of onychomycosis has been increasing, particularly in individuals over 60 years of age, patients with HIV infection, and patients with diabetes mellitus. Onychomycosis may impact upon physical, functional, psychosocial, and emotional aspects of life. Difficulty walking, wearing shoes, and embarrassment are common complaints. Quantification of such quality-of-life changes are significant to clinical practice in that many factors can affect overall patient health. In light of the potential clinical implications on physical and mental health, onychomycosis should be considered a medical condition that deserves rigorous clinical management. Onychomycosis can be treated effectively and with comparative safety with the new generation of oral antifungal agents (itraconazole, fluconazole and terbinafine). Significantly improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles permit markedly reduced duration of administration, individual drug exposure, and ultimately enhanced patient compliance and satisfaction with therapy. In addition, a number of pharmacoeconomic studies have documented the cost effectiveness of these newer agents compared with both traditional pharmacologic treatment and topical therapies. The currency figures quoted are 1997 values. With regard to continuous oral antifungal regimens, terbinafine therapy has been found to be most cost effective in the treatment of toenail onychomycosis, with a drug acquisition cost of $US522.50. However, improved safety, tolerability, efficacy and cost effectiveness have been documented with itraconazole intermittent, pulse regimens. With itraconazole pulse therapy, the drug acquisition cost decreases to $US488.90. Additionally, the total cost of medical management is less for itraconazole therapy compared with that of terbinafine ($US261.00 vs $US306.00). Because sensitivity analyses for itraconazole and terbinafine have been found to be somewhat comparable in terms of mycological cure, clinical response, and relapse rates, other variables such as safety and efficacy profiles, and patient attitudes and expectations toward therapy need to be considered when formulating an onychomycosis pharmacologic treatment plan. The drug aquisition cost of fluconazole given as a 300 mg dose once weekly for 6 months is $US562.76 and given as a 150 mg dose once weekly (for 6 months) $US281.38.

### Update: medical treatment of onychomycosis [^5a2b440e]. Dermatologic Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of onychomycosis should be made clinically and mycologically: clinically, by one of seven subtypes of onychomycosis, and mycologically, by evidence of dermatophytes or verified presence of molds and/or yeasts. Dermatophytes are usually considered as pathogens, whereas non-dermatophyte molds and yeasts are saprophytes. Basic anamnesis and close inspection should be performed to eliminate combined diseases (e.g., onychomycosis and trauma). The gold standard treatment for onychomycosis is basically systemic. Combination with topical agents, such as nail lacquer and/or chemical nail avulsion, produces better results than systemic treatment alone. Topical treatment as monotherapy is not efficient, excluding minor cases. Terbinafine is superior to itraconazole for dermatophyte onychomycosis. Evaluation of the outcome of clinical cure, mycological cure and total cure should be based on the well-defined worldwide criteria; otherwise, comparison of results is impossible due to lack of uniformity in different studies. In case of treatment failure, the reasons for each failure should be carefully considered.

### Treating onychomycosis [^1e2cd0e7]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis accounts for one third of fungal skin infections. Because only about one half of nail dystrophies are caused by fungus, the diagnosis should be confirmed by potassium hydroxide preparation, culture or histology before treatment is started. Newer, more effective antifungal agents have made treating onychomycosis easier. Terbinafine and itraconazole are the therapeutic agents of choice. Although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not labeled fluconazole for the treatment of onychomycosis, early efficacy data are promising. Continuous oral terbinafine therapy is most effective against dermatophytes, which are responsible for the majority of onychomycosis cases. Intermittent pulse dosing with itraconazole is as safe and effective as short-term continuous therapy but more economical and convenient. With careful monitoring, patients treated with the newer antifungal agents have a good chance of achieving relief from onychomycosis and its complications.

### Topical therapy for toenail onychomycosis: an evidence-based review [^bfbcd004]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Managing toenail onychomycosis with topical treatments is challenging. It is difficult for topical medication to penetrate the nail plate, and this is reflected in lower cure rates with topical treatment than with oral treatment. However, oral medications may not be suitable for some patients, because of drug interactions; therefore, topical treatments are critical in managing the disease in certain patient populations.

Objective

This paper reviews the quality and content of the scientific literature on topical treatments for toenail onychomycosis.

Methods

PubMed, Ovid (Medline and Embase), Scopus, Cochrane library, and clinicaltrials.gov databases were searched for original clinical reports of topical monotherapy for microscopy and/or culture-confirmed toenail onychomycosis in adults. Studies were evaluated using an onychomycosis study quality scale, which was based on the CONSORT guidelines.

Results

Twenty-five publications (28 studies) were identified and met the inclusion criteria. Thirteen studies scored high ratings on the quality scale. These were randomized controlled trials or randomized comparative trials. Low-quality studies were nonrandomized, open studies that prevented statistical analysis. Most studies reported clinical and mycological cure. The most variation was observed with reporting outcomes of clinical improvement. Amorolfine, ciclopirox, tavaborole, and efinaconazole produced clinical and mycological cure in patients with mild to moderate toenail onychomycosis (< 50–65% nail involvement), with efinaconazole showing the highest rates. Treatments were generally applied daily for 24–48 weeks, with longer treatment and follow-up showing better outcomes.

Conclusion

Topical treatment with amorolfine, ciclopirox, tavaborole, or efinaconazole is appropriate for cases of mild to moderate toenail onychomycosis due to dermatophyte or mixed dermatophyte/Candida infection.

### Topical and device-based treatment of toenail onychomycosis… [^78a439d5]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Are topical and device-based therapies safe and effective in the treatment of toenail onychomycosis. Evidence-Based Answer Topical antifungal drugs, including efinaconazole 10% solution, tavaborole 5% solution, and ciclopirox 8% lacquer and hydrolacquer, are beneficial in treating mild to moderate toenail onychomycosis. 1, 2 Potential adverse effects are mild and include dermatitis and vesicles.

1. 1 Most studies addressed mild to moderate onychomycosis without matrix involvement and with more than one toenail affected. Participants were 27 to 68 years of age, on average, with a treatment duration of 36 or 48 weeks, and clinical outcomes were measured up to four weeks after treatment completion. Finally, ciclopirox 8% lacquer was superior to placebo at achieving mycologic cure and complete cure. When compared with ciclopirox 8% lacquer and amorolfine 5% lacquer, ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer was more effective at achieving complete cure. However, there was no difference between these treatments in mycologic cure or risk of adverse effects, including erythema, rash, and burning. 1 Current clinical practice guidelines recommend using oral antifungal agents as first-line treatment for onychomycosis; however, this may not be feasible for patients with limited access to care, potential drug interactions, contraindications to oral therapy, or a preference for topical treatment. 4, 5 Of note, oral terbinafine costs the same as or less than topical agents. 6.

### Assessing treatment outcomes in toenail onychomycosis clinical trials [^b140d99a]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Several oral and topical medications are available for the treatment of onychomycosis, a widespread fungal infection of the nail. Since efficacy criteria vary greatly among clinical trials for onychomycosis treatment, it is difficult for physicians to compare outcomes and determine the appropriate therapy for a given patient. The present analysis evaluates the efficacy criteria used in intention-to-treat clinical trials of itraconazole, terbinafine, and 8% ciclopirox nail lacquer, drugs approved by the US FDA for the treatment of onychomycosis. Efficacy parameters often appear to use subjective assessment tools and may not include the actual size measurement of the affected target nail as an efficacy variable. Parameters, which assess both mycologic and clinical cure, are frequently omitted from clinical trials. Not surprisingly, clinical trials with stringent efficacy criteria, which assess both mycologic and clinical response/cure without use of subjective methods, appear to have the lowest rates for both therapeutic response and complete cure. Thus, an evaluation of treatment options for onychomycosis cannot solely compare success/failure rates in clinical trials, but requires a critical appraisal of the efficacy criteria utilized in those trials.

### Clinical evaluation of safety and efficacy of a new topical treatment for onychomycosis [^48641fa4]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

This clinical study assessed the safety and efficacy of an investigational topical product for the treatment of onychomycosis (nail fungus).

Method

A prospective, multi-center, single-arm, self-controlled clinical investigation was done with adult subjects that met the inclusion criteria, primarily culture-confirmed dermatophyte infection of at least one great toe. Subjects self-treated in a weekly regimen of topical application for six months, with clinical assessment at one, three, and six months. Primary efficacy endpoint was clearance of fungal nail infection after six months of weekly treatment. Primary safety endpoint was freedom from product-related adverse events for the duration of the treatment term.

Results

Fifty males and 13 females, ages 24 to 65, infected with Trichophyton (n = 62) or Epidermophyton (n = 1) were enrolled; 53 completed six months of assessment. Sixty percent showed improvement in clinical parameters (nail color, nail plate involvement, onycholysis, thickness, and hyperkeratosis) at six months. Cumulative rates of dermatophyte-negative culture results (test of cure) were 28, 36, and 62 percent of subjects after one, three, and six months of treatment, respectively. Three minor adverse events were device-related, with no unanticipated or serious adverse events.

Limitations

This study was single-arm and self-controlled; 53 of 63 enrolled subjects completed the study.

Conclusion

This study describes a new topical medical device with safety and efficacy profiles that compare favorably to results reported for topically applied onychomycosis drug treatments.

### Systematic review of the prevalence of onychomycosis in children [^2de43613]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Fungal infection of the nails accounts for 15%–40% of all nail disease and is one of the most common nail diseases in adults. The prevalence of onychomycosis increases with age and is reported to be infrequent in children. It has nevertheless been suggested that the incidence of onychomycosis in children may have increased over the last three decades. However, most studies are retrospective and based on information from medical records or laboratory data.

Pediatric onychomycosis is important to diagnose and treat for several reasons. Early detection and treatment of onychomycosis is crucial to prevent disease progression. In addition, early treatment of onychomycosis can result in higher cure rates. Mild onychomycosis can be treated topically with good clearance in children. Few antifungal therapies are licensed to onychomycosis treatment in children. Topical therapy is used as monotherapy for milder cases and is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from the age of ≥ 12 years (ciclopirox), and ≥ 6 years (efinaconazole, tavaborole). Treatment with topical therapy is reported to be more effective in children than in adults, with low risk of side effects and low systemic exposure. Systemic treatment is added when the disease is more severe but has a larger risk of drug interaction and adverse events. No systemic antifungal therapy is licensed for treatment of onychomycosis in children.

The aim of this systematic review is to explore the worldwide prevalence of onychomycosis in children.

### The use of topical therapies to treat onychomycosis [^a2c05d9b]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

The management of onychomycosis using topical agents has improved with the introduction of ciclopirox and amorolfine nail lacquers; other topical agents may be less effective. The combination of a nail lacquer with an oral antifungal agent may further improve efficacy rates in certain clinical presentations (eg, among those individuals with severe onychomycosis). Topical agents have a favorable adverse events profile. Further studies are required on the treatment of onychomycosis with nail lacquers.

### Onychomycosis: diagnosis and definition of cure [^9dff4da9]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Until now, there has been no agreement on criteria defining resolution of onychomycosis. Most published reports use clinical and mycological cure, which comprises a completely normal-appearing nail plate, and negative nail culture and microscopy results, as the end point for defining success of therapeutic intervention. Reported here is the definition of onychomycosis, which delineates both primary and secondary criteria for diagnosis of onychomycosis and identifies clinical and laboratory parameters to define a resolved fungal nail infection. Onychomycosis cure is defined by the absence of clinical signs or the presence of negative nail culture and/or microscopy results with one or more of the following minor clinical signs: (1) minimal distal subungual hyperkeratosis; and (2) nail-plate thickening. Clinical signs indicative of persistent onychomycosis at the end of the observation period include (1) white/yellow or orange/brown streaks or patches in or beneath the nail plate; and (2) lateral onycholysis with subungual debris. Although nail appearance will usually continue to improve after cessation of therapy, the nails may have a persistent abnormal appearance even in cases where treatment has been effective.

### Antifungal therapy for onychomycosis in children [^13919e90]. Clinics in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a chronic infection of the nail unit, and its prevalence increases with age. Treatment options for children are similar to those for adults and include both oral and topical therapies. Oral agents, such as terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole have been reported to have good efficacy and a low rate of side effects in children. Topical therapies, such as amorolfine and ciclopirox, can also be used as monotherapy or combined with oral agents to treat onychomycosis. Due to their thinner, faster-growing nails, children are more likely to respond to topical monotherapy than adults. There is currently insufficient data comparing emerging medical devices, such as laser therapy, with standard therapeutic options to recommend their use in children.

### Combination therapy for onychomycosis [^2f515cd4]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Combination therapy is one way of improving the cure rate of onychomycosis. The LION Study examined the efficacies of terbinafine and itraconazole. The Icelandic cohort of the study reported that after 5 years only 46% of the terbinafine-treated patients and 13% of the itraconazole-treated patients were still disease-free, suggesting that relapses and reinfections were common in the long term treatment of onychomycosis with monotherapy. Combination therapy is a well-established principle in mycology; the current strategy involves the combination of oral and topical antifungal treatments. A number of specific drug combinations have proved to be useful in the treatment of onychomycosis: tioconazole and griseofulvin, amorolfine and griseofulvin, amorolfine and terbinafine, and amorolfine and itraconazole. However, comparison of the combination trials can be difficult because of the short duration of some of the studies and variation in global cure rates. Although it is necessary to consider these factors it is clear that combination therapy offers advantages when compared with monotherapy. Combination therapy can be administered sequentially or in parallel. Parallel therapy is recommended for patients who are likely to fail therapy (e.g. patients with diabetes), whereas sequential therapy is recommended for patients who show a poor response to initial treatment.

### A phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, dose-ranging study to investigate the efficacy and safety of 4 dose regimens of oral albaconazole in patients with distal subungual onychomycosis [^ba4b45bc]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis is effectively treated with terbinafine and itraconazole. However, frequent repeated dosing is required, and hepatic and cardiac adverse events may occur.

Objectives

Evaluate efficacy and safety of albaconazole, a novel triazole, for once-weekly treatment of distal subungual onychomycosis of the great toenail.

Methods

This double-blind, phase II study randomized 584 patients to receive albaconazole 100 to 400 mg or placebo weekly for 24 or 36 weeks. Effective treatment was measured as mycologic cure and clear or almost clear nail at week 52.

Results

All treatment groups achieved greater effective treatment rates (21%-54%) compared to placebo (1%; P < .001 for all groups) at week 52. Effective treatment was attained at week 24 in ≥ 5% of patients in most groups. Most adverse events were mild or moderate, and treatment-related adverse events were all ≤ 3%. No treatment-related hepatic or cardiac serious adverse events were observed.

Limitations

The follow-up period was likely too short to detect maximal efficacy; cure rates were increasing at study end. The efficacy and tolerability of albaconazole were not compared with other available treatments, and the global change in target toenail scale was subjective.

Conclusions

Albaconazole was well tolerated at all doses and resulted in high cure rates for onychomycosis.

### Treatment of onychomycosis in the diabetic patient population [^5dc2e10d]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2003). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a common medical condition in patients with diabetes. Conflicting data exist as to whether diabetes predisposes patients to the disease. Controversy notwithstanding, patients with diabetes have several medical conditions (obesity, peripheral neuropathy, and retinopathy) that can inhibit the identification or mask the progression of fungal nail infections. In addition, vascular insufficiency, impaired wound healing, and compromised immunologic status associated with diabetic foot increase the risk of secondary infections in diabetic patients with onychomycosis. Such factors contribute to an increased morbidity and decreased quality of life in these patients and underscore the need for effective antifungal treatment. Oral antifungal agents are generally well tolerated, but serious adverse events independent of or associated with a number of significant drug interactions have been reported. The availability of a topical therapy, ciclopirox topical solution, 8% (Penlac Nail Lacquer), provides clinicians with an additional effective and well-tolerated treatment option. In order to further increase the efficacy of topical or oral treatment, mechanical intervention (e.g., debridement) may be combined with either of these options. Choice of appropriate treatment and careful monitoring of fungal nail infections can prevent significant morbidity in patients with diabetes.

### Onychomycosis diagnosis and management: perspectives from a joint dermatology-podiatry roundtable [^fd7fab9e]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis prevalence is expected to rise as the population ages and the prevalence of diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and other significant risk factors rise. Until recently, treatment options were limited due to safety concerns with oral antifungals and low efficacy with available topical agents. Efinaconzole and tavaborole were approved by the FDA in 2014 for onychomycosis treatment and provide additional effective topical treatment options for patients with mild-to-moderate disease. Dermatologists and podiatrists both regularly treat onychomycosis, yet there are striking differences between specialties in approach to diagnosis and treatment. In order to explore these differences a joint dermatology-podiatry roundtable of onychomycosis experts was convened. Although it has little effect on mycologic cure, debridement may be a valuable adjunct to oral or topical antifungal therapy, especially in patients with greater symptom burden. However, few dermatologists incorporate debridement into their treatment plans and referral to podiatry may be appropriate for some of these patients. Furthermore, podiatrists may be better equipped to manage patients with concurrent diabetes or peripheral vascular disease and elderly patients who are unable to maintain proper foot hygiene. Once cure is achieved, lifestyle and hygiene practices, maintenance/prophylactic onychomycosis treatment, and proactive tinea pedis treatment in patients and family members may help to maintain patients' cured status.

### Onychomycosis: rapid evidence review [^3c41b354]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Onychomycosis is a chronic fungal infection of the fingernail or toenail bed leading to brittle, discolored, and thickened nails. Onychomycosis is not just a cosmetic problem. Untreated onychomycosis can cause pain, discomfort, and physical impairment, negatively impacting quality of life. Onychomycosis should be suspected in patients with discolored nails, nail plate thickening, nail separation, and foul-smelling nails. Accurate diagnosis is important before initiating treatment because therapy is lengthy and can cause adverse effects. A potassium hydroxide preparation with confirmatory fungal culture, periodic acid-Schiff stain, or polymerase chain reaction is the preferred diagnostic approach if confirmative testing is cost prohibitive or not available. Treatment decisions should be based on severity, comorbidities, and patient preference. Oral terbinafine is preferred over topical therapy because of better effectiveness and shorter treatment duration. Patients taking terbinafine in combination with tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, atypical antipsychotics, beta blockers, or tamoxifen should be monitored for drug-drug interactions. Topical therapy, including ciclopirox 8%, efinaconazole 10%, and tavaborole 5%, is less effective than oral agents but can be used to treat mild to moderate onychomycosis, with fewer adverse effects and drug-drug interactions. Nail trimming and debridement used concurrently with pharmacologic therapy improve treatment response. Although photodynamic and plasma therapies are newer treatment options that have been explored for the treatment of onychomycosis, larger randomized trials are needed. Preventive measures such as avoiding walking barefoot in public places and disinfecting shoes and socks are thought to reduce the 25% relapse rate.

### Clinical inertia in onychomycosis treatment: results from the illuminating dialogues and insights in onychomycosis management (IDIOM) survey [^3230f3e8]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail that can serve as a reservoir for tinea infections in other parts of the body and can be transmitted to other individuals. As the disease progresses, it can lead to functional impairment, such as difficulties in walking, and negatively impact the psychosocial aspects of quality of life. Onychomycosis treatment, especially topical, is long-term, and adequate follow-up is essential for cure. However, the realities and issues of patient-physician communication after treatment initiation, including patients' perception of efficacy, treatment satisfaction, and reconsideration of the treatment approach, remain unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the realities and issues associated with onychomycosis treatment, focusing on topical therapies, through a web-based survey of patients with onychomycosis and dermatologists. The duration of topical treatment was prolonged, with 30.5% of patients undergoing topical therapy for more than 2years. Of these, 54.5% had not perceived clear efficacy. In addition, 93.7% of all patients with onychomycosis expressed a desire to change their treatment if it was ineffective. However, only 29.9% of patients receiving topical treatment discussed changing their treatment with their physicians, and only 7.3% ultimately changed their treatment. These findings indicate that the review of treatment strategies was insufficient. Furthermore, the satisfaction rate among patients treated with oral medications was higher than that of patients treated with topical medication. Despite dermatologists' awareness of low patient satisfaction with topical treatments, approximately 40% recommended alternative topical therapies when the initial topical treatment was ineffective. These results suggest clinical inertia in the treatment of onychomycosis stemming from a lack of appropriate intensification of treatment. In managing onychomycosis, the patient and dermatologist must share a common understanding of the importance of regular evaluation and the optimization of treatment regimens during treatment and must work side by side toward a cure.

In this position paper, we discuss interpretation of mycological outcome and clinical trial length.

Methods

We reviewed data from seven international onychomycosis trials that enrolled subjects with positive KOH and dermatophyte-positive culture at screening followed by 48 weeks of treatment. Further, we examined 94 KOH-positive/culture-negative week 52 follow-up samples for morphological hyphal damage.

Results

From 3054 samples collected at week 52 follow-up visits, 2360 were culture-negative. However, a significant percentage (78.7%) of these subungual samples (n = 1857) remained KOH-positive. From the subset of follow-up samples examined for morphological changes, we identified hyphal breakage or distortion in 56 direct smears (60%), which may indicate nonviability.

Conclusions

Reassessment of the definition of onychomycosis cure is critical. For clinical trials of topical agents, length of treatment should be re-examined. Further, in our experience, a high rate of subungual debris samples remained direct smear-positive while converting to negative culture. Evidence of morphological hyphal damage suggests that late-visit microscopic results may be false-positives. Therefore, the absence of clinical signs following an adequate washout period, coupled with a negative culture, with or without negative microscopy, should be considered the definition of onychomycosis cure.

### Onychomycosis does not always require systemic treatment for cure: a trial using topical therapy [^86c0e1fb]. Pediatric Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Standard teaching dictates that systemic therapy is required for treatment of onychomycosis. It is unknown whether topical antifungal therapy is effective for pediatric nail infections. This prospective, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study was conducted in the Pediatric Dermatology Research Unit at Rady Children's Hospital to determine whether topical antifungal therapy is efficacious for pediatric onychomycosis. Forty patients ages 2 to 16 years with nonmatrix onychomycosis were randomized 1:3 to ciclopirox lacquer or vehicle lacquer. Ciclopirox lacquer or vehicle was applied daily for 32 weeks, with weekly removal of the lacquer and mechanical trimming. Those with poor response were crossed over to active drug at week 12. Thirty-seven patients completed the 32-week study, and follow-up data were collected 1 year after completion of the study from 24 patients. Mycologic cure, effective treatment, and complete cure were assessed, as well as adverse events and effect on quality of life. Mycologic cure was 70% in the treated group and 20% in the vehicle arm (p = 0.03) at week 12. At end of the study (week 32), 77% of treated patients achieved mycologic cure and 71% effective treatment, compared with 22% of the control group. Ninety-two percent of those who were cured and followed for 1 year remained clear. Topical antifungal lacquer (ciclopirox) can be an effective option for children with nonmatrix onychomycosis. Pediatric onychomycosis does not always require systemic therapy and responds better to topical therapy than does adult disease.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: a multicenter, single-arm study [^f1ae87ab]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The study clarifies the new efficacy of EFCZ in subjects with onychomycosis and warrants higher safety. These properties may possibly expand the potentiality of EFCZ as a good treatment option for patients with various lesions and backgrounds.

On the other hand, a certain number of patients are resistant to treatment with EFCZ; thus, combination therapy with oral drugs or other surgical treatments would be considered. In fact, reports have described improved cure rates after using a topical preparation in combination with an oral drug or nail debridement, 20, 21, 22 and that EFCZ in combination with laser therapy enhances the therapeutic efficacy. 23 Further studies on such cases will be expected. Topical treatment of onychomycosis may be currently at a turning point in the world. From the results of this study, we predict EFCZ to become a practical option for the treatment of onychomycosis.

### Efinaconazole (Jublia) [^3b0655e0]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The safety and efficacy of once daily use of JUBLIA for the treatment of onychomycosis of the toenail were assessed in two 52-week prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trials in subjects 18 years and older (18 to 70 years of age) with 20% to 50% clinical involvement of the target toenail, without dermatophytomas or lunula (matrix) involvement. The trials compared 48 weeks of treatment with JUBLIA to the vehicle solution. The Complete Cure rate was assessed at Week 52 (4 weeks after completion of therapy). Complete cure was defined as 0% involvement of the target toenail (no clinical evidence of onychomycosis of the target toenail) in addition to Mycologic Cure, defined as both negative fungal culture and negative KOH. Table 2 lists the efficacy results for trials 1 and 2.

### The effects of COlaser and topical agent combination therapy for onychomycosis: a meta-analysis [^b1f6dfc7]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

The routine options for onychomycosis are oral, topical, and device-based therapies which are often limited in terms of efficacy and unsatisfactory side effects. Topical agents such as luliconazole, tioconazole, terbinafine, and tazarotene can be more effective when combined with laser therapies. Our aim was to compare the efficacy and satisfaction rates of CO 2 laser therapy with topical agents in patients with onychomycosis. PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, and Ovid databases were searched to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of combined therapies. Selected study data were analyzed for differences expressed as odds ratio (OR) and relative ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. Efficacy and satisfaction outcomes were assessed using quantitative methods. Our investigations showed that combined CO 2 laser and topical treatments significantly increased efficacy 5.38-fold when compared with topical agents alone (OR 5.38; 95% CI; 3.20–9.04; p < 0.00001), with low heterogeneity observed among studies (I² = 38%). Mycological clearance comparison rates were also improved by combined treatments. The higher satisfaction of the combined group was assessed by pooled effect (OR 4.56; 95% CI; 2.78–7.49; p < 0.00001). Our evidence suggests combined therapy may exert positive effects and satisfactory safety for patients with moderate to severe onychomycosis, however, optimal combination options and appropriate dosages require more comprehensive RCTs.

### Pilot study to evaluate a plasma device for the treatment of onychomycosis [^d28ab57e]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail unit, and is the most common of the nail disorders. Current therapies for onychomycosis have less than ideal efficacy and have the potential for adverse effects. As previous studies have shown that nonthermal plasma inhibits the in vitro growth of Trichophyton rubrum, we conducted a pilot study on 19 participants with toenail onychomycosis. The primary endpoint was safety of the device, and secondary outcome measures were clinical efficacy and mycological cure. Patient satisfaction was measured using questionnaires at the completion of the study. All but one patient met the primary endpoint of safety and there were no long-term sequelae. The overall clinical cure was 53.8% and the mycological cure was 15.4%. The majority of patients were satisfied with the treatment. Our conclusions are that nonthermal plasma is a safe treatment and may have a beneficial effect on toenail onychomycosis.

### Prospective efficacy and safety evaluation of laser treatments with real-time temperature feedback for fungal onychomycosis [^88a14da7]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Onychomycosis affects five percent of the worldwide population. Onychomycosis is a therapeutic challenge. Current therapies on the market are either ineffective or require patient monitoring. Laser and light technologies are being investigated as a possible treatment option for onychomycosis. The proposed mechanism of action is unknown. All infectious agents may be killed by heat (except prions). One possible theory is the photothermal effect from water absorbing lasers creates bulk heating in the nail plate to kill fungal hyphae. Laser technology may be a promising new treatment option for onychomycosis. This is a prospective trial with real-time temperature feedback to evaluate efficacy and safety of laser therapy for onychomycosis.

Methods

Twenty-one patients with PAS or culture proven fungal onychomycosis were prospectively treated with laser until target temperature of 46–48 degrees Celsius was achieved using real-time infrared temperature feedback. The laser and light therapies used were 1319 nm, 1064 nm and BroadBand Light. Exclusion criteria included mixed infection and no other prior therapeutic interventions. Subjects received four treatment sessions one week apart. Assessments included PAS & cultures at one, three and six months post treatment. Patients also were asked a pain score from 1–10 during treatment.

Results

Patients tolerated the procedures well with high satisfaction. Average treatment time was 10 minutes. No adverse events were noted. Patients reported mild-moderate transient discomfort during treatment. Six-month culture results revealed 20/21 negative for fungal organisms.

Conclusion

Laser therapy offers a safe and effective new option for onychomycosis. This may be the optimal therapy for a large market that needs alternative or adjunct to current therapies. Laser is quick, painless therapy that does not require any oral medications or blood test for monitoring. Additional larger scientific studies are needed to confirm our pilot study results.

### Terbinafine, 250 mg once daily-12 weeks on, 12 weeks off, four… [^300d6c44]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question What is the best oral monotherapy for toenail onychomycosis in adults. Bottom Line Based on effectiveness, safety, and cost, a regimen of terbinafine, 250 mg once daily for 12 weeks, followed by a 12-week period of no therapy and then a four-week booster, was preferred for onychomycosis in adults for the outcome of complete cure at one year. This POEM aligns with the Canadian Dermatology Association's Choosing Wisely Canada recommendation: Do not prescribe systemic antifungals for suspected onychomycosis without mycologic confirmation of dermatophyte infection. Synopsis The goal of the network meta-analysis was to compare individual oral antifungal regimens directly and indirectly for onychomycosis in adults. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve, a measure of the likelihood that a regimen was more likely to be effective or to cause harms, was calculated for each study and outcome.

The researchers identified a total of 21 studies. Study quality was mixed, with many studies failing to mask participants and/or physicians. An overall assessment of the quality of each study was not provided, although most were at moderate to high risk of bias. The highest complete cure rates at one year were found with terbinafine, 250 mg once daily for 12 weeks, followed by no treatment for 12 weeks and then terbinafine, 250 mg once daily for another four weeks; the same regimen, but with an initial treatment period of eight weeks; and albaconazole, 400 mg once weekly for 36 weeks. Terbinafine, 250 mg once daily for 24 weeks, had the highest likelihood of mycologic cure.

Terbinafine, 250 mg daily for 12 weeks, was found to be significantly safer than albaconazole, 400 mg weekly for 36 weeks; oteseconazole, 600 mg daily for two weeks, then 600 mg weekly for 10 weeks; fluconazole, 300 mg once weekly for 12 months; and posaconazole, 200 mg daily for 24 weeks.

### Terbinafine [^bd94b7e0]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of terbinafine tablets in the treatment of onychomycosis is illustrated by the response of subjects with toenail and/or fingernail infections who participated in three US/Canadian placebo-controlled clinical trials.

Results of the first toenail trial, as assessed at week 48 (12 weeks of treatment with 36 weeks follow-up after completion of therapy), demonstrated mycological cure, defined as simultaneous occurrence of negative KOH plus negative culture, in 70% of subjects. Fifty-nine percent (59%) of subjects experienced effective treatment (mycological cure plus 0% nail involvement or greater than 5mm of new unaffected nail growth); 38% of subjects demonstrated mycological cure plus clinical cure (0% nail involvement).

In a second toenail trial of dermatophytic onychomycosis, in which nondermatophytes were also cultured, similar efficacy against the dermatophytes was demonstrated. The pathogenic role of the nondermatophytes cultured in the presence of dermatophytic onychomycosis has not been established. The clinical significance of this association is unknown.

Results of the fingernail trial, as assessed at week 24 (6 weeks of treatment with 18 weeks follow-up after completion of therapy), demonstrated mycological cure in 79% of subjects, effective treatment in 75% of the subjects, and mycological cure plus clinical cure in 59% of the subjects.

The mean time to overall success was approximately 10 months for the first toenail trial and 4 months for the fingernail trial. In the first toenail trial, for subjects evaluated at least 6 months after achieving clinical cure and at least 1 year after completing therapy with terbinafine tablets, the clinical relapse rate was approximately 15%.

### A clinical review of laser and light therapy for nail psoriasis and onychomycosis [^1d6a7ebd]. Dermatologic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

There are considerable emerging data in the use of lasers and lights to treat onychomycosis and psoriasis of the nail subunit.

Objective

We aimed to review all of the medical literature on laser therapy of nail psoriasis and onychomycosis published since 1992.

Methods and Materials

We performed a PubMed literature search using the search terms "nail", "laser therapy", "laser surgery", "light", with search terms "psoriasis" and "onychomycosis". In addition, we performed extensive MeSH and bibliographic searches as delineated in the manuscript. Because of the poor quality of evidence, we were not able to complete a quantitative review and thus present our findings qualitatively.

Results

Although the trials are small, PDL (595 nm) and IPL with a 550-nm filter demonstrate compelling data in treating nail psoriasis. Laser studies of onychomycosis fall short on many levels. Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers with very short pulse durations and fractionated CO2 demonstrate the most promise for the treatment of onychomycosis.

Conclusion

The data for treating nail psoriasis and onychomycosis with laser and light therapy are rapidly emerging. With increased subject data, improved study methodology, and more precise output parameters, lasers may become an important modality in the treatment of nail psoriasis and onychomycosis.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: a multicenter, single-arm study [^ad012dae]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

However, in clinical practise, EFCZ may be used in cases exceeding the study criteria, namely more severe cases with more than 50% clinical involvement or with long‐term use for over 1 year. 6 Therefore, it is meaningful to obtain information on the efficacy and safety of EFCZ when used in severe cases or applied for over 48 weeks to provide findings for clinical medicine.

Our study was conducted to examine the efficacy of EFCZ by daily application for up to 72 weeks in patients with onychomycosis with 20% or more clinical involvement of the nails, including severe cases. As for the impact of EFCZ on patient QOL, only one report so far has used OnyCOE‐tTM, 7 which is a QOL questionnaire regarding onychomycosis. So far, no similar study has been conducted in the Japanese population, and thus we decided to include this as one of the aims of our study.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: a multicenter, single-arm study [^489c3c51]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

In our study, the treatment success rate in terms of the primary end‐point (≤ 10% clinical involvement) was 56.6% in the eligible patients after applying EFCZ for up to 72 weeks. In the multinational phase III study for EFCZ in subjects with onychomycosis who had 20–50% area of nail involvement, the treatment success rate was defined as the percentage of subjects with less than 10% area of nail involvement. Treatment success rate was 31.0%, and in the subgroup analysis in the Japanese population, this rate was 46.7% (48 weeks of application and assessed at week 52). 4, 5 Considering that the definitions of treatment success are slightly different in a precise sense and that our study included not only patients with DLSO but also those with SWO, an equable comparison is not possible. However, when comparing only with the population with an affected area of 20–50%, a similar trend of 57.6% (at week 48) was obtained in our study.

### A 1, 320-nm Nd: YAG laser for improving the appearance of onychomycosis [^6d196390]. Dermatologic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis is a therapeutic challenge because of the toxicities of systemic medications. This has led to the investigation of light-based technologies for safe and effective alternative treatment modalities.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of 4 treatments with a 1,320-nm neodymium:yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser in improving the appearance of onychomycosis.

Materials and Methods

This study was a 24-week, single-center randomized placebo-controlled study. Ten subjects were enrolled with culture-proven, bilateral great toenail onychomycosis. The subjects received 4 treatments with the 1,320-nm Nd:YAG laser to the treatment toenail on Days 1, 7, 14, and 60. The control toenail received a sham treatment of cryogen cooling only. Mycologic cultures were obtained at 3-month follow-up visits.

Results

Fifty percent of mycologic cultures were negative at the 3-month follow-up after 4 laser treatments. Toenails had improvement in subungual debris, hypertrophy, and yellowing. Patient satisfaction was upheld as assessed by the Nail Quality of Life Questionnaire.

Conclusion

The 1,320-nm Nd:YAG laser may be a safe and effective therapy for improving the appearance of onychomycosis. Additional therapy may be necessary to enhance long-term results. Further investigation needs to explore the optimal treatment settings and the most effective treatment schedule.

### Impact of new antifungal medications on onychomycosis prescriptions and costs in Japan: a nationwide claims database study [^c6f6c1aa]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, this study highlights the dynamic shifts in prescription patterns for onychomycosis treatment, particularly the rapid introduction of new antifungal medications, such as efinaconazole and fosravuconazole, which have significantly altered treatment approaches. Despite the guideline recommendations for oral medications, the predominance of topical treatments in older adults suggests a potential gap between guideline recommendations and clinical practice. Furthermore, the substantial economic impact of onychomycosis treatments, particularly newer antifungal medications, necessitates the assessment of their cost‐effectiveness.

### Safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of efinaconazole 10% topical solution for onychomycosis treatment in pediatric patients [^63aad0b6]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pediatric onychomycosis management is challenging as there are limited treatment options. The objective of this study was to evaluate efinaconazole 10% topical solution in children with onychomycosis.

Methods

This phase 4, multicenter, open-label study (NCT02812771) evaluated safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy of efinaconazole 10% topical solution in pediatric participants (6–16 years). Efinaconazole was administered once daily for 48 weeks, with a 4-week posttreatment follow up. Participants had culture-positive, mild-to-severe distal lateral subungual onychomycosis affecting at least 20% of at least 1 great toenail. The PK subset included participants 12–16 years with moderate-to-severe onychomycosis affecting at least 50% of each great toenail and onychomycosis in at least 4 additional toenails.

Results

Of 62 enrolled participants, 60 were included in the safety population and 17 in the PK population. Efinaconazole 10% topical solution was well tolerated. The concentration-time profiles for efinaconazole and its major metabolite were relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations during the 24-hour dosing interval. Systemic exposure to efinaconazole was low. By week 52, 65.0% of participants achieved mycologic cure, with a 36.7% mycologic cure rate observed as early as week 12. A total of 40.0% of participants achieved complete cure, 50.0% achieved clinical efficacy, and 88.3% achieved fungal cure by week 52.

Conclusion

Efinaconazole was safe and efficacious in pediatric participants with mild-to-severe onychomycosis, with improved mycologic cure and complete cure rates compared with adults from two 52-week studies. J Drugs Dermatol. 2020;19(9):867–872. doi:10.36849/JDD.2020.5401.

### Treatment of nondermatophyte mold and Candida onychomycosis [^235db1e8]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

Mold onychomycosis often can be clinically suspected because of the presence of periungual inflammation. Treatment with systemic antifungals is very effective in onychomycosis caused by Aspergillus sp. Scopulariopsis brevicaulis and Fusarium sp. infection are difficult to eradicate and treatment with systemic antifungals should always be associated with topical treatment with nail lacquers. Candida onychomycosis is always a sign of immunodepression. Systemic treatment with itraconazole or fluconazole is usually effective, but relapses are very common.

### The use of terbinafine in the treatment of onychomycosis in adults and special populations: a review of the evidence [^8029882d]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Terbinafine is an allylamine with fungicidal activity, first approved for the treatment of onychomycosis in the United Kingdom in the early 1990s, and in the US in 1996. Terbinafine is the most frequently prescribed oral antifungal agent in the US and Canada for onychomycosis. Its efficacy and safety in dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis in adults has been established in many studies. In fact, 18 randomized controlled trials have shown terbinafine to be highly effective, with a meta-average for mycological cure of 76% ± 3% (mean ± standard error). In large surveillance studies, terbinafine exhibited excellent safety profiles consistent with results obtained in pivotal studies. Additionally, terbinafine has been reported to be superior to both itraconazole and fluconazole in comparative studies in the treatment of dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis. Recent studies have reported terbinafine to be more cost effective than griseofulvin, fluconazole, or itraconazole. Terbinafine has also been used to treat onychomycosis effectively and safely in special patient populations, such as children, the elderly, immunocompromised patients, diabetics, and those with Down syndrome. Terbinafine should therefore be considered for the management of onychomycosis in adults based on its effectiveness, broad spectrum, fungicidal nature, established safety profile, and very low occurrence of drug interactions. Furthermore, the data support the use of terbinafine to treat dermatophyte onychomycosis in children and the elderly.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: a multicenter, single-arm study [^f8fd70f4]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Another finding in our study is that the therapeutic effect was examined for severe cases with an affected area of more than 50%, which was not sufficiently evaluated in the multinational phase III clinical study. The treatment success rate in the subjects with severe onychomycosis with more than 50% affected area was 31.3% at week 48 and 36.3% at week 72, showing continuous improvement over time. Changes in the affected area started to increase from week 12 after starting the application, and at the final assessment, the changes in the affected area from the start of application was 49.7%. This indicates that the affected area in the subjects with more than 50% affected area continuously improved over time with EFCZ application. As for the decreased rate in the affected area, the proportion of subjects in whom the treatment was determined to be effective or better was almost the same in the group with affected areas of 20–50% and the group with affected areas of more than 50% at week 72, indicating the high efficacy of EFCZ regardless of severity. Limited to severe cases, the treatment success rate was 36.3% at week 72, but considering the 47.5% mycological cure rate and changes in nail growth, further improvement can be expected by continuous application. Noguchi et al. 6 also reported that efinaconazole was effective regardless of age, disease severity and clinical type when administrated alone in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases, consistent with the conclusions in our study.

### Receipt survey of prescription continuation rates for patients with onychomycosis and web-based survey of dermatologists on prescribing policies for onychomycosis therapeutics [^3e65b442]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Onychomycosis can be treated with topical and oral medications. However, it is important to appropriately select these medications according to the type and severity of the disease and ensure treatment is continued for the recommended duration. In Japan, treatment options for onychomycosis have increased in recent years. Moreover, in 2019, the guidelines for dermatomycosis treatment were revised. In this study, we conducted a receipt survey to clarify the actual treatment status of onychomycosis cases as indicated by the continuation rates of prescribed treatment drugs, together with a web-based survey to ascertain the prescribing policy of dermatologists regarding drugs for onychomycosis treatment. In agreement with past surveys, this receipt survey showed that the prescription continuation rate for oral medications was higher than that for topical medications. The 1-year prescription continuation rate for topical onychomycosis medications was found to be low (< 10%). The web-based survey showed that the percentage of physicians who prescribed oral medications as their first choice increased by approximately 10% for each disease type, compared with the results of the previous survey conducted around 7years ago. However, the study also confirmed that topical drugs are still prescribed for some disease types for which oral drugs are better suited. To ensure complete cure without patient drop-out, oral drugs with a high probability of achieving complete cure and a high continuation rate should be prescribed for patients with onychomycosis.

### Long-term efficacy of antifungals in toenail onychomycosis: a critical review [^a717857b]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Modern antifungal drugs achieve high mycological and clinical cure rates in onychomycosis of the toes, but little is known about the long-term evolution of the treated patients.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to analyse the therapeutic results recorded more than 1 year after initiation of therapy.

Methods

We used two endpoints for the analysis: EP1 (the number of patients with negative mycology after follow-up, divided by the number of patients included at day 0, including all patients lost to follow-up), and EP2 (the number of patients with negative mycology after follow-up divided by the number of patients with negative mycology at week 48). Clinical cure rate (EPclin) was the number of patients clinically cured or with minimal residual lesions divided by the number of patients included at day 0.

Results

From a Medline search we identified 17 studies providing results beyond 48 weeks. Ketoconazole 200 mg d⁻¹ up to 1 year resulted in EP1 of 11% at 18 months, and EP2 of 43%. Griseofulvin 1 g d⁻¹ for 1 year allowed an EP1 of 43% at 18 months, and EP2 of 71%. The mean EP1 after fluconazole once weekly up to 1 year was 49% at 18 months, and EP2 was 91%. With itraconazole 200 mg d⁻¹ or 400 mg d⁻¹ for 1 week each month for 3–4 months, EP1 was 37% at 18 months, and 53% at 2 years; EP2 was 76% at 4 years. Terbinafine 250 mg d⁻¹ for 12–16 weeks achieved an EP1 of 62% at 18 months, 72% at 2 years, and 60% at 4 years; EP2 was 80% at 18 months, 81% at 2 years, and 71% at 4 years. In the only study planned to compare the long-term efficacy of terbinafine and itraconazole, EP1 at 18 months was significantly higher with continuous terbinafine than with intermittent itraconazole (66% vs. 37%, P < 0.001). The clinical cure rates were 21% at 60 weeks and 37% at 72 weeks with fluconazole. EPclin was 27% at 18 months and 35% at 2 years with itraconazole. EPclin was 48% at 18 months, 69% at 2 years and 50% at 4 years with terbinafine.

Conclusions

Considering the stringency of the criteria we used, this critical review suggests that the long-term efficacy achieved with terbinafine is superior to that obtained with griseofulvin, ketoconazole, fluconazole or itraconazole.

### Impact of shared decision-making in onychomycosis treatment: a cross-sectional study based on the illuminating dialogues and insights in onychomycosis management (IDIOM) survey [^a01b94d8]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail characterized by deformity and discoloration. Besides aesthetic concerns, it can impair patients' quality of life and increase the risk of secondary bacterial infections as well as the spread of fungal infections to other body sites and other individuals, making it a potential public health concern. Treatment options include oral and topical medications, the latter often requiring long-term therapy. While oral antifungal agents demonstrate high efficacy against onychomycosis, concerns about side effects and drug-drug interactions may act as barriers to their selection. Shared decision-making (SDM) is a collaborative process in which patients and physicians share information based on scientific evidence and make decisions together taking into account the patient's values and preferences. While SDM has been reported to be beneficial across various disease areas, its utility in the treatment of onychomycosis remains insufficiently explored. In this study, we conducted an online survey of patients with onychomycosis to cross-sectionally compare the level of SDM implementation with patient concerns about oral medications, treatment satisfaction, perceived treatment efficacy, and treatment-switching behaviors. The percentage of patients with strong concerns about the side effects and drug-drug interactions of oral medications was significantly lower in the high SDM implementation group (21.7% and 13.0%, respectively) than in the low SDM implementation group (46.1% and 39.5%, respectively). Furthermore, the high SDM implementation group reported significantly higher treatment satisfaction than that reported by the low SDM implementation group, regardless of whether oral or topical treatment was used. These findings underscore the importance of SDM in the treatment of onychomycosis and suggest that dermatologists should actively consider implementing SDM.

### Efficacy and safety of luliconazole 5% nail solution for the treatment of onychomycosis: a multicenter, double-blind, randomized phase III study [^5411e3dc]. The Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a highly prevalent and intractable disease. The first-line treatment agents are oral preparations, but an effective topical medication has long been desired. The objective was to investigate the efficacy and safety of luliconazole 5% nail solution, an imidazole antifungal agent, for the treatment of patients with onychomycosis. A multicenter, double-blind, randomized phase III study was conducted in Japanese patients with distal lateral subungual onychomycosis affecting the great toenails, with 20–50% clinical involvement. Patients were randomized (2:1) to luliconazole or vehicle once daily for 48 weeks. The primary end-point was the complete cure rate (clinical cure [0% clinical involvement of the nail] plus mycological cure [negative results on direct microscopy]). The adverse event incidence was monitored to evaluate safety. The complete cure rate significantly favored luliconazole (14.9%, 29/194 subjects) versus vehicle (5.1%, 5/99) (P = 0.012). Similarly, the negative direct microscopy rate was significantly higher with luliconazole (45.4%, 79/174) than with vehicle (31.2%, 29/93) (P = 0.026). There were no serious adverse drug reactions. We conclude that once daily topical luliconazole 5% nail solution demonstrated clinical efficacy and was confirmed to be well tolerated.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: a multicenter, single-arm study [^458fe85c]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

We evaluated the efficacy of efinaconazole 10% topical solution in long‐term use, for up to 72 weeks, for onychomycosis, including severe cases. Among 605 participants, 219 patients diagnosed as having onychomycosis were evaluated for the efficacy of efinaconazole. The treatment success rate (< 10% clinical involvement of the target toenail) at the final assessment time point was 56.6%, the complete cure rate was 31.1% and the mycological cure rate was 61.6%, all of which increased over time, demonstrating that continuous application contributed to the improvement of cure rate. Even in severe cases, reduction of the affected nail area was observed, showing the potential efficacy of the treatment. Responses to a quality of life questionnaire among patients with onychomycosis, OnyCOE‐t, suggested that efinaconazole treatment improved the patients' quality of life. The incidence of adverse drug reaction in the patients eligible for the assessment was 6.3%, and this developed only in the administration site in all cases. No systemic adverse event was observed. In addition, no increase in the incidence of adverse drug reaction due to long‐term use was found. Efinaconazole therapy was proved to exhibit excellent balance between efficacy and safety, and thus may serve as a useful treatment option for onychomycosis.

### Terbinafine hydrochloride [^c525a60c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of terbinafine tablets in the treatment of onychomycosis is illustrated by the response of subjects with toenail and/or fingernail infections who participated in 3 US/Canadian placebo-controlled clinical trials.

Results of the first toenail trial, as assessed at week 48 (12 weeks of treatment with 36 weeks follow-up after completion of therapy), demonstrated mycological cure, defined as simultaneous occurrence of negative KOH plus negative culture, in 70% of subjects. Fifty-nine percent (59%) of subjects experienced effective treatment (mycological cure plus 0% nail involvement or greater than 5mm of new unaffected nail growth); 38% of subjects demonstrated mycological cure plus clinical cure (0% nail involvement).

In a second toenail trial of dermatophytic onychomycosis, in which nondermatophytes were also cultured, similar efficacy against the dermatophytes was demonstrated. The pathogenic role of the nondermatophytes cultured in the presence of dermatophytic onychomycosis has not been established. The clinical significance of this association is unknown.

Results of the fingernail trial, as assessed at week 24 (6 weeks of treatment with 18 weeks follow-up after completion of therapy), demonstrated mycological cure in 79% of subjects, effective treatment in 75% of the subjects, and mycological cure plus clinical cure in 59% of the subjects.

The mean time to overall success was approximately 10 months for the first toenail trial and 4 months for the fingernail trial. In the first toenail trial, for subjects evaluated at least 6 months after achieving clinical cure and at least 1 year after completing therapy with terbinafine tablets, the clinical relapse rate was approximately 15%.

### Itraconazole (Sporanox) [^1cb9c1c7]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

SPORANOX®(itraconazole) Capsules are indicated for the treatment of the following fungal infections in immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised patients:

Blastomycosis, pulmonary and extrapulmonary
Histoplasmosis, including chronic cavitary pulmonary disease and disseminated, non-meningeal histoplasmosis, and
Aspergillosis, pulmonary and extrapulmonary, in patients who are intolerant of or who are refractory to amphotericin B therapy.

Specimens for fungal cultures and other relevant laboratory studies (wet mount, histopathology, serology) should be obtained before therapy to isolate and identify causative organisms. Therapy may be instituted before the results of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known; however, once these results become available, antiinfective therapy should be adjusted accordingly.

SPORANOX®Capsules are also indicated for the treatment of the following fungal infections in non-immunocompromised patients:

Onychomycosis of the toenail, with or without fingernail involvement, due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium), and
Onychomycosis of the fingernail due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium).

Prior to initiating treatment, appropriate nail specimens for laboratory testing (KOH preparation, fungal culture, or nail biopsy) should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis of onychomycosis.

(See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations, CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Experience for more information.)

Blastomycosis

Analyses were conducted on data from two open-label, non-concurrently controlled studies (N = 73 combined) in patients with normal or abnormal immune status. The median dose was 200 mg/day. A response for most signs and symptoms was observed within the first 2 weeks, and all signs and symptoms cleared between 3 and 6 months. Results of these two studies demonstrated substantial evidence of the effectiveness of itraconazole for the treatment of blastomycosis compared with the natural history of untreated cases.

Histoplasmosis

Analyses were conducted on data from two open-label, non-concurrently controlled studies (N = 34 combined) in patients with normal or abnormal immune status (not including HIV-infected patients). The median dose was 200 mg/day. A response for most signs and symptoms was observed within the first 2 weeks, and all signs and symptoms cleared between 3 and 12 months. Results of these two studies demonstrated substantial evidence of the effectiveness of itraconazole for the treatment of histoplasmosis, compared with the natural history of untreated cases.

### Opportunities to improve guideline adherence for the diagnosis and treatment of onychomycosis: analysis of commercial insurance claims data, United States [^2c54131c]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

We found a lower onychomycosis prevalence (1.6%) than previous European and North American studies (2% to 14%), potentially reflecting underreporting, lack of clinical nail examination and testing, or differences in study design. Compared with other oral antifungals, terbinafine was more commonly prescribed, likely because it is of low cost and generally covered by health insurance without a requirement for laboratory testing. Compared with an urban academic medical center, patients in our study less frequently received confirmatory diagnostic testing (15.3% vs 39.3%), possibly because fewer providers in our study were dermatologists (13.1% vs 62.1%) and practices at an academic institution likely differ from other settings.

Despite the limitations inherent to administrative data, including potential disease misclassification and undercoding, our study provides an update regarding US onychomycosis epidemiology and a concerning assessment of adherence to AAD guidelines for onychomycosis diagnosis and treatment. Confirming the diagnosis of onychomycosis with laboratory testing is important for ensuring appropriate therapy and avoiding unnecessary antifungal exposure. In the era of antifungal-resistant dermatophytosis, a renewed, cross-specialty emphasis on guideline-based onychomycosis treatment is needed, emphasizing antifungal stewardship to preserve available treatment options.

### Long-term follow-up of onychomycosis patients treated with efinaconazole [^71a81608]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis is a common disease that remains difficult to treat despite the introduction of new topical agents. Clinical trials on efinaconazole and tavaborole included 48 weeks' daily treatment regimens with a 4-week follow-up. It has been suggested that either a longer treatment regimen or longer follow-up would lead to even better results, primarily due to the time taken for the diseased nail to grow out, especially in those patients with more severe disease.

Objective

To investigate the impact of a longer follow-up period on the efficacy of efinaconazole 10% topical solution in patients with moderate-to-severe onychomycosis.

Methods

&Single center, open-labeled study in 23 subjects aged 18–80 years with a clinical and mycological diagnosis of moderate-to-severe dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis (40–75% clinical involvement). Subjects were treated with efinaconazole 10% solution, once-daily for 48 weeks, with two 12-week post-treatment follow-ups (at week 60 and 72). Primary efficacy endpoint was complete cure rate (0% clinical involvement of target toenail, and both negative potassium hydroxide examination and fungal culture). Secondary endpoints included mycologic cure rates and treatment success (defined as those patients who had at least a 50% improvement in affected toenail from baseline).

Results

Twenty-two subjects completed the study. Mean baseline age 59.4 years (range, 37–77), predominance of male subjects (73.9%). Median baseline severity 50% affected target toenail. At week 72, two subjects were complete cures and 56.5% of subjects achieved treatment success. There were no complete cures at week 48, but 39.1% achieved treatment success. Mycologic cure rates were 91.3% at week 48. Median percent affected target toenail reduced to 40%, and further to 25% (week 48 and 72, respectively). Treatment was well tolerated, with no adverse events related to medication.

Conclusions

This single-center phase 4 study supports previous data showing good efficacy and tolerability of efinaconazole in moderately severe onychomycosis. Continued reduction in disease severity post-treatment suggest that a longer follow-up of patients treated with efinaconazole would afford better efficacy results, as indicated by greater treatment success, and increase in number of subjects who became complete cures.

### Onychomycosis treatment prescribed at only twenty percent of visits: a cross-sectional analysis of the national ambulatory medical care survey 2007 to 2016 [^7c09640a]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis represents the highest proportion of nail disorders seen in clinical practice. Onychomycosis management may differ amongst specialties, with impact on patient outcomes and quality of life (QoL).

Objective

We aimed to characterize onychomycosis treatment across specialties, accounting for patient demographics, to assess for potential onychomycosis practice gaps.

Materials/Methods

We conducted a population based cross-sectional analysis using the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) 2007 to 2016 (the most recent years available).

Results

Overall, 71.6% of onychomycosis visits were with general practitioners (GPs), 25.8% with dermatologists, and 2.58% with pediatricians. No onychomycosis treatment was prescribed at 82.0% of dermatology visits and 78.9% of GP visits. Dermatologists (Odds Ratio (OR):2.27 [95% Confidence Interval (CI):[2.14–2.41]; P < 0.0001) and GPs (OR:2.32 [2.21–2.44]; P < 0.0001) were more likely than pediatricians to prescribe treatment vs no treatment. Dermatologists were more likely than GPs to prescribe both no treatment vs treatment and topical vs oral antifungals (OR:1.33 [1.16–1.52]; P < 0.0001 and OR:4.20 [3.80–4.65]; P < 0.0001), respectively.

Discussion

Our study showed that there is a low treatment rate for onychomycosis, with treatment prescribed at only 20% of visits. Untreated onychomycosis might result in secondary infection, pain, and negative QoL impact.1 Although dermatologists are specialists in nail disease management, they saw only about 25% of onychomycosis visits. Future efforts should be directed towards promoting onychomycosis therapy, and educating both patients and referring physicians that dermatologists are primary resources for nail disorder treatment.J Drugs Dermatol. 2023;22(10):1040–1045 doi:10.36849/JDD.6770.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: a multicenter, single-arm study [^c64606e0]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Changes in the mycological cure rate increased earlier than the treatment success and complete cure rates, increasing to 38.8% at week 24, 50.7% at week 36 and 55.3% at week 72 after starting EFCZ application. The mycological cure rate at the final assessment was 61.6%. The same trend was observed in the patient populations with clinical involvements of 20–50% and more than 50%, with increases of up to 66.9% and 52.5%, respectively, at the final assessment (Fig. 3 b).

Changes in clinical involvement started to increase to 11.1% ± 13.27% (clinical involvement, 49.1% ± 23.14% at the start of EFCZ application) from week 12 after starting EFCZ application, reaching up to 21.0% ± 18.40% at week 24 and then 31.9% ± 24.32% at week 72. In the subject population with a clinical involvement of 20–50%, the clinical involvement when starting the EFCZ therapy was 33.6% ± 9.98%, and the change in clinical involvement was 21.6% ± 16.90% at week 72. In the subject population with more than 50% affected nail area, the clinical involvement at the start of EFCZ therapy was 75.9% ± 12.27%, showing greater increases in clinical involvement area of 17.1% ± 15.16% at week 12, 32.7% ± 19.08% at week 24 and 49.9% ± 24.88% at week 72 (Fig. 3 c). Table 2 shows the results of subgroup analysis of the complete cure rate, mycological cure rate and changes in clinical involvement.
