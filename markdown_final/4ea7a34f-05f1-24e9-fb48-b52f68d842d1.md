## Question

ASCVD

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about ASCVD prevention and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining ASCVD and its burden. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and why LDL-C is central. Next, I will review risk assessment tools and thresholds. After that, I need to examine primary prevention strategies, including lifestyle, statins, and risk enhancers. Then, I will analyze secondary prevention targets and nonstatin add-on therapy. I should also consider special populations and implementation gaps. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, patient-centered algorithm and highlight controversies and future directions, ensuring each claim is supported by guidelines or high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the definition and burden of ASCVD so I don't gloss over fundamentals. ASCVD encompasses coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral arterial disease of atherosclerotic origin, and it remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally, with substantial economic costs in the United States exceeding $200 billion annually, which underscores the urgency of prevention and risk factor control [^1136KTZK] [^113gkNcY].

> I need to check the pathophysiology next. Atherogenesis is driven by apoB-containing lipoproteins, chiefly LDL-C, with a dose-dependent relationship between LDL-C lowering and ASCVD risk reduction; this is why "lower for longer" is a consistent theme across guidelines, and it explains why intensive LDL-C lowering is prioritized in high-risk patients [^111ykjRF] [^113KaHZB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about risk assessment. I should verify the tools and thresholds. For adults 40–75 years, calculate 10-year ASCVD risk using the Pooled Cohort Equations, then refine decisions with risk enhancers and, when uncertain, coronary artery calcium scoring; for adults 20–39 years, assess lifetime risk and lifestyle factors rather than 10-year risk, and repeat risk assessment every 4–6 years in those without ASCVD [^111Ksvaj] [^1167FpAL] [^11227DTh].

> Let me consider primary prevention lifestyle measures first, because I need to ensure foundational steps are emphasized. Dietary patterns that are lower in saturated fat, higher in fiber, and plant-forward, along with at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, weight management, and smoking cessation, are core to reducing lifetime ASCVD risk and should be reinforced at every visit even if pharmacotherapy is indicated [^112WJ31f] [^1127wjzA] [^113gkNcY].

> Next, I should review statin therapy for primary prevention and confirm thresholds. Statins are first-line when LDL-C is ≥ 190 mg/dL, in adults 40–75 years with diabetes, or when 10-year ASCVD risk is ≥ 7.5% after a clinician–patient risk discussion; for borderline risk (5– < 7.5%), consider statins selectively using risk enhancers or CAC to guide decisions, and aim for a 30–49% LDL-C reduction in intermediate risk and ≥ 50% in high risk [^115mxs3h] [^114Vu9ZA] [^115c4Mvu].

> Wait, let me verify the role of CAC because overuse can misclassify. CAC is most helpful in borderline or intermediate risk when the decision to start a statin is uncertain; CAC = 0 allows deferring statins in the absence of higher-risk conditions and reassessing in 5–10 years, CAC 1–99 favors statins especially if age ≥ 55, and CAC ≥ 100 or ≥ 75th percentile supports statin initiation; this reclassification meaningfully improves the net clinical benefit discussion [^115c4Mvu] [^1177TNkm].

> I should double-check special primary prevention populations. In adults > 75 years without established ASCVD, evidence is limited; if a decision is made to treat, moderate-intensity statins are reasonable, with individualized benefit–risk assessment and consideration of nonstatin options like ezetimibe or bempedoic acid if statins are not tolerated, acknowledging the paucity of outcomes data in this exact group [^116TMavT] [^114BMqX1].

> Now, for secondary prevention, I need to ensure intensity and targets are precise. High-intensity statins are indicated for adults ≤ 75 years with clinical ASCVD to achieve ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction; for those > 75 years, continue or initiate statins based on tolerance and comorbidity, and escalate to nonstatins if LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL in very high-risk ASCVD, with a strong emphasis on sustained LDL-C lowering over time [^115vtFC5] [^113P23XF] [^113KaHZB].

> Let me verify nonstatin add-on therapy sequencing. Ezetimibe is first-line add-on when LDL-C is not at goal on maximally tolerated statin, and PCSK9 inhibitors are reasonable for very high-risk ASCVD with LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL despite statin plus ezetimibe; bempedoic acid is an option for statin-intolerant patients or as an alternative LDL-lowering agent, and inclisiran is an emerging siRNA therapy for persistent elevations, though long-term outcomes data continue to mature [^113P23XF] [^115vtFC5] [^111xMLZH].

> But wait, what about implementation gaps and disparities? I should confirm the magnitude. Despite strong evidence, underuse and undertreatment persist: approximately half of eligible patients with ASCVD are not on statins, and among those treated, many do not reach LDL-C thresholds; racial and ethnic disparities remain substantial, with Black and Hispanic patients less likely to receive guideline-recommended therapies, highlighting the need for system-level interventions and equitable care pathways [^111LRNyB] [^117VZtbT] [^112RhwQi].

> I will now examine a practical, patient-centered algorithm to ensure nothing is missed. Assess risk every 4–6 years starting at age 20, calculate 10-year risk at age 40, reinforce lifestyle at every visit, initiate statins per risk category, add risk enhancers and CAC when decisions are uncertain, escalate to ezetimibe and then PCSK9 inhibitors if LDL-C goals are unmet, and embed shared decision-making, team-based care, and medication reconciliation to improve adherence and outcomes [^111Ksvaj] [^1154Wfh7] [^117RjeMP].

> Hold on, I should verify controversies and future directions so I don't overstate certainty. Debates include the appropriate 10-year risk threshold for statins in primary prevention, the role of CAC in very low-risk patients, and the optimal intensity of therapy in the elderly; emerging areas include RNA-based therapeutics, earlier intervention in the risk continuum, and precision approaches integrating polygenic risk and advanced imaging, all of which may refine risk stratification and timing of therapy [^115keNEX] [^112uARWX] [^116Pfvfc].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is coherent: ASCVD prevention hinges on lifetime risk modification, with LDL-C as the primary causal target; use structured risk assessment, prioritize lifestyle, deploy statins at evidence-based thresholds with shared decision-making, intensify therapy with nonstatins when indicated, and close implementation gaps through equitable, team-based care to realize the full population benefit of guideline-directed therapy [^1138QxsW] [^113KaHZB] [^1154Wfh7].

ASCVD is the leading cause of death globally [^1136KTZK], driven by atherosclerosis and **LDL-C is a causal risk factor** [^111ykjRF]. Prevention relies on **lifestyle first** [^112WJ31f] and **risk-based pharmacotherapy** [^111Ksvaj] to lower LDL-C and reduce events [^111tuzpR]. Statins are first-line [^111k11S8]; add ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors if LDL-C remains above threshold in high-risk patients [^113P23XF] [^115vtFC5]. Risk assessment with the Pooled Cohort Equations [^111Ksvaj] and selective coronary artery calcium scoring guide therapy [^115c4Mvu]. Persistent treatment gaps persist [^111LRNyB], especially in secondary prevention, requiring team-based care and shared decision-making to improve outcomes [^1154Wfh7].

## Definition and clinical significance

ASCVD encompasses coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral arterial disease [^113HgDdc]; it is the **leading global cause of morbidity and mortality** [^1136KTZK], with substantial economic burden [^113gkNcY].

---

## Pathophysiology

Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory process characterized by lipid deposition, endothelial dysfunction, and plaque formation. LDL-C is a **causal driver** [^111ykjRF]; lowering LDL-C reduces events in proportion to the absolute reduction [^111tuzpR].

---

## Risk factors

Risk factors include non-modifiable factors — age, sex, and family history — and modifiable factors — LDL-C, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity [^117AXrh7]. Risk assessment uses the **Pooled Cohort Equations** [^111Ksvaj] and selective coronary artery calcium scoring to guide therapy [^115c4Mvu].

---

## Prevention strategies

### Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle modifications are foundational [^112WJ31f] and include a heart-healthy diet, regular physical activity, weight management, smoking cessation, and alcohol moderation [^113gkNcY].

---

### Pharmacological interventions

- **Statins**: First-line therapy to lower LDL-C and reduce events [^111k11S8].
- **Ezetimibe**: Add-on if LDL-C remains above threshold on statins [^113P23XF].
- **PCSK9 inhibitors**: For very high-risk patients not at LDL-C goal despite maximally tolerated statin/ezetimibe [^113P23XF] [^115vtFC5].
- **Nonstatin options**: Bempedoic acid and inclisiran for statin-intolerant or refractory cases [^111xMLZH].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

| **Guideline** | **Key recommendations** |
|-|-|
| ACC/AHA 2019 | - Emphasize lifestyle [^112WJ31f] <br/> - Risk-based statin therapy [^115mxs3h] <br/> - Shared decision-making [^112twVqH] <br/> - Selective CAC scoring [^115c4Mvu] |
| ESC/EAS 2019 | - Aggressive LDL-C lowering [^112QMZmt] <br/> - Targets: < 55 mg/dL very high risk; < 70 mg/dL high risk <br/> - Combination therapy for high/very high risk [^112QMZmt] |
| AACE 2025 | - Risk stratification [^115irgM5] <br/> - LDL-C targets by risk <br/> - Combination therapy to reach goals [^111g27S2] |

## Treatment gaps and challenges

Despite strong evidence, **underuse and undertreatment persist** [^111LRNyB], especially in secondary prevention [^113LYtcN]. Barriers include clinician inertia, patient adherence, and access/cost [^113tgunW].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Emerging therapies include **RNA-based agents** (e.g. inclisiran) [^111xMLZH], **SGLT2 inhibitors** for high-risk patients with diabetes [^112xRKQX], and **personalized medicine** approaches using genetic and imaging data [^112uARWX].

---

ASCVD prevention requires **integrated lifestyle and risk-based pharmacotherapy** to lower LDL-C and reduce events [^1138QxsW]. Closing treatment gaps and adopting emerging therapies are essential to improve outcomes [^111uQYrr].

## References

### Guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia: how can clinicians effectively implement them? [^113tgunW]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Guidelines support lowering cholesterol to decrease atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk across the entire lifespan with intensive lifestyle intervention, as well as statin and non-statin pharmacotherapy for those at highest risk. Modest improvements in the initiation, use, and adherence to statin therapy in patients with ASCVD have occurred over the past decades. However, studies continue to document a less than desired implementation of guidelines highlighting a substantial and persistent treatment gap. The success of implementation depends on the consideration of a variety of barriers that exist throughout the healthcare delivery system. Further research is needed to comprehensively evaluate these barriers in order to develop appropriate and sustainable interventions to improve guideline implementation.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^112uARWX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite guideline recommendations and evidence supporting the use of lipid‐lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, recent population studies indicate that their current use for preventing ASCVD events is insufficient. Most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL‐C thresholds. Long‐term adherence and persistence with statin therapy are poor, even following a catastrophic event, such as acute myocardial infarction. Consequently, in patients who fall within established benefit groups according to current guidelines, there is a significant need to increase the use of available lipid‐lowering therapies, especially statins, at the recommended intensity.

Current guidelines categorize recommendations for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL‐C by primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD events; however, as demonstrated by tools for imaging coronary atherosclerosis (including coronary artery calcium [CAC] scoring, coronary computed tomographic angiography, intravascular ultrasound, and optical coherence tomography), a continuum of ASCVD and associated risk exists. Patients are at increased risk as both plaque burden and high‐risk plaque features accumulate before their first ASCVD event. Intensive LDL‐C lowering is therefore critical to halt plaque progression, with the potential to induce regression and prevent outcomes, such as myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, or the need for coronary revascularization. This concept is recognized in the 2019 ESC/EAS guideline, which considers unequivocal evidence of ASCVD on imaging as very high risk, the same category as those with documented ASCVD events.

Multiple challenges exist to effective LDL‐C management in patients with, and at risk for, ASCVD (Figure 1). This review presents a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from primary versus secondary prevention to a continuum of risk. Such an approach acknowledges the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment to prevent first cardiovascular events (ie, "high‐risk primary prevention").

### American Heart Association national integrated ASCVD initiative: an implementation initiative to improve lipid management among patients with ASCVD [^111uQYrr]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2025). Medium credibility.

Optimal management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), the leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide, is a key clinical and public health priority. Cholesterol management is central to the primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD, with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering being consistently proven to reduce rates of major adverse cardiovascular events. Clinical guidelines recommend lipid-lowering therapies for individuals at elevated cardiovascular risk, with therapeutic intensification to lower LDL-C targets in those with higher baseline risk, for whom the greatest absolute risk reduction is anticipated. For individuals with very high-risk ASCVD, the American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology Multisociety cholesterol guidelines recommend high-intensity statin therapy to lower LDL-C by ≥ 50%, with the addition of nonstatin lipid-lowering agents if LDL-C remains at a threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL. Despite extensive clinical trial evidence and strong guideline recommendations, many eligible individuals remain untreated or undertreated with statins and other lipid-lowering therapies. This indicates a need for an enhanced focus on implementation science to ensure that individuals at very high ASCVD risk receive appropriate lipid management.

### Assessment of cardiovascular disease risk: a 2022 Update [^113GFLpP]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Assessment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk is the cornerstone of primary ASCVD prevention, enabling targeted use of the most aggressive therapies in those most likely to benefit, while guiding a conservative approach in those who are low risk. ASCVD risk assessment begins with the use of a traditional 10-year risk calculator, with further refinement through the consideration of risk-enhancing factors (particularly lipoprotein(a)) and subclinical atherosclerosis testing (particularly coronary artery calcium (CAC) testing). In this review, we summarize the current field of ASCVD risk assessment in primary prevention and highlight new guidelines from the Endocrine Society.

### 2013 ACC / AHA cholesterol treatment guideline: paradigm shifts in managing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk [^1178PAur]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults represents a major shift from prior cholesterol management guidelines. The new guidelines include data from individual randomized trials as well as the most comprehensive meta-analyses, and introduce several major paradigm shifts, which include: aiming for ASCVD risk reduction as opposed to targeting LDL-C levels, advocating for the use of evidence-based doses of statins as first line therapy, and utilizing a new risk calculator and risk cut point to guide initiation of statin therapy. These major changes have created controversy and confusion among the medical community, with some clinicians hesitant to embrace the shift. We review the evidence that forms the basis for these major changes, compare them to other major lipid guidelines, and recommend an integrated approach to managing dyslipidemia to decrease atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^111k11S8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is central to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and key to reducing the risk of ASCVD events. Current guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol recommend statins as first-line therapy for LDL-C reduction according to an individual's ASCVD risk and baseline LDL-C levels. The addition of nonstatin lipid-lowering therapy to statins to achieve intensive LDL-C lowering is recommended for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events, including patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who have not achieved adequate LDL-C lowering with statins alone. Despite guideline recommendations and clinical trial evidence to support the use of lipid-lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL-C thresholds. This review explores the challenges associated with LDL-C lowering in contemporary clinical practice and proposes a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from "primary" versus "secondary" prevention to a "continuum of risk". The approach considers the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment for preventing first cardiovascular events. Patients at high risk of ASCVD events who require significant LDL-C lowering should be considered for combination therapies comprising statin and nonstatin agents. Practical guidance for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL-C, both now and in the future, is provided.

ABSTRACT

Management of elevated low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) is central to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and key to reducing the risk of ASCVD events. Current guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol recommend statins as first‐line therapy for LDL‐C reduction according to an individual's ASCVD risk and baseline LDL‐C levels. The addition of nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapy to statins to achieve intensive LDL‐C lowering is recommended for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events, including patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who have not achieved adequate LDL‐C lowering with statins alone. Despite guideline recommendations and clinical trial evidence to support the use of lipid‐lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL‐C thresholds. This review explores the challenges associated with LDL‐C lowering in contemporary clinical practice and proposes a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from "primary" versus "secondary" prevention to a "continuum of risk". The approach considers the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment for preventing first cardiovascular events. Patients at high risk of ASCVD events who require significant LDL‐C lowering should be considered for combination therapies comprising statin and nonstatin agents. Practical guidance for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL‐C, both now and in the future, is provided.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^1154Wfh7]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

2019 ACC/AHA patient-centered approaches to comprehensive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) prevention specify the following Class of Recommendation (COR) I directives with corresponding Levels of Evidence (LOE): COR I, LOE A — A team-based care approach is recommended for the control of risk factors associated with ASCVD; COR I, LOE B-R — Shared decision-making should guide discussions about the best strategies to reduce ASCVD risk; COR I, LOE B-NR — Social determinants of health should inform optimal implementation of treatment recommendations for the prevention of ASCVD.

### Primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: controversies and clinical considerations [^111tGkFj]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

A new guideline for the treatment of blood cholesterol was recently released by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA), serving as an update to the National Cholesterol Education Program's (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III cholesterol guideline first released in 2001. With significant changes to key definitions, treatment strategy, and therapy selection, the guideline has transformed the treatment of blood cholesterol and also created controversy within the health care community. This controversy is largely focused on appropriate identification and treatment of patients for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Whereas statins play an integral role in the treatment and secondary prevention of ASCVD, their use for primary prevention is less clearly defined. It is imperative that health care providers are well versed in the concepts and controversies of the new guideline recommendations for primary prevention of ASCVD and can effectively assess the risks and benefits of statin therapy in this patient population.

### Intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in cardiovascular disease prevention: opportunities and challenges [^112S8QXr]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, preventing ASCVD requires a coordinated response across primary and secondary care to diagnose and manage patients according to their risk profile. As the major modifiable causal factor for atherosclerosis, lowering LDL-C is the primary target and appropriate modification of dietary and lifestyle risk factors is the starting point. The updated 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines recommend a move towards intensive lowering of LDL-C, which is warranted on scientific grounds and achievable in clinical practice. Implementation strategies are needed to apply current knowledge, guidelines and clinical judgement to the benefit of those at highest risk.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk assessment — adults who are 40 to 75 years of age and are being evaluated for cardiovascular disease prevention should undergo 10-year ASCVD risk estimation and have a clinician-patient risk discussion before starting pharmacological therapy; assessing for other risk-enhancing factors can help guide decisions, as can coronary artery calcium scanning.

### Primary atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease prevention: optimally active, agile, and accountable [^111tuzpR]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) affects 24 million adults (1 in every 10) in the United States. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a main causal risk factor for ASCVD, such that there is an estimated 22% relative risk reduction of ASCVD events for every 39 mg/dL LDL-C lowering with statin therapy. Statins remain the foundation of ASCVD prevention and likely confer pleiotropic effects beyond lipid-lowering. Nonetheless, challenges remain with respect to the optimal implementation of guideline-directed approaches to statin initiation.

The 2018 Guideline on the Management of Blood Cholesterol provides a Class I recommendation for the initiation of statin therapy for primary prevention in adults aged 40 to 75 years with type 2 diabetes or LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL as well as those with an intermediate risk (7.5–20%), or high risk (≥ 20%) based on the Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) risk calculator. Among select adults with a borderline risk (5–7.5%) or all adults with an intermediate risk (7.5%-20%), there is a Class IIa recommendation to measure coronary artery calcium (CAC) to facilitate clinician-patient risk discussions regarding consideration of statin therapy for primary prevention. Measurement of CAC has been shown to help reclassify risk and better identify those most likely to derive net clinical benefit from statin therapy, as the 10-year number needed to treat to prevent 1 ASCVD event is more than 2-fold lower for statin-eligible candidates with incident CAC vs long-term absence of CAC.

### Review of clinical practice guidelines for the management of LDL-related risk [^113MJKs8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Managing risk related to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is vital in therapy for patients at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events given its important etiologic role in atherogenesis. Despite decades of research showing reduction of ASCVD risk with multiple approaches to lowering of LDL cholesterol, there continue to be significant gaps in care with inadequate numbers of patients receiving standard of care lipid-lowering therapy. Confusion regarding implementation of the multiple published clinical practice guidelines has been identified as one contributor to suboptimal management of LDL-related risk. This review summarizes the current guidelines for reduction of LDL-related cardiovascular risk provided by a number of major professional societies, which have broad applicability to diverse populations worldwide. Statements have varied in the process and methodology of development of recommendations, the grading system for level and strength of evidence, the inclusion or exclusion of expert opinion, the suggested ASCVD risk assessment tool, the lipoproteins recommended for risk assessment, and the lipoprotein targets of therapy. The similarities and differences among important guidelines in the United States and internationally are discussed, with recommendations for future strategies to improve consistency in approaches to LDL-related ASCVD risk and to reduce gaps in implementation of evidence-based therapies.

### The 2013 ACC / AHA guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk: a new paradigm supported by more evidence [^113BK1pT]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol guideline was a major paradigm shift and heavily criticized by some experts. A better understanding of the methodology used to develop the guideline, the guideline recommendations, and the evidence supporting them addresses many of criticisms.

Methods and Results

An extensive body of evidence from randomized clinical trials supports the new risk-based approach. The emphasis is on the appropriate intensity of statin therapy in patients most likely to benefit. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines have taken a similar approach. Recent studies have found the 2013 guideline outperforms earlier cholesterol guidelines recommending low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) treatment thresholds and targets. The 2013 cholesterol guideline better identifies high-risk patients with a greater burden of atherosclerosis and avoids treating those at lower risk with little atherosclerosis; its application would prevent up to 450 000 more atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events over 10 years. The 2013 cholesterol guideline also recommends regularly monitoring LDL-C levels to assess adherence to lifestyle and drug therapy, and adjusting treatment based on response to therapy and adverse events. Non-statins shown to reduce ASCVD events when added to statin therapy, and that have an acceptable margin of safety in randomized, controlled clinical trials, are preferred. Ezetimibe has now been shown to meet this standard.

Conclusions

The concept of net benefit introduced in the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guideline identifies patients most likely to benefit from statin therapy to reduce ASCVD risk. Net benefit, incorporating the absolute ASCVD risk of a patient and the relative reduction in ASCVD risk based on the magnitude of LDL-C reduction from the addition of a non-statin, can be used when considering whether to add ezetimibe or another LDL-C lowering drug.

### Clinician's guide to the updated ABCs of cardiovascular disease prevention [^116d1oTq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite significant progress, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), which is composed of coronary heart disease (CHD), cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke, remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the Western world. In 2010, it was estimated that ≈1 in every 6 deaths was from CHD. In 2012, CHD was estimated to result in > 17.3 million deaths annually worldwide. With attempts to prevent or reduce the onset of modifiable risk factors, the burden of ASCVD can be reduced, making it an attractive target for preventive measures. In the INTERHEART (A Study Of Risk Factors For First Myocardial Infarction In 52 Countries And Over 27 000 Subjects) study, for example, 9 modifiable risk factors — smoking, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, abdominal obesity, stress, poor diet, physical inactivity, and excess alcohol consumption — were responsible for > 90% of the risk for a first MI. Furthermore, because CV risk accrues slowly over time, every person can benefit from preventive interventions, whether primordial, primary, or secondary.

Prevention has played a pivotal role in the reduction in ASCVD morbidity and mortality seen over the last 3 decades. Nearly half (44%) of the decline in CHD deaths from 1980 to 2000 resulted from population‐wide risk‐factor reduction, with another half resulting from medical therapies targeting specific risk factors in patients with known or suspected atherosclerosis (47%). – In contrast, only 5% of the reduction in CHD deaths was due to coronary revascularization for chronic stable angina.

In a busy clinical practice, incorporating the recommendations from lengthy guideline documents into every visit can be challenging and difficult to remember. We offer this simplified guide to assist clinician compliance with guideline‐based care and to promote participation in the multiple preventive initiatives that exist, including the AHA 2020 goal, the Million Hearts Initiative, and the "25×25" target, each of which is aimed at preventing MIs and strokes and promoting CV health over the next decade and beyond. We present our recommendations in a simple, easy‐to‐remember "ABCDEF" format (Table 1) that integrates the most recent CV guideline recommendations. –

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^115eiqFA]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk assessment — scope and general use: ASCVD risk assessment includes lipoprotein lipid levels, evaluation of other major risk factors, clinical evidence of ASCVD, and conditions associated with high or very high risk (including LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL and chronic kidney disease [CKD] stage 3B or higher). Quantitative risk scoring is generally not recommended for high-risk and very high–risk groups unless a validated equation for that subset is used. ASCVD risk category is used to define treatment goals for atherogenic cholesterol and when pharmacotherapy might be considered, and lifestyle therapy should be emphasized and monitored in all patients with elevated atherogenic cholesterol whether or not pharmacotherapy is used.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) burden and implications — ASCVD remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally and is the leading cause of death for most racial/ethnic groups in the United States, with a high economic burden; prior myocardial infarction patients often had unfavorable cardiovascular risk factors beforehand, and better cardiovascular health factors are associated with lower adverse outcomes. In the United States, the estimated annual cost is > $200 billion, and increasing numbers of ideal cardiovascular health factors have been associated with lower prevalence and incidence of ASCVD events and other conditions.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and multimorbidity — general clinical assumptions: This ECDP applies to the patient with ASCVD and multimorbidity and is primarily focused on outpatient management; the writing committee endorses ACC/AHA evidence-based approaches but recognizes that stacking disease-specific Clinical Practice Guidelines may lead to unintended consequences and that following all possible recommendations may not be practical. CV clinicians should consider the whole patient and the patient's life expectancy and other patient-specific domains when making treatment decisions, and clinicians should regularly review and reconcile conditions and treatments to prioritize high-value interventions aligned with the patient's goals, priorities, and preferences. Expected benefits, potential harms, and burdens should be considered, priority should often be given to treatments that address multiple conditions, and optimal patient care should reflect the patient's goals and the clinician's medical knowledge. Deprescribing one or more medications or therapies may be the best option for some patients; this ECDP is not intended to supersede good clinical judgment and the treating clinician should seek input as needed. Team-based care should be used to address various treatment domains to attain the best possible outcomes, health systems and clinicians should leverage electronic health records (EHRs) to facilitate care coordination among clinicians while promoting patient engagement, and healthcare organizations should advocate for legislative efforts to reward holistic, patient-centered care. This ECDP is based on currently available data and information, and clinicians should incorporate pertinent information published after this ECDP.

### Primary prevention with statins in the Elderly [^112EBHgP]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

The burden of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in high-income countries is mostly borne by the elderly. With increasing life expectancy, clear guidance on sensible use of statin therapy to prevent a first and potentially devastating ASCVD event is critically important to ensure a healthy aging population. Since 2013, 5 major North American and European guidelines on statin use in primary prevention of ASCVD have been released by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and the European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society. Guidance on using statin therapy in primary ASCVD prevention in the growing elderly population (> 65 years of age) differs markedly. The authors discuss the discrepant recommendations, place them into the context of available evidence, and identify circumstances in which uncertainty may hamper the appropriate use of statins in the elderly.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Assessment of cardiovascular risk — recommendations for adults. For adults 40 to 75 years of age, clinicians should routinely assess traditional cardiovascular risk factors and calculate 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) by using the pooled cohort equations (PCE). For adults 20 to 39 years of age, it is reasonable to assess traditional ASCVD risk factors at least every 4 to 6 years. In adults at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) or intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), it is reasonable to use additional risk-enhancing factors to guide decisions about preventive interventions (e.g., statin therapy). In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) or selected adults at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk), if risk-based decisions for preventive interventions remain uncertain, it is reasonable to measure a coronary artery calcium score to guide clinician–patient risk discussion. For adults 20 to 39 years of age and for those 40 to 59 years of age who have < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk, estimating lifetime or 30-year ASCVD risk may be considered.

Primary prevention risk assessment — Adults who are 40 to 75 years of age being evaluated for cardiovascular disease prevention should undergo 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk estimation and have a clinician–patient risk discussion before starting on pharmacological therapy; the presence or absence of additional risk-enhancing factors and coronary artery calcium scanning can help guide decisions. A team-based care approach is an effective strategy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, and clinicians should evaluate the social determinants of health that affect individuals to inform treatment decisions.

### 2013 ACC / AHA guideline recommends fixed-dose strategies instead of targeted goals to lower blood cholesterol [^113wVuy7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Task Force on Practice Guidelines recently issued the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults. This new guideline endorses a paradigm shift in strategies for reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events by lowering blood cholesterol. Whereas previous guidelines focused on therapy to decrease low-density lipoprotein and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to specific target levels, the new guideline instead proposes implementation of cholesterol-lowering treatment using evidenced-based intensity of statin therapy without such targets. The guideline also provides a new risk estimator for primary prevention decisions, including stroke outcomes and data on African Americans, which will significantly increase the number of patients recommended for outcome-related benefits of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The first section of this paper reviews the process by which the task force developed the new evidence-based guideline, the major findings and recommendations, and their implications. The second section primarily focuses on the question of how much low-density lipoprotein cholesterol should be lowered and on additional considerations in risk assessment.

ACC/AHA primary prevention scope — adults and targeted outcomes: The guideline addresses the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in adults (≥ 18 years of age) and focuses on outcomes of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) including acute coronary syndromes, myocardial infarction (MI), stable or unstable angina, arterial revascularization, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or peripheral arterial disease of atherosclerotic origin, and also includes heart failure and atrial fibrillation. It is intended to be a resource for the clinical and public health practice communities and presents recommendations related to lifestyle factors, other factors affecting CVD risk (eg, obesity, diabetes, blood cholesterol, high BP, smoking, aspirin use), patient-centered approaches, and considerations of the cost and value of primary prevention.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) — ASCVD remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally, and in the United States it is the leading cause of death with an estimated cost of > $200 billion annually in healthcare services, medications, and lost productivity. Most Americans who have had a myocardial infarction had unfavorable levels of at least 1 cardiovascular risk factor before their ASCVD event. The AHA's model of ideal cardiovascular health, referred to as Life's Simple 7, is presented, and an increasing number of ideal cardiovascular health factors have been associated with a lower prevalence and incidence of ASCVD events and other conditions; moving individuals toward ideal cardiovascular health is critically important for prevention of many important health conditions. The guideline consolidates existing recommendations and includes newly generated recommendations for aspirin use, exercise and physical activity, and tobacco use, along with recommendations related to team-based care, shared decision-making, and assessment of social determinants of health. Prevention strategies must include a strong focus on lifestyle optimization (improvements in diet, physical activity, and avoidance of tobacco use and exposure to secondhand smoke) to minimize the risk of future ASCVD events, and a comprehensive patient-centered approach that addresses all aspects of a patient's lifestyle habits and estimated risk of a future ASCVD event is the first step in deciding on where there may be a need for pharmacotherapy; even if a blood pressure (BP)–reducing medication, lipid-lowering medication, or diabetes medication is ultimately prescribed, lifestyle goals should be emphasized on a regular basis.

### Starting primary prevention earlier with statins [^113mhgJf]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was based on a systematic review of randomized trials with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) outcomes and meta-analyses of these trials published through 2011. With evidence of an ASCVD risk reduction benefit greatly outweighing the potential for adverse effects, the guideline recommends statin therapy for primary prevention in those with ≥ 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk and consideration of statin therapy in those with 5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk. Subsequent meta-analyses of the statin trials support these recommendations and have additionally found a reduction in total mortality in lower-risk subjects. Additional evidence from imaging trials and epidemiologic studies suggests that initiation of statin therapy earlier in the course of ASCVD could have the potential to more effectively prevent age-related progression of atherosclerosis. Given the high levels of suboptimal risk factors in adults and the safety and availability of low-cost generic statins, a consideration of all the available evidence strongly supports earlier intervention for the primary prevention of ASCVD. In conclusion, earlier initiation of statin therapy has the potential to have a large long-term impact on the heavy burden of cardiovascular disease in the aging populations.

### Managing hypercholesterolemia in adults older than 75 years without a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: an expert clinical consensus from the National Lipid Association and the American Geriatrics Society [^114BMqX1]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

QUESTION 8
For the population of adults older than 75 years without established ASCVD, when should non‐statin therapies be considered for ASCVD risk reduction?

Synopsis

Due to a lack of randomized controlled trials, non‐statin therapy for adults older than 75 years without prevalent ASCVD was not addressed in recent US or ESC guidelines of cholesterol management. Ezetimibe as monotherapy has been evaluated since in a single randomized controlled open label trial, EWTOPIA 75 (Ezetimibe Lipid‐Lowering Trial on Prevention of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in 75 or Older) which showed a 2.6% absolute and 34% relative reduction in risk of MACE in the ezetimibe group. The combination of statin and ezetimibe has not been evaluated in outcomes trials among adults older than 75 years without ASCVD. Among adults older than 75 years in whom a decision is made to use LDL‐C lowering therapy for the primary prevention of ASCVD, statins are preferred given the available evidence, but ezetimibe therapy may be considered as an alternative if statin therapy is not tolerated, deemed inadvisable, or based on patient preference.

Limited data on bempedoic acid among statin‐intolerant high‐risk primary prevention patients are available from a subgroup analysis of the CLEAR Trial (Bempedoic Acid and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Statin‐Intolerant Patients). Bempedoic acid reduced the primary endpoint of major adverse cardiovascular events by 30% (absolute risk reduction 2.3% (5.3% vs. 7.6%)). The mean age among primary prevention patients was 68 years. In the overall trial, 15% of participants were aged 75 years or older, but data specific to this subgroup were not provided. There was no interaction of treatment by age. Thus, among statin intolerant individuals older than 75 years in whom a decision is made to lower LDL‐C to reduce ASCVD risk, bempedoic acid may be considered.

Secondary prevention trials with both evolocumab and alirocumab suggest similar benefits and safety of PCSK9 inhibition in older (≥ 65 years of age) and younger individuals. To date, there are no large randomized controlled outcomes trials using PCSK9 inhibition for primary prevention of ASCVD. Current data are not sufficient to make a recommendation for the treatment of adults aged 75 or older without ASCVD.

Figure 3 summarizes some key steps in managing hypercholesterolemia among this population.

### Prevention of cardiovascular disease: highlights for the clinician of the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association guidelines [^113e2uhq]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Prevention of cardiovascular disease, undoubtedly an emphasis of clinical care in 2014, will provide both opportunities and challenges to patients and their healthcare providers. The recently-released ACC/AHA guidelines on assessment of cardiovascular risk, lifestyle management to reduce cardiovascular risk, management of overweight and obesity, and treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk, have introduced new concepts and revised prior conventional strategies. New to risk assessment are the Pooled Cohort Equations, targeting the expanded concept of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and focusing not solely on mortality but as well on major nonfatal events. The lifestyle management focuses on diet and physical activity for lipid and blood pressure control. The cholesterol guideline identifies four high-risk groups with the greatest benefits from statin therapy: preexisting ASCVD, primary LDL-C elevations ≥ 190 mm/dl, those 45–75 years with diabetes and LDL-C 70–189 mm/dl without clinical ASCVD, and those 40–75 years without clinical ASCVD with an LDL-C 70–189 mg/dl with a 7.5% or greater 10-year ASCVD risk. Eliminated are arbitrary LDL-C treatment targets, with individual patient risk status guiding who should take statins and the appropriate intensity of statin drugs. Patient-physician discussions of individual benefits and risks are paramount. Management of high blood pressure remains controversial, with two different expert panels offering varying treatment targets; there is general agreement on a < 140/90 mmHg goal, but substantial disagreement on blood pressure targets for older adults. Clinicians and their patients deserve a well-researched concensus document.

### Personalizing treatment: between primary and secondary prevention [^116MmVat]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for the management of patients with elevated blood cholesterol increasingly emphasize assessment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk in deciding when to initiate pharmacotherapy. The decision to treat is based primarily on mathematical integration of traditional risk factors, including age, sex, race, lipid values, systolic blood pressure, hypertension therapy, diabetes mellitus, and smoking. Advanced risk testing is selectively endorsed for patients when the decision to treat is otherwise uncertain, or more broadly interpreted as those patients who are at so-called "intermediate risk" of ASCVD events using traditional risk factors alone. These new guidelines also place new emphasis on a clinician-patient risk discussion, a process of shared decision making in which patient and physician consider the potential benefits of treatment, risk of adverse events, and patient preferences before making a final decision to initiate treatment. Advanced risk testing is likely to play an increasingly important role in this process as weaknesses in exclusive reliance on traditional risk factors are recognized, new non-statin therapies become available, and guidelines are iteratively updated. Comparative efficacy studies of the various advanced risk testing options suggest that coronary artery calcium scoring is most strongly predictive of ASCVD events. Most importantly, coronary artery calcium scoring appears to identify an important subgroup of patients with advanced subclinical atherosclerosis-who are "between" primary and secondary prevention-that might benefit from the most aggressive lipid-lowering pharmacotherapy.

### LDL cholesterol management simplified in adults-lower for longer is better: guidance from the National Lipid Association [^113KaHZB]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

ASCVD remains the #1 cause of death in the United States and has been on the rise for more than a decade after more than 40 years of steady decline. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a well-established causal factor for the development of ASCVD that should be monitored in a timely manner and may be modified through both lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. Despite the existence of cholesterol guidelines, universal screening ages, risk assessment tools, and recommendations for LDL-C management based on risk, data show that LDL-C measurement and management in patients with ASCVD are not meeting guideline-directed objectives. Further, there is no single clinical guideline that presents LDL-C measurement frequency, risk assessment, management, and desirable LDL-C levels for adults based on risk.

Objective

This document aims to summarize the numerous guidelines and recommendations from leading professional organizations to help clinicians and patients improve evidence-based measurement and management of LDL-C.

Methods

Guidelines and updates from the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, National Lipid Association, and other relevant professional organizations were systematically reviewed. Key recommendations were synthesized and translated into a simplified, patient-centered message for clinical application.

Results

The synthesis revealed consistent recommendations across major guidelines emphasizing early identification of risk, aggressive lipid lowering in high-risk populations, and the use of shared decision-making to improve adherence. The resulting simplified message aligns with current evidence and is intended to support clinical teams in delivering consistent, guideline-directed care.

Conclusion

Integrating major cardiovascular and lipid management guidelines into a unified, simplified message may improve provider clarity and patient understanding. This approach supports team-based care, reduces variation in practice, and enhances the implementation of evidence-based strategies to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. The primary goals for LDL-C management are to achieve an acceptable level for the patient's risk category and to maintain that over time because lower for longer is better to reduce ASCVD risk.

ACC/AHA primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) — Prevention emphasizes lifestyle first, with medications considered only when risk is sufficiently high within shared decision-making. The most important way to prevent ASCVD is stated as promoting a healthy lifestyle throughout life, and prevention strategies must include a strong focus on lifestyle optimization to minimize future ASCVD events. Only when a person's risk is sufficiently high should medications to reduce ASCVD risk be considered as part of a shared decision-making process, and even if BP-, lipid-lowering, or diabetes medication is ultimately prescribed, lifestyle goals should be emphasized on a regular basis.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — intermediate and high risk targets: In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), if a decision is made for statin therapy, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended, and in intermediate risk patients, LDL-C levels should be reduced by 30% or more; for patients at high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), levels should be reduced by 50% or more.

### Is there a role for coronary calcium in patients with diabetes? [^111UP6yr]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

In the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), a significant portion of high-risk patients have diabetes. Two decades ago, patients with or without cardiovascular disease were identified as having coronary heart disease (CHD) risk equivalents because prospective studies showed that they were at risk for future CHD events equivalent to that of patients with established CHD. Thus, for patients with CHD, cholesterol guidelines recommended that patients with diabetes should be treated routinely with statins. However, recently, the treatment of diabetes has been greatly improved, and the risk for ASCVD has decreased. For this reason, it may be appropriate to re-evaluate the recommendations for routine use of statins in patients with diabetes. One of the major advances in the risk assessment for ASCVD is the introduction of coronary artery calcium measurement. This report will examine the role of coronary artery calcium scanning for the decision to initiate statin therapy in the primary prevention for patients with diabetes.

Lipid management for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in people with diabetes — age‑stratified recommendations specify: in people 20–39 years of age, consider statin therapy if there are additional ASCVD risk factors. In people 40–75 years of age, use moderate-intensity statin therapy in those without ASCVD risk factors, and use a high-intensity statin in those with ≥ 1 ASCVD risk factor, with an LDL cholesterol goal of < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L); it may be reasonable to add ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitor to maximum tolerated statin therapy if LDL goal is not achieved, and use bempedoic acid for those who are statin intolerant. In people > 75 years of age, continue current statin therapy or consider initiating a moderate-intensity statin after weighing benefits and risks.

### ACC / AHA release updated guideline on the treatment of… [^117PWpLb]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Based on these data, the Blood Cholesterol Expert Panel from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association issued an updated evidence-based guideline in 2013 that addresses the use of fixed doses of cholesterol-lowering drugs to reduce the risk of ASCVD in adults 21 years and older. What Is New in the Guideline. FOUR STATIN BENEFIT GROUPS This updated guideline focuses on reducing the risk of ASCVD in four statin benefit groups: persons with clinical ASCVD.

The net ASCVD risk-reduction benefit is approximately the number of potential ASCVD events prevented with statin therapy vs. the number of potential excess adverse effects. ASCVD before 55 years of age in a first-degree male relative or before 65 years of age in a first-degree female relative; high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level of 2 mg per L or greater; coronary artery calcium score of 300 Agatston units or greater, or being in the 75th percentile or greater for age, sex, and ethnicity; ankle-brachial index less than 0. 9; or elevated lifetime risk of ASCVD. The Pooled Cohort Equations should be used to estimate the 10-year ASCVD risk in persons without clinical ASCVD to guide initiation of statin therapy. In persons 40 to 75 years of age without clinical ASCVD or diabetes and with an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk of 7. 5% or greater, moderate- to high-intensity statin therapy should be used. If the 10-year risk of ASCVD is 5% to less than 7.

5%, treatment with a moderate-intensity statin is reasonable. Before initiating statin therapy, it is reasonable for clinicians and patients to engage in a discussion about the potential for ASCVD risk-reduction benefits, adverse events, drug-drug interactions, and patient preferences.

### The 2018 AHA / ACC / multi-society cholesterol guidelines: looking at past, present and future [^111tz2gY]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

The authors review more than three decades of progress in providing clinicians and patients with guidance on risk assessment, patient evaluation and cholesterol management. Beginning with the National Cholesterol Education Program's Initial Adult Treatment Panel report, the cholesterol guidelines increasingly reflect the progress made in understanding the benefits of improved lifestyle and nutrition to improve lipid profiles, major risk factors and reduce ASCVD risk. Moreover, they now provide qualitative and quantitative assessment tools to guide appropriate risk reduction LDL-C lowering therapy. Use of the Pooled Cohort Equations to determine Low, Borderline, Intermediate and High 10-year ASCVD risk is now joined by recognition of conditions and biomarkers that enhance ASCVD risk. This personalizes the risk discussion for the patient. An important addition is the selective use of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring to reclassify risk in patients at borderline or intermediate risk, but for whom a risk decision regarding statin therapy is uncertain. In secondary prevention, current guidelines provide criteria for determining a "very high" risk group in whom risk is especially high and in whom aggressive LDL-C lowering can be shown to provide increased absolute benefit. Current guidelines provide a comprehensive look at children and adolescents, young adults, elderly, women and issues specific to women through the life course. They provide guidance for those adults at risk due to severe hypercholesterolemia, persistent hypertriglyceridemia after secondary causes have been addressed, those with inflammatory disorders and HIV, those adults with chronic kidney disease, and those affected by issues of race/ethnicity. They conclude with a brief summary of recommendations emphasizing important concepts for providing safety with LDL-C lowering therapy. This combination of best external evidence and clinical expertise from the expert panel should provide a solid foundation for lipid management of patients at risk for or with clinical ASCVD.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^111xMLZH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

The 2022 ACC ECDP on the role of nonstatin therapies in ASCVD risk reduction includes a discussion of the newer agents (bempedoic acid, evinacumab, and inclisiran) approved for LDL‐C lowering since the publication of the latest guidelines. In patients with clinical ASCVD at very high risk, the addition of nonstatin therapy is recommended if LDL‐C levels remain ≥ 55 mg/dL, in view of the favorable net clinical benefit. In patients with clinical ASCVD who are not at very high risk, a ≥ 50% reduction in LDL‐C from baseline and a threshold of LDL‐C < 70 mg/dL is considered a desirable response to lipid‐lowering therapy.

Estimating the Risk of RecurrentEvents

Patients with established ASCVD are at very high risk for future events; however, this population has substantial variation in the degree of risk. The Secondary Manifestations of ARTerial disease risk score was developed to predict the 10‐year risk of recurrent vascular events, identifying patients who are most likely to benefit from treatment intensification and facilitating a personalized approach to secondary prevention. Originally developed from the Utrecht Cardiovascular–Secondary Manifestations of ARTerial disease cohort, the tool has recently been updated with regional incidence rates, broadening its applicability across European and non‐European populations.

### Impact of statins on mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in dialysis patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111UoxbP]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Statins are a cornerstone in reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). However, current clinical guidelines don't recommend statin use in patients undergoing maintenance dialysis due to inconclusive evidence. We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the clinical effectiveness of statins in patients with established ASCVD and undergoing dialysis. We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception until April 20, 2025. We used Review Manager (RevMan 5.4 for Windows) to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and odds ratios (ORs), along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Seven observational studies comprising 116,535 patients met our inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. Statin therapy was associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality (HR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.89–0.98, P = 0.004) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (HR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.80–0.98, P = 0.02). However, no significant associations were observed for cardiovascular mortality (HR = 0.92, 95% CI: [0.69, 1.24], P = 0.60), myocardial infarction (OR = 1.23, 95% CI: [0.99, 1.53], P = 0.06), or stroke (HR = 0.99, 95% CI: [0.79, 1.24], P = 0.92). In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that statin therapy can reduce all-cause mortality and MACE in dialysis-dependent patients with ASCVD. However, it does not significantly impact cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Given the observational nature of the included studies, high-quality prospective trials are warranted to reassess current guidelines and refine treatment recommendations.

ASCVD risk-reduction therapy — absolute risk–aligned intensity and lifestyle versus drug therapy: The intensity of risk-reduction therapy should generally be adjusted to the patient's absolute risk for an ASCVD event. Lifestyle therapy is considered to be first-line intervention, with LDL-C (and non–HDL-C) reductions with lifestyle changes most often in the range of 5% to 15%, but in individuals at moderate to higher risk for ASCVD, a larger magnitude of atherogenic cholesterol lowering than can be achieved with lifestyle changes alone is generally warranted; decisions regarding adding atherogenic cholesterol– lowering drug therapy should include an investigation of the patient's absolute risk for ASCVD, including long-term risk.

### Curing atherosclerosis should be the next major cardiovascular prevention goal [^116Pfvfc]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of death in developed and developing countries. Despite decades of effort, unhealthy lifestyle habits and ASCVD risk factor levels remain high and are increasing in many population groups. A new approach to ASCVD prevention is needed. Multiple lines of evidence from animal and human studies suggest that atherosclerosis regression and normalization of vessel function can occur when low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering occurs early in the course of atherosclerosis or when very aggressive LDL-C lowering occurs somewhat later. We propose a new paradigm focused on curing atherosclerosis early in the course of the disease. An approach that resets the vascular aging clock composed of initial regression therapy followed by periodic retreatment to suppress atherosclerosis development may be possible, with the ultimate goal of preventing subsequent ASCVD events. Proof-of-concept studies are needed to determine: 1) the optimal age and/or extent of atherosclerosis for intervention and LDL-C-lowering therapy; 2) the intensity and duration of therapy for inducing atherosclerosis regression; and 3) documenting the normalization of vascular function. Ultimately, this new paradigm will need to be evaluated in ASCVD outcomes trials.

### Preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease using American college of cardiology and American Heart Association prevention guidelines: some good news, but caveats remain [^1178A2Zg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

To put this in perspective, the following caveats are noted. It is important to emphasize that the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guidelines did not mandate that all lower risk primary prevention patients with ≥ 7.5% ASCVD 10‐year risk receive a statin. The threshold of ≥ 7.5% was intended to start the risk discussion and was useful in epidemiological studies for determining the potential value of statin treatment in such patients. Pencina and colleagues indicated that, based on the guidelines determination of 10‐year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5%, the guidelines could be projected to save 450 000 lives. 9 They also correctly noted, however, that the guidelines did not equate an ASCVD risk of ≥ 7.5% with automatic statin assignment; the guidelines recommended a clinician–patient risk discussion (CPRD) first.

The recommendation of a CPRD before statin prescription in lower risk primary care is crucial because it helps address the potential for inaccuracy of global risk estimation. The guidelines are based on data from 3 solely primary prevention RCTs to support treating at a 10‐year ASCVD risk of ≥ 7.5%. There was benefit down to 5%, but the guidelines panel chose the higher cutoff so that patients who had a lower risk due to ASCVD risk overestimation would still be in a statin‐benefit risk group. Consequently, the guidelines advise that statin treatment should be individualized within the context of a risk discussion enabling joint decision making. The CPRD was described in the table of recommendations as well as in the explanatory text and accompanying figures. This description addresses control of other ASCVD risk factors and the need for optimal lifestyle, the potential for benefit of statin therapy versus the potential for adverse effects and drug–drug interactions, and the inclusion of informed patient preference in final decision making. Further papers described techniques for making the CPRD truly effective. 10, 11

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Adults with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) on statin therapy for secondary prevention — initiation and intensity guidance: High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated in adults aged ≤ 75 years with clinical ASCVD who are not receiving statin therapy, or increased from low or moderate intensity; when high intensity is contraindicated or adverse-effect risk is present, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be used as the second option, if tolerated, with an objective of a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C for moderate intensity and ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction for high intensity. For individuals aged > 75 years, evidence supports continuation of statin therapy in those already taking and tolerating it, data support the use of moderate-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals with clinical ASCVD aged > 75 years, and it is reasonable to consider initiation of high-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals aged > 75 years with decisions based on expected benefit and competing comorbidities. Patients with clinical ASCVD are defined from RCT inclusion criteria and subgroups include those at very high risk, those not at very high risk, and those with baseline LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL.

Conclusions

In summary, a personalized approach, identifying patients at risk of ASCVD earlier in the risk continuum and optimizing the use of available lipid‐lowering therapies in combination with statins, will enable more patients to achieve LDL‐C targets and help to address the current high global burden of ASCVD.

Statin therapy — Statin therapy is first-line treatment for primary prevention of ASCVD in patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (≥ 190 mg/dL), those with diabetes mellitus, who are 40 to 75 years of age, and those determined to be at sufficient ASCVD risk after a clinician–patient risk discussion.

Cholesterol

Cholesterol‐containing lipoproteins are central to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Elevated total cholesterol and LDL‐C are associated with increased ASCVD risk, – and lipid‐lowering medications can reduce this risk. – Intensive lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, should be recommended as first‐line therapy for all patients.

The newest iteration of the guidelines on the treatment of blood cholesterol (to reduce atherosclerotic CV risk in adults) have markedly changed the approach to lipid management, identifying statins as the preferred drug class to lower LDL‐C. Randomized controlled trial data support the use of statins to reduce CV risk in 4 groups: (1) those with known ASCVD, (2) those with an LDL‐C level ≥ 190 mg/dL, (3) those aged 40 to 75 years with DM and LDL‐C 70 to 189 md/dL, and (4) those aged 40 to 75 years with LDL‐C 70 to 189 mg/dL and an estimated ASCVD 10‐year risk of ≥ 7.5% (Table 4). The new pooled cohort risk estimator weighs age quite heavily; therefore, many more adults may be considered eligible for statin therapy despite having well‐controlled risk factors. Consequently, a central component of the new guideline recommendations is to have an informed discussion with the patient about the relative benefits and risks of drug therapy before starting a statin.

Table 4.
Groups in Who Randomized Controlled Trial Evidence Demonstrated a Reduction in ASCVD With Statin Therapy

Intensity of statin therapy is chosen to match the risk of those who are most likely to benefit (Table 4). A high‐intensity statin lowers LDL‐C by ≥ 50%, and a moderate‐intensity statin lowers LDL‐C by 30% to < 50%. Recommendations for statin intensity based on indication are summarized in Table 4. In addition, appropriate periodic monitoring (every 3 to 12 months) of lipid values should be obtained to monitor adherence, adequacy of response, and safety measures, as stated in the 2013 cholesterol guidelines.

Patients with increased concentrations of LDL‐C particles, decreased HDL‐C particles, and increased triglycerides carry an increased risk of metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and type 2 DM. This form of atherogenic dyslipidemia can be assessed by non–HDL‐C or by measuring an apolipoprotein B level. In addition, lipoprotein(a), which is a modified form of LDL that confers atherogenic risk independent of LDL‐C, can be elevated in the absence of other lipid abnormalities.

Figure 4
Impact of LLT type on the proportion of patients with ASCVD per LDL‐C range. For each treatment, the percentages of patients per LDL‐C range type are provided, based on their latest LDL‐C levels. The latest LLT is displayed, including from left to right: statin (monotherapy and combination therapy), statin alone (monotherapy), ezetimibe (monotherapy and combination therapy), a combination of ezetimibe and statins (possibly with other LLTs), and high‐intensity statin plus ezetimibe (possibly with other LLTs).

As per recommended guidelines for patients with ASCVD, LDL‐C goals should be reached with a maximum tolerated dose of statin and ezetimibe and intensified with a PCSK9 inhibitor when required. In Belgium, certain PCSK9 inhibitors are reimbursed for patients with established ASCVD and with LDL‐C ≥ 100 mg/dL despite being treated with a maximally tolerated dose of statin and ezetimibe. As described in Table 1, there was only a minority of patients with reported use of PCSK9 inhibitors in this cohort (49 patients only). Yet, the LDL‐C reduction observed with PCSK9 inhibitors was qualitatively similar to that achieved with high‐intensity statin plus ezetimibe, demonstrating the benefit of this therapy (not shown).

### Vascular quality of care assessment: clinicians' adherence to lipid-lowering therapy for patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^113LYtcN]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Lipid-lowering medication can considerably lessen the risk for cardiovascular events in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Despite well-publicized guidelines and the accessibility of effective therapies, many patients do not attain their lipid goals and remain at high cardiovascular risk. Guidelines recommend statins as first-line therapy to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in ASCVD. We aimed to analyze admission lipid levels in a broad contemporary population of patients with ASCVD attending a vascular clinic or admitted to an inpatient vascular unit.

Methods

Patients with known ASCVD, current cholesterol levels, and lipid-lowering medications were documented and compared with published current Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines recommendations for achieving < 2.0 mmol/L or > 50% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Cholesterol levels (current and previous), demographic characteristics, cardiovascular risk factors, and medical therapy were assessed from available patient records.

Results

Two hundred eight adult patients were identified. The mean age of the patients was 72 (± 10) years, and 76% were men. About half had peripheral arterial disease (n = 118, 56.7%), one-third had coronary artery disease (n = 78, 37.5%), and one-third had diabetes (n = 76, 36.5%). Most were hypertensive (n = 140, 67.3%) and half gave a history of dyslipidemia (n = 103, 49.5%). Most patients (n = 183, 88%) were taking a statin and the majority at a moderate-intensity dose (n = 79, 43.2%) or high-intensity dose (n = 101, 55.2%). However, 32.7% of patients (n = 68) did not reach target of LDL-C level of < 2.0 mmol/L or had ≤ 50% reduction from the baseline level. Of the patients who did not reach goals, 7 (10.3%) did not fill their statin prescriptions in the last 3 months. Only 26 patients (12.5%) were also on ezetimibe, a guideline-recommended second-line therapy if targets are not reached with maximally tolerated statin therapy. One patient, who was able to reach target LDL-C, was on evolocumab monotherapy, a PCSK9 inhibitor, a contemporary nonstatin therapy that could be considered in ASCVD in those not at LDL-C goal. Of the 16 patients who were not prescribed any lipid-lowering therapy and did not reach target, 8 (50%) did not have any identified or documented reasons. Of the remaining 8 patients, 7 (87.5%) reported intolerance or side effects to statins only, and could benefit from nonstatin LDL-lowering therapy.

Conclusions

In this observational study, we established suboptimal adherence to guideline recommendations for statin therapy and hesitancy to use nonstatin LDL-lowering agents in high-risk patients with ASCVD. These treatment gaps have an enormous effect on achieving improved cardiovascular clinical outcomes and must be tackled.

American Heart Association scientific statement — statin therapy scope and co-medication considerations state that "Statins reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and in many primary prevention patients", and that "Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend high-intensity statin therapy in patients with ASCVD ≤ 75 years and moderate- to high-intensity statin therapy in patients with ASCVD and age > 75 years, diabetes mellitus, and familial hypercholesterolemia and in primary prevention patients with 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5%"; given this role, "combination therapy with statins and other cardiovascular medications is highly likely, and potentially significant DDIs must be considered in patients treated with statins".

### Preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease using American college of cardiology and American Heart Association prevention guidelines: some good news, but caveats remain [^117JusFY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

It is axiomatic that you can be logical and factual, but if your assessment is incomplete, you can be misled.

That is why it is important to look carefully at papers that comment on the 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) cholesterol 1 and risk assessment 2 guidelines and the use of the pooled cohort equations for risk assessment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). An important attribute of the current ACC/AHA cholesterol guidelines is close adherence to the evidence derived from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or meta‐analyses of these RCTs. This approach emanated from important restraints imposed on the guidelines process from the start. A comprehensive literature search was undertaken in response to critical questions chosen by the panel. The literature search of RCTs and meta‐analyses of these RCTs was performed by an independent contractor chosen by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. This contractor, devoid of any conflicts with industry, graded the papers that the panel could consider for quality. Poor‐quality data were not considered, and the accumulated evidence was compiled into evidence tables. The cholesterol guideline recommendations were made from those tables. Importantly, > 50% of the large and diverse guidelines panel reported no conflicts during this process, which focused on evidence over expert opinion.

Evidence for the Underuse of Lipid‐Lowering Therapies in Clinical Practice

Despite guideline recommendations and compelling clinical trial evidence, recent population studies conducted in the United States and Europe have revealed that pharmacotherapy with a primary mechanism of LDL‐C lowering is underused. Gu and colleagues reported an increase in the use of lipid‐lowering therapies for ASCVD within the United States between 2014 and 2019; however, overall use remained low, with most patients not at guideline‐recommended LDL‐C thresholds. The persistent underuse of statins in contemporary practice is highlighted by a recently published retrospective study of > 600 000 US patients with established ASCVD; during the study period of 2018 to 2019, half of the included patients were not on any statin.

Among patients who receive lipid‐lowering therapies, evidence suggests that management of lipid levels remains suboptimal, with many not receiving appropriate treatment intensity or available combination therapies needed to achieve LDL‐C goals. A retrospective cohort study of ≈1.5 million patients with a history of ≥ 1 major ASCVD event reported that > 50% of patients meeting the 2018 AHA/ACC/Multisociety guideline very high‐risk criteria had LDL‐C levels ≥ 70 mg/dL, despite receiving statins and/or ezetimibe. Similarly, data from the GOULD (Getting to an Improved Understanding of Low‐Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol and Dyslipidemia Management) registry showed that over a 2‐year period, two‐thirds of patients with ASCVD remained with LDL‐C levels > 70 mg/dL and only 17% received treatment intensification. Recently, an interim report of the European SANTORINI (Treatment of High and Very High Risk Dyslipidemic Patients for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Europe: A Multinational Observational Study) to assess the management of high‐risk and very high‐risk patients after publication of the ESC/EAS 2019 guidelines showed that combination therapy was used in just 27.3% of patients, of whom 17.1% received statin plus ezetimibe, and 4.1% received an anti‐PCSK9 monoclonal antibody plus oral lipid‐lowering therapy.

Coronary artery calcium measurement — selected candidates and caveats — Patients reluctant to initiate statin who wish to understand their risk and potential for benefit more precisely and those concerned about need to reinstitute statin therapy after discontinuation for statin-associated symptoms are listed, as are older patients (men 55–80 y of age; women 60–80 y of age) with low burden of risk factors who question whether they would benefit from statin therapy and middle-aged adults (45–55 y of age) with pooled cohort equations (PCE)–calculated 10-year risk for ASCVD 5% to < 7.5% with factors that increase their ASCVD risk. Caveats include that if patient is at intermediate risk and if a risk decision is uncertain and a CAC score is obtained, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy unless higher-risk conditions are present and to reassess the CAC score in 5 to 10 years, and that, if CAC is recommended, it should be performed in facilities with current technology and expertise to deliver the lowest radiation possible.

Estimating Longitudinal Risks and Benefits From Cardiovascular Preventive Therapies Among Medicare Patients: The Million Hearts Longitudinal ASCVD Risk Assessment Tool Supporting Files 3 28 2017 By Lloyd-Jones, Donald M.; Huffman, Mark D.; Karmali, Kunal N. ;. File Language: English. Details Alternative Title: J Am Coll Cardiol Personal Author: Description: The Million Hearts Initiative has a goal of preventing 1 million heart attacks and strokes-the leading causes of mortality-through several public health and healthcare strategies by 2017. The American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology support the program.

The Cardiovascular Risk Reduction Model was developed by Million Hearts and the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services as a strategy to assess a value-based payment approach toward reduction in 10-year predicted risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease by implementing cardiovascular preventive strategies to manage the "ABCS". The purpose of this special report is to describe the development and intended use of the Million Hearts Longitudinal ASCVD Risk Assessment Tool. The Million Hearts Tool reinforces and builds on the "2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Assessment of Cardiovascular Risk" by allowing clinicians to estimate baseline and updated 10-year ASCVD risk estimates for primary prevention patients adhering to the appropriate ABCS over time, alone or in combination.

The tool provides updated risk estimates based on evidence from high-quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the ABCS therapies. This novel approach to personalized estimation of benefits from risk-reducing therapies in primary prevention may help target therapies to those in whom they will provide the greatest benefit, and serves as the basis for a Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services program designed to evaluate the Million Hearts Cardiovascular Risk Reduction Model.

AACE dyslipidemia — ASCVD risk stratification and initial therapy outline risk categories and actions: Individuals are classified as low (< 7.5%), intermediate (7.5–20%), or high (> 20%) 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. For low risk, the main treatment is lifestyle intervention that includes diet and physical activity modifications, and pharmacologic lipid management is not recommended. For high risk, pharmacologic therapy should be added to lifestyle interventions, whereas for intermediate risk clinicians should discuss benefits and harms of treatment options. AACE recommends an LDL-C treatment target of < 70 mg/dL for individuals with ASCVD at an increased risk including those with diabetes mellitus. Those at intermediate risk may benefit from additional testing for risk enhancers to aid in shared decision making. Tools and algorithms to estimate ASCVD risk include the Pooled Cohort Equations ASCVD Risk Calculator, the PREVENT Calculator, SCORE2 and SCORE2-OP, and QRISK.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^1167FpAL]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Assessment of cardiovascular risk (2019 ACC/AHA) — For adults 40 to 75 years of age, clinicians should routinely assess traditional cardiovascular risk factors and calculate 10-year risk of ASCVD by using the pooled cohort equations (PCE). For adults 20 to 39 years of age, it is reasonable to assess traditional ASCVD risk factors at least every 4 to 6 years. In adults at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) or intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10‑year ASCVD risk), it is reasonable to use additional risk‑enhancing factors to guide decisions about preventive interventions (eg, statin therapy). In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10‑year ASCVD risk) or selected adults at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10‑year ASCVD risk), if risk‑based decisions for preventive interventions (eg, statin therapy) remain uncertain, it is reasonable to measure a coronary artery calcium score to guide clinician–patient risk discussion. For adults 20 to 39 years of age and for those 40 to 59 years of age who have < 7.5% 10‑year ASCVD risk, estimating lifetime or 30‑year ASCVD risk may be considered; among those at borderline (5% to < 7.5%) and intermediate (≥ 7.5% to < 20%) risk, further testing to document subclinical coronary atherosclerosis is reasonable to more accurately reclassify the risk estimate upward or downward.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — coronary artery calcium (CAC)–guided statin decisions — in intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [ASCVD] risk) adults or selected borderline-risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults in whom a CAC score is measured for the purpose of making a treatment decision, if the CAC score is zero, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy and reassess in 5 to 10 years so long as higher-risk conditions are absent; if the CAC score is 1 to 99, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy for patients ≥ 55 years of age; and if the CAC score is 100 or higher or in the 75th percentile or higher, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy. Additionally, in intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults, risk-enhancing factors favor initiation or intensification of statin therapy, and in patients at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk), in risk discussion, the presence of risk-enhancing factors may justify initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy.

### Effect of 2013 ACC / AHA blood cholesterol guidelines on statin treatment patterns and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients [^115e1AQY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Preceding the release of the 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) blood cholesterol guidelines (hereafter referred to as the "2013 guidelines" or simply "guidelines"), LDL‐C goals were < 4.1 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) for patients with a single CVD risk factor, < 3.4 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) for patients with 2 or more risk factors, and < 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) for patients with known CVD or risk factor equivalent. 4 The guidelines were revised in 2013 to recommend moving away from a "treating to goal" approach with respect to LDL‐C 1 and instead focus on treating with the most appropriate statin intensity based on the patient's risk. The 4 statin benefit groups described in the guidelines are (1) patients with clinical ASCVD, (2) adult patients with LDL‐C ≥ 4.9 mmol/L (190 mg/dL), (3) patients aged 40 to 75 years with diabetes mellitus and LDL‐C levels 1.8 to 4.9 mmol/L (70–189 mg/dL), and (4) patients with an estimated 10‐year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5% and LDL‐C levels 1.8 to less than 4.9 mmol/L (70–189 mg/dL; primary prevention). 1 With some exceptions for age and risk, in general, high‐intensity statin therapy is recommended for those in statin benefit groups 1 and 2, whereas moderate‐ or high‐intensity statin therapy is recommended for most patients in statin benefit group 3. For statin benefit group 4, the recommendation is to estimate 10‐year ASCVD risk and engage in patient‐clinician discussions to determine an appropriate course of action. 5 In addition, the 2013 guidelines no longer recommend monitoring LDL‐C to assess achievement of a particular LDL‐C goal, but instead recommend monitoring LDL‐C to determine adherence and anticipated therapeutic response.

### 2018 cholesterol clinical practice guidelines: synopsis of the 2018 American Heart Association / American college of cardiology / multisociety cholesterol guideline [^1138QxsW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Description

In November 2018, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) released a new clinical practice guideline on cholesterol management. It was accompanied by a risk assessment report on primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

Methods

A panel of experts free of recent and relevant industry-related conflicts was chosen to carry out systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined cardiovascular outcomes. High-quality observational studies were used for estimation of ASCVD risk. An independent panel systematically reviewed RCT evidence about the benefits and risks of adding nonstatin medications to statin therapy compared with receiving statin therapy alone in persons who have or are at high risk for ASCVD.

Recommendation

The guideline endorses a heart-healthy lifestyle beginning in childhood to reduce lifetime risk for ASCVD. It contains several new features compared with the 2013 guideline. For secondary prevention, patients at very high risk may be candidates for adding nonstatin medications (ezetimibe or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [PCSK9] inhibitors) to statin therapy. In primary prevention, a clinician-patient risk discussion is still strongly recommended before a decision is made about statin treatment. The AHA/ACC risk calculator first triages patients into 4 risk categories. Those at intermediate risk deserve a focused clinician-patient discussion before initiation of statin therapy. Among intermediate-risk patients, identification of risk-enhancing factors and coronary artery calcium testing can assist in the decision to use a statin. Compared with the 2013 guideline, the new guideline gives more attention to percentage reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as a treatment goal and to long-term monitoring of therapeutic efficacy.

### 2013 ACC / AHA cholesterol guideline and implications for healthy people 2020 cardiovascular disease prevention goals [^116ZyzwG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

A prior analysis indicated that full implementation of the 2013 Cholesterol Guideline would prevent an additional ≈475 000 cardiovascular events over 10 years compared with full implementation of the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP)‐3 Guideline. 9 A cost‐effectiveness analysis suggested that lowering the threshold for intervention from a 10‐year ASCVD risk (ASCVD 10) from ≥ 7.5% to ≥ 3.0% would prevent an additional 161 650 ASCVD events over 10 years and was cost effective, especially with low‐cost statins. 11 In both reports, only adults aged 40 to 75 years were included, and statins were assumed to reduce CHD by 25% and stroke by 17%, given a 39‐mg/dL reduction in low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C).

The 2013 Cholesterol Guideline extends to a broader age range than 40 to 75 years for adults with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) ≥ 190 mg/dL. 6 Moreover, the percentage and absolute reduction in LDL‐C are dose dependent with high‐intensity statins more effective than moderate‐intensity statins in reducing ASCVD, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 although adverse effects also increase. 16, 17, 18, 19 The current and previous cholesterol guidelines also identified a favorable risk:benefit ratio for statins in adults aged ≥ 75 years with clinical ASCVD. 6, 20, 21

Given the importance of ASCVD prevention, we examined the impact of implementing the 2013 Cholesterol Guideline on 2 key outcomes. One outcome was to estimate the number of ASCVD events that could be prevented in the United States by providing statins to currently untreated but statin‐eligible adults 21 to 79 years old. A second outcome was to calculate absolute risk reduction (ARR) and 10‐year number needed‐to‐treat (NNT) to prevent a major ASCVD event. This information is important for assessing clinical resource requirements and risk:benefit ratio. Study findings have potentially important implications for healthcare delivery, policy, and payment to enhance cardiovascular health promotion and disease prevention.

### National trends in racial and ethnic disparities in use of recommended therapies in adults with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, 1999–2020 [^112RhwQi]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

This study extends existing research in several critical ways. First, it uses the most recent nationally representative data to investigate the use of guideline-recommended therapies for secondary prevention. This approach extends the findings of earlier studies, such as Massing et aland Shah et al, by providing a more up-to-date and comprehensive picture of disparities in medication use among patients with ASCVD. Moreover, the study goes beyond previous work by analyzing a wide range of medications used for secondary prevention, including individual medication groups and optimal regimens. By doing so, it offers a more detailed and nuanced understanding of medication utilization patterns among ASCVD patients. Finally, the study provides quantitative data on lifestyle modifications (eg, weight loss, physical activity, and smoking cessation) recommended for secondary prevention, which are crucial for reducing the risk of ASCVD.

Limitations

Our study has several limitations. First, we relied on self-reported history of ASCVD to define the secondary prevention population, which may introduce measurement error. Nonetheless, previous studies have shown that self-reported myocardial infarction has high sensitivity and specificity (over 97%), suggesting that self-report could be a valid instrument to define the study population in this analysis. Second, while this study focuses on individuals with established ASCVD, the distinction is often based on whether diagnostic testing is performed, or events are recognized. Therefore, a secondary prevention cohort is likely specific for people with established coronary disease but may not be sensitive. Third, the data on medication use was self-reported, which may be subject to recall bias. To minimize this bias, we combined self-report medication use with information gathered during the actual examination of the patient's prescription medication. Fourth, the sample size of participants with ASCVD by race and ethnicity in each NHANES cycle is relatively small, which may limit the power to detect changes for certain therapies. Finally, because evidence and clinical guidelines were evolving during the study period, some of the change in utilization of guideline-recommended therapies over time may reflect the evolution of the knowledge base rather than actual changes in clinical practice.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^111ykjRF]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Low credibility.

The leadership of the National Lipid Association convened an Expert Panel to develop a consensus set of recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia in clinical medicine. An Executive Summary of those recommendations was previously published. This document provides support for the recommendations outlined in the Executive Summary. The major conclusions include (1) an elevated level of cholesterol carried by circulating apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins (non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], termed atherogenic cholesterol) is a root cause of atherosclerosis, the key underlying process contributing to most clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events; (2) reducing elevated levels of atherogenic cholesterol will lower ASCVD risk in proportion to the extent that atherogenic cholesterol is reduced. This benefit is presumed to result from atherogenic cholesterol lowering through multiple modalities, including lifestyle and drug therapies; (3) the intensity of risk-reduction therapy should generally be adjusted to the patient's absolute risk for an ASCVD event; (4) atherosclerosis is a process that often begins early in life and progresses for decades before resulting a clinical ASCVD event. Therefore, both intermediate-term and long-term or lifetime risk should be considered when assessing the potential benefits and hazards of risk-reduction therapies; (5) for patients in whom lipid-lowering drug therapy is indicated, statin treatment is the primary modality for reducing ASCVD risk; (6) nonlipid ASCVD risk factors should also be managed appropriately, particularly high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, and diabetes mellitus; and (7) the measurement and monitoring of atherogenic cholesterol levels remain an important part of a comprehensive ASCVD prevention strategy.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^112QMZmt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

The 2019 ESC/EAS guideline recommends using the Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation system, based on large, European cohort data sets, for estimating the 10‐year risk of fatal ASCVD events in adults > 40 years of age. The Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation tool has since been updated as Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation 2, which predicts 10‐year risk for both fatal and nonfatal ASCVD events. Also, CAC scoring is recommended in asymptomatic individuals classified as low or intermediate risk for whom statin therapy is being considered. A summary of the risk categories and recommendations for LDL‐C lowering in both the ACC/AHA/Multisociety and ESC/EAS guidelines is provided in Table 1.

Table 1
Classification of ASCVD Risk and LDL‐C Thresholds Defined by US and European Guidelines

Both the US and European guidelines recommend consideration of nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapy in addition to statins for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events; however, the guidelines differ in their respective definitions of patients at "very high risk". In the ACC/AHA/Multisociety guidelines, patients with a history of multiple major ASCVD events or those who have had one major ASCVD event plus multiple high‐risk conditions are considered very high risk. Recommendation for add‐on nonstatin therapy is therefore restricted to secondary prevention for patients at an LDL‐C threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL. The ESC/EAS guideline adopts a broader definition of very high risk, encompassing those with documented ASCVD, either clinical or unequivocal on imaging or various other higher‐risk conditions in the absence of ASCVD. A more aggressive approach to lipid lowering is advocated. Add‐on nonstatin therapies are recommended if a target reduction of ≥ 50% in LDL‐C values from baseline and a treatment goal of < 55 mg/dL are not achieved.

Recommendations for adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy are as follows: "In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), statin therapy reduces risk of ASCVD, and in the context of a risk discussion, if a decision is made for statin therapy, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended". Targets are specified: "In intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) patients, LDL-C levels should be reduced by 30% or more", and "in patients at high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), levels should be reduced by 50% or more". Diabetes-specific guidance states: "In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, regardless of estimated 10-year ASCVD risk, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated", and "In adults with diabetes mellitus who have multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more". For very high LDL-C, "In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended".

Aerobic physical activity dosage for adults — minimum amounts and accumulation patterns to lower atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk — is specified with weekly time targets and options for shorter bouts. All adults should engage in at least 150 minutes per week of accumulated moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity (or an equivalent combination of moderate and vigorous activity) to lower ASCVD risk. Shorter durations of exercise seem to be as beneficial as longer ones (e.g., ≥ 10-minute bouts) and additional reduction in ASCVD risk is seen with higher amounts (> 300 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or 150 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity). There is likely no lower limit on the quantity of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity at which benefits start to accrue, and sedentary individuals starting an exercise program should initiate exercise at a lower intensity and duration and progress gradually to recommended levels.

### The causal-benefit model to prevent cardiovascular events [^116PXArz]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Conventional definitions of primary and secondary prevention

Currently, prevention of ASCVD is divided into general population measures that are directed at everyone, such as eliminating smoking and promoting a healthy lifestyle, vs more intensive strategies involving medical treatments directed at restricted groups of individuals. The latter are divided into primary and secondary prevention strategies. Primary prevention includes all those with a calculated 10-year risk of ASCVD that exceeds a specified value, plus those with diabetes mellitus or extremely high levels of LDL-C. Secondary prevention includes all those who have suffered the clinical consequences of atherosclerosis or who have anatomic evidence of atherosclerosis. All these individuals are automatically eligible for pharmacological therapy to reduce LDL-C. In both primary and secondary prevention, the explicit objective is to prevent clinical ASCVD events.

### 2020 expert consensus decision pathway on novel therapies for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^112xRKQX]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Unresolved questions for sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) — key uncertainties and cautions include: Several important clinical questions regarding the use of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs remain unanswered, including what are the benefits and risks of using both classes of medications simultaneously, as current guidelines do suggest the use of both classes of medications in some patient groups, but whether combination therapy leads to further improvements in outcome is unknown. It is also uncertain whether an SGLT2 inhibitor or a GLP-1RA should be the initial therapy in drug-naïve patients with T2D and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and what is the role for these medications in patients who do not have diabetic kidney disease (DKD) or established ASCVD but are at high risk, although we and others recommend their use in patients with a high burden of risk factors for CV disease. Finally, prioritization and sequencing among novel therapies are highlighted, and the writing committee emphasizes the importance of these drugs to CV specialists on the basis of their effects on CV risk reduction rather than a direct effect through glucose lowering; however, increased vigilance to avoid hypoglycemia in patients with HbA1c near or below target levels at SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA initiation is warranted, especially if the patient's existing T2D therapies include sulfonylureas, glinides, or insulin.

ACC/AHA 2013 long-term atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk assessment — It is reasonable to assess traditional ASCVD risk factors every 4 to 6 years in adults 20 to 79 years of age who are free from ASCVD and to estimate 10-year ASCVD risk every 4 to 6 years in adults 40 to 79 years of age who are free from ASCVD (NHLBI Grade: B [Moderate]; ACC/AHA COR: IIa, LOE: B). Assessment of 30-year or lifetime ASCVD risk on the basis of traditional risk factors may be considered in adults 20 to 59 years of age who are free from ASCVD and are not at high short-term risk (NHLBI Grade: C [Weak]; ACC/AHA COR: IIb, LOE: C). Evidence notes that lifetime risk assessment did not guide pharmacological therapy decisions and was judged more appropriate to motivate lifestyle change in younger individuals, with age 20 years as the starting point for long-term risk assessment and age 40 years as the threshold for short-term 10-year ASCVD risk assessment; long-term or lifetime estimation may be less valuable in those at high short-term (10-year) risk. A Web-based application enabling estimation of 10-year and lifetime risk of ASCVD is available at the cited URLs.

### 2017 focused update of the 2016 ACC Expert consensus decision pathway on the role of non-statin therapies for LDL-cholesterol lowering in the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on expert consensus decision pathways [^115Da8wV]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

In 2016, the American College of Cardiology published the first expert consensus decision pathway (ECDP) on the role of non-statin therapies for low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol lowering in the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. Since the publication of that document, additional evidence and perspectives have emerged from randomized clinical trials and other sources, particularly considering the longer-term efficacy and safety of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors in secondary prevention of ASCVD. Most notably, the FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated Risk) trial and SPIRE-1 and -2 (Studies of PCSK9 Inhibition and the Reduction of Vascular Events), assessing evolocumab and bococizumab, respectively, have published final results of cardiovascular outcomes trials in patients with clinical ASCVD and in a smaller number of high-risk primary prevention patients. In addition, further evidence on the types of patients most likely to benefit from the use of ezetimibe in addition to statin therapy after acute coronary syndrome has been published. Based on results from these important analyses, the ECDP writing committee judged that it would be desirable to provide a focused update to help guide clinicians more clearly on decision making regarding the use of ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors in patients with clinical ASCVD with or without comorbidities. In the following summary table, changes from the 2016 ECDP to the 2017 ECDP Focused Update are highlighted, and a brief rationale is provided. The content of the full document has been changed accordingly, with more extensive and detailed guidance regarding decision making provided both in the text and in the updated algorithms. Revised recommendations are provided for patients with clinical ASCVD with or without comorbidities on statin therapy for secondary prevention. The ECDP writing committee judged that these new data did not warrant changes to the decision pathways and algorithms regarding the use of ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors in primary prevention patients with LDL-C < 190 mg/dL with or without diabetes mellitus or patients without ASCVD and LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL not due to secondary causes. Based on feedback and further deliberation, the ECDP writing committee down-graded recommendations regarding bile acid sequestrant use, recommending bile acid sequestrants only as optional secondary agents for consideration in patients intolerant to ezetimibe. For clarification, the writing committee has also included new information on diagnostic categories of heterozygous and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, based on clinical criteria with and without genetic testing. Other changes to the original document were kept to a minimum to provide consistent guidance to clinicians, unless there was a compelling reason or new evidence, in which case justification is provided.

Exercise and physical activity — Adults should be routinely counseled in healthcare visits to optimize a physically active lifestyle. Adults should engage in at least 150 minutes per week of accumulated moderate-intensity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity (or an equivalent combination of moderate and vigorous activity) to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. For adults unable to meet the minimum physical activity recommendations (at least 150 minutes per week of accumulated moderate-intensity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity), engaging in some moderate- or vigorous-intensity physical activity, even if less than this recommended amount, can be beneficial to reduce ASCVD risk. Decreasing sedentary behavior in adults may be reasonable to reduce ASCVD risk.

### Statins and primary atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease prevention-what we know, where we need to Go, and… [^115keNEX]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

A C statement was made that clinicians selectively offer statins in those with a 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event of 7. 5% to less than 10%. 1, 2 The sex- and race-specific pooled cohort risk equations may be used for 10-year ASCVD risk estimation. 3 Given lack of sufficient data, the USPSTF concluded that "there was insufficient evidence to assess outcomes of statins in adults 76 years or older. "1, 2. This is understandable, given the issues surrounding overestimation of ASCVD risk using PCE, as shown in some studies, and the dominant role that age plays in 10-year ASCVD risk estimation. 3 On the other hand, statin therapy has been shown to be efficacious at much lower 10-year ASCVD risk levels. For example, the 10-year hard ASCVD event rates in 3 trials of pure primary prevention showed benefits of statin therapy ranging from 5. 1% to
7. 6%.

4 Indeed, statin therapy shows efficacy at even lower 10-year ASCVD risk levels, and there is some indication that the relative benefits of statin therapy may be higher among individuals with lower 10-year ASCVD risk. 5 For most therapies, treating individuals with lower ASCVD risk comes at a price of treating a large number of individuals for a longer period of time. With statin therapy, this strategy could still be considered by clinicians, given more than 40 years' worth of efficacy and safety data; excellent cost-effectiveness, even for individuals with 10-year ASCVD risk of at least 5%6; availability of statin therapy as a low-cost generic medication; and.

Second, 10-year risk assessment using PCE does not include several important factors associated with risk of ASCVD. Fourth, clinicians should consider titrating the intensity of therapy to the risk of the individual. Therefore, patients who belong to high-risk primary prevention groups may derive further benefit from the use of high-intensity statin therapy.

### Statin therapy for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: pros [^1123QQkc]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Medium credibility.

The initiation of statins for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains a debated subject, despite decades worth of clinical trial data demonstrating efficacy, effectiveness, and safety. Statin therapy, in addition to blood pressure-lowering drugs and efforts to reduce cigarette smoking, was a key component of the preventive cardiology renaissance that achieved a dramatic reduction in ASCVD-related mortality from the 1950s to 2010. However, deaths attributable to ASCVD have increased by approximately 13% in recent years, which are in part driven by incomplete treatment of risk factor burden starting in youth. Statins are a cornerstone of preventive cardiology practice, not only due to their lipid-lowering properties, but also in part due to their ability to exert pleiotropic effects that promote atherosclerotic plaque stability which reduces the likelihood of atherothrombotic clinical events. While the benefit of statin therapy undoubtedly depends on the presence and degree of atherosclerotic plaque burden, a broader statin allocation strategy on a population-based level should be considered especially in younger communities that are disproportionately affected by ASCVD risk factors. Thus, the era of precision medicine must be balanced with a pragmatic, cost-effective approach that maximizes ASCVD prevention across the life course. Herein, we examine the pros of statin pharmacotherapy in primary prevention while examining over three decades worth of basic science, translational, and clinical research in the setting of clinical practice guidelines.

The treatment of lipid disorders begins with lifestyle therapy to improve nutrition, physical activity, weight, and other factors that affect lipids. Secondary causes of lipid disorders should be addressed, and pharmacologic therapy initiated based on a patient's risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Patients at extreme ASCVD risk should be treated with high-intensity statin therapy to achieve a goal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of < 55 mg/dL, and those at very high ASCVD risk should be treated to achieve LDL-C < 70 mg/dL. Treatment for moderate and high ASCVD risk patients may begin with a moderate-intensity statin to achieve an LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, while the LDL-C goal is < 130 mg/dL for those at low risk. In all cases, treatment should be intensified, including the addition of other LDL-C-lowering agents (i.e., proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, ezetimibe, colesevelam, or bempedoic acid) as needed to achieve treatment goals. When targeting triglyceride levels, the desirable goal is < 150 mg/dL. Statin therapy should be combined with a fibrate, prescription-grade omega-3 fatty acid, and/or niacin to reduce triglycerides in all patients with triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL, and icosapent ethyl should be added to a statin in any patient with established ASCVD or diabetes with ≥ 2 ASCVD risk factors and triglycerides between 135 and 499 mg/dL to prevent ASCVD events. Management of additional risk factors such as elevated lipoprotein(a) and statin intolerance is also described.

### Clinician's guide to the updated ABCs of cardiovascular disease prevention [^117AXrh7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Assessment of Risk

The first step in prevention is to assess a patient's risk of having an ASCVD event. Risk assessment enables clinicians to target those who will benefit most from risk‐reducing therapy. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) risk assessment guidelinesrecommend that all adults aged 20 to 79 years old should have risk factors assessed at least every 4 to 6 years for primary prevention (although providers may do this more regularly). For adults aged 40 to 79 years, 10‐year risk estimation should be done using the pooled cohort risk assessment tool. Younger adults aged 20 to 59 years at low 10‐year risk may be considered for 30‐year or lifetime ASCVD risk assessment. Risk assessment in secondary prevention (those with established ASCVD) is much more straightforward as the benefits of pharmacotherapy (ie, aspirin, statin) are well established. Some view those with diabetes who are at least 40 years of age, and possibly stage ≥ 2 chronic kidney disease, as higher risk individuals who merit more aggressive prevention efforts.

With the recent release of the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults, a new risk estimator derived from the pooled cohort equationswas introduced to assess clinical ASCVD risk. The risk estimator was validated in community‐based populations with large numbers of non‐Hispanic whites and blacks. Initially, some raised concerns about its calibration and discrimination. These concerns emanated from using the equations in selected low‐risk cohorts with likely downstream prevention interventions such as statin use –; however, the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study validated the ACC/AHA pooled cohort risk equations in a community‐based US population. In that study, the risk estimator proved to be well calibrated and demonstrated fair discrimination or rank ordering. Consequently, it is the preferred tool for risk assessment in the United States for facilitating risk discussions between clinicians and patients.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: advances in diagnosis and treatment [^112T2D1u]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Clinical decision making regarding the appropriate use of aspirin for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events is complex, and requires an individualized benefit to risk assessment.

Objective

To review advances in the individualized assessment for ASCVD and bleeding risk, and to provide an update of the randomized clinical trial evidence that examined the use of aspirin for primary prevention (primarily for ASCVD, and secondarily for colorectal cancer). The recently released 2016 US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations are discussed, as well as the role of ASCVD risk, age, sex, and aspirin dose/formulation in clinical decision making.

Evidence Review

We performed a detailed review of peer-reviewed publications that were identified through searches of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database through 2016 using the literature search terms "aspirin", "primary prevention", "cardiovascular disease", "mortality", "cancer". Bibliographies from these references as well as meta-analyses of these randomized clinical trials were also reviewed.

Findings

Evidence from a total of 11 trials involving more than 118 000 patients is available to guide clinical decision making for aspirin use in the primary prevention of ASCVD. Clinicians should balance the benefit to risk ratio and the individual's preferences, calculating the 10-year ASCVD risk and evaluating risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding, to facilitate a safer and more personalized approach to appropriate selection of candidates for low-dose aspirin (75 to 81 mg/d) for the primary prevention of ASCVD, with secondary considerations for reducing colorectal cancer risk when taken for longer periods (> 10 years). Both the net ASCVD benefit and the bleeding risk of aspirin therapy increased as the absolute ASCVD risk increased, but the net benefits generally exceeded the risks at higher baseline ASCVD risk (≥ 10% ASCVD 10-year risk). The Aspirin-Guide is a clinical decision making support tool (app for mobile devices) with internal risk calculators to help clinicians with this dual assessment by calculating the ASCVD risk and the bleeding risk in the individual patient, and incorporating age- and sex-specific guidance based on randomized trial results.

Conclusions and Relevance

Balancing the benefit of ASCVD reduction with the risk of bleeding from low-dose aspirin is difficult but essential for informed decision making and achieving a net clinical benefit from aspirin for primary prevention. This is facilitated by a free and readily available evidence-based clinical decision support tool.

### Statinopause [^115kh8SZ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Statins are the cornerstone of lipid-lowering therapy for cardiovascular disease prevention. The 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines represent a fundamental shift in how statins will be prescribed. The new guidelines recommend statins for nearly all older patients up to age 75 years, including healthy adults with low normal lipid levels and no atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors other than age. Under the 2013 guidelines, age becomes a main determinant for initiating statin therapy for primary prevention among older adults. Specifically, according to the new guidelines, white males aged 63–75, white females aged 71–75, African American males aged 66–75, and African American females aged 70–75 with optimal risk factors would be recommended for statin treatment for primary prevention. Based on the new guidelines, one could term these older adults as having "statin deficiency", a condition warranting statin treatment. We call this putative condition of age-related statin deficiency "statinopause". After careful examination of the trial evidence, we find very little support for the new recommendations for primary prevention. The lack of evidence underscores the need for clinical trials to determine the risks and benefits of statin therapy for primary prevention among older adults.

### Effect of 2013 ACC / AHA blood cholesterol guidelines on statin treatment patterns and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients [^116uqt2p]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

High levels of low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) are associated with greater risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). 1 Approximately 85.6 million people in the United States have at least 1 type of cardiovascular disease (CVD). 2 An additional 45 million people in the United States have either a ≥ 7.5% 10‐year risk of a cardiovascular event (33 million) or a > 5% to 7.4% 10‐year risk of a cardiovascular event (12.8 million). 2 For patients at high risk for cardiovascular events or with ASCVD, statins are considered standard first‐line therapy to lower LDL‐C. The appropriate statin dose is important to effectively lower LDL‐C and therefore reduce the risk of ASCVD and cardiovascular events; however, not all patients are able to sufficiently lower their LDL‐C levels, even at the maximally tolerated statin dose. 1 Approximately 40% of patients are unable to adequately lower their LDL‐C levels despite high‐intensity statin therapy. 3 For these patients, treatment regimens may be modified to include a higher statin dose, a switch to a different statin, or combination therapy with other lipid‐lowering agents such as ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, niacin, or, when appropriate, an inhibitor of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9).

### Primary prevention of ASCVD and T2DM in patients at metabolic risk: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^116uq1L5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Risk assessment and evaluation (Recommendation 3.1) focuses on metabolic risk populations, stating that we recommend global assessment of 10-year risk for either CHD or ASCVD to guide the use of medical or pharmacological therapy. Technical remark: Global risk assessment includes the use of one of the established cardiovascular risk equations, and elevated LDL is indicative of cardiovascular risk. The Writing Committee recommends that 10-year risk for CHD be assessed for individuals using published algorithms that best pertain to the individuals from a particular population group, and clinical judgment or national or regional recommendations can be used for making these assessments. The population with previously diagnosed diabetes is outside the framework of the primary prevention population considered in this guideline.

### 2013 ACC / AHA guideline on the assessment of cardiovascular risk: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines [^1162hkCz]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA 2013 risk assessment implementation — Risk assessment should be repeated every 4 to 6 years in persons who are found to be at low 10-year risk (< 7.5%). Beginning at age 40 years, formal estimation of the absolute 10-year risk of ASCVD is recommended, and long-term or lifetime risk estimation is recommended for all persons who are between 20 and 39 years of age and for those between 40 and 59 years of age who are determined to be at low 10-year risk (< 7.5%). For patients outside this age range, providers should refer to applicable clinical practice guidelines. Using Adult Treatment Panel III, approximately 31.9% of the ASCVD-free, nonpregnant US population between 40 and 79 years of age have a 10-year risk of a first hard CHD event of at least 10% or have diabetes, whereas on the basis of the new Pooled Cohort Equations approximately 32.9% have a 10-year risk of a first hard ASCVD of at least 7.5%; the overlap of these high-risk groups is roughly 75%. We recommend that healthcare organizations convert to these new Pooled Cohort Equations as soon as practical.

### Optimisation of lipids for prevention of cardiovascular disease in a primary care [^116SgcrX]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Problem

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains the leading cause of mortality in the world with approximately 17.7 million annual deaths. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) released guidelines on the treatment of blood lipids to reduce ASCVD in adults in 2013. These guidelines include a Pooled Cohort Equation risk calculator that uses age, gender, race, diabetes, hypertension and smoking history, lipid levels and blood systolic pressure to guide primary prevention methods of ASCVD. In the Internal Medicine Clinic, we identified a gap of evidence-based treatment for hyperlipidaemia; less than 1% of active, eligible patients had ASCVD risk scores documented in electronic health record using the ASCVD risk calculator. These data indicate that evidence-based treatment for hyperlipidaemia using ACC/AHA guidelines were underused in the Internal Medicine Clinic.

### National trends in racial and ethnic disparities in use of recommended therapies in adults with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, 1999–2020 [^117VZtbT]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Individuals with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) are at high risk for subsequent cardiovascular events and mortality. Evidence-based secondary prevention guidelines recommend the use of lifestyle modifications and pharmacological medications to reduce risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. However, previous studies have shown substantial racial and ethnic disparities in adherence to these guidelines, with non-Hispanic Black patients and Hispanic and Latino patients being less likely to achieve cardiovascular risk factor control goals compared with non-Hispanic White patients. Given the national efforts to eliminate health disparities, and the American Heart Association's goal to champion health equity and advance cardiovascular health for all, it is crucial to assess how much progress has been made in eliminating disparities in guideline-recommended therapies for secondary prevention among patients with ASCVD.

Limited national-level data exist on racial and ethnic disparities in adherence to secondary prevention guidelines, with available data only extending through 2012. Since that time, new evidence-based guidelines for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease and stroke have been introduced. Despite the introduction of these new guidelines, no recent comprehensive studies have evaluated the utilization of guideline-recommended therapies by race and ethnicity. Previous studies, while informative, have focused on only a small number of medications, such as statins, and have not systematically quantified racial and ethnic disparities in the use of a broad range of therapies for secondary prevention.

Therefore, this study aims to estimate 21-year trends in the utilization of guideline-recommended therapies for secondary prevention among US adults with ASCVD and to compare these trends by race and ethnicity using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) from 1999 to 2020. This study addressed gaps in previous research by systematically quantifying racial and ethnic differences in the use of a wide range of therapies for secondary prevention, including pharmacological medications and lifestyle modifications.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) prevention — 2018 AHA/ACC/multisociety cholesterol guideline context identifies primary-prevention groups likely to benefit from statins, including patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] levels ≥ 190 mg/dL and those with diabetes mellitus aged 40 to 75 years, and introduced risk stratification refinements with "risk enhancers" and selective use of a coronary artery calcium score to reclassify risk and inform shared decision-making; for secondary prevention, it introduced a "very high-risk ASCVD group" that derives the greatest absolute risk reduction from further LDL-C lowering with addition of ezetimibe and/or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [PCSK9i] to maximally tolerated statin therapy.
