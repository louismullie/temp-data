## Question

Pancytopenia and elevated procalcitonin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret pancytopenia with an elevated procalcitonin, including what it means, how to prioritize the differential, and how to act on it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the hematologic implications of pancytopenia and the immediate safety risks. Then, I should verify what procalcitonin actually measures and how its kinetics and thresholds behave. Next, I will integrate both findings into a prioritized differential diagnosis, being careful not to jump to conclusions. After that, I need to outline a diagnostic workup and management plan, including when to start antibiotics and when to stop them. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize a practical, guideline-aligned approach with explicit cautions and follow-up steps.

> Let me first confirm the clinical significance of pancytopenia. Pancytopenia reflects simultaneous depression of at least two, and usually all three, hematopoietic lineages and signals bone marrow failure or suppression, which carries risks of infection, bleeding, and anemia-related hypoxia. I need to ensure I assess severity by absolute neutrophil count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, and I should remember that pancytopenia is a recognized feature of sepsis-associated hematologic dysfunction, so I must not miss evolving sepsis in this context [^b91d9cd1].

> Now, I should verify what procalcitonin represents. Procalcitonin is a precursor of calcitonin that rises within 4–6 hours of bacterial exposure, peaks around 6–8 hours, and falls with effective therapy. It is relatively specific for bacterial infection compared with viral illness, but it is not perfectly specific and can be elevated in severe noninfectious inflammatory states, so I need to interpret any single value in clinical context and, ideally, as a trend rather than an isolated number [^69967f97] [^5d5cec61].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should integrate the two findings thoughtfully. Pancytopenia plus elevated procalcitonin most strongly suggests a bacterial infection superimposed on bone marrow suppression, but I must actively consider noninfectious causes of pancytopenia with secondary PCT elevation from systemic inflammation, and I should double-check for viral etiologies like COVID-19 or SFTS that can produce both cytopenias and PCT elevations, which would mislead if I assume bacteria by default [^b91d9cd1] [^a0bbd0eb].

> I will now examine the most likely infectious explanation. Severe bacterial sepsis can cause pancytopenia via bone marrow suppression, margination, and consumption, and concurrently drive PCT upward. In this scenario, PCT often exceeds 0.5 ng/mL and can reach much higher levels in bacteremia or septic shock, so a high PCT in a pancytopenic patient should heighten concern for invasive bacterial infection and prompt empiric antibiotics while cultures are pending, especially if the patient is febrile or unstable [^b91d9cd1] [^69967f97].

> But wait, what if the cytopenias are primary and the PCT elevation reflects noninfectious inflammation. Hematologic malignancies, aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, and chemotherapy-induced marrow suppression can all cause pancytopenia, and in these patients PCT may rise with mucositis, translocation, or secondary infections, yet PCT lacks sufficient sensitivity to exclude infection in febrile neutropenia, so a normal PCT cannot safely defer antibiotics, whereas a clearly elevated PCT supports bacterial infection and should be acted upon [^ca262e0c] [^bdce3c3e].

> I need to check for viral etiologies that can mimic this pattern. COVID-19 frequently causes lymphopenia and can be accompanied by thrombocytopenia and anemia, and PCT may be modestly elevated in severe disease even without bacterial coinfection. Similarly, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome can present with pancytopenia and elevated PCT, so travel and exposure histories are critical to avoid anchoring on bacteria alone [^a0bbd0eb].

> Next, I should review noninfectious inflammatory states that elevate PCT. Major trauma, surgery, burns, severe pancreatitis, and severe drug reactions can all raise PCT in the absence of proven bacterial infection. In these contexts, PCT may reflect cytokine-driven neuroendocrine activation rather than bacterial invasion, so I must correlate with the clinical picture and, when possible, trend PCT to see if it declines with supportive care rather than antibiotics [^1488f93f] [^64ca917b].

> Let me think about the diagnostic workup I should pursue. I should confirm the CBC with differential and smear, obtain at least two sets of blood cultures before antibiotics if feasible, and send a comprehensive infection workup guided by symptoms, including urinalysis and culture, chest imaging, and targeted cultures. Given the pancytopenia, I should also evaluate for hematologic causes with peripheral smear, B12/folate, iron studies, liver function, and consider bone marrow evaluation if cytopenias are unexplained or persistent, while remembering that in febrile neutropenia PCT has limited negative predictive value and should not be used alone to withhold antibiotics [^ca262e0c] [^bdce3c3e].

> I should confirm management principles next. If bacterial infection is suspected or the patient is unstable, I should start empiric antibiotics promptly, typically with coverage for gram-negative organisms given the frequency of E. coli and Pseudomonas in neutropenic hosts, and then de-escalate based on cultures and clinical response. If the patient stabilizes and cultures are negative, I should reassess daily and consider stopping antibiotics, ideally incorporating PCT trends to support discontinuation once the clinical trajectory is favorable and source control is adequate [^5a5d94dc] [^417908ab].

> Hold on, I should verify how to use PCT to guide duration rather than initiation. Multiple RCTs and meta-analyses support using PCT algorithms to shorten antibiotic duration in sepsis, with stopping rules such as a decrease to less than 0.5 ng/mL or a reduction of at least 80% from peak, provided the patient is clinically improving and source control is achieved. The ADAPT-Sepsis RCT showed a modest reduction in antibiotic days without harm, reinforcing that PCT is most useful for de-escalation rather than withholding initial therapy [^3cdcc0e7] [^fc061dcb] [^5a5d94dc].

> I should double-check special populations and caveats. In febrile neutropenia, PCT is specific but not sensitive, so a high PCT supports infection and should prompt escalation, but a normal PCT does not exclude infection and should not delay antibiotics. In COVID-19, elevated PCT may reflect severity rather than bacterial coinfection, so I should avoid reflex antibiotics and instead use clinical judgment plus cultures. In acute liver failure, PCT is unreliable for infection surveillance, so I should not rely on it to guide therapy [^ca262e0c] [^a0bbd0eb] [^880c9719].

> Let me reconsider the synthesis to ensure internal consistency. Pancytopenia with elevated procalcitonin most often indicates bacterial infection superimposed on marrow suppression, but I must actively exclude viral causes and noninfectious inflammatory states that can elevate PCT. Therefore, I should act on a high PCT by treating presumed bacterial infection when clinically indicated, use PCT trends to support shorter antibiotic courses once the patient stabilizes, and never use a normal PCT to withhold antibiotics in a high-risk pancytopenic patient, aligning with sepsis and stewardship guidelines [^b91d9cd1] [^5a5d94dc] [^6f9eaefa].

Pancytopenia with elevated procalcitonin most often reflects **severe bacterial or fungal infection** (sepsis, pneumonia, or bloodstream infection) in the setting of bone marrow suppression from chemotherapy, malignancy, or marrow failure [^b91d9cd1] [^ca262e0c]. Procalcitonin rises within 4–6 hours of bacterial exposure and correlates with infection severity, but it can also be elevated in noninfectious inflammatory states (e.g. severe trauma, surgery, burns, or drug reactions) and in some viral illnesses, so results must be interpreted in clinical context [^69967f97] [^1488f93f] [^a0bbd0eb]. In immunocompromised or febrile neutropenic patients, **PCT helps identify bacterial infection and guide antibiotic decisions**, but a normal PCT does not exclude infection, so clinical judgment remains essential [^ca262e0c] [^bdce3c3e]. Management should prioritize early empiric antibiotics, source control, and hematology support, with PCT trends used to tailor antibiotic duration once the patient stabilizes [^5a5d94dc] [^6f9eaefa].

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking pancytopenia and elevated procalcitonin

Pancytopenia arises from **impaired hematopoiesis** (marrow failure, infiltration, or suppression), **peripheral destruction** (autoimmunity, hypersplenism), or **sequestration** (splenomegaly). Elevated procalcitonin reflects bacterial toxin–driven CALC gene expression in extra-thyroid tissues, rising within 4–6 hours and peaking at 6–8 hours; it is less responsive to viral or noninfectious inflammation, though exceptions exist [^69967f97] [^5d5cec61].

## Clinical conditions associated with pancytopenia and elevated procalcitonin

| **Clinical condition** | **Mechanism of pancytopenia** | **Mechanism of elevated procalcitonin** |
|-|-|-|
| Severe bacterial sepsis | Bone marrow suppression, consumption, immune-mediated destruction | Bacterial endotoxin-driven PCT synthesis |
| Fungal infections (e.g. invasive aspergillosis) | Bone marrow suppression, immune-mediated destruction | Fungal cell wall components triggering innate immunity |
| Hematologic malignancies (e.g. leukemia, lymphoma) | Bone marrow infiltration, chemotherapy-induced suppression | Secondary bacterial infections due to immunosuppression |
| Severe viral infections (e.g. COVID-19, EBV) | Immune-mediated destruction, bone marrow suppression | Severe viral illness can elevate PCT via cytokine storms |
| Severe drug reactions (e.g. DRESS, SJS) | Immune-mediated destruction, bone marrow suppression | Noninfectious inflammation triggering PCT |
| Severe trauma or surgery | Consumption, bone marrow suppression | Noninfectious systemic inflammation |

---

## Diagnostic implications and clinical approach

- **Initial evaluation**: Confirm pancytopenia with repeat CBC, peripheral smear, and reticulocyte count; assess for infection with cultures, imaging, and clinical exam [^notfound].
- **Procalcitonin interpretation**: PCT > 0.5 ng/mL suggests bacterial infection; levels > 2 ng/mL indicate severe bacterial infection or sepsis; trends are more informative than single values [^69967f97] [^5a5d94dc].
- **Limitations**: PCT can be falsely elevated in noninfectious inflammation and falsely low in localized infections or early viral illness; always interpret in clinical context [^1488f93f] [^a0bbd0eb].
- **Additional tests**: Bone marrow biopsy may be needed if hematologic malignancy or marrow failure is suspected; viral PCR, fungal assays, and autoimmune panels may be indicated based on context [^e531f42a].

---

## Management strategies

- **Empiric antibiotics**: Start broad-spectrum antibiotics promptly in febrile neutropenia or suspected sepsis, then de-escalate based on cultures and clinical response [^notfound].
- **Source control**: Identify and treat the source of infection (e.g. drain abscess, remove infected device) [^5a5d94dc].
- **Hematologic support**: Transfuse RBCs and platelets as indicated; consider growth factors (e.g. G-CSF) in neutropenia.
- **PCT-guided therapy**: Use PCT trends to shorten antibiotic duration once the patient stabilizes and source control is achieved, reducing resistance and adverse effects [^3cdcc0e7] [^5a5d94dc].

---

## Prognostic significance

Elevated procalcitonin in pancytopenic patients is associated with **higher severity of illness**, ICU admission, and mortality. PCT kinetics correlate with treatment response and can inform prognosis when tracked serially [^e5939f70] [^5d5cec61].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

- **Noninfectious elevations**: Trauma, surgery, burns, and severe drug reactions can elevate PCT without infection [^1488f93f].
- **Viral infections**: Severe viral illnesses (e.g. COVID-19) can elevate PCT, reducing specificity [^a0bbd0eb].
- **Immunocompromised patients**: PCT may be blunted or atypical in neutropenia or immunosuppression, limiting reliability [^00e71f71].

---

Pancytopenia with elevated procalcitonin most often signals **severe bacterial or fungal infection** in the setting of marrow suppression, but PCT must be interpreted in clinical context. Early empiric antibiotics, source control, and hematology support are essential, with PCT trends used to guide antibiotic duration and improve outcomes.

### Procalcitonin and other markers of infection. what should be their role in clinical practice? [^7720287d]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2002). Low credibility.

Clinicians are always faced with a decision when confronted with a febrile patient; they must decide between what is an infectious condition and what is not, and between what merits hospital observation, what requires empirical antibiotic treatment and what needs outpatient follow-up. In this respect, judgement based on medical history and physical examination outweigh the predictive value of various laboratory markers of infection, as the latter generally reflect a nonspecific reaction of the host to widely different infectious and inflammatory stimuli. In the evaluation of specific subgroups of patients, e.g. those in the intensive care unit, laboratory tests should also preferably form a continuum with medical history and physical examination, aimed at clarifying host condition, the setting and the source of a possible infection.

### Use of plasma procalcitonin levels as an adjunct to clinical microbiology [^b3425cbc]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2010). Low credibility.

Procalcitonin (PCT) is synthesized by a large number of tissues and organs in response to invasion by pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and some parasites. Current PCT assays are rapid, specific, and of sufficient sensitivity to detect increases in PCT serum levels within 4 to 6 h of initiation of infection. Clinically, PCT levels may help in decisions regarding the need for empirical antibiotic therapy, "source control" of infection, and duration of antibiotic therapy. The addition of PCT levels to bacterial culture and viral detection results can assist with the separation of colonization and invasion by pathogenic bacteria.

### Neglected variables in the interpretation of serum procalcitonin levels in patients with septic shock [^5d5cec61]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The interpretation of serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels in septic patients is facilitated by reviewing the known stimuli that activate the PCT family of genes. Herein we describe 7 pathways that, alone or in combination, can increase serum PCT levels. As a marker of activation of innate immunity, high PCT levels affect clinical diagnosis, can be trended as a measure of "source" control, and can guide duration of antibacterial therapy in septic patients. Low PCT levels reflect little to no activation of an innate immune response, influence the differential diagnosis, and support the discontinuation of empiric antibiotic therapy. Understanding the pathways that result in elevated serum PCT levels is necessary for interpretation and subsequent clinical management.

Are PCT limitations addressed?

In addition, another important limitation of PCT use is related to the lack of information on specific conditions and populations where its value is inadequate because of intrinsic constraints. In critically ill patients the presence of acute kidney injury or the use of renal replacement therapies has a profound effect on PCT concentrations. Additionally, PCT tends to be less responsive to repeated inflammatory insults (such as VAP or nosocomial bloodstream infections), resulting in lower than expected peak concentrations. Similar findings are described in neutropenic patients, limiting the interpretation and use of PCT in this context.

Conclusion

Within the context of febrile adult patients presenting to an ED, PCT assay at a 0.2 μg/l threshold can help physicians to identify bacterial/parasitic infections. Whether this can back up therapeutic decisions must be investigated in interventional studies. PCT measurement in the emergency room could contribute to the early identification of critical illness. Emergency febrile patients with PCT above 5 μg/l should be carefully monitored to identify severe sepsis or septic shock criteria.

Key messages

- PCT is the first laboratory marker among a large array of inflammatory variables that offers the possibility to differentiate bacterial infection from viral or non-infectious inflammatory reaction.

- PCT assessment provides a helpful tool to decide on the duration of antibiotic treatment, if interpreted in the clinical context including the underlying disease.

- PCT-based algorithm supports the cautious use of antibiotics and has a favourable effect on the clinical outcome.

- PCT-based algorithm is certainly practicable and simple.

- PCT-controlled antibiotic therapy must still be tested in heterogenous groups of patients, particularly for safety.

### Using procalcitonin to guide antimicrobial duration in sepsis: asking the same questions will not bring different answers [^d677d785]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

To achieve safe and efficient short-course antimicrobial therapy in severe sepsis we propose an algorithm that may aid clinicians in their decision-making process (Figure 1). Using such a protocol, which remains to be validated in multicenter studies, we would be applying two very sound and validated concepts: patients with a fast response pattern to antibiotic therapy (early and substantial decrease in biomarker levels) have better outcomes; and most cases of severe infections may be treated with 7 days of antibiotic therapy.

Figure 1
Use of C-reactive protein and procalcitonin to guide antimicrobial therapy in critically ill patients. C-reactive protein (CRP) was tested only in a single center trial with predominantly medical ICU patients. This flowchart does not apply to immune-compromised patients (for example, febrile neutropenia) or to patients with infections requiring long-term antibiotic therapy (for example, infectious endocarditis, cerebral abscess, bacteremia due to Staphylococcus aureus). £ Most trials investigating procalcitonin (PCT)-guided protocols tested the role of this marker in guiding the decision of antibiotic interruption. Initiating antibiotics for all critically ill patients with suspected infection is probably the safest decision, regardless the levels of laboratory biomarkers. However, this decision must be reassessed daily. PCT and CRP are proposed as additional tools to diagnose infection, and different cutoff levels have been proposed in the literature. Consider stopping antibiotics before day 7 in patients with no proven infection (for example, negative cultures) regardless the levels of CRP or PCT. SOFA, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment.

### Potential use of procalcitonin as a diagnostic criterion in febrile neutropenia: experience from a multicentre study [^c720ced0]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2004). Low credibility.

In order to assess the diagnostic value of procalcitonin, 158 patients with febrile neutropenia from centres across Europe were studied. Patients with fever were diagnosed on the basis of either: (1) clinical, radiological and microbiological criteria; or (2) the procalcitonin value. In the latter case, concentrations of 0.5–1.0 ng/mL were considered diagnostic of localised infection, concentrations of 1.0–5.0 ng/mL of bacteraemia, and concentrations of > 5.0 ng/mL of severe sepsis. Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein were estimated daily in serum by immunochemiluminescence and nephelometry, respectively. Overall, the sensitivity (specificity) of procalcitonin for bacteraemia was 44.2% (64.3%) at concentrations of 1.0–5.0 ng/mL, and 83.3% (100%) for severe sepsis at concentrations of > 5.0 ng/mL. It was concluded that procalcitonin is a marker strongly suggestive of severe sepsis at concentrations of > 5.0 ng/mL. Estimated concentrations of < 0.5 ng/mL indicate that infection is unlikely, but it was observed that bacteraemia associated with coagulase-negative staphylococci may fail to elevate serum procalcitonin levels.

### Assessment of procalcitonin as a diagnostic marker of underlying infection in patients with febrile neutropenia [^565f4cfa]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

The novel inflammatory marker procalcitonin (PCT) was assessed as an index of infection in patients with febrile neutropenia. Blood samples were obtained from 115 patients with febrile neutropenia for determination of PCT levels before onset of fever and daily until the resolution of fever. The median PCT level on the first day of fever was 8.23 ng/mL in patients with bacteremia, compared with 0.86 ng/mL in patients with localized bacterial infections (P = 0.017). The median PCT level on the first day of fever was 2.62 ng/mL in patients with severe sepsis, compared with 0.57 ng/mL in patients with clinically localized infections (P < .001). A dramatic decrease in PCT levels was documented after resolution of the infection; PCT levels were elevated when the infection worsened. Pronounced PCT levels were also found in patients with fever of unknown origin who were responding to antimicrobial chemotherapy, compared with those not responding to treatment with antibiotics. PCT levels were particularly elevated in patients with bacteremia and severe sepsis. These findings provide new insight into the application of PCT in clinical trials as a diagnostic tool of the severity of an infection in patients with febrile neutropenia and of the need to change antimicrobial regimen.

### Serum procalcitonin measurement as diagnostic and prognostic marker in febrile adult patients presenting to the emergency department [^61c073a9]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Key messages

- The optimal PCT threshold in adult febrile patients in the ED may be 0.2 μg/l.

- PCT is an independent variable that can predict whether a febrile episode has a bacterial origin.

- PCT, at a threshold of 2 μg/l, is independently associated with critical illness.

### Role of procalcitonin in the management of infected patients in the intensive care unit [^6b16c44c]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The combination of molecular pathogen diagnostics and the biomarker procalcitonin (PCT) are changing the use of antimicrobials in patients admitted to critical care units with severe community-acquired pneumonia, possible septic shock, or other clinical syndromes. An elevated serum PCT level is good supportive evidence of a bacterial pneumonia, whereas a low serum PCT level virtually eliminates an etiologic role for bacteria even if the culture for a potential bacterial pathogen is positive. Serum PCT levels can be increased in any shocklike state; a low PCT level eliminates invasive bacterial infection as an etiology in more than 90% of patients.

### Procalcitonin to guide duration of antibiotic therapy in intensive care patients: a randomized prospective controlled trial [^dca0b9cc]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusions

PCT assessment provides a helpful tool to decide on the duration of antibiotic treatment, if interpreted in the clinical context including the underlying disease. This can substantially improve to determine adequate duration of antibiotic therapy with favorable effects on resistance and intensive care costs.

### Procalcitonin: seeking a niche [^fedaf9bf]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

For over a decade there has been intense interest given to the role of procalcitonin in the diagnosis and management of sepsis in critically ill patients. Early opinions strongly supported the diagnostic role but data accumulating from numerous subsequent studies are less supportive, even when used in very selective settings. Although there remains sufficient reason to support the use of procalcitonin in guiding antibiotic therapy or perhaps providing prognostic information, it may be time to focus our efforts on the early diagnosis of sepsis in the critically care setting on alternative, more promising methods.

### Procalcitonin in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [^dd550d08]. The Journal of Infection (2004). Low credibility.

Objective and Methods

The role of procalcitonin (PCT) in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has not been highlighted so far. We described retrospectively eight cases of sepsis from pneumonia of various microbiological aetiologies including two due to SARS, compared their PCT concentrations and provided further descriptors of SARS as a viral pneumonia.

Results

Like any viral pneumonia, patients with SARS had low PCT levels in contrast to bacterial or fungal pneumonia.

Conclusions

In the setting of pneumonia with a finding of low PCT, testing for SARS should be considered, especially if there is a positive travel or contact history. During a SARS epidemic, we also strongly advocate isolating all suspected community acquired pneumonia with a low PCT level.

### Procalcitonin for diagnosis of infection and guide to antibiotic decisions: past, present and future [^64ca917b]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Limitations and areas of uncertainty

Sepsis is not a well-defined disease, but a consequence of different infectious disease entities and far too complex to be reduced to a single cut-off of any surrogate marker. Limitations of every PCT measurement include false-positive and false-negative results. Different pathogens might induce distinct responses resulting in a variable up-regulation of circulating PCT levels. While highly elevated PCT levels were found in patients with pneumococcal CAP, the same was not true in CAP due to atypical organisms such as mycoplasma. Antimicrobial pre-treatment may influence the level of PCT resulting in lower PCT levels, although it remains unclear whether this relates to a direct effect or rather to lower microbial burden in patients treated with antibiotics. Unspecific elevations of PCT levels in the absence of a bacterial infection can typically be seen in situations of massive stress, for example after severe trauma and surgery or in patients after cardiac shock. Although the available evidence from intervention studies favors the use of PCT for de-escalation of antibiotic therapy, the same may not be true for escalation of antibiotics when PCT increases as recently demonstrated. In this study PCT-guided escalation of diagnostic procedures and antibiotic therapy in the ICU did not improve survival and led to worse secondary outcomes in patients.

### Exploring the clinical value of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in the early diagnosis of bloodstream infections in children [^29ea03ee]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The combination of PCT and CRP can offer valuable complementary insights for the etiological diagnosis of pediatric BSI. Elevated levels of both PCT and CRP are frequently indicative of fungal or Gram-negative bacterial infections, with PCT demonstrating particularly noteworthy implications. However, the utility of WBC and NLR in differentiating the pathogen classification of pediatric BSI is currently limited. The combined utilization of serum PCT, CRP, WBC, and NLR testing can improve the diagnostic sensitivity of pediatric BSI, reducing the likelihood of missed diagnoses, thereby enhancing the early diagnostic value of pediatric BSI.

### The diagnostic role of procalcitonin and other biomarkers in discriminating infectious from non-infectious fever [^17524f23]. The Journal of Infection (2010). Low credibility.

Fever is not only observed in the course of a bacterial or viral infection, but can be a symptom of, for instance, auto-immune, malignant or thromboembolic disease. Determining the etiology of fever in a fast and reliable way is of pivotal importance, as different causes of fever may ask for different therapies. Neither clinical signs and symptoms, nor traditional biomarkers, such as CRP, leukocytes and ESR have sufficient sensitivity and specificity to guide treatment decisions. In this review we focus on the value of traditional and newer biomarkers in non-infectious febrile diseases. Procalcitonin (PCT) seems to be the most helpful laboratory marker for the differentiation of causes of fever, particularly in autoimmune, autoinflammatory and malignant diseases.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^9b04ea81]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 guideline — laboratory markers and antibiotic stewardship: the use of procalcitonin in a group of hospitals was not effective as a tool to encourage antibiotic discontinuation compared to clinical judgment. Mason and colleagues compared hospitalized cohorts of 619 patients with COVID-19 and 106 with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) and found marked differences in white blood cell counts (6.78 COVID-19 vs. 12.48 CABP) and that CRP declined in 48–72 hours with antibiotic therapy in the CABP cohort but not the COVID-19 group, suggesting these findings can guide discontinuation when antibiotics are initiated empirically in COVID-19. Initiating and continuing empiric antibiotics at admission may lead to resistant superinfections; one study found antibiotic use in the first two days of admission for COVID-19 to be a risk factor for superinfection. Immunomodulatory therapies are recommended for many patients with severe and critical illness from COVID-19, including corticosteroids, IL-6 antagonists, and JAK inhibitors.

Review of systems was notable for fatigue and negative for fever, night sweats, weight loss, dyspnea, or abnormal bleeding. Examination revealed temperature of 36. 7°C; heart rate, 91/min; blood pressure, 120/70 mm Hg; and body mass index, 20.

1. He was well-appearing with conjunctival pallor but no petechiae, no hepatosplenomegaly, and a normal neurologic examination. Laboratory evaluation showed a white blood cell count of 1.7 × 10³/μL with an absolute neutrophil count of
0.17 × 10³/μL; hemoglobin level, 7 g/dL with mean corpuscular volume of 103 fL; and platelet count, 116 × 10³/μL. Histopathologic examination of bone marrow aspirate from patient.

Check serum trace element levels, including iron, copper, and zinc Obtain periodic outpatient complete blood cell counts and treat with supportive transfusions as clinically indicated. Workup for nutritional deficiency should be performed before serologic and endoscopic evaluation for celiac disease. In this patient, iron and zinc levels were normal; however, serum copper level was less than 5 µg/dL. In asymptomatic cases of pancytopenia due to copper deficiency, a trial of copper repletion should precede treatment with blood transfusions or erythropoiesis-stimulating agent. Patient Outcome Supplementation was initiated with oral copper gluconate. Within 2 months, serum copper level normalized and blood counts improved.

The copper gluconate dosage was subsequently reduced and maintained at 2 mg daily without recurrence of cytopenias.

### A systematic review of clinical and laboratory parameters associated with increased severity among COVID-19 patients [^6b13616c]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been an extremely difficult pandemic to contain and it has affected more than 148 countries worldwide. The main aim of this systematic review is to provide a comprehensive summary of clinical and laboratory parameters that are associated with and indicative of increased severity among COVID-19 patients.

Material and Methods

All the available data from high-quality research articles relevant to the epidemiology, demographics, trends in hospitalization and outcomes, clinical signs and symptoms, diagnostic methods and treatment methods of COVID-19 were retrieved and evaluated for inclusion.

Results

As per our review, the mean age of patients in the severe group was 59.3 years compared to 46.5 years in non severe group. COVID-19 was more severe among men than women. Clinical presentation was variable among different studies. and dyspnea was the factor indicating severe disease. Laboratory parameters associated with increased severity were lymphopenia < 0.8 × 10⁹/L, thrombocytopenia 100 × 10⁹/L, leucocytosis TC > 11 × 10⁹/L, procalcitonin > 0.5 ng/mL, d dimer > 2 mcg/mL, aspartate transaminase elevation > 150U/L, LDH > 250U/L.

Conclusion

This systematic review suggests that COVID-19 is a disease with varied clinical presentation and laboratory parameters. The commonest clinical symptoms were fever, cough and dyspnea. The laboratory parameters associated with severe disease were lymphopenia, elevated LDH, D dimer and Procalcitonin.

Arch Dermatol. 2007; 143: 1589–1603. doi: 10.1001/archderm.143.12.1591-a © 2025 Although procalcitonin serum level is still considered to be a highly specific and sensitive biologic marker of severe bacterial infections, it can be increased in noninfectious situations such as diffuse metastatic solid cancers, 1 C-cell carcinoma of the thyroid gland, 2 major trauma or surgery, 3, 4 or after cardiopulmonary bypass. 5 Herein we show that PCT level increases in some patients with severe drug reactions. Clinicians should therefore not rely on PCT values to discriminate between infectious and immunoallergic eruptions in patients who present with fever and a rash. We investigated 8 consecutive patients with a severe cutaneous drug eruption.

Four patients had Stevens-Johnson syndrome; 2 had drug rash, eosinophilia, and systemic symptoms syndrome; 1 had acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis; and 1 had Lyell syndrome. The diagnosis of drug eruption was based on clinical, biologic, and histologic findings. In all cases, investigations including routine biology tests, blood cultures, urinary bacterial examination, pulmonary radiography, and serology failed to identify any bacterial or viral agent. Procalcitonin levels were significantly elevated in 2 patients, one with DRESS and the other with SJS. All patients healed within a mean of 25 days without any antibiotic treatment. Our findings suggest that in some patients with severe drug eruptions, PCT level can be elevated in the absence of bacterial infection.

Thus, elevated PCT levels neither predict infection in patients with severe drug rashes nor allow discrimination between infectious and noninfectious eruptions.

COVID-19 inflammatory markers — interpretation for bacterial or fungal coinfection. Elevated inflammatory markers in COVID-19 may reflect immune dysregulation and have been incorrectly interpreted as indicating bacterial coinfection; COVID-19 without bacterial or fungal infection causes elevations in white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and sedimentation rate, and procalcitonin frequently reflects severe COVID-19 rather than bacterial coinfection, contributing to antibiotic overuse when these laboratory abnormalities are used to initiate or continue antibiotics.

Regarding inpatient care for hospital-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to laboratory monitoring, ALAT/ERS/ESCMID/ESICM 2017 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining serial measurements of procalcitonin levels together with clinical assessment in the following clinical circumstances with the aim of reducing antibiotic treatment duration:

- initially inappropriate antibiotic therapy

- severely immunocompromised patients (such as neutropenia or stem cell transplant)

- highly antibiotic-resistant pathogens (P. aeruginosa, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter species, Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae)

- second-line antibiotic therapy (such as colistin and tigecycline).

Severe sepsis is a major healthcare problem and the early initiation of antimicrobials is one of the few measures associated with improved outcomes. However, antibiotic overuse is an increasing problem in critical care. Of several potential biomarkers for antibiotic stewardship, procalcitonin represents the most widely studied and validated. In this commentary we address the current literature on the use of biomarkers to guide antimicrobial therapy in the critically ill and discuss its limitations and future directions.

Prediction of critical illness

At 30 days of follow up, 55 patients presented with critical illness (31 admissions to the ICU and 30 deaths, including six patients admitted to the ICU). Two of the six patients with bacterial infections, initially admitted to a medical bed and transferred within the 48 subsequent hours to the ICU, had a PCT level above 5 μg/l (8.53 μg/l and 282 μg/l). Similarly, three patients with bacterial infection were initially admitted to a medical bed and died suddenly before day two. None of these patients had co-morbidity that could have restricted ICU transfer (for instance, end-stage cancer or severe neurodegenerative disease) and all three had PCT concentrations above 5 μg/l (5.8, 36 and 316 μg/l). Univariate analysis showed that age, body temperature, white blood cell count, C-reactive protein and PCT were significantly greater in patients with critical illness, as were associated immunocompromised status and altered haemodynamic or renal function at ED assessment. Stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that three variables were significantly associated with critical illness: PCT of 2 μg/l or greater, heart rate above 120 beats/min, and creatininaemia of 120 μmol/l or greater (Table 4). Moreover, there was a correlation between the magnitude of elevation in PCT and the likelihood of subsequent critical illness or death (Figure 3). Indeed, 51% of patients with PCT concentrations of 5 μg/l or greater were deceased at day 30 or admitted to the ICU, as compared with 13% of patients in whom PCT concentration was not elevated.

### Uses of procalcitonin as a biomarker in critical care medicine [^a978bd3b]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Procalcitonin is a commonly used biomarker for infection and severity in the intensive care unit. Although relatively specific for bacterial, as opposed to viral, infections, serum procalcitonin levels also correlate with disease severity and thus cannot reliably distinguish between bacterial and nonbacterial infections in the setting of critical illness, particularly in cases of severe influenza and coronavirus disease-2019. Baseline procalcitonin levels are insufficiently discriminative to permit the withholding of antibiotics in patients with critical illness and suspected sepsis. Trends in procalcitonin levels over time, however, give us the opportunity to individualize the duration of antibiotics without negative impacts on mortality.

### Biomarkers in sepsis: can they help improve patient outcome? [^e8b1cfe6]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Biomarkers, mainly procalcitonin, are commonly used in sepsis diagnosis, prognosis and treatment follow-up. This review summarizes the potential benefit of their use for the critically ill.

Recent Findings

Increased clinical evidence from randomized clinical trials of biomarker-guided treatment suggests a trend for appropriate but short antimicrobial treatment for the critically ill. Procalcitonin (PCT) is the most studied biomarker; in the majority of randomized clinical trials, the use of a stopping rule of antibiotics on the day when PCT is below 80% from baseline or less than 0.5ng/ml was proven effective to reduce length of antimicrobial treatment, antibiotic-associated adverse events and infectious complications like infections by multidrug-resistant organisms and Clostridium difficile. Survival benefit was also noted.

Summary

Biomarkers, mainly PCT, may help improve sepsis outcome by restriction of injudicious antimicrobial use.

### Biomarker-guided antibiotic duration for hospitalized patients with suspected sepsis: the ADAPT-sepsis randomized clinical trial [^3cdcc0e7]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study ADAPT-Sepsis (procalcitonin-guided) was published by Paul Dark and colleagues in 2025 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Sepsis and septic shock. In the ADAPT-Sepsis (procalcitonin-guided) study, the trial question was: what is the role of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic duration in hospitalized patients with suspected sepsis? In the ADAPT-Sepsis (procalcitonin-guided) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the ADAPT-Sepsis (procalcitonin-guided) study, the population was: 1836 patients (729 female, 1107 male). The inclusion criteria were hospitalized critically ill adults who have been commenced on intravenous antibiotics for sepsis. The key exclusion criteria were requirement of prolonged antibiotic therapy; severe immunocompromised state from a cause other than sepsis; expected to receive IL-6 receptor inhibitors during acute hospital admission; sepsis treatments likely to stop within 24 hours because of futility. In the ADAPT-Sepsis (procalcitonin-guided) study, the interventions were: n = 918 daily PCT-guided protocol (daily serum procalcitonin measurement until antibiotic discontinuation plus standard care) n = 918 standard care (no procalcitonin testing). In the ADAPT-Sepsis (procalcitonin-guided) study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in total antibiotic treatment duration to 28 days (9.8 days vs. 10.7 days; MD -0.88, 95% CI -1.58 to -0.19). In the ADAPT-Sepsis (procalcitonin-guided) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in antibiotic treatment duration for initial sepsis period (7 days vs. 8.1 days; MD -1.13, 95% CI -1.68 to -0.58) No significant difference in ≥ 1 event of unscheduled care escalation or readmission (23.4% vs. 26.2%; ARD -2.8, 95% CI -6.76 to 1.16) No significant difference in death at day 90 (25.6% vs. 25.5%; AD 0.09%, 95% CI -4.08 to 4.29). In the ADAPT-Sepsis (procalcitonin-guided) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in death at day 28, serious adverse events. In the ADAPT-Sepsis (procalcitonin-guided) study, the conclusion was: in hospitalized critically ill adults who have been commenced on intravenous antibiotics for sepsis, daily PCT-guided protocol was superior to standard care with respect to total antibiotic treatment duration to 28 days.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^9709078f]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Sepsis and septic shock — procalcitonin-guided discontinuation of antimicrobials is supported by evidence from 14 randomized controlled trials (RCTs; n = 4,499 patients) assessing use of procalcitonin to guide duration, with a meta-analysis reporting improved mortality (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.99) and no effect on length of stay in ICU or hospital; antibiotic exposure was consistently lower though in many trials the total duration of therapy was still 7 days or longer, and the overall quality of evidence was judged to be low. Based on apparent benefit and no obvious undesirable effects, we suggest using procalcitonin along with clinical evaluation to decide when to discontinue antimicrobials in adults with an initial diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and adequate source control, if the optimal duration of therapy is unclear and if procalcitonin is available.

### Biomarkers and outcomes of COVID-19 hospitalisations: systematic review and meta-analysis [^48a3ced4]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Objective

To evaluate association between biomarkers and outcomes in COVID-19 hospitalised patients. COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge. Biomarkers have always played an important role in clinical decision making in various infectious diseases. It is crucial to assess the role of biomarkers in evaluating severity of disease and appropriate allocation of resources.

Design and Setting

Systematic review and meta-analysis. English full text observational studies describing the laboratory findings and outcomes of COVID-19 hospitalised patients were identified searching PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, medRxiv using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms COVID-19 OR coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2 OR 2019-nCoV from 1 December 2019 to 15 August 2020 following Meta-analyses Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines.

Participants

Studies having biomarkers, including lymphocyte, platelets, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine, procalcitonin (PCT) and creatine kinase (CK), and describing outcomes were selected with the consensus of three independent reviewers.

Main Outcome Measures

Composite poor outcomes include intensive care unit admission, oxygen saturation < 90%, invasive mechanical ventilation utilisation, severe disease, in-hospital admission and mortality. The OR and 95%CI were obtained and forest plots were created using random-effects models. Publication bias and heterogeneity were assessed by sensitivity analysis.

Results

32 studies with 10491 confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. We found that lymphopenia (pooled-OR: 3.33 (95% CI: 2.51–4.41); p < 0.00001), thrombocytopenia (2.36 (1.64–3.40); p < 0.00001), elevated D-dimer (3.39 (2.66–4.33); p < 0.00001), elevated CRP (4.37 (3.37–5.68); p < 0.00001), elevated PCT (6.33 (4.24–9.45); p < 0.00001), elevated CK (2.42 (1.35–4.32); p = 0.003), elevated AST (2.75 (2.30–3.29); p < 0.00001), elevated ALT (1.71 (1.32–2.20); p < 0.00001), elevated creatinine (2.84 (1.80–4.46); p < 0.00001) and LDH (5.48 (3.89–7.71); p < 0.00001) were independently associated with higher risk of poor outcomes.

Conclusion

Our study found a significant association between lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and elevated levels of CRP, PCT, LDH, D-dimer and COVID-19 severity. The results have the potential to be used as an early biomarker to improve the management of COVID-19 patients, by identification of high-risk patients and appropriate allocation of healthcare resources in the pandemic.

Procalcitonin (PCT) in adult ICU patients — test characteristics and kinetics: PCT is described as a precursor hormone of calcitonin produced by parafollicular thyroid and neuroendocrine lung and intestinal cells that may help discriminate bacterial from viral and noninfectious etiologies; however, it may be elevated during severe viral illness including influenza and COVID-19, potentially reducing discriminative power. PCT begins to rise four hours after exposure to bacteria, reaching a maximum level after six to eight hours; serum levels are associated with infection severity and decrease rapidly after antibiotic treatment. Test results are usually available within one hour with point-of-care devices or routine laboratories, and values in healthy individuals are less than 0.05 ng/mL.

### The utility of procalcitonin in febrile neutropenia… [^bdce3c3e]. ASCO (2024). Medium credibility.

PCT, an amino acid, is elevated specifically during bacterial infections in the non-cancer population and correlates with infection severity. Clinicians employ PCT levels as a diagnostic adjunct, discerning bacterial from viral infections and analyzing PCT changes to guide treatment decisions. We examined oncology patients presenting with FN to correlate PCT levels and trends with confirmed infections. Baseline and highest PCT levels were compared by patient and disease characteristics and proven infection using Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. Logistic regression was used to determine the association of log-transformed PCT with proven infection while adjusting for covariates. All tests were two-tailed with p < 0. 05 considered statistically significant. Results: Of 365 patients, 61 had an identified infection. Median baseline and peak PCT of 1. 26 and

1.

51 ng/mL, respectively, were significantly greater for these patients as compared to those with negative cultures at 0. 54 and
0. 65 ng/mL, respectively. For every unit increase in the log transformed baseline PCT, the odds of having a proven infection increased by 23%. There were no significant differences in patient or clinical characteristics between those with and without infection. Of those admitted for induction chemotherapy and transplant who developed FN, PCT at time of initial fever was higher at 0. 97 vs
0. 56 ng/mL. Interestingly, median baseline and median peak PCT differed between gender with females 0. 51 and males
0. 72 ng/mL at baseline, and 0. 63 vs
0. 83 ng/mL, respectively, at peak. Conclusions: PCT levels in cancer patients with FN are significantly associated with culture positive infection. This data can help guide treatment and de-escalation of antibiotics in cancer patients admitted with FN.

Further evaluation should be taken to determine how to best use PCT to determine the need for admission and antibiotic prescription. Altmetric Citations Article CitationThe utility of procalcitonin in febrile neutropenia. JCO 42, 12040–12040.

### Clinical value of procalcitonin in critically ill patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 [^224e0777]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background Blood procalcitonin (PCT) levels usually increase during infectious diseases and might be helpful to differentiate bacterial from non-bacterial origin. COVID-19 patients could present co-infections at initial presentation in the Emergency Department and nosocomial infections during stay in the ICU. However, the published literature has not established whether PCT changes could aid in the diagnosis of infectious complication during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Retrospective, single-center, cohort study, including COVID-19 patients admitted between March and May 2020. The data were prospectively collected for department purposes; laboratory results were collected automatically at admission and during the whole patient admission. Results 56 patients were analyzed (female 32%, male 68%), 35 were admitted to ICU, and 21 received general ward care. 21 ICU patients underwent mechanical ventilation (88%), and 9 died during admission (26%).

Conclusion

An approach along a biomarker-guided treatment algorithm using procalcitonin levels may be helpful to guide antimicrobial treatment in severe sepsis patients, treated in ICUs and reduces the duration of antimicrobial therapy without an obvious increase in mortality. However, more research is urgently needed to investigate the safety and effectiveness in subgroups of surgical and medical severe sepsis patients, treated in ICUs. Most importantly, treatment algorithms differ substantially and have to be clarified in future studies.

### Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein to rule out early bacterial coinfection in COVID-19 critically ill patients [^bd4a9fdd]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Third, in the subgroup analysis we considered the variable "time since symptoms onset", which is necessarily self-reported, dependent on the subjective perception of symptoms and therefore susceptible to bias; however, the exact onset of symptoms is not otherwise objectifiable for a community-acquired infection.

Fourth, we acknowledge limitations associated to the retrospective design of the study and the plausible influence on our results of selecting patients from different waves of the pandemic, as well as those connected to the observational nature of the study and missing data. Particularly, in our population the rate of missing values was higher for PCT when compared with CRP, as the former is not routinely measured. The impact of PCT-based algorithms on antibiotic sparing, and therefore their cost-effectiveness, is still debated; the decision to measure PCT is normally based on the clinician request, introducing a possible bias in observational studies involving this biomarker. However, we have adjusted all of our analyses for these confounders.

Finally, our results bring new interesting aspects to the interpretation of biomarkers in the context of bacterial coinfection, but they refer to COVID-19 patients and may not be applicable in other clinical settings.

### Effect of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic treatment on clinical outcomes in intensive care unit patients with infection and sepsis patients: a patient-level meta-analysis of randomized trials [^e6bb2351]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, PCT-guided antibiotic treatment in ICU patients with infection results in improved survival and shorter antibiotic treatment duration. Effects were similar in sepsis patients and among subgroups based on sepsis severity, sepsis treatment modalities, and type of infection. Whether the reduction in antibiotic exposure fully explains the mortality effects seen in our data needs to be investigated in future trials. These findings have substantial clinical and public health implications.

### Serum procalcitonin measurement as diagnostic and prognostic marker in febrile adult patients presenting to the emergency department [^09db22c3]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Accurate identification of bacterial aetiology of fever in patients attending the emergency department (ED) is a desirable objective but it is often unattainable, largely because signs and symptoms of bacterial and viral infections overlap considerably. Delay in identifying pathogens from specimen cultures adds to the difficulty in establishing an aetiological diagnosis in the ED and leads to inappropriate use of antibiotics. In addition, estimation of the severity of bacterial infection is mostly based on the presence of characteristics suggestive of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, which may not be apparent when the patient is seen early in the course of the infection.

Procalcitonin (PCT) concentration is raised in the serum of patients with severe bacterial infection. The primary objective of our study was to test the efficiency of PCT in identifying bacterial/parasitic episodes among febrile adult patients presenting to an ED. Secondary objectives were to identify clinical or biological variables associated with either bacterial or parasitic infection, and to identify clinical or biological variables associated with critical illness during the febrile episode.

### When once is not enough – further evidence of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic stewardship [^3547d322]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Every day, critical care physicians around the world face the same challenge of the optimal timing of antimicrobial administration: when to start and when to stop antibiotics. Duration of antibiotic therapy for sepsis is mostly based on expert opinion, but its reduction is arguably the most promising approach to decrease emergence and selection of antibiotic resistance. The study by Hochreiter and colleagues presents another piece of evidence suggesting that procalcitonin may indeed be a valuable diagnostic parameter to guide antibiotic treatment duration, despite the ongoing controversy about the diagnostic accuracy of pro-calcitonin.

### How to use… procalcitonin [^3ed6f0e8]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2018). Low credibility.

Diagnosing bacterial infection in the unwell or febrile child is a common challenge faced by all paediatricians. Despite the advent of novel molecular techniques, there is ongoing need for diagnostic assays with adequate performance and turnaround time to facilitate safe clinical decision-making when bacterial sepsis is suspected, such as whether to commence empirical treatment with antibiotics. Procalcitonin is an established marker of infection that has a potential role in the diagnosis and exclusion of serious or invasive bacterial infection in neonates and children. Although enthusiastically adopted in many countries and institutions, national guidance in the UK does not yet support its routine use. This article reviews the relevant literature on the use of procalcitonin measurement in common paediatric clinical scenarios.

### Procalcitonin for diagnosis of infection and guide to antibiotic decisions: past, present and future [^7770c33f]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

There are a number of limitations to using conventional diagnostic markers for patients with clinical suspicion of infection. As a consequence, unnecessary and prolonged exposure to antimicrobial agents adversely affect patient outcomes, while inappropriate antibiotic therapy increases antibiotic resistance. A growing body of evidence supports the use of procalcitonin (PCT) to improve diagnosis of bacterial infections and to guide antibiotic therapy. For patients with upper and lower respiratory tract infection, post-operative infections and for severe sepsis patients in the intensive care unit, randomized-controlled trials have shown a benefit of using PCT algorithms to guide decisions about initiation and/or discontinuation of antibiotic therapy. For some other types of infections, observational studies have shown promising first results, but further intervention studies are needed before use of PCT in clinical routine can be recommended. The aim of this review is to summarize the current evidence for PCT in different infections and clinical settings, and discuss the reliability of this marker when used with validated diagnostic algorithms.

Materials and methods

Patients

Patients were eligible for inclusion in this prospective study if they presented, during the period from 1 June 2003 to 29 February 2004, with a oral temperature of 38.5°C or greater to the adult ED of a 1800-bed academic tertiary care hospital. Patients younger than 15 years were excluded. Immunocompromised status was not an exclusion criterion. The study was approved by the ethical committee of our hospital (Comité de Protection des Personnes Pitié-Salpêtrière, Paris, France). All patients gave written informed consent.

After evaluation in the emergency room, each patient was examined by a senior physician. Blood sampling and radiological examinations were ordered in accordance with routine care apart from blood chemistry, which in all patients included a sample for PCT measurement. Microbiological work up varied according to infectious clinical focus but included, in all patients, one pair of blood culture and urinary analysis. The emergency physician completed a standardized form for each patient, including co-morbidity, vital signs, putative source of infection, prior antibiotic therapy before ED consultation, and presence or absence of headache, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, myalgia, sore throat, rhinorrhoea, dry cough, polyadenopathy and rash. The form ended with the emergency physician's diagnostic suspicion, antibiotic prescription and patient course (not admitted or admitted to a medical, surgical, or intensive care unit [ICU] bed). PCT results were not available at this time.

### Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein as markers of bacteremia in patients with febrile neutropenia who receive chemotherapy for acute leukemia: a prospective study from Nepal | JCO global oncology… [^417908ab]. ASCO (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods We conducted a prospective, observational study in patients who developed FN while undergoing chemotherapy for acute leukemia. PCT and CRP were obtained in patients who presented with FN. Blood cultures also were obtained. The primary goals were to evaluate the ability of PCT and CRP to predict bacteremia in patients with FN. The secondary goals were to assess the prognostic role of PCT and CRP and to assess the microbiologic profile and culture sensitivity patterns in the study population. Results A total of 124 episodes of FN that involved 67 patients with acute leukemia occurred in the study. PCT was superior to CRP in the prediction of bacteremia. The median PCT level in the bacteremia group was 3. 25 ng/mL compared with
0. 51 ng/mL in the group without bacteremia. The median values of CRP in the bacteremia and without-bacteremia groups were 119. 3 mg/L and
94. 5 mg/L, respectively.

There were no differences in median PCT and CRP in patients who died and those who improved. Of the 42 positive cultures, Gram-negative bacteremia was common, and Escherichia coliwas the most frequent organism isolated. Carbapenem resistance was seen in 39% of positive cultures. Prediction of Bacteremia The median values of PCT and CRP after FN in the entire cohort were 1. 58 ng/mL and
97. 94 mg/L, respectively. The median PCT level in the bacteremia group was 3. 25 ng/mL and was
0. 51 ng/mL in the group without bacteremia. The median values of CRP in the bacteremia and without-bacteremia groups were 119. 30 mg/L and
94. 45 mg/L, respectively. This study revealed a high prevalence of Gram-negative bacteremia, as in other studies. 23There was also a high incidence of carbapenem-resistant organisms in this study.

Mortality in patients with FN and bacteremia is high, so this study provides a basis for additional, larger studies with PCT as a biomarker to determine whether evidence can be obtained to justify escalation of antibiotics in clinically ill patients, pending blood culture reports, who have high PCT levels. This approach could help reduce mortality from sepsis in resource-limited settings.

### Serum procalcitonin measurement as diagnostic and prognostic marker in febrile adult patients presenting to the emergency department [^d9597c80]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

The lower specificity that we report (0.59) may have two primary explanations. First, we retained a low cutoff value for PCT assay (0.2 μg/l). This cutoff value was retained based on statistical considerations because it was the optimal compromise between sensitivity and specificity on the ROC curve. However, in practice the threshold must be suited to the clinical context. For example, on one hand, a 0.1 μg/l cutoff may be useful in immunocompromised patients to screen for bacterial infection, although it may lead to a significant proportion of false-positive results (specificity 0.32; Table 2). On the other hand, a 2 μg/l threshold exhibited excellent specificity for bacterial infection (0.93), but it lacked sensitivity (0.36), which would lead to under-diagnosis a large proportion of infected patients (Table 2). Because a 0.25 μg/l threshold was reported to be useful within the context of respiratory tract infection and in the ED setting, our choice of a 0.2 μg/l cutoff in the present study is a rational one. Finally, because PCT determination in ED is performed early in the course of infection, a low threshold may be more appropriate in this setting than the higher threshold that could be used in the ICU. However, further studies are required to determine precisely the optimal PCT thresholds for application in febrile patients presenting to the ED. The second reason that may account for the the lower specificity we report here is that of the 31 patients with no bacterial/parasitic infection but with raised PCT concentrations (false positives), 12 had diseases that have previously been shown to be associated with elevated PCT, namely acute pancreatitis, environmental heatstroke and haemophagocytic syndrome.

### Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein to rule out early bacterial coinfection in COVID-19 critically ill patients [^74059138]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our study suggests that measurements of PCT and CRP, alone and at a single time point, are unfortunately not useful for ruling in or out bacterial coinfection in viral pneumonia by COVID-19.

Considering the combined values of these biomarkers, as well as symptoms timing and the broader clinical context, appears to be relevant in their interpretation and therefore in the design of further studies.

### Effect of the coronavirus pandemic on tumor markers [^696d1384]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

The new type of coronavirus could cause severe acute respiratory syndrome and injuries in other systems as well. Multiple organ damage can occur rapidly in patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Previous studies have shown that many laboratory biomarkers were not within the normal ranges in COVID-19 patients. We aimed to summarize laboratory parameters and the tumor markers in COVID-19 patients. This is a retrospective cohort study conducted on 53 women between the ages of 19–85 years infected with COVID-19 at a training and research hospital between May 2020 and August 2020. Of the 53 women, 16 (30.2%) had leukopenia. The mean C-reactive protein level was 18.42 ± 59.33mg/L. The mean procalcitonin level was 0.1 ± 0.21µg/L. The liver function tests were within normal limits. The mean creatinine level was 0.58 ± 0.37 mg/dl. Elevated levels of α-fetoprotein (AFP) in 1 patient, elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in 2 patients, elevated levels of cancer antigen 125 (CA125) in 4 patients, elevated levels of CA19-9 in 2 patients, and elevated levels of CA15-3 in 2 patients were detected. One of 4 patients who were taken to the intensive care unit had elevated levels of AFP. In addition, 2 of 4 patients who were taken to the intensive care unit had elevated levels of CA125 and CA15-3. Except for AFP, levels of all tumor markers of the patient who died were high. We found that COVID-19 had no effect on tumor markers (CA125, CA19-9, CA15-3, AFP, and CEA).

### Procalcitonin for triage of patients with respiratory tract symptoms: a case study in the trial design process for approval of a new diagnostic test for lower respiratory tract infections [^5207034c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Symptoms of cough, fever, chest pain, and shortness of breath are common reasons that patients seek medical care, and they can be due to a variety of medical conditions, including lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Only a small proportion of these patients will actually have a bacterial etiology, but many will receive antibiotic treatment because physicians cannot readily determine the etiology at the time of presentation. Current diagnostic methodologies are not sensitive or specific enough to reliably distinguish bacterial from viral or noninfectious etiologies. Procalcitonin (PCT) is a marker of host response. PCT serum levels are elevated in patients with bacterial infection, compared with levels in those with viral infections or other inflammatory pulmonary conditions. Studies have suggested that the determination of PCT levels can identify a subset of patients with LRTI symptoms who can safely avoid antibiotic treatment. As with any new test, clinical trials are necessary to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the test to obtain U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance. However, in the absence of standard reference methods for comparison that are reliably sensitive and specific, meeting the regulatory requirements for proof of safety and efficacy is a major challenge. Additional challenges include the choice of study design, the definition and determination of end points, and the justification of statistical analysis.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^5bb292ba]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Procalcitonin-guided discontinuation of antimicrobials — evidence and recommendation: In patients with sepsis, direct evidence from 14 randomized controlled trials (n = 4,499 patients) assessed procalcitonin to guide treatment duration and a meta-analysis showed improved mortality with procalcitonin versus control (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.99) with no effect on length of stay; antibiotic exposure was consistently lower with procalcitonin, although in many trials the total duration was still 7 days or longer, algorithms and thresholds varied, and the overall quality of evidence was judged low; undesirable effects were considered minimal, cost data are limited with one single-center study reporting decreased hospital costs with PCT-guided antibiotic, and testing may not be available in all settings, including LMICs; based on apparent benefit and no obvious undesirable effects, we suggest using procalcitonin along with clinical evaluation to decide when to discontinue antimicrobials in adults with an initial diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and adequate source control, if the optimal duration of therapy is unclear and if procalcitonin is available.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) — procalcitonin as a decision aid is limited; a recent study in hospitalized patients with CAP failed to identify a procalcitonin threshold that discriminated between viral and bacterial pathogens, and the reported sensitivity of procalcitonin to detect bacterial infection ranges from 38% to 91%, underscoring that this test alone cannot be used to justify withholding antibiotics from patients with CAP; although some patients with low procalcitonin levels have CAP and have been safely treated without antibiotics, these represent small subgroups, raising concerns about the safety of widely using such a strategy.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for evaluating new fever in adult patients in the ICU [^fc061dcb]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in adult ICU patients are discussed for diagnostic accuracy and antibiotic stewardship. The diagnostic accuracy and specificity of PCT are higher than those of CRP, although further studies are needed to define the optimal cutoff points for PCT and CRP and the diagnostic indexes in different disease stages. Several RCTs have demonstrated that PCT-based algorithms safely reduce antibiotic use in stable, low-risk patients with respiratory infections, and in ICU patients with suspected sepsis, clinicians should not initially withhold antibiotics, but PCT levels of less than 0.5 μg/L or levels that decrease by greater than or equal to 80% from peak levels may guide antibiotic discontinuation once patients stabilize. The Stop Antibiotics on Procalcitonin Guidance Study demonstrated a reduction in both antibiotic exposure and mortality in critically ill patients, and a meta-analysis of 11 RCTs involving 4,482 patients reported that PCT-guided antibiotic treatment in ICU patients with infection and sepsis patients resulted in improved survival and lower antibiotic treatment duration. The latest and largest systematic review and meta-analysis to date of 16 studies and greater than5000 patients showed that PCT-guided antibiotic discontinuation appeared to decrease antibiotic utilization by 1 day and improve mortality, but support for their findings was tempered by low-certainty evidence and the majority of the PCT trials excluded severely immunocompromised patients. In summary, PCT and CRP provide only supportive and complementary information to clinical assessment, and decisions on initiating, altering, or discontinuing antimicrobial therapy should not be made solely based on changes in PCT or CRP levels.

### Prognostic value of procalcitonin in respiratory tract infections across clinical settings [^d08e83c5]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This is the first large-scale study in which the prognostic value of admission PCT levels has been investigated throughout all clinical settings in the field of ARIs. PCT levels mainly provide prognostic information for risk stratification of patients in the ED setting and in patients with low to moderate ARIs. Future randomised controlled studies must address whether adding PCT to initial risk assessment can improve patient management and prognostication.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^9bd48716]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Biomarkers to start antibiotics — procalcitonin: For adults with suspected sepsis or septic shock, we suggest against using procalcitonin plus clinical evaluation to decide when to start antimicrobials, as compared to clinical evaluation alone (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence). In a meta-analysis of 30 studies (3,244 patients), procalcitonin had a pooled sensitivity of 77% and specificity of 79% for sepsis in critically ill patients, but a meta-analysis of three RCTs (n = 1,769 ICU patients) comparing procalcitonin-guided initiation vs usual care found no difference in short-term mortality (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.15), length of ICU stays (MD, 0.19 days; 95% CI, -0.98 to 1.36), or length of hospitalization (MD, 7.00 days; 95% CI, -26.24 to 12.24), and long-term mortality, readmission rates, and hospital-free days were not reported in any of the trials.

Safety signals include that "one SR and two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggests an increase in diarrhea with antibiotic therapy compared with placebo from four weeks to two years post commencement of antibiotics", and "No significant difference was found in harms between shorter and longer durations of broad spectrum antibiotics". For biomarker-guided prescribing, "the use of C-reactive protein (CRP) point-of-care testing guided antibiotic prescription compared to usual care, had no clinically important difference in adverse effects… at six months", and "The Work Group did not review evidence on other specific biomarkers, such as procalcitonin". Clinically, "Based on clinical judgment, antibiotic therapy may be warranted and beneficial on a case-by-case basis", with examples including "a moderate exacerbation, increased dyspnea and increased sputum volume/purulence, fever/chills, and leukocytosis with radiographic evidence of pneumonia". The Work Group's confidence in the evidence was stated as low.

### Can procalcitonin measurement help in differentiating between bacterial infection and other kinds of inflammatory processes? [^7b6b6ff9]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the levels of procalcitonin (PCT) in various inflammatory states seen in an internal medicine department and to evaluate the possible discriminative role of PCT in differentiating bacterial infection from other inflammatory processes.

Methods

PCT, C reactive protein (CRP), and white blood cell count (WBC) were measured in patients admitted to the department for fever or biological inflammatory syndrome, or both. The serum of 173 consecutive patients was analysed according to the aetiological diagnosis. The patients were divided into two groups: group I (n = 60) with documented bacterial or fungal infection; group II (n = 113) with abacterial inflammatory disease.

Results

PCT levels were > 0.5 ng/ml in 39/60 (65%) patients in group I. In group II, three patients with a viral infection had slightly increased PCT levels (0.7, 0.8, and 1.1 ng/ml) as did two others, one with crystal arthritis and the other with vasculitis (0.7 ng/ml in both cases). All other patients in group II had PCT levels < 0.5 ng/ml. In this study a value of PCT > 0.5 ng/ml was taken as the marker of bacterial infection (sensitivity 65%, specificity 96%). PCT values were more discriminative than WBC and CRP in distinguishing a bacterial infection from another inflammatory process.

Conclusion

PCT levels only rose significantly during bacterial infections. In this study PCT levels > 1.2 ng/ml were always evidence of bacterial infection and the cue for starting antibiotic treatment.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment using procalcitonin-guided treatment algorithms in older patients: a patient-level meta-analysis from randomized controlled trials [^28ed5dc0]. Age and Ageing (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis remains a major healthcare problem worldwide and is responsible for a large number of deaths particularly in the older patient population. Early identification and appropriate initial management, including start of antibiotic treatment and fluid resuscitation, have been shown to improve outcomes. In addition, monitoring of patients during treatment both for timely escalation of therapy in case of treatment failure and de-escalation in case of a favourable treatment response has an important impact on patients' recovery. This also includes early de-escalation or cessation of antibiotic treatment once a patient's condition has stabilized, with signs indicating progression towards resolution of infection. In addition to closely monitoring the clinical status of patients, blood biomarkers mirroring specific physiopathological pathways may help to better estimate the resolution of infection thereby improving clinical decision-making. Serum procalcitonin (PCT) has emerged as a host-derived biomarker that provides prognostic information in patients with infections and thus may improve sepsis management. Particularly, the kinetics of PCT in an infected patient provide information about the recovery and risk for adverse outcome, which in turn may influence decisions about the duration of antibiotic treatment. Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCT) have investigated the benefits of using serum PCT levels to guide whether and for how long antibiotic therapy is used — a process referred to as PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship — in patients with different types of infections including sepsis patients in intensive care unit (ICU). There are several trials and meta-analyses from such trials suggesting that PCT use decreases antibiotic exposure with beneficial effects on clinical outcomes including lower mortality in patients with respiratory tract infections, sepsis and blood stream infection.

### Utility of procalcitonin as a biomarker for sepsis in children [^1df78c2c]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is a complex process defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates in both adults and children, and emphasis has been placed on its early recognition and prompt provision of antimicrobials. Owing to limitations of current diagnostic tests (i.e., poor sensitivity and delayed results), significant research has been conducted to identify sepsis biomarkers. Ideally, a biomarker could reliably and rapidly distinguish bacterial infection from other, noninfectious causes of systemic inflammatory illness. In doing so, a sepsis biomarker could be used for earlier identification of sepsis, risk stratification/prognostication, and/or guidance of antibiotic decision-making. In this minireview, we review one of the most common clinically used sepsis biomarkers, procalcitonin, and its roles in sepsis management in these three areas. We highlight key findings in the adult literature but focus the bulk of this review on pediatric sepsis. The challenges and limitations of procalcitonin measurement in sepsis are also discussed.

### Procalcitonin as a biomarker in respiratory tract infection [^76303c00]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels rapidly increase in patients with invasive bacterial disease. PCT levels increase faster than do C-reactive protein levels. Furthermore, a rapid decrease in the PCT level is supporting evidence that the source of the bacterial infection is responding to clinical management. In patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, sequential PCT levels are useful as a guide to shorter courses of antimicrobial therapy. With use of emerging multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction platforms for the detection of viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens, it should be possible to critically assess whether an elevated serum PCT level is a valid biomarker of invasive bacterial infection.

On admission, the blood counts of 19 of the 62 (31%) patients showed leucopenia (white blood cell count < 4×10⁹/L) and 26 (42%) showed lymphopenia (lymphocyte count < 1.0×10⁹/L; table 2). The D-dimer levels were within normal range (median 0.2 mg/L (interquartile range 0.2–0.5 mg/L). Levels of aspartate aminotransferase increased in 10 (16%) patients. Fifty five (89%) patients had normal serum levels of procalcitonin (< 0.1 ng/mL). Abnormalities on chest computed tomograms or radiographs were detected among all of the patients except for one. Fifty two (84%) patients showed bilateral involvement on chest radiographs (table 2). Typical chest computed tomography findings of infected patients on admission were bilateral or multiple lobular or subsegmental areas of consolidation or bilateral ground glass opacity (fig 1). Only one patient did not have pneumonia. Of the 62 patients, only one was transferred to an intensive care unit for acute respiratory distress syndrome and received mechanical ventilation (table 3). Fifty five (89%) patients received antiviral treatment, 28 (45%) were given empirical antibiotic treatment, and 16 (26%) were given systematic corticosteroid and gamma globulin treatment. At this point, one (2%) patient had been discharged and no patients had died. Fitness for discharge was based on abatement of fever for at least three days, with improved evidence on chest radiography and viral clearance in samples from the lower respiratory tract.

### Two-transcript signature for differentiation and clinical outcomes in severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) patients: a double-blind, multicenter, validation study [^25646c95]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Procedures

Within 24 hours of admission, all patients received routine examinations. Except for blood cultures and blood draws for two transcripts, other routine laboratory evaluations were performed by the treating physician. These typically include blood cell count and differential, procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), blood chemistry, urinalysis, and urine culture, among others. Computed tomography (CT) was performed on the basis of clinical indications. The physicians and nursing staff involved in the treatment of patients were unaware of the transcript test results. The two-transcript test was used to evaluate the expression levels of the IFI44L and PI3 genes. A predefined logistic regression formula was used to calculate the likelihood score for determining a bacterial or viral infection, as previously described, and further details can be found in the supplementary materials. On the basis of the likelihood score of the two-transcript test, each patient was classified as having a bacterial or a viral immune response. Patients with a two-transcript test score above 0.547598 were classified as having bacterial infections, whereas those with a score below 0.547598 were classified as having viral infections. The smaller the value is, the greater the likelihood of a viral infection.

Clinical data were gathered from medical records via an electronic case report form (eCRF). The eCRF included demographic information, medical history, comprehensive radiological and laboratory data collected during routine care (such as procalcitonin levels, white blood cell counts, and absolute neutrophil counts), microbiological investigation outcomes (including blood culture and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) for SFTSV specific to the study), and follow-up details. Two clinicians who were blinded to the two-transcript test results assigned one of the following causes to each patient: bacterial infection, SFTSV infection, no-SFTS viral infection, noninfectious disease, or indeterminate.

### Procalcitonin to guide duration of antibiotic therapy in intensive care patients: a randomized prospective controlled trial [^075aa617]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Beyond a reduction of the length of antibiotic treatment PCT guidance also had a favorable effect on the length of the intensive care stay. These findings are in accordance with a recent publication by Nobre and colleagues who observed a reduction of the length of antibiotic therapy along with a two-day shorter average duration of intensive care treatment using a PCT-based algorithm.

As already mentioned before, delayed diagnosis and inadequate antibiotic therapy have unfavorable consequences for the success of treatment in patients with sepsis. On the other hand, if antibiotic treatment is inadequate and too long the development of antibiotic resistance is favoured. The duration of antibiotic therapy is based on the type of infection, suspected or proven pathogens, and the clinical course with potential recurrence of clinical signs and symptoms of infection. The length of treatment should be kept as short as possible.

### Procalcitonin-guided diagnosis and antibiotic stewardship revisited [^ca262e0c]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Abdominal disease and abdominal infection

Several studies have investigated the use of PCT in patients with abdominal infection. In patients with liver cirrhosis, one study found that PCT could identify complications through bacterial infection. Similar results were found for acute pancreatitis, with PCT a good predictor of accompanied perforation or abscess. In a small RCT of patients with acute pancreatitis, a PCT-guided antimicrobial approach was shown to be safe and effective compared to a control group that received prophylactic antibiotic treatment for 2 weeks. Furthermore, in patients presenting with secondary peritonitis, PCT-guided therapy was shown to reduce antibiotic consumption by 50%. There are currently no studies evaluating the role of PCT in infected diverticulosis and more studies are strongly needed in general to evaluate the use of PCT-guided treatment in abdominal infection.

Endocarditis

Few studies have investigated the use of serum PCT in infectious endocarditis. Nevertheless, one large meta-analysis by Yu et al. found that PCT was not superior compared to CRP, and therefore not suitable in routine diagnostic. However, Cornelissen et al. found PCT useful in the prediction of poor outcome (cut-off 0.5 ng/ml, sensitivity 73%, specificity 79%), with an odds ratio of 12.8 (95% CI 2.5–66.2) for finding Staphylococcus aureus in blood cultures.

Febrile neutropenia

In patients with haematological malignancies with newly developed febrile neutropenia (FN), PCT is an accurate marker of infection as well as a predictor of severity. A 2015 meta-analysis provided the first large-scale clinical evidence on the validity of PCT in discriminating bacterial infection from other cause of fever in patients with FN. In this study of 1960 febrile episodes, a positive likelihood ratio of 5.49 was found for PCT being a good marker for infection. Overall, PCT had a specificity of 0.88 but low sensitivity of 0.65, resulting in a suboptimal negative likelihood ratio of 0.4. Taken together, PCT might be specific, but not sensitive, in differentiating severe bacterial infection from other systemic inflammation or viral infection. The authors state that, with regards clinical implications, the use of PCT is valuable as a diagnostic aid to confirm infection. However, the negative likelihood ratio (0.4) is unacceptably high for guiding antimicrobial therapy and PCT is therefore not suitable for predicting treatment cessation in patients with FN. Moreover, a recent study showed a significant correlation between initial PCT concentration and ICU admission (AUC 0.93) and mortality (AUC 0.86).

### Comparison of laboratory characteristics of gastrointestinal symptoms and nongastrointestinal symptoms in patients infected with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^07d856cc]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 has rapidly spread to more than 200 countries, with close to 43 million confirmed cases in the United States alone. Although respiratory symptoms are the most common and usually the earliest symptom, as the number of human infections with SARS-CoV-2 increased, the number of COVID-19 patients with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms as the first manifestation were increasing. – From the present investigations, we find that there is inconsistency with the clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients with GI symptoms. Some studies show that GI symptoms are very frequent in patients with COVID-19 and may not be associated with a poor prognosis. In contrast, other studies reported COVID-19 with GI symptoms were associated with poor clinical outcomes. In addition, some studies have reported laboratory test variations about COVID-19 patients with GI symptoms. In terms of hematologic observations, lymphopenia is the relatively common white blood cell (WBC) derangement. A portion of COVID-19 affected persons with GI symptoms develop liver biochemistry abnormalities. Procalcitonin (PCT) is a sensitive and specific indicator of bacterial infection. Therefore, patients with viral infections do not show significant elevated levels of PCT. There are also some studies that report post-infection functional gastrointestinal disorders following COVID-19. These patients also experience abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, anorexia, and other GI symptoms. However, these symptoms usually appear months after infection. With increased numbers of COVID-19 patients with GI symptoms now published, it has been possible to summarize laboratory data about COVID-19 patients with GI symptoms. The purpose of this study is to summarize and compare the laboratory indicators of COVID-19 with GI symptoms to help clinicians effectively deal with the disease.

### Prognostic value of procalcitonin in respiratory tract infections across clinical settings [^8b347bf3]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Key messages

We found an increase in PCT levels across the clinical settings and ARI diagnoses, supporting the current practice of using specific PCT cutoff levels in different clinical settings.
PCT levels are significantly associated with treatment failure and mortality in the overall population.
The prognostic information of initial PCT levels in primary care and ICU patients is rather low, whereas admission PCT levels provide important prognostic information in the ED setting and in patients with low to moderate ARIs.

### Diagnostic efficacy of Mycoplasma pneumoniae antibody and procalcitonin in children with Mycoplasma pneumonia [^6e0c44cd]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Higher PCT levels in the observation group suggest a stronger inflammatory response associated with MPP, which may be indicative of more severe or systemic infection. Elevated PCT is often associated with bacterial infections and can be a useful marker for distinguishing bacterial from viral infections, particularly in the context of pneumonia. But some patients with negative PCR results have higher PCT levels, it is important to note several potential explanations: Firstly, 23 S PCR is mainly used to detect specific types of bacteria or their subspecies (such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae). If the patient's infection is caused by other types of bacteria, then even if the 23 S PCR result is negative, the PCT level may increase due to the presence of these bacteria. PCT is a biomarker more broadly related to bacterial infections; Secondly, for patients who have undergone surgery or suffered trauma, even if the 23 S PCR is negative, it can still lead to an increase in PCT.

Investigations

At the acute presentation and after the two episodes of sudden neurological deterioration, the patient underwent urgent non-contrast head CT and brain MRI studies. Initial tests were performed and showed that haemoglobin A1c was 6.8%, low-density lipoprotein was 100 mg/dL and high-density lipoprotein was 51 mg/dL. They also showed pancytopenia associated with the recent chemotherapy treatments and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels due to the underlying cholangiocarcinoma. Extensive workup to investigate the stroke aetiology was conducted, and the relevant findings are discussed below in relation to each differential diagnosis.

### Acute liver failure guidelines [^880c9719]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Acute liver failure (ALF) — infection surveillance and prophylaxis emphasize that patients with ALF have a high incidence of bacterial infections and that fungal infections account for up to 32% of infections; in a review of 1,551 patients, antimicrobial prophylaxis did not reduce the rate of bloodstream infection or 21-day mortality. Usual indicators of leukocytosis and fever are absent in up to 30% of infected ALF cases, and procalcitonin showed no differences between uninfected and documented infection groups; there is insufficient evidence in ALF to recommend procalcitonin as a biomarker of infection. In the absence of surrogate indications, it is recommended that regular surveillance of blood, urine, and sputum cultures be performed, and we suggest regular surveillance cultures, although the optimal frequency is unknown. Empiric antibiotic and antifungal therapies may be considered in clinical deterioration, and in patients with ALF, we recommend against the routine use of prophylactic antimicrobial agents given no improvement in either bloodstream infection or 21-day mortality; GRADE recommendation: conditional, low quality of evidence.

### Effect of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic treatment on clinical outcomes in intensive care unit patients with infection and sepsis patients: a patient-level meta-analysis of randomized trials [^05cd8f72]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, remains a major healthcare problem worldwide and affects millions of people each year. Early identification and appropriate initial management including the start of antibiotic treatment and fluid resuscitation improves outcomes. In addition, monitoring of patients during treatment both for timely escalation of therapy in case of treatment failure and de-escalation in case of a favorable treatment response has an important impact on patient recovery. This also includes early de-escalation or cessation of antibiotic treatment once a patient's condition has stabilized, with signs indicating progression towards the resolution of infection.

Given that clinical signs for monitoring patients with sepsis can be ambiguous, the use of additional biomarkers mirroring specific physiopathological pathways has been proposed. In this context, serum procalcitonin (PCT) has emerged as a sensitive biomarker that provides prognostic information in patients with infections, and thus may improve sepsis management. Multiple studies have demonstrated that PCT levels increase in response to bacterial infection and decrease during recovery. Reflecting the host response to a bacterial infection, PCT thus provides important adjunctive information in addition to traditional clinical and diagnostic parameters.

Multiple trials have investigated the benefits of using serum PCT levels to guide whether and for how long antibiotic therapy is used — a process referred to as PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship — in patients with infection in the intensive care unit (ICU). While most trials have focused on the effects of PCT guidance on antibiotic usage, a recent large trial from the Netherlands reported lower mortality following PCT-guided therapy. However, conclusive evidence on the safety of this approach across different types of infection and sepsis severities has been limited due to largely insufficient statistical power in most of the individual trials. Moreover, meta-analyses focusing on the impact of PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship in sepsis patients on clinical outcomes overall and within patient subgroups based on infection type and severity have been inconclusive. A noteworthy limitation of these meta-analyses was that they were based on aggregate data, limiting opportunities to harmonize outcome definitions among trials and to investigate the impact of PCT guidance in different patient subgroups.

To address this significant drawback of earlier meta-analyses, we performed a meta-analysis of individual patient data from 11 randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the safety of using PCT to guide antibiotic decisions in ICU patients with infection and different sepsis severities and with the involvement of different organs.

### Procalcitonin to distinguish viral from bacterial pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c2af488e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Because of the diverse etiologies of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and the limitations of current diagnostic modalities, serum procalcitonin levels have been proposed as a novel tool to guide antibiotic therapy. Outcome data from procalcitonin-guided therapy trials have shown similar mortality, but the essential question is whether the sensitivity and specificity of procalcitonin levels enable the practitioner to distinguish bacterial pneumonia, which requires antibiotic therapy, from viral pneumonia, which does not. In this meta-analysis of 12 studies in 2408 patients with CAP that included etiologic diagnoses and sufficient data to enable analysis, the sensitivity and specificity of serum procalcitonin were 0.55 (95% confidence interval [CI].37-.71; I2 = 95.5%) and 0.76 (95% CI, .62-.86; I2 = 94.1%), respectively. Thus, a procalcitonin level is unlikely to provide reliable evidence either to mandate administration of antibiotics or to enable withholding such treatment in patients with CAP.

### A coronavirus disease-2019 induced pancytopenia [^c653a99e]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

As the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) pandemic progresses, various hematologic complications have emerged, often centered around the hypercoagulable state. However, pancytopenia represents a rare but serious complication from SARS-CoV2 infection. While lymphopenia is a common finding, concomitant acute anemia and thrombocytopenia are not commonly reported. We describe a novel case of SARS-CoV2 pancytopenia in a 40-year-old male without active risk factors for cell line derangements but subsequent critical illness.

### Procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy may shorten length of treatment and may improve survival-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^56eb3a68]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Length of ICU stay, length of hospital stay, healthcare costs

Higher infection recurrence rate did not result in excessive ICU and in-hospital stay in the PCT group, which is consistent with the previous meta-analysis in septic ICU patients. Despite the high heterogeneity in cost-effectiveness reports, our results suggest that PCT guidance at least does not appear to be inferior to SOC, but further research is needed to draw firm conclusions about this outcome.

### A descriptive study on multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children in a single center in west Michigan [^4d8fcfe8]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Lab differences

Statistically significant differences were found between the PICU and non-PICU groups regarding laboratory values of hemoglobin, BNP, AST, peak ferritin, and procalcitonin. These laboratory derangements correlated with disease severity in our cohort.

Mean hemoglobin was found to be lower in the PICU group; however, the interpretation of this finding is uncertain, especially given that normal ranges for hemoglobin vary by age. Anemia has been frequently described in critical care settings as well in inflammatory states, and the etiology of anemia in our cohort may be multifactorial: iatrogenic (more frequent blood draws, dilution from fluid resuscitation), anemia of acute inflammation, and possibly preexisting anemia of iron deficiency. Our small cohort and retrospective study design do not allow us to delineate between these potential causes. On average, BNP was greater in the PICU group than the non-PICU group. Elevated BNP correlates with greater cardiac dysfunction, and indeed may correlate with disease severity.

In the PICU group, we observed greater elevation in AST, peak ferritin, and procalcitonin. The elevation in AST may be secondary to the greater organ dysfunction and shock present in the PICU group. Elevations in ferritin are commonly associated with inflammatory and immune dysregulation states. This, in combination with the increased AST, is reminiscent of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and macrophage activation syndrome (HLH/MAS). These immune dysregulation disorders have previously been reported secondary to viral illness and so it may follow that MIS-C may have a similar pathophysiological basis with SARS-CoV-2 as a trigger. Procalcitonin was also substantially elevated in the ICU patients; this may be a biomarker of multi-organ dysfunction, as excretion of procalcitonin is mediated by the kidneys. However, procalcitonin was elevated in patients who did not have documented renal dysfunction, and may therefore be a biomarker for disease severity in MIS-C.

### Evaluation and management of well-appearing febrile infants 8 to 60 days old [^2e9fcfa2]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Inflammatory marker thresholds and adjunct testing — 8 to 21 days: Laboratory inflammatory markers are considered elevated at procalcitonin > 0.5 ng/mL, C-reactive protein (CRP) > 20 mg/L, and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 4000 to 5200 per mm³, and although "we recommend all infants in this age group have a complete sepsis workup, receive parenteral antimicrobial agents, and be monitored in a hospital", IM results can guide decisions. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing should be sent for cell count, Gram stain, glucose, protein, bacterial culture, and enterovirus PCR (if available) if pleocytosis is present and during periods of increased local enterovirus prevalence. HSV should be considered when there is a maternal history of genital HSV infections or fevers from 48 hours before to 48 hours after delivery and in infants with vesicles, seizures, hypothermia, mucous membrane ulcers, CSF pleocytosis in the absence of a positive Gram stain result, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or elevated alanine aminotransferase levels; recommended HSV studies are CSF PCR; HSV surface swabs of the mouth, nasopharynx, conjunctiva, and anus for an HSV culture (if available) or PCR assay; alanine aminotransferase; and blood PCR.

Regarding medical management for ventilator-associated pneumonia, more specifically with respect to initiation of antibiotics, ATS/IDSA 2016 guidelines recommend to use clinical criteria alone, rather than using serum procalcitonin plus clinical criteria, to decide whether or not to initiate antibiotic therapy in patients with suspected ventilator-acquired pneumonia.

### Role of procalcitonin in managing adult patients with respiratory tract infections [^b3950817]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Respiratory infections remain the most common reason why patients seek medical care in ambulatory and hospital settings, and they are the most frequent precursor of sepsis. In light of the limitations of clinical signs and symptoms and traditional microbiologic diagnostics for respiratory infections, blood biomarkers that correlate with the presence and extent of bacterial infections may provide additional useful information to improve diagnostic and prognostic efforts and help with therapeutic decisions in individual patients. A growing body of evidence supports the use of procalcitonin (PCT) to differentiate bacterial from viral respiratory diagnoses, to help risk stratify patients, and to guide antibiotic therapy decisions about initial need for, and optimal duration of, therapy. Although still relatively new on the clinical frontier, a series of randomized controlled trials have evaluated PCT protocols for antibiotic-related decision making and have included patients from different clinical settings and with different severities of respiratory infection. In these trials, initial PCT levels were effective in guiding decisions about the initiation of antibiotic therapy in lower-acuity patients, and subsequent measurements were effective for guiding duration of therapy in higher-acuity patients, without apparent harmful effects. Recent European respiratory infection guidelines now also recognize this concept. As with any other laboratory test, PCT should not be used on a stand-alone basis. Rather, it must be integrated into clinical protocols, together with clinical, microbiologic data and with results from clinical risk scores. The aim of this review is to summarize recent evidence about the usefulness of PCT in patients with lower respiratory tract infections and to discuss the potential benefits and limitations of this marker when used for clinical decision making.

### Reassessing procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy in critically ill patients with sepsis: lessons from the ADAPT-sepsis trial [^8c325c54]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Randomized trials of procalcitonin-guided algorithms to discontinue antibiotics in critically ill patients with sepsis report reduced antibiotic duration and possible mortality benefit. However, open-label trial designs, inconsistent algorithm adherence, and unclear stewardship practices have limited confidence in procalcitonin's benefit. The ADAPT-Sepsis trial addressed several of these gaps through a concealed intervention, robust stewardship, and head-to-head comparison with CRP. Procalcitonin-guided care reduced antibiotic use without significantly impacting mortality, while CRP-guided care showed no benefit. However, algorithm adherence was suboptimal and the absolute reduction in antibiotic duration with procalcitonin was only one day. As shorter fixed-duration therapy becomes standard, procalcitonin's utility in the ICU may decline. Embedding procalcitonin and other biomarkers into multifaceted stewardship strategies, and addressing barriers to clinician trust and implementation, is essential. Future research should also evaluate whether biomarker use earlier in the sepsis care pathway, particularly in Emergency Departments, can improve early diagnostic accuracy and enhance patient outcomes.
