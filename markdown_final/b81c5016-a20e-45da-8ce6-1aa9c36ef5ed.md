## Question

do you trend ammonia in hepatic encephalopathy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether we should trend serum ammonia levels to monitor hepatic encephalopathy in patients with chronic liver disease, and if not, what the evidence-based approach should be instead. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether we are dealing with chronic cirrhosis or acute liver failure. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about ammonia testing in chronic liver disease. Next, I will examine the diagnostic and prognostic utility of serial ammonia measurements. After that, I need to check for confounders and pre-analytical pitfalls that could mislead interpretation. Finally, I will consider any exceptions, such as acute liver failure or inborn errors of metabolism, and synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation with monitoring alternatives.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context, because the role of ammonia differs between chronic cirrhosis and acute liver failure. In chronic liver disease with portosystemic shunting, hepatic encephalopathy is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion and is graded by bedside mental status scales, whereas in acute liver failure, very high ammonia levels correlate with cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension, so the threshold and implications are different [^115KhUMC] [^112Txfat].

> Next, I should review what the major guidelines say about ammonia in chronic liver disease. The AASLD/EASL 2014 guideline explicitly states that increased blood ammonia alone does not add diagnostic, staging, or prognostic value in patients with chronic liver disease, and that a normal ammonia level should prompt reconsideration of the diagnosis rather than reassurance, which argues against serial trending to follow treatment response [^116fpXmX] [^114zUApH]. The EASL 2022 guidance aligns with this, recommending ammonia measurement only when the diagnosis is uncertain, particularly to exclude HE when the value is normal, not to monitor therapy [^1159UJym] [^114sczVk]. The 2024 AASLD acute-on-chronic liver failure guidance similarly advises against routine ammonia testing in cirrhosis with altered mental status and emphasizes clinical assessment over serial ammonia checks [^115KhUMC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify whether serial ammonia correlates with clinical improvement. Multiple studies show no correlation between lactulose dose or clinical resolution and ammonia levels, and lactulose dosing is not guided by ammonia values in practice, which undermines the idea of trending ammonia to titrate therapy [^114a9VtD] [^111KhZCV]. In fact, lactulose dosing is typically titrated to stool frequency and clinical mental status rather than to ammonia levels, reinforcing that trending ammonia does not change management decisions [^1172SD8u].

> I need to check the prognostic angle carefully. While higher ammonia correlates with worse outcomes in acute decompensation and acute liver failure, this supports risk stratification at baseline, not serial trending to monitor response. For example, an admission ammonia around 79.5 µmol/L predicts higher 28-day mortality, and persistent hyperammonemia in acute liver failure portends cerebral edema and death, but these are prognostic observations rather than a rationale for serial trending in chronic HE management [^116YtUCc] [^115z4TDw]. But wait, what if a falling ammonia "helps" track improvement? Even where ammonia declines with clinical recovery, the correlation is inconsistent and not actionable, so clinical scales remain the standard for monitoring [^111KhZCV].

> Let me consider confounders and pre-analytical pitfalls, because these can easily mislead interpretation if we trend ammonia. Ammonia levels are labile and increase after protein intake, vary substantially between laboratories, and are highly sensitive to sample handling; venous samples drawn without tourniquet, transported on ice, and analyzed promptly are required, yet these steps are frequently omitted in routine care, producing spurious results that could prompt inappropriate treatment changes if trended serially [^115fE9cg] [^116g8tZj] [^115SV5eU]. I should double-check that even under controlled conditions, variability persists, which further erodes the reliability of serial trends for clinical decision-making [^115qC1VQ].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought a normalizing ammonia might confirm response, but I should correct that assumption. In chronic cirrhosis, normalization of ammonia can lag behind clinical improvement, and conversely, elevated values are nonspecific and occur in many patients without encephalopathy, so trending can create false reassurance or unnecessary alarm without changing therapy [^115SV5eU]. This reinforces that serial ammonia adds little beyond careful bedside assessment and can distract from more important tasks like identifying precipitants and reassessing the differential if the course is atypical [^114sczVk].

> I will now examine whether there are any exceptions where trending ammonia is reasonable. In acute liver failure, very high ammonia levels, especially above 100–200 µmol/L, identify patients at risk for cerebral edema and may inform early use of continuous renal replacement therapy and neurocritical care strategies; here, serial ammonia can be part of risk stratification and response monitoring, but this is distinct from chronic HE management [^112Txfat] [^1174Z8Q5]. Similarly, in inborn errors of metabolism and urea cycle disorders, ammonia is a primary therapeutic target and serial measurements guide dose adjustments of nitrogen-scavenging agents, which is a different clinical paradigm than cirrhotic HE [^113HsZZf] [^112QdZR5].

> Next, I should review what to do instead of trending ammonia. Diagnosis and monitoring of overt HE should be clinical, using the West Haven criteria and frequent neurologic assessments every 6–12 hours during acute episodes, while searching for and treating precipitating factors such as infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, dehydration, renal dysfunction, constipation, and sedating medications [^115KhUMC] [^115NXRDD]. For covert HE, validated psychometric testing can detect deficits and track response, whereas routine ammonia testing is not recommended for diagnosis or monitoring in this setting either [^117FvZAD] [^1159UJym].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I am not missing a hidden benefit of trending. The weight of guideline statements and observational data indicates that trending serum ammonia in chronic cirrhosis does not improve diagnostic accuracy, guide therapy, or predict clinical response better than bedside assessment, and it is vulnerable to pre-analytical error and interpretive ambiguity; therefore, serial ammonia should not be used to monitor HE in chronic liver disease [^116fpXmX] [^114sczVk] [^115KhUMC]. Instead, clinicians should monitor mental status with standardized scales, aggressively identify and treat precipitants, and escalate care based on clinical trajectory, reserving ammonia testing for diagnostic uncertainty or alternative etiologies rather than for serial trend monitoring [^1159UJym] [^115KhUMC].

---

Routine ammonia trending is **not recommended** in hepatic encephalopathy (HE) because it does not guide management or predict outcomes [^116kCx7i] [^114a9VtD]. Ammonia levels are variable [^115fE9cg], poorly correlate with HE severity [^111KhZCV], and are influenced by pre-analytical factors; thus, trending is unreliable [^1153BJM7]. Guidelines advise against routine ammonia testing [^115KhUMC]; a single baseline level may help if the diagnosis is uncertain, but serial measurements should not be used to monitor response [^1159UJym] [^114sczVk]. Management should rely on **clinical assessment** and standard HE therapies [^115T6DuK].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines from major liver societies provide clear recommendations on the role of ammonia testing in HE:

- **AASLD/EASL 2014 guidelines**: Elevated blood ammonia alone does not add diagnostic, staging, or prognostic value in chronic liver disease; if a patient with overt HE has a normal ammonia level, the diagnosis of HE should be questioned [^116fpXmX] [^114zUApH].

- **EASL 2022 guidelines**: Serum ammonia may be measured in patients with delirium/encephalopathy and liver disease, but a normal value brings the diagnosis of HE into question; routine trending is not recommended [^1159UJym].

- **AASLD 2024 guidance**: Routine ammonia level testing in patients with cirrhosis and altered mental status is not recommended; a low ammonia level in coma or confusion should prompt evaluation for alternative etiologies [^115KhUMC].

---

## Evidence against routine ammonia trending

Several studies have demonstrated the limited utility of routine ammonia trending in HE:

- **Lack of correlation with severity**: Ammonia levels do not consistently correlate with the severity of HE or clinical outcomes, making trending unreliable for monitoring disease progression or response to therapy [^111KhZCV] [^1127WV7v].

- **No impact on management**: A prospective study found that obtaining ammonia levels did not influence clinical decision-making or patient outcomes, highlighting its limited utility in routine practice [^113SEYzx] [^116kCx7i].

- **Variability and technical challenges**: Ammonia levels are highly variable and influenced by pre-analytical factors such as sample handling, processing, and protein intake, further limiting their reliability for trending [^115fE9cg] [^1153BJM7].

---

## Situations where ammonia measurement may be useful

While routine trending is not recommended, certain clinical scenarios may benefit from selective ammonia measurement:

- **Diagnostic uncertainty**: In patients with altered mental status and liver disease, a normal ammonia level may prompt evaluation for alternative diagnoses [^1159UJym] [^113inYyR].

- **Acute liver failure**: Elevated ammonia levels (> 100–200 µmol/L) are associated with increased risk of cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension, and early continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) may be considered to reduce ammonia levels [^112s2YH9] [^1174Z8Q5].

- **Research settings**: Ammonia measurement may be used in clinical trials or research studies to better understand pathophysiology, but not for routine clinical monitoring [^115qC1VQ].

---

## Alternative clinical monitoring strategies

Given the limitations of ammonia trending, clinicians should rely on **clinical assessment** and standardized tools to monitor HE:

- **Clinical assessment**: Regular neurological assessments using standardized grading systems (e.g. West Haven criteria) are essential for monitoring HE severity and response to therapy [^115NXRDD].

- **Psychometric testing**: For minimal HE, validated psychometric tests can help detect subtle cognitive impairments and monitor treatment response [^115NXRDD].

- **Management of precipitating factors**: Identifying and addressing precipitating factors (e.g. infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, electrolyte disturbances) remain the cornerstone of HE management [^115T6DuK].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Routine ammonia trending is **not recommended** for monitoring hepatic encephalopathy because of its limited clinical utility, variability, and lack of correlation with clinical outcomes. Clinicians should prioritize clinical assessment, standardized grading systems, and management of precipitating factors. Selective ammonia measurement may be considered in specific clinical scenarios, such as diagnostic uncertainty or acute liver failure, but should not guide routine management decisions.

Is there any role of ammonia measurements in HE diagnosis?

It is a common practice to order ammonia levels when patients with a known history of HE get admitted. However, as per the current evidence, there seems to be no role for such practice and should best be avoided. The diagnosis of HE is entertained on the basis of clinical grounds and blood‐ammonia levels offer limited useful information in terms of diagnosis or staging. Elevated ammonia levels have been found in as many as 69% of patients with no signs or symptoms of encephalopathy, making it a nonspecific diagnostic tool. Hence, trending the ammonia to "normal levels" is of limited utility in patients with overt HE (OHE) as the efficacy of treatment is primarily based on clinical improvement alone. This becomes pertinent as the normalization of ammonia levels may lag behind the clinical improvement in HE patients. However, in cases of normal ammonia levels in patients being treated for possible OHE, alternative diagnoses should be explored. Hospitalists should be aware of the fact that some medications can also cause elevations in ammonia levels, for example, sodium valproate, which is independent of HE and can be a source of confusion. In addition, blood sample collection (e.g. using a tourniquet) and processing techniques may as well cause inaccuracies with the ammonia measurements.

Laboratory testing — high blood-ammonia levels alone do not add diagnostic, staging, or prognostic value in HE with chronic liver disease (CLD); if a patient with overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) has a normal ammonia level, the diagnosis of HE is in question. For ammonia-lowering drugs, repeated ammonia measurements may be helpful to test efficacy, but logistical challenges, specimen type differences, and method variability should be considered when interpreting results.

### The ongoing debate of serum ammonia levels in cirrhosis: the good, the bad, and the ugly [^113inYyR]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Serum ammonia testing in hepatic encephalopathy (HE) has been long debated in the field of hepatology. Although central to the pathophysiology of HE, serum ammonia testing is fraught with complexities that can lead to challenges in laboratory collection and interpretation. Although there is some disagreement across guideline organizations regarding routine testing of ammonia in HE, all acknowledge that normal values, although possible in HE, may warrant reconsideration of the diagnosis. In this study, we propose a nuanced approach to ammonia testing in HE. Serum ammonia testing provides little additional benefit in clinical scenarios with a high or low pretest probability for HE. However, if the pretest probability for HE is uncertain, a low ammonia level may reduce the posttest probability of HE. In this scenario, other etiologies of altered mental status should be explored. Future research should focus on developing a standardized approach to serum ammonia collection, processing, and interpretation.

### Ammonia levels and hepatic encephalopathy in patients with known chronic liver disease [^114tYJ6x]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Ammonia is predominantly generated in the gut by intestinal bacteria and enzymes and detoxified primarily in the liver. Since the 1930s, ammonia has been identified as the principal culprit in hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Many physicians utilize serum ammonia to diagnose, assess severity, and determine the resolution of HE in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) despite research showing that ammonia levels are unhelpful in all of these clinical circumstances. HE in patients with CLD is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion that should not be based on ammonia levels.

### Ammonia levels Do not guide clinical management of patients with hepatic encephalopathy caused by cirrhosis [^114a9VtD]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ammonia appears to play a major role in the pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), but its role in guiding management is unclear. We aimed to understand the impact of ammonia levels on inpatient HE management, hypothesizing that patients with elevated ammonia levels would receive more aggressive lactulose therapy than patients with normal ammonia or no ammonia level drawn.

Methods

We examined patients with cirrhosis older than 18 years admitted for management of HE from 2005 to 2015. We additionally used propensity matching to control for confounding by the severity of underlying disease. Patients with an ammonia level taken at time of HE diagnosis were further separated into those with normal or elevated ammonia levels. The primary endpoint was the total lactulose (mL) amount (or dose) given in the first 48 hours of HE management.

Results

One thousand two hundred two admissions with HE were identified. Ammonia levels were drawn in 551 (46%) patients; 328 patients (60%) had an abnormal ammonia level (> 72 μmol/L). There were no significant differences in the Child-Pugh score, MELD, or Charlson Comorbidity Index in those with and without ammonia levels drawn. The average total lactulose dose over 48 hours was 167 and 171 mL in the no ammonia vs ammonia groups, respectively (P = 0.42). The average lactulose dose in patients with an elevated ammonia level was 161 mL, identical to the lactulose dose in patients with a normal ammonia level. There was no correlation between lactulose dose and ammonia level (R = 0.0026).

Discussion

Inpatient management of HE with lactulose was not influenced by either the presence or level of ammonia level, suggesting that ammonia levels do not guide therapy in clinical practice.

### Ammonia-induced stress response in liver disease progression and hepatic encephalopathy [^113HAQFC]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Ammonia levels are orchestrated by a series of complex interrelated pathways in which the urea cycle has a central role. Liver dysfunction leads to an accumulation of ammonia, which is toxic and is strongly associated with disruption of potassium homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, hypoxaemia and dysregulation of neurotransmission. Hyperammonaemia is a hallmark of hepatic encephalopathy and has been strongly associated with liver-related outcomes in patients with cirrhosis and liver failure. In addition to the established role of ammonia as a neurotoxin in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy, an increasing number of studies suggest that it can lead to hepatic fibrosis progression, sarcopenia, immune dysfunction and cancer. However, elevated systemic ammonia levels are uncommon in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. A clear causal relationship between ammonia-induced immune dysfunction and risk of infection has not yet been definitively proven. In this Review, we discuss the mechanisms by which ammonia produces its diverse deleterious effects and their clinical relevance in liver diseases, the importance of measuring ammonia levels for the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy, the prognosis of patients with cirrhosis and liver failure, and how our knowledge of inter-organ ammonia metabolism is leading to the development of novel therapeutic approaches.

### Variability and lability of ammonia levels in healthy volunteers and patients with cirrhosis: implications for trial design and clinical practice [^115fE9cg]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction:

Ammonia levels are used to assess hepatic encephalopathy, but their levels are highly variable in clinical practice.

Methods:

We studied factors associated with variation in ammonia values in cirrhotic patients without previous hepatic encephalopathy and healthy volunteers (HVs).

Results:

Ammonia increased by 12% and 18% at 1 and 2 hour, respectively, after a protein meal in 64 cirrhotic patients (P < 0.001). In 237 HVs, ammonia levels varied significantly between sites (P < 0.0001). New site-specific ammonia upper limits based on HV levels using a strict analysis protocol differed from routinely used values. Correlation between paired fresh samples was high (r = 0.83) but modest between fresh and frozen samples (r = 0.62).

Discussion:

Sample handling, processing, and protein intake impact ammonia levels across sites.

Regarding medical management for acute liver failure, more specifically with respect to management of hepatic encephalopathy, EASL 2017 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining invasive ICP monitoring in a highly selected subgroup of patients progressed to grade 3 or 4 coma, intubated and ventilated, and deemed at high risk of intracranial hypertension based on the presence of > 1 of the following variables:

- young patients with hyperacute or acute presentations,

- ammonia level > 150–200 mcmol/L not dropping with initial treatment interventions (RRT and fluids)

- renal impairment

- vasopressor support (> 0.1 mcg/kg/min).

### Fasting blood ammonia predicts risk and frequency of hepatic encephalopathy episodes in patients with cirrhosis [^112A25FW]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

There is controversy over the use of measuring blood levels of ammonia (NH3) in the management of patients with overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE).

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of data from a randomized, double-blind study of 178 patients with cirrhosis given glycerol phenylbutyrate (an NH3-lowering agent) or placebo for 16 weeks. Blood samples were collected at baseline and on study days 7 and 14 and NH3 levels were measured. The probabilities of having an HE episode, based on ammonia values, were modeled using binary logistic regression. A Cox proportional model was used to determine the risk of HE episodes in patients with baseline fasting NH3 levels ≤ 1.5-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN) versus patients with fasting NH3 levels > 1.5-fold the ULN.

Results

The risk and frequency of HE episodes and HE-related hospitalizations correlated with baseline (mean, 51 ± 6 μmol/L; ULN, 35 μmol/L) and on-study fasting levels of NH3, and increased sharply at levels > 1.5-fold the ULN. Regardless of baseline level, NH3 exposure and the relative risk of HE episodes were decreased by glycerol phenylbutyrate.

Conclusions

In analysis of data from a phase 2 study of the effects of glycerol phenylbutyrate in patients with cirrhosis, we found that fasting levels of NH3 in blood can identify patients at risk for HE-related morbidity. Patients with HE might benefit from NH3-lowering therapy. ClinicalTrials.gov no: NCT 00999167.

Hepatic encephalopathy

What are the best practices in management of hepatic encephalopathy?

Recommendation

Ammonia levels should be obtained to exclude or implicate HE as an etiology of altered mental status, but not to follow its progression or response to therapy. Initial treatment should include non-absorbable disaccharides and rifaximin.

### Correlation between ammonia levels and the severity of hepatic encephalopathy [^117XQRfy]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

Because the correlation between ammonia levels and the severity of hepatic encephalopathy remains controversial, we prospectively evaluated the correlation in 121 consecutive patients with cirrhosis.

Methods

The diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy was based on clinical criteria, and the severity of hepatic encephalopathy was based on the West Haven Criteria for grading of mental status. Arterial and venous blood samples were obtained from each patient. Four types of ammonia measurements were analyzed: arterial and venous total ammonia, and arterial and venous partial pressure of ammonia. Spearman rank correlations (r(s)) were calculated.

Results

Of the 121 patients, 30 (25%) had grade 0 encephalopathy (no signs or symptoms), 27 (22%) had grade 1, 23 (19%) had grade 2, 28 (23%) had grade 3, and 13 (11%) had grade 4 (the most severe signs and symptoms). Each of the four measures of ammonia increased with the severity of hepatic encephalopathy: arterial total ammonia (r(s) = 0.61, P ≤ 0.001), venous total ammonia (r(s) = 0.56, P ≤ 0.001), arterial partial pressure of ammonia (r(s) = 0.55, P ≤ 0.001), and venous partial pressure of ammonia (r(s) = 0.52, P ≤ 0.001).

Conclusion

Ammonia levels correlate with the severity of hepatic encephalopathy. Venous sampling is adequate for ammonia measurement. There appears to be no additional advantage of measuring the partial pressure of ammonia compared with total ammonia levels.

Hepatic encephalopathy diagnostic adjuncts — Testing for MHE and CHE could be used in patients who would most benefit from testing, such as those with impaired quality of life or implication on employment or public safety (GRADE II-2, B, 2), and increased blood ammonia alone does not add any diagnostic, staging, or prognostic value for HE in patients with CLD; a normal value calls for diagnostic reevaluation (GRADE II-3, A, 1).

### Variability and lability of ammonia levels in healthy volunteers and patients with cirrhosis: implications for trial design and clinical practice [^115TUXNb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is related to inflammation and ammonia. Although there is a statistical correlation between ammonia levels and HE grade, the overlap makes their clinical translation difficult. Careful pretrial planning and interpretation of results obtained from trials that depend on standardized ammonia levels requires evaluation of potential confounding factors. Therefore, we examined ammonia levels in cirrhotic patients (CPs) without previous overt HE. We specifically aimed to determine (i) the level and interindividual variability of fasting spot venous ammonia, (ii) impact of a standardized protein meal on the level of spot venous ammonia, and (iii) compare samples analyzed immediately or after flash freezing. We also compared the local reference range for ammonia in healthy volunteers (HVs) using standardized procedures for sampling and processing to each laboratory's routine processes.

### Variability and lability of ammonia levels in healthy volunteers and patients with cirrhosis: implications for trial design and clinical practice [^1153BJM7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

We conclude that sample handling, processing, and protein intake have a major impact on ammonia levels and are important to account for in multicenter studies, which highlight the unreliability of ammonia measures for clinical practice.

### Serum ammonia use: unnecessary, frequent and costly [^112hyTXn]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background/Objective

While ammonia plays a role in the complex pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), serum ammonia is unreliable for both diagnosis of, and correlation with, neurological symptoms in patients with cirrhosis. We aimed to quantify ordering, cost and appropriate use of serum ammonia in a major Midwestern healthcare system.

Design/Method

Serum ammonia ordering in adult patients presenting to a large Midwestern health system was evaluated from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2019.

Results

Serum ammonia ordering was prevalent, with 20338 tests ordered over 5 years. There were no differences in the number of inappropriate serum ammonia tests per 100000 admissions for chronic liver disease over time (Pearson's correlation coefficient = -0.24, p = 0.70). As a proportion of total ammonia tests ordered, inappropriate tests increased over time (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.91, p = 0.03). Inappropriate ordering was more common at community hospitals compared with the academic medical centre (99.3% vs 87.6%, p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Despite evidence that serum ammonia levels are unreliable for the diagnosis of HE and are not associated with severity of HE in individuals with cirrhosis, ordering remains prevalent, contributing to waste and potential harm.

### Prognostic role of ammonia in patients with cirrhosis [^116YtUCc]. Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Ammonia is thought to be central to the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), but its prognostic role in patients with cirrhosis and acute decompensation is unknown. The aims of this study were to determine the relationship between ammonia levels and severity of HE and its association with organ dysfunction and short-term mortality. We identified 498 patients from two institutions as part of prospective observational studies in patients with cirrhosis. Plasma ammonia levels were measured on admission and Chronic Liver Failure-Sequential Organ Failure Assessment criteria were used to determine the presence of organ failures. The 28-day patient survival was determined. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to identify the cutoff points for ammonia values, and multivariable analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazard regression model. The 28-day mortality was 43.4%. Plasma ammonia correlated with severity of HE (P < 0.001), was significantly higher in nonsurvivors (93 [73–121] versus 67 [55–89] µmol/L, P < 0.001), and was an independent predictor of 28-day mortality (hazard ratio, 1.009, P < 0.001). An ammonia level of 79.5 µmol/L had sensitivity of 68.1% and specificity of 67.4% for predicting 28-day mortality. An ammonia level of ≥ 79.5 µmol/L was associated with a higher frequency of organ failures (liver [P = 0.004], coagulation [P < 0.001], kidney [P = 0.004], and respiratory [P < 0.001]). Lack of improvement in baseline ammonia at day 5 was associated with high mortality (70.6%). Conclusion: Ammonia level correlates with not only the severity of HE but also the failure of other organs and is an independent risk factor for mortality; lack of improvement in ammonia level is associated with high risk of death, making it an important biomarker and a therapeutic target.

### AASLD practice guidance on acute-on-chronic liver failure and the management of critically ill patients with cirrhosis [^115KhUMC]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in critically ill cirrhosis — brain failure characterization and workup should be guided as follows: The West Haven HE criteria and the Glasgow Coma Scale should be used to characterize brain failure, with cutoffs of Grade 3 or 4 HE and Glasgow Coma Scale < 8 indicating severe injury; consider ICU admission for patients with Grades 3 and 4 HE; investigation and treatment of potential precipitating factors and empirical therapy for suspected HE should be performed; workup should include liver-unrelated causes of altered mental status, especially if this is the first episode of confusion or if a patient does not respond to empirical therapy or the precipitating factors are not readily identified; routine brain imaging in patients with presentation similar to prior episodes of HE is not warranted, though brain imaging could be considered for a first episode of altered mental status, seizures or new focal neurological signs, or an unsatisfactory response to therapy; routine ammonia level testing in patients with cirrhosis and altered mental status is not recommended, and a low ammonia level in patients with coma or confusion should point toward etiologies other than HE.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) — diagnostic differentiation from other causes: Because HE shares symptoms with concomitant disorders, differentiating HE from other causes can be difficult, and a normal blood ammonia level in a patient suspected of HE calls for consideration; none of the diagnostic measures used at present has been evaluated for their ability to differentiate HE from other causes; psychometric tests detect functional deficits but cannot differentiate causes; brain imaging results for diagnosing HE are disappointing; nevertheless, brain imaging should be done in every patient with chronic liver disease (CLD) and unexplained alteration of brain function to exclude structural lesions; in rare cases, reversibility by flumazenil may be useful.

### Asparaginase-associated hyperammonemia [^114QCpx9]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

We recommend reducing asparaginase doses with concomitant monitoring of asparaginase enzyme activity to ensure levels > 100 IU. The reduced amount of available asparaginase will result in a decrease of glutaminase activity and reduced levels of ammonia (Figure 1).

In patients with severe encephalopathy and high ammonia levels (≥ CTCAE grade 3) dialysis or plasmapheresis is considered an option in the intensive care setting, especially for patients with acute liver failure(Figure 1).

Currently, there are no guidelines on how to manage AAH. Based on our experience we propose treating only symptomatic patients. The choice of treatment options depends on the severity, according to CTCAE grade, of any encephalopathy (Figure 1).

Hepatic encephalopathy

Other possible etiologies of global neurologic decline should be investigated (e.g. hypoxia, hypercapnia, hypoglycemia, uremia, medications, delirium tremens, hypoactive delirium, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage). Elevated blood ammonia level (found in over 90% of cases) corroborates the clinical diagnosis, but correlation with the actual disease severity is poor. It should also be noted that monitoring blood ammonia levels is inferior to clinical assessment, and it is not recommended in asymptomatic patients. Benzodiazepines should be avoided and replaced with haloperidol when chemical restraint is indicated.

The classic protein-restricted diet does not find support in the current literature because most patients do not tolerate high-food/calorie intake. Furthermore, malnutrition is a much more significant concern. Despite ongoing debate, branched amino acid supplementation may also be beneficial. Other adjuncts, such as cathartics and oral antibiotics, are recommended in an attempt to decrease the intestinal production of ammonia due to bacterial overgrowth.

Lactulose, a non-absorbable sugar that causes osmotic diarrhea, has been traditionally used to treat hepatic encephalopathy. It acidifies the colon and promotes the conversion of ammonia to ammonium, which is not reabsorbed. Lactulose dosing should be titrated to two to three bowel movements per day. Known side effects of this therapy include electrolyte imbalances, nausea, and bloating.

Rifaximin, a semisynthetic drug derivative of rifampin, was originally employed as a second-line treatment for hepatic encephalopathy. In 2012, a meta-analysis of 12 randomized controlled trials stated that rifaximin had similar effectiveness compared to lactulose, with fewer side effects. A more recent, larger meta-analysis has also further supported its use, although the dominant limitation remains its high cost when compared to lactulose.

Hepatorenal syndrome

Euvolemia and electrolyte homeostasis should be maintained under strict clinical and laboratory monitoring. Acute kidney injury in the absence of hemodynamic instability, use of nephrotoxic drugs, or parenchymal renal disease suggests the diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome. Additional diagnostic criteria include no improvement in renal function after volume expansion with albumin and diuretic withdrawal. Treatment of hepatorenal syndrome requires the use of splanchnic vasoconstrictors (terlipressin, noradrenalin, or midodrine) and albumin infusion. Improved renal function has been demonstrated with medical treatment, but a mortality benefit is only ultimately achieved with liver transplantation. TIPS placement and renal and hepatic replacement therapies can be indicated as bridging strategies.

### To pee or not to pee: ammonia hypothesis of hepatic encephalopathy revisited [^115Z1zW8]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy is a neuropsychiatric syndrome associated with liver failure. Its aetiology has been debated for the past 100 years. Nevertheless, elevated ammonia levels are still believed to play a central role in its pathogenesis. After intestinal production, ammonia is detoxified by the liver. In liver failure, skeletal muscle and brain have been proposed to be alternative, although temporary, ammonia detoxifying organs. However, there is an increasing body of evidence that the kidney, in addition to the gut, is a pivotal organ determining systemic ammonia levels. In the last 20 years, it has been shown that the kidney can switch from an organ of systemic net ammonia production to a net ammonia excretion organ. The kidney plays a central role in the determination of ammonia levels. It is at least as important as the gut and could therefore serve as a target for new treatments for hepatic encephalopathy.

### Acute liver failure guidelines [^112s2YH9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Acute liver failure (ALF) — central nervous system management emphasizes ICU monitoring and airway protection by encephalopathy grade, structured ICP therapies, and careful sodium management. Patients with ALF with grade 2 or higher encephalopathy should be monitored in an ICU setting, and those with advanced grade 3–4 hepatic encephalopathy should undergo endotracheal intubation for airway protection; lactulose should be discontinued in this setting. First-line treatment of increased intracranial pressure includes hyperosmolar therapy (mannitol, hypertonic saline), hyperventilation, and continuous renal replacement therapy, and hyponatremia should be avoided; it is a common practice to target serum sodium 145–150 mmol/L without supporting literature, and where correction is undertaken, it should be accomplished at a slow rate, not exceeding 6–8 mmol/L in 24 hours. General recommendations are for 3% saline as a 250–500 mL bolus or continuous infusion to maintain serum sodium levels below 160 mmol/L. Continuous renal replacement therapy has been shown to effectively lower ammonia levels in ALF, and reduced ammonia has been associated with reduced mortality and increased transplant-free survival at 21 days. Routine ICP monitor placement lacks conclusive evidence and may be considered only in centers with expertise and in highly selected patients; there is no conclusive evidence to recommend routine use of hypothermia to control ICP, and a review concluded it did not improve overall patient survival despite efficacy and a low risk of bleeding. There is also no conclusive evidence to recommend for or against lactulose or rifaximin for encephalopathy treatment in ALF.

RESULTS

Part 1

We enrolled 64 CPs (age 59.8 ± 7.0 years, 58% male, MELD 8.43 ± 2.21) from 3 centers. All patients tolerated the protein load without any signs of HE or confusion during the postmeal period. Baseline fasted venous ammonia levels were 33.71 (SD 13.78; range 18–85) μmol/L, which increased to 37.71 (13.86; 17–80) and 39.82 (15.20; 17–96) μmol/L 1 and 2 hours postmeal, respectively. This represented a 12% and 18% increase relative to baseline (P < 0.001, Figure 1). Interindividual variability was 71% of the total variance (SD = 9.3 μmol/L), whereas intraindividual variability was 29% (SD = 5.9 μmol/L). These changes were independent of age and sex. The MELD score was correlated with ammonia levels at baseline and at all time points with an 8% increase in ammonia levels with every point MELD rise.

In cirrhotic patients without previous overt hepatic encephalopathy, the change in ammonia levels 1 and 2 hours after 20 g standardized protein meal are presented. Individual data, median, and 95% CI are shown, demonstrating a significant increase over baseline at 1- and 2-hour time points.

Patients experiencing acute elevations of ammonia present to the ICU with encephalopathy, which may progress quickly to cerebral herniation. Patient survival requires immediate treatment of intracerebral hypertension and the reduction of ammonia levels. When hyperammonemia is not thought to be the result of liver failure, treatment for an occult disorder of metabolism must begin prior to the confirmation of an etiology. This article reviews ammonia metabolism, the effects of ammonia on the brain, the causes of hyperammonemia, and the diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism in adult patients.

### Variability and lability of ammonia levels in healthy volunteers and patients with cirrhosis: implications for trial design and clinical practice [^115qC1VQ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The current multicenter experience demonstrates that wide variability and lability of serum ammonia levels can confound interpretation, which highlights the unreliability of ammonia as a clinical measure. These results are consistent with American Association for Study of Liver Disease/European Association for the Study of Liver guidelines recommending against using ammonia levels alone for managing HE. This is relevant when ammonia levels are used as the major determinant of trial entry or success/failure. Variation in ammonia levels between sites additionally confounds ammonia level interpretation, particularly because it biases uniformity of the ULN. Correlation with MELD likely reflects hepatic synthetic dysfunction. Interestingly, this variation was reduced but not eliminated even with a detailed protocol for blood draw and analysis, rarely followed in routine clinical practice. Moreover, norms generated using ULN from healthy controls were largely different from those that were followed locally. This further demonstrates the need to restandardize ammonia measurements (as has been encouraged for aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and international normalized ratio) for research.

We also found a major discordance between frozen-thawed and freshly drawn ammonia samples. This poses a challenge to multicenter trials using central laboratories to analyze flash-frozen samples. These results further suggest that if ammonia levels are to be used as an outcome measure in clinical trials, local analytic parameters must likely be standardized.

Previous single-center HV studies have demonstrated an increase in ammonia with high protein loads (30 and 60 g), as have single-center studies with glutamine and other amino acids. Our study extends this experience of ammonia lability using a shake with only 20 g of protein, which better replicates a "real-world" experience. This result could inform studies that rely on multiple inpatient and outpatient blood draws to time ammonia sampling with respect to meals.

### Hepatic encephalopathy: from pathophysiology to therapeutic management [^113kTTNW]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy is a complex and potentially reversible neuropsychiatric syndrome complicating acute or chronic liver disease. Clinical manifestations are multiple and varied, ranging from minimal neurological changes to coma. Ammonia is the main toxic substance involved in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy, although other mechanisms, such as modifications of the blood-brain barrier, disruptions in neurotransmission and abnormalities in GABAergic and benzodiazepine pathways may also play a role. The identification and treatment of precipitating factors is crucial in the management of patients with hepatic encephalopathy. Current treatments are based on reducing intestinal ammonia load by agents such as antibiotics or disaccharides, although their efficacy is yet to be clearly established.

Pediatric acute liver failure — ammonia levels and encephalopathy risk note clinically important thresholds and cautions: Ammonia levels of > 100 µmol/L on admission represent an independent risk factor for the development of high-grade HE, and a level of > 200 µmol/L is strongly associated with cerebral herniation; medical therapy targeting ammonia reduction is often prescribed; lactulose may be favored over rifaximin given its mechanism of action and shorter time to clinical effect, however no definitive data suggests that either impact clinical outcomes; mechanisms driving HE extend beyond ammonia so reliance upon a singular ammonia value to determine the presence of HE should be avoided, with its measurement supporting the clinical assessment at the bedside.

### Noninvasive assessment of hepatic decompensation [^116ph2ps]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The presence of ascites is commonly clinically overt. However, patients with compensated cirrhosis have regular ultrasound examinations, which occasionally detect small amounts (grade 1) of ascites. Although minimal ascites are not considered decompensation, affected patients appear to have poorer prognoses. Interestingly, grade 1 ascites were not associated with a higher rate of progression to overt ascites, suggesting that these patients do not necessarily need diuretic treatment, but it was associated with a higher level of systemic inflammation as compared with no ascites.

Overt HE (West Haven grade ≥ II) is usually diagnosed on clinical grounds, but because normal values of plasma ammonia rule out overt HE with a high negative predictive value, measurement of ammonia may be done in patients with acute encephalopathy to exclude other causes of cognitive impairment. On a more exploratory note, elevated levels of ammonia have shown to predict hospitalization with liver-related complications in stable outpatients with cirrhosis. However, one should be aware that measuring and using serum ammonia has limitations including handling and processing time of the sample having a significant impact on the ammonia levels. Further, no upper limit of normal or generally accepted diagnostic cutoff exists, and ammonia levels overlap in patients with HE of various grades. –

A diagnosis of covert HE requires neuropsychological or psychometric tests. These tests include the simple Animal Naming Test, for bedside use, and the gold standard psychometric HE score. Because covert HE is associated with a higher risk of overt HE and impaired patient-reported outcomes, EASL guidelines suggest screening for covert HE and treatment with lactulose if present, even if supported by a low level of evidence.

### A capillary blood ammonia bedside test following glutamine load to improve the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhosis [^114BNQFy]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common complication of cirrhosis that affects quality of life, increases the risk of accidents, and is an independent predictor of poor outcome. When neurological deficits are subtle but the neurological clinical examination is normal, a condition referred to as minimal HE, patients are exposed to a risk of developing clinical episodes of HE over time. The presence of HE in cirrhosis is a prognostic marker of severity and a valid indication for liver transplantation, although it is not considered in the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score on which organ distribution is based in most liver transplant centres.

Neurological alterations observed in HE are postulated to result from the exposure of the brain to abnormally elevated concentrations of ammonia present in the general circulation in response to liver insufficiency and portosystemic collaterals. Accordingly, high ammonia levels have been associated with large portosystemic collaterals such as esophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis. However, ammonia determination is not currently accepted as a reliable marker to identify patients with HE. Hyperammonemia arises from the production by colonic bacteria and the small intestine through an increased intestinal glutaminase activity. Although the pathogenesis of HE is still incompletely elucidated, the ammonia hypothesis remain central and a large number of experimental data support the role of hyperammonemia in the direct and indirect alterations of brain function that characterize HE.

Hepatic encephalopathy management strategy — Patients with higher grades of HE who are at risk or unable to protect their airway need more intensive monitoring and are ideally managed in an intensive care setting, and alternative causes of encephalopathy are not infrequent in patients with advanced cirrhosis. Controlling precipitating factors in the management of OHE is of paramount importance, because nearly 90% of patients can be treated with just correction of the precipitating factor, and careful attention to this issue is still the cornerstone of HE management.

### Assessment of the spectrum of hepatic encephalopathy: a multicenter study [^117UEheu]. Liver Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a major cause of morbidity in cirrhosis. However, its severity assessment is often subjective, which needs to be studied systematically. The aim was to determine how accurately trainee and nontrainee practitioners grade and manage HE patients throughout its severity. We performed a survey study using standardized simulated patient videos at 4 US and 3 Canadian centers. Participants were trainees (gastroenterology/hepatology fellows) and nontrainees (faculty, nurse practitioners, physician assistants). We determined the accuracy of HE severity identification and management options between grades < 2 or ≥ 2 HE and trainees/nontrainees. In total, 108 respondents (62 trainees, 46 nontrainees) were included. For patients with grades < 2 versus ≥ 2 HE, a higher percentage of respondents were better at correctly diagnosing grades ≥ 2 compared with grades < 2 (91% versus 64%; P < 0.001). Specialized cognitive testing was checked significantly more often in grades < 2, whereas more aggressive investigation for precipitating factors was ordered in HE grades > 2. Serum ammonia levels were ordered in almost a third of grade ≥ 2 patients. For trainees and nontrainees, HE grades were identified similarly between groups. Trainees were less likely to order serum ammonia and low-protein diets, more likely to order rifaximin, and more likely to perform a more thorough workup for precipitating factors compared with nontrainee respondents. There was excellent concordance in the classification of grade ≥ 2 HE between nontrainees versus trainees, but lower grades showed discordance. Important differences were seen regarding blood ammonia, specialized testing, and nutritional management between trainees and nontrainees. These results have important implications at the patient level, interpreting multicenter clinical trials, and in the education of practitioners. Liver Transplantation 24 587–594 2018 AASLD.

### Sodium phenylbutyrate (Olpruva) [^113HsZZf]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Dosage

OLPRUVA treatment should be supervised by a healthcare provider experienced in the treatment of urea cycle disorders.

The recommended dosage of OLPRUVA for patients with urea cycle disorders is 9.9–13 g/m2/day orally. Divide the calculated total daily dose into three to six doses. Administer as three to six divided doses and take with food.

Round each individual dose of OLPRUVA to the nearest available dosage strength. The maximum dosage is 20 grams per day. Combine OLPRUVA with dietary protein restriction and, in some cases, amino acid supplementation (e.g., essential amino acids, arginine, citrulline, and protein-free calorie supplements).

If a dose is missed, take the missed dose as soon as possible on the same day.

2.2 Dosage Administration and Monitoring

Monitor plasma ammonia levels to determine the need for dosage adjustment. Adjust the OLPRUVA dosage to maintain the plasma ammonia level within the normal range for the patient's age, taking into consideration their clinical condition (e.g., nutritional requirements, protein intake, growth parameters, etc.).

Monitor patients for potential neurotoxicity and obtain measurements of plasma phenylacetate and phenylacetylglutamine levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Adverse Reactions (6)]. If neurologic symptoms (e.g., vomiting, nausea, headache, somnolence, or confusion) are present in the absence of high ammonia levels or other incurrent illnesses, consider reducing the dose of OLPRUVA.

2.3 Dosage Adjustment in Patients with Hepatic Impairment

For patients with hepatic impairment, start at the lower end of the recommended dosing range and maintain patients on the lowest dose necessary to control plasma ammonia levels [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

2.4 Preparation and Administration Instructions

For oral administration only. Do not administer via gastrostomy or nasogastric tubes.

Pour the entire contents of the Mix-Aid packet into approximately 4 ounces of water in a cup and stir, forming a suspension.
Pour the entire contents of the OLPRUVA packet(s) into the suspension and stir.
Drink the entire suspension within 5 minutes after stirring to minimize dissolution of coating. After 30 minutes, the suspension should be discarded.
Pour another 4 ounces of water into the cup and drink to make sure that any OLPRUVA remaining in the cup is consumed.

### Prevalence of minimal hepatic encephalopathy in patients with liver cirrhosis: a multicenter study [^113RouHF]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE), in particular in different subgroups, remains unknown. This study aimed to analyze the prevalence of MHE in different subgroups to identify patients at high risk and to pave the way for personalized screening approaches.

Methods

In this study, data of patients recruited at 10 centers across Europe and the United States were analyzed. Only patients without clinical signs of hepatic encephalopathy were included. MHE was detected using the Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score (PHES, cut-off < or ≤ -4 depending on local norms). Clinical and demographic characteristics of the patients were assessed and analyzed.

Results

In total, 1,868 patients with cirrhosis with a median model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) of 11 were analyzed (Child-Pugh [CP] stages: A 46%, B 42%, and C 12%). In the total cohort, MHE was detected by PHES in 650 patients (35%). After excluding patients with a history of overt hepatic encephalopathy, the prevalence of MHE was 29%. In subgroup analyses, the prevalence of MHE in patients with CP A was low (25%), whereas it was high in CP B or C (42% and 52%). In patients with a MELD score < 10, the prevalence of MHE was only 25%, but it was 48% in patients with a MELD score ≥ 20. Standardized ammonia levels (ammonia level/upper limit of normal of each center) correlated significantly, albeit weakly with PHES (Spearman ρ = -0.16, P < 0.001).

Discussion

The prevalence of MHE in patients with cirrhosis was high but varied substantially between diseases stages. These data may pave the way for more individualized MHE screening approaches.

### Serum ammonia in cirrhosis: clinical impact of hyperammonemia, utility of testing, and national testing trends [^112s1ueE]. Clinical Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Ammonia is central to the pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in cirrhosis. Serum ammonia levels have prognostic value and have been implicated in sarcopenia, hepatotoxicity, and immune dysfunction. Studies indicate that clinicians frequently order serum ammonia levels in decompensated cirrhosis; however, the clinical utility of serum ammonia levels has been questioned, citing challenges in accurate measurement and interpretation. This article involves a primary review of the literature to evaluate the importance of serum ammonia in cirrhosis and examines the clinical utility of serum ammonia levels in the management of HE. In addition to the review, we conducted primary research using national claims data to investigate national trends in practitioner use of serum ammonia.

Methods

We identified all hospitalizations in a national commercial claims database with and without ammonia testing among adults with noncirrhotic chronic liver disease and cirrhosis from January 1, 2007, to September 31, 2015. We calculated the proportion of hospitalizations with ammonia testing and the number of ammonia tests per 1000 hospital-days.

Findings

Proportion of hospitalizations with ammonia testing and ammonia tests per 1000 inpatient-days increased significantly from 2007 to 2015, and particularly in 2014 and 2015, for all groups.

Implications

A review of the literature indicated that elevated serum ammonia contributes to neurotoxicity, sarcopenia, and immune dysfunction in cirrhosis. However, serum ammonia testing has not had consistent benefit in clinical diagnosis or management of HE in cirrhosis. Claims data indicated that ammonia testing increased substantially during the study period, particularly after the advent of electronic medical record systems. The rapid increase in testing may suggest that electronic health records play a crucial role in test volume by facilitating easy ordering and could be leveraged to improved value-based serum ammonia ordering. Serum ammonia levels may also benefit from standardized guidelines on collection, laboratory analysis, and interpretation.

### Measurement of ammonia in blood [^112Cxdh6]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

The measurement of ammonia, now known to be a normal constituent of all body fluids, is fraught with problems. An elevated ammonia level in blood (100 micromol/L or higher) is an indicator of an abnormality in nitrogen homeostasis. The collection, handling, storage, and analysis of blood samples, their limitations, and potential sources of error are discussed. New techniques that permit continuous or real-time estimates of systemic ammonia levels over a broad range are also discussed. The aim should always be to minimize the release of ammonia from the collected sample before analysis. Recommendations are made on the collection and processing of blood samples, for it is by standardization and rigid adherence to these techniques that the reliability of the test results will be improved.

Introduction

Patients with an impaired liver function caused by end-stage liver disease or liver failure can develop hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Brain function is impaired in HE. Even though the precise underlying pathophysiology of HE is unclear, it is widely accepted that increased amounts of ammonia in the systemic circulation is a key factor. Ammonia is produced during the metabolism of amino acids and other compounds that contain nitrogen and in the intestine by intestinal bacterial flora. Physiologically ammonia is cleared in the liver where it is converted to urea via the urea cycle. Urea is water-soluble and is subsequently excreted via the urine. If this system is somehow compromised, systemic ammonia levels rise, with the potential to cross the blood–brain barrier and cause brain damage. When ammonia levels rise acutely, astrocytes increase the conversion of ammonia into glutamine via glutamine synthase, which causes brain edema. Second, due to the increased glutamine production, there is an increase of reactive oxygen species, which triggers inflammatory cascades. It is hypothesized that, in chronically elevated ammonia, the enzyme glutamine synthase is downregulated, resulting in lower glutamine and higher brain ammonia levels. Ammonia is also directly neurotoxic, enhancing inhibitory signaling through multiple mechanisms, including GABA and glutamate. In patients with liver disease, HE is a predictor of poor outcome, and it is associated with a 1-year mortality of up to 54% and, therefore, a serious complication. Currently, treatment for HE in hepatic failure or portosystemic shunting is directed at reducing ammonia concentrations by reducing production and absorption in the intestines, mainly through the use of nonabsorbable disaccharides, such as lactulose and lactitol, and antibiotics such as rifaximin. However, no universally accepted guidelines for the treatment of HE exist.

### Ammonia-lowering strategies for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy [^115dHJXb]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Hyperammonemia leads to neurotoxic levels of brain ammonia and is a major factor involved in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Ammonia-lowering treatments primarily involve two strategies: inhibiting ammonia production and/or increasing ammonia removal. Targeting the gut has been the primary focus for many years, with the goal of inhibiting the generation of ammonia. However, in the context of liver failure, extrahepatic organs containing ammonia metabolic pathways have become new potential ammonia-lowering targets. Skeletal muscle has the capacity to remove ammonia by producing glutamine through the enzyme glutamine synthetase (amidation of glutamate) and, given its large mass, has the potential to be an important ammonia-removing organ. On the other hand, glutamine can be deaminated to glutamate by phosphate-activated glutaminase, thus releasing ammonia (ammonia rebound). Therefore, new treatment strategies are being focused on stimulating the removal of both ammonia and glutamine.

Advances in Management of ALF

The medical management of ALF has not been extensively studied and remains poorly defined. In the absence of evidence-based clinical trials, experts from 23 centers in the United States have proposed detailed management guidelines by consensus. Since the last AASLD Position Paper, several noteworthy advances have been made in assessing the risk of developing, and managing, specific complications of ALF.

A detailed analysis of serum ammonia in patients with ALF identified a concentration of 75 μM as an important threshold below which patients rarely develop intracranial hypertension (ICH). Conversely, arterial ammonia levels of > 100 μM on admission represent an independent risk factor for the development of high-grade hepatic encephalopathy, and a level of > 200 μM predicts ICH. The risk of developing ICH is decreased by raising the serum sodium to 145–155 mEq/L with hypertonic saline. Once established, however, the medical treatment of ICH must bridge patients to liver transplantation, because no treatment permanently reverses cerebral edema. In cases of ICH refractory to osmotic agents (e.g. mannitol and hypertonic saline), therapeutic hypothermia (cooling to a core temperature of 32°C-34°C) has been shown to bridge patients to transplantation, but is associated with a theoretical risk of impairing liver regeneration.

To optimize neurological recovery after ALF, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) must be raised to avoid cerebral underperfusion and anoxia. In hypotensive patients with ALF, intravascular volume should be repleted first with normal saline, and vasopressors should be administered subsequently to titrate the MAP to > 75 mmHg and CPP to 60–80 mmHg. Vasopressin, or its analog, terlipressin, is often added to norepinephrine in critically ill patients who remain hypotensive on norepinephrine, but was reported to increase intracranial pressure (ICP) in patients with ALF. More recent data suggest, however, that vasopressin and analogs increase cerebral perfusion without increasing ICP and may be used safely as an adjunct to norepinephrine.

It is generally accepted that patients with ALF have a bleeding diathesis based upon elevation of the international normalized ratio (INR). Concern about the safety of inserting ICP monitors and other invasive devices has prompted the use of recombinant factor VIIa, although the practice has been associated with thrombotic complications in patients with ALF. However, a recent study has suggested that global hemostasis assessed by thromboelastography usually remains normal, suggesting that the perceived bleeding risk based upon INR may be overstated.

### A capillary blood ammonia bedside test following glutamine load to improve the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhosis [^113baQqx]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Making a diagnosis of HE may be straightforward when a patient with cirrhosis presents with obvious neurological deficits such as altered consciousness, but it is much more challenging in the presence of more subtle neuropsychological or personality changes that are not uncommon in an outpatient population of cirrhotics (up to 62% in a recent report). In fact, it is recommended to search for minimal HE in patients who complain of cognitive alterations, a disturbed sleep, or are exposed to an accident risk while driving or at their work-place. As neurological deficits associated with minimal HE are clinically subtle, this complication may be underdiagnosed and may negatively impact patients' management. Accordingly, minimal HE can be accessible to medical therapy that may improve quality of life and prevent the development of clinical episodes of overt HE.

In clinical practice, the available tools for the diagnosis of HE include clinical scales to assess the mental status, such as the West-Haven scale, and a number of psychometric tests to assess the presence of congnitive deficits. Neuroradiological imaging is mostly directed at excluding other neurological disorders. Blood ammonia concentration in the context of HE is difficult to interpret, as the correlation between neurological symptoms and ammonia blood levels is variable, with a wide overlap across different stages of HE. Some, but not all studies report a closer correlation with arterial as compared to venous ammonia blood levels. The diagnosis of minimal HE is therefore challenging for the clinician who has to choose between a suboptimal biological test or a number of neuropsychological tests that may be time consuming, need to be adjusted for several parameters, and are subject to learning biases.

To improve the performance of blood ammonia for the diagnosis of minimal HE, we hypothesized that measuring ammonia in arterialized blood following oral glutamine-induced hyperammonemia and consecutive cognitive deterioration would increase the diagnostic yield of this biological test. Therefore, we explored the value of capillary blood ammonia measured at bedside following an oral glutamine challenge to unmask HE in patients with cirrhosis.

### A capillary blood ammonia bedside test following glutamine load to improve the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhosis [^113Jt7LU]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, we demonstrated that determination of capillary blood ammonia after a bedside oral glutamine challenge is feasible, well tolerated and superior to basal levels for the diagnosis of minimal HE in patients with cirrhosis and moderate to severe liver failure. The increase in blood ammonia, absent in healthy subjects, correlated imperfectly with the deterioration in psychometric tests. Thus, in spite of a recognized important pathogenic role in HE, blood ammonia, even in a capillary, arterialized vascular bed, remains an approximate marker for the presence of HE. According to our data in unselected patients with cirrhosis, ammonia determination in capillary blood after an oral glutamine challenge is not a valid tool for the diagnosis of HE and a poor predictor of future clinical episodes of HE.

Statistical analysis

Statistical tests were performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences SPSS version 10.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA) Continuous variables were expressed as mean and standard deviation or median value (interquartile range [IQR]) as appropriate. The results of psychometric tests were transformed into Z-scores, which allows to normalize the value to a standard distribution curve. We used the Wilcoxon-signed rank, and chi-squared test as appropriate. To test for blood ammonia changes over time, we used the one way repeated measures ANOVA test with Dunnett's test. We constructed receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curves to assess for overall accuracy of capillary blood ammonia levels and to identify optimal cutoffs. To identify independent predictors of development of HE episodes during follow-up, we performed a multivariate logistic regression analysis using a Cox proportional hazard model. A 2-sided p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### Dispelling myths in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy [^1139Jmbj]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Guidelines for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy suggest ammonia reduction as the main focus, based on strategies to reduce ammonia's generation and absorption in the colon by using lactulose and a reduced protein diet.

Starting Point

Two studies provide compelling and provocative data questioning the relevance of these interventions. Bodils Als-Nielsen and colleagues, in a systematic review of randomised trials, found insufficient evidence about whether non-absorbable disaccharides are beneficial (BMJ 2004; 328: 1046–50). In a small randomised study, Juan Cordoba and colleagues showed that diets with normal protein content can be administered safely during episodic hepatic encephalopathy due to cirrhosis and that protein restriction does not have any beneficial effect during such episodes (J Hepatol 2004; 41: 38–43).

Where Next

Two approaches to new therapies for hepatic encephalopathy are needed. First, it is important to focus on the interorgan metabolism of ammonia. The small intestine and kidneys might be important producers of ammonia, and muscle is an important organ that can remove ammonia. Novel therapies targeting these organs reduce ammonia. Second, research is needed to explore factors other than ammonia that might be important in hepatic encephalopathy, including the synergistic role of inflammation. The lack of conclusive data about the efficacy of any treatment supports the view that placebo-controlled trials of newer agents are needed and ethical. The emphasis should shift to aggressive management of the precipitating event.

### Persistent hyperammonemia is associated with complications and poor outcomes in patients with acute liver failure [^115z4TDw]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Patients admitted to the hospital with acute liver failure (ALF) and high arterial levels of ammonia are more likely to have complications and poor outcomes than patients with lower levels of ammonia. ALF is a dynamic process; ammonia levels can change over time. We investigated whether early changes (first 3 days after admission) in arterial levels of ammonia were associated with complications and outcomes and identified factors associated with persistent hyperammonemia.

Methods

We performed a prospective observational study that measured arterial ammonia levels each day for 5 days in 295 consecutive patients with ALF. We analyzed associations of changes in ammonia levels during the first 3 days with complications and outcomes.

Results

Patients with persistent arterial hyperammonemia (≥ 122 μmol/L for 3 consecutive days), compared with those with decreasing levels, had lower rates of survival (23% vs 72%; P < .001) and higher percentages of cerebral edema (71% vs 37%; P < .001), infection (67% vs 28%; p = 0.003), and seizures (41% vs 7.7%; P < .001). Patients with persistent hyperammonemia had greater mortality, with an odds ratio (OR) of 10.7, compared with patients with baseline levels of ammonia ≥ 122 μmol/L (OR, 2.4). Patients with persistent hyperammonemia were more likely to progress to and maintain advanced hepatic encephalopathy than those with decreasing levels. Patients with persistent, mild hyperammonemia (≥ 85 μmol/L for 3 days) were also more likely to have complications or die (P < .001) than patients with serial ammonia levels < 85 μmol/L. Infections (OR, 4.17), renal failure (OR, 2.20), and decreased arterial pH (OR, 0.003) were independent predictors of persistent hyperammonemia.

Conclusions

Patients with ALF and persistent arterial hyperammonemia for 3 days after admission are more likely to develop complications and have greater mortality than patients with decreasing levels or high baseline levels. Infection, renal failure, and decreased arterial pH are independent predictors of persistent hyperammonemia.

Based on the adult literature, a patient's protein requirements should be met and protein intake should not be decreased with the sole purpose of addressing rising ammonia levels. Mineral and trace elements deficiencies should be monitored and age-appropriate single/multivitamin products used as supplementation, as needed, although the optimal frequency of monitoring has not been established.

### Nitric oxide, ammonia, and CRP levels in cirrhotic patients with hepatic encephalopathy: is there a connection? [^111XgQkD]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Goals

Comparison of nitric oxide (NO) levels in cirrhotic patients with and without hepatic encephalopathy (HE), evaluation of possible correlation between HE and other clinical or laboratory characteristics, and estimation of utilization of NO levels in clinical practice.

Background

HE is a neuropsychiatric complication of cirrhosis. The exact pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the presence of HE are not known. However, dysfunction of the NO pathway and ammonia detoxification are thought to play a major role.

Study

Sixty-seven cirrhotic patients, 36 (53.7%) without HE, and 31 (46.3%) with HE were included in the study. Eighteen healthy individuals were used as control group. Clinical and laboratory data, including ammonia and stable end products of NO using Griess reaction, were collected.

Results

NOx levels were statistically significantly higher in cirrhotic patients (225.5 μmol/L) than in control group [(67.94 μmol/L) (P = 0.000)]. NOx levels were, also, statistically significantly higher in patients with HE compared with patients without HE (324.67 μmol/L vs. 141.96 μmol/L, P = 0.000). Significant correlation between the presence of HE and NOx, ammonia, C-reactive protein, albumin, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, and Child-Pugh classification revealed. NOx levels also correlated with severity of HE. NOx and ammonia are independent factors predicting HE according to regression analysis. Diagnostic accuracy for the diagnosis of HE using a combination of NOx and ammonia was superior compared with standalone NOx or ammonia utilization.

Conclusions

NOx levels are correlated with the presence and severity of HE. NOx levels determination, in addition to ammonia levels, could contribute in diagnosis of HE.

### Covert hepatic encephalopathy: not as minimal as you might think [^116LcuZQ]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a serious neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive complication of acute and chronic liver disease. Symptoms are often overt (confusion, disorientation, ataxia, or coma) but can also be subtle (difficulty with cognitive abilities such as executive decision-making and psychomotor speed). There is consensus that HE is characterized as a spectrum of neuropsychiatric symptoms in the absence of brain disease, ranging from overt HE (OHE) to minimal HE (MHE). The West Haven Criteria are most often used to grade HE, with scores ranging from 0–4 (4 being coma). However, it is a challenge to diagnose patients with MHE or grade 1 HE; it might be practical to combine these entities and name them covert HE for clinical use. The severity of HE is associated with the stage of liver disease. Although the pathologic mechanisms of HE are not well understood, they are believed to involve increased levels of ammonia and inflammation, which lead to low-grade cerebral edema. A diagnosis of MHE requires dedicated psychometric tests and neurophysiological techniques rather than a simple clinical assessment. Although these tests can be difficult to perform in practice, they are cost effective and important; the disorder affects patients' quality of life, socioeconomic status, and driving ability and increases their risk for falls and the development of OHE. Patients with MHE are first managed by excluding other causes of neurocognitive dysfunction. Therapy with gut-specific agents might be effective. We review management strategies and important areas of research for MHE and covert HE.

### Sodium benzoate for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in humans and animals: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112MBPrC]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

In the subgroup analysis of animal studies, pooled data were used for Campollo et al.'s study. In this study, three subgroups received an SB analog in different doses (250, 500, and 1000 mg). Pooled data were used instead of including the three subgroups apart from each other as is preferable according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

With only a few trials performed with this drug for this specific indication, all studies demonstrate a positive effect, which could imply a successful drug or positive publication bias. To evaluate risk of publication bias, Egger's regression-based test was performed, and this was not statistically significant, indicating a low risk for publication bias. Limitations of this test are that nine studies were included, 10 studies are generally considered to be the lower limit to use this test to distinguish real asymmetry.

Neurological assessment would have been our preferred primary outcome measurement for HE. Keeping in mind, however, that neurological assessment has not been described in all studies, differences in ammonia levels were chosen as the primary outcome instead, theorizing that this would allow for the inclusion of more articles. While measuring ammonia concentration to support the diagnosis of HE has been scrutinized due to poor correlation, studies have shown strong correlations between plasma ammonia levels and severity of HE. The other toxic metabolites such as glutamine in plasma and brain would be future additional endpoints to take into account.

Conclusion

SB appears to be an effective additional treatment for reducing ammonia levels in HE caused by end-stage liver disease, liver failure, or portosystemic shunting. Typically, SB is used as an add-on therapy when standard treatments have failed, or in acute situations where the effect of standard therapy cannot be awaited.

However, more high-quality studies are needed to provide stronger evidence and draw more definitive conclusions. A well-designed, prospective double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled trial is necessary, where all patients receive standard therapy along with either SB or placebo. The ethical question arises whether it is justifiable to withhold this treatment given the substantial indirect evidence supporting its use.

### Role of determination of partial pressure of ammonia in cirrhotic patients with and without hepatic encephalopathy [^11118ApZ]. Journal of Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

To compare venous, arterial and partial pressure of ammonia (pNH(3)) in 27 consecutive cirrhotics with hepatic encephalopathy, 15 cirrhotics without hepatic encephalopathy and nine controls; to reevaluate all parameters after the improvement of encephalopathy.

Methods

Patients were studied by clinical examination and psychometric testing. pNH(3) was calculated from arterial ammonia and pH.

Results

In patients with encephalopathy, each form of ammonia was higher than in both controls and patients without encephalopathy. The correlation with the severity of hepatic encephalopathy was similar for venous (r = 0.72), arterial ammonia (r = 0.76) and pNH(3) (r = 0.75). The sensitivity and specificity of each variable in correctly classifying the patients as having or not having hepatic encephalopathy was also similar. Each form of ammonia decreased after the resolution or amelioration of symptoms. However, even in the 17 patients with complete resolution of hepatic encephalopathy, all three ammonia determinations resulted unchanged or increased in some patients.

Conclusions

Despite the significant correlation between pNH(3) and hepatic encephalopathy, our study suggests that neither pNH(3) nor arterial ammonia are, from a clinical point of view, more useful than venous ammonia: all three determinations being limited both for the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy and for the clinical management of the patients.

### Pediatric acute liver failure: reexamining key clinical features, current management, and research prospects [^116g8tZj]. Liver Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Given the nuances of determining etiology, the need for early aggressive management, and the potential need for emergent LT, patients should be cared for in pediatric LT centers as early in the disease course as possible given the rapidly progressive and unpredictable nature of disease. Patients who are transferred earlier to pediatric transplant centers, before developing hepatic encephalopathy, have better outcomes than those who are transferred later.

Physiology of multiorgan failure in

The natural course of PALF results in either recovery or death. For patients with decompensating and progressive disease, intensive care is imperative. Patients may develop cardiac dysfunction, including peripheral vasodilation with decreased systemic vascular resistance and low mean arterial blood pressure in the setting of hyperdynamic cardiac failure. Respiratory compromise can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome as a result of fluid overload, and patients may require endotracheal intubation, especially to protect the airway in the setting of hepatic encephalopathy. Acute kidney injury or even renal failure is also a commonly observed complication among the PALF population and is associated with increased mortality. Kidney injury can be attributed to intrarenal vasoconstriction and decreased renal perfusion as well as drug toxicity, hypovolemia, and sepsis. Renal function typically recovers as hepatic function improves. Patients with PALF require careful monitoring of electrolytes as they are at risk of hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia. Persistent hypoglycemia can represent an ominous sign of complete hepatic necrosis, with an inability to maintain euglycemia in the absence of gluconeogenesis. For the most part, maintenance of normal electrolyte ranges is optimal. In the event of increased intracranial pressure, hypernatremia may be indicated, but outside of cerebral complications, normal serum Na levels ought to be maintained.

Although hyperammonemia is involved in the development of hepatic encephalopathy because of its neurotoxic nature, the degree of elevation does not always correlate with the extent of encephalopathy that a patient may exhibit. Careful and frequent neurological assessments are important as the high ammonia level can cause increased intracellular osmolarity in astrocytes, leading to enhanced water diffusion into the cells and ultimately cerebral edema. According to the PALFSG, 55% of children present with hepatic encephalopathy, usually Grade 1 or 2. Patients with Grade 3 or 4 encephalopathy usually require brain imaging to evaluate for any signs of intracranial hemorrhage. It is important to ensure the ammonia level is collected from a free‐flowing blood sample that is quickly placed on ice to reduce the chance of falsely elevated results.

### A capillary blood ammonia bedside test following glutamine load to improve the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhosis [^117CUrPG]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

Making a diagnosis of minimal HE is challenging for the clinician, who needs a sensitive, reliable, and easy-to-use diagnostic tool. However, at present, neuropsychological evaluation and electrophysiological tests do not fulfill these requirements. This aspect may explain in part why only a minority of hepatologists are screening for minimal HE in daily practice. Therefore, a simple test would be welcome and greatly facilitate the diagnosis and thus the management of HE. In our study, we tried to improve the diagnostic accuracy of blood ammonia, a key substance in the pathogenesis of HE, for the presence of minimal HE. To do so, we used capillary blood as an equivalent to the arterial compartment, and induced hyperammonemia via small intestine ammonia production to unmask HE. Finally, we designed the test as a bedside procedure fulfilling the definition of POCT to improve patients' and clinician's acceptance.

### Sodium phenylbutyrate (Pheburane) [^1156t8aH]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Dosage

PHEBURANE treatment should be supervised by a healthcare provider experienced in the treatment of urea cycle disorders.

The recommended dosage of PHEBURANE (measured as sodium phenylbutyrate) for patients with urea cycle disorders is:

Patients weighing less than 20kg: 450–600 mg/kg/day of sodium phenylbutyrate orally. Divide the calculated total daily dose into three to six doses. Administer as three to six divided doses and take with food.
Patients weighing greater than or equal to 20 kg: 9.9–13 g/m2/day of sodium phenylbutyrate orally. Divide the calculated total daily dose into three to six doses. Administer as three to six divided doses and take with food.

The maximum dosage is 20 grams per day. Combine PHEBURANE with dietary protein restriction and, in some cases, amino acid supplementation (e.g., essential amino acids, arginine, citrulline, and protein-free calorie supplements).

Measure the dose using only the calibrated spoon provided in the packaging. This calibrated dosing spoon directly measures PHEBURANE oral pellets as sodium phenylbutyrate [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

If a dose is missed, take the missed dose as soon as possible. There should be at least 3 hours between two doses and doses should not be doubled to make up for the missed dose.

2.2 Dosage Adjustment and Monitoring

Monitor plasma ammonia levels to determine the need for dosage adjustment. Adjust the PHEBURANE dosage to maintain the plasma ammonia level within the normal range for the patient's age, taking into consideration their clinical condition (e.g., nutritional requirements, protein intake, growth parameters, etc.).

Monitor patients for potential neurotoxicity and obtain measurements of plasma phenylacetate and phenylacetylglutamine levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Adverse Reactions (6)]. If neurologic symptoms (e.g. vomiting, nausea, headache, somnolence or confusion) are present in the absence of high ammonia levels or other intercurrent illnesses, consider reducing the dose of PHEBURANE.

2.3 Dosage Adjustment in Patients with Hepatic Impairment

For patients with hepatic impairment, start at the lower end of the recommended dosing range and maintain patients on the lowest dose necessary to control plasma ammonia levels [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

### Clearance and production of ammonia quantified in humans by constant ammonia infusion-the effects of cirrhosis and ammonia-targeting treatments [^113Z19Hh]. Journal of Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Hyperammonaemia is a key pathological feature of liver disease and the primary driver of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). However, the relative roles of increased ammonia production and reduced clearance are poorly understood as is the action of ammonia-targeting drugs for HE. We aimed to quantify whole-body ammonia metabolism in healthy persons and patients with cirrhosis and to validate our method by examining the effects of glycerol phenylbutyrate and lactulose + rifaximin treatment.

Methods

Ten healthy men and ten male patients with cirrhosis were investigated by 90-minute constant ammonia infusion to achieve steady-state plasma ammonia. Whole-body ammonia clearance was calculated as infusion rate divided by steady-state concentration increase and ammonia production was calculated as clearance multiplied by baseline ammonia concentration. Participants were re-investigated after the ammonia-targeting interventions.

Results

In healthy persons, ammonia clearance was 3.5 (3.1–3.9) L/min and ammonia production was 49 (35–63) μmol/min. Phenylbutyrate increased clearance by 11% (4–19%, p = 0.009). In patients with cirrhosis, ammonia clearance was 20% lower at 2.7 (2.1–3.3) L/min (p = 0.02) and production was nearly threefold higher at 131 (102–159) μmol/min (p < 0.0001). Lactulose + rifaximin reduced production by 20% (2–37%, p = 0.03). The infusion was generally well-tolerated apart from in one hyperammonaemic patient, with cirrhosis and possible bleeding unrelated to the infusion, who developed clinical HE that reverted when infusion was discontinued.

Conclusions

Whole-body ammonia clearance and production may be measured separately using the described technique. This technique identified a lower clearance and a higher production of ammonia in patients with cirrhosis, and showed that phenylbutyrate increases clearance, whereas lactulose + rifaximin reduces production.

Impact and Implications

High blood ammonia plays a key role in cirrhosis-related brain dysfunction. However, the relative roles of reduced ammonia clearance and increased ammonia production are poorly understood as is the action of ammonia-targeting treatments. This study presents a relatively simple test to measure ammonia metabolism. By using this test, it was possible to show that patients with cirrhosis exhibit decreased ammonia clearance and increased ammonia production compared to healthy persons, and to quantify the unique effects of different ammonia-targeting treatments. The test described herein may be used to examine a range of questions related to normal physiology, pathophysiology and the mechanisms of action of ammonia-targeting treatments.

### Asparaginase-associated hyperammonemia [^114McBFY]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment options

The management of AAH depends on the severity of the hyperammonemia and associated symptoms. The primary goal is to reduce ammonia levels while maintaining effective asparaginase therapy whenever possible. Early recognition of symptoms, such as lethargy, vomiting, and encephalop athy, is critical to prevent severe complications such as cerebral herniation.

In patients with hyperammonemia due to causes other than asparaginase treatment, such as inborn errors of metabolism, liver failure or sepsis, the therapy for hyperammonemia encompasses: (i) reduced protein intake, (ii) interventions that can reduce ammonia absorption from the gut, (iii) ammonia-scavengers using metabolic interventions and (iv) increasing the function/activity of the urea cycle with arginine and carglumic acid(Online Supplementary Figure S2). Similar approaches have been used in patients receiving asparaginase, including reducing the asparaginase doses preferably while monitoring asparaginase activity or by extending the infusion time of Erwinase and withdrawal of asparaginase. The latter however should be avoided(Table 1).

In asymptomatic patients (CTCAE grade 1) elevated ammonia levels do not require treatment. In patients with mild neurotoxicity, a protein-reduced or protein-free diet may reduce intestinal ammonia production. The role of restricting protein intake has been questioned. Protein restriction may offer limited benefit for patients with AAH, as most ammonia derives from asparaginase's glutaminase activity rather than dietary protein. It is not recommended in patients with hepatic encephalopathy because it results in catabolism with increased muscle ammonia production, and sarcopenia in which the reduced muscle mass reduces clearance of ammonia. Additionally, administration of 10% glucose infusions to reduce protein catabolism is commonly used.

In patients with moderate encephalopathy (CTCAE grade 1 or 2) we recommend ammonia-reducing therapies such as sodium benzoate and lactulose, antibiotics, glucose 10% infusion and a reduction in asparaginase dose.

Monitoring response to antibiotics for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhosis occurs due to serious impairment of the immune system and may trigger severe complications, particularly AKI, HE, or ACLF; it is also associated with a high risk of mortality. The diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis requires a high index of suspicion because the clinical symptoms are heterogeneous and may not always include abdominal manifestations. The biomarker used for diagnoses and for monitoring the efficacy of antibiotic therapy is neutrophil count in the ascitic fluid, and a bacterial isolate is not required for diagnoses because ascitic fluid culture is positive in less than half of cases. Other biomarkers based on systemic inflammation secondary to the infection, such as cytokines (eg, IL-6), pro-calcitonin, and others, have been investigated, but none have yet successfully shown to improve diagnostic accuracy. A summary of the changes in neutrophil count in ascitic fluid during antibiotic therapy and their clinical interpretations is presented in Table 5.

Monitoring response to treatment of HE

Development of overt HE requires rapid clinical investigation and initiation of therapy, including the management of possible precipitating factors. Specific therapy of HE focuses on preventing ammonia absorption from the gut and reducing ammonia production. The response to treatment is generally monitored by evaluating neurological status every 6–12 hours on the same scales that are used to categorize disease severity, usually the West Haven criteria. Psychometric testing is reserved for monitoring treatment effects on covert HE. There are no specific biomarkers for monitoring the response to therapy of patients with overt HE, but plasma ammonia levels may be informative because these decrease in patients improving from HE symptoms. However, international guidelines do still not recommend the measurement of ammonia levels for monitoring the treatment of HE.

### Topiramate [^115QM7zZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.12 Hyperammonemia and Encephalopathy (Without and With Concomitant Valproic Acid Use)

Topiramate treatment can cause hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. The risk for hyperammonemia with topiramate appears dose-related. Hyperammonemia has been reported more frequently when topiramate is used concomitantly with valproic acid. Postmarketing cases of hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy have been reported with topiramate and valproic acid in patients who previously tolerated either drug alone [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Clinical symptoms of hyperammonemic encephalopathy often include acute alterations in level of consciousness and/or cognitive function with lethargy and/or vomiting. In most cases, hyperammonemic encephalopathy abated with discontinuation of treatment.

The incidence of hyperammonemia in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age in the preventive treatment of migraine trials was 26% in patients taking topiramate monotherapy at 100 mg/day, and 14% in patients taking topiramate at 50 mg/day, compared to 9% in patients taking placebo. There was also an increased incidence of markedly increased hyperammonemia at the 100 mg dose.

Dose-related hyperammonemia was also seen in pediatric patients 1 to 24 months of age treated with topiramate and concomitant valproic acid for partial-onset epilepsy and this was not due to a pharmacokinetic interaction.

In some patients, hyperammonemia can be asymptomatic.

Monitoring for Hyperammonemia

Patients with inborn errors of metabolism or reduced hepatic mitochondrial activity may be at an increased risk for hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy. Although not studied, topiramate treatment or an interaction of concomitant topiramate and valproic acid treatment may exacerbate existing defects or unmask deficiencies in susceptible persons.

In patients who develop unexplained lethargy, vomiting or changes in mental status associated with any topiramate treatment, hyperammonemic encephalopathy should be considered and an ammonia level should be measured.

### Heretical thoughts into hepatic encephalopathy [^1117tTR9]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical progress in the development of new diagnostic modalities and therapeutic strategies for the management of patients with hepatic encephalopathy has lagged behind the vast knowledge that has been generated from basic studies. In this article, we critically assess matters that should be revisited, such as definition, classification, diagnosis and grading of hepatic encephalopathy, which are difficult to apply reproducibly using the current criteria. Many lines of investigation have confirmed that hepatic encephalopathy is irreversible in many patients and suggest the need for further studies focussing on mechanisms of neuronal injury and death, to guide future drug development for these patients. The clinical evidence behind using lactulose for all severities of hepatic encephalopathy, which is currently considered the standard of care, is poor and placebo-controlled trials for hepatic encephalopathy should be considered ethically sound. This expert opinion identifies current challenges in hepatic encephalopathy and highlights areas which require further debate and investigation in order to help advance the field both scientifically and clinically.

### A capillary blood ammonia bedside test following glutamine load to improve the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhosis [^113DgwTw]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Capillary blood ammonia and hepatic encephalopathy

At baseline, patients with cirrhosis, with and without minimal HE demonstrated similar capillary blood ammonia values. 60 minutes following glutamine load, there was a trend of higher values in patients with HE as compared to those without HE, but the difference was not significant (183 [45–290] versus 144 [49–264] umol/l, respectively, p = 0.133) (see Figure 4). To further explore the diagnostic accuracy of capillary blood ammonia for minimal HE, ROC curves were constructed and the area under the ROC curve (AUROC) was computed. The AUROC for making the diagnosis of minimal HE at baseline was 0.541 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.38–0.7, p = 0.6), while at 60 minutes after the test it was 0.727 (95% CI, 0.58–0.87, p < 0.006) (see Figure 5).

The subgroup of 18 patients with previous episodes of HE had higher 60 minutes post glutamine ammonia levels compared to those who never experienced clinical episodes of HE (181 ± 13 vs 163 ± 11 umol/l, p < 0.05).

No clinically overt HE developed in the 4 patients with TIPS after the oral glutamine test. Table 4 provides the individual values of capillary blood ammonia during the test period, as well as the MHE status.

### Zonisamide [^114hiFDe]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hyperammonemia and Encephalopathy:

Hyperammonemia and encephalopathy have been reported with the postmarketing use of zonisamide. Zonisamide treatment inhibits carbonic anhydrase activity, which may cause metabolic acidosis that is associated with an increased risk for developing hyperammonemia. Hyperammonemia resulting from zonisamide can also be asymptomatic.

The risks of hyperammonemia and various manifestations of encephalopathy may be increased in patients treated with zonisamide and concomitantly taking other medications that can cause hyperammonemia, including valproic acid or topiramate (see PRECAUTIONS). Patients with inborn errors of metabolism or reduced hepatic mitochondrial activity may be at an increased risk for hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy and this risk may be increased by zonisamide use.

Measure serum ammonia concentration if signs or symptoms (e.g., unexplained change in mental status, vomiting, or lethargy) of encephalopathy occur. Hyperammonemia resulting from zonisamide resolves when zonisamide is discontinued. Hyperammonemia from zonisamide may resolve or decrease in severity with a decrease of the daily dose.

### Clinical impact of arterial ammonia levels in ICU patients with different liver diseases [^1148yWx5]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Increased arterial ammonia levels are associated with high mortality in patients with acute liver failure (ALF). Data on the prognostic impact of arterial ammonia is lacking in hypoxic hepatitis (HH) and scarce in critically ill patients with cirrhosis.

Methods

The patient cohort comprised 72 patients with HH, 43 patients with ALF, 100 patients with liver cirrhosis and 45 patients without evidence for liver disease. Arterial ammonia concentrations were assessed on a daily basis in all patients and the results were compared among these four patient groups and between 28-day survivors and 28-day non-survivors overall and in each group.

Results

Overall 28-day mortality rates in patients with HH, ALF and cirrhosis and in the control group were 54, 30, 49 and 27%, respectively. Peak arterial ammonia levels differed significantly between transplant-free 28-day survivors and non-survivors in the HH and ALF groups (p < 0.01 for both). Multivariate regression identified peak arterial ammonia concentrations as an independent predictor of 28-day mortality or liver transplantation in patients with HH and ALF, respectively (p < 0.01). There was no association between mortality and arterial ammonia in patients with liver cirrhosis and in the control group. Admission arterial ammonia levels were independently linked to hepatic encephalopathy grades 3/4 in patients with HH (p < 0.01), ALF (p < 0.05) and cirrhosis (p < 0.05), respectively.

Conclusions

Elevated arterial ammonia levels indicate a poor prognosis in acute liver injury and are associated with advanced HE in HH, ALF and cirrhosis. Arterial ammonia levels provide additional information in the risk assessment of critically ill patients with liver disease.

### Arterial ammonia and clinical risk factors for encephalopathy and intracranial hypertension in acute liver failure [^1177T9LH]. Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

High circulating ammonia concentrations are common in patients with acute liver failure (ALF) and are associated with hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and intracranial hypertension (ICH). Other risk factors are poorly characterized. We evaluated the relation of the admission arterial ammonia concentration and other clinical variables with the development of HE and ICH. Arterial ammonia was measured on admission to the intensive care unit in 257 patients; 165 had ALF and severe HE, and there were 3 control groups: acute hepatic dysfunction without severe HE (n = 50), chronic liver disease (n = 33), and elective surgery (n = 9). Variables associated with ICH and HE were investigated with regression analysis. Ammonia was higher in ALF patients than controls. An independent risk factor for the development of severe HE and ICH, a level greater than 100 mumol/L predicted the onset of severe HE with 70% accuracy. The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score was also independently predictive of HE, and its combination with ammonia increased specificity and accuracy. ICH developed in 55% of ALF patients with a level greater than 200 mumol/L, although this threshold failed to identify most cases. After admission, ammonia levels remained high in those developing ICH and fell in those who did not. Youth, a requirement for vasopressors, and renal replacement therapy were additional independent risk factors.

Conclusion

Ammonia is an independent risk factor for the development of both HE and ICH. Additional MELD scoring improved the prediction of HE. Factors other than ammonia also appear important in the pathogenesis of ICH. Ammonia measurements could form part of risk stratification for HE and ICH, identifying patients for ammonia-lowering therapies and invasive monitoring.

### Simple and inexpensive quantification of ammonia in whole blood [^112LTerK]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Quantification of ammonia in whole blood has applications in the diagnosis and management of many hepatic diseases, including cirrhosis and rare urea cycle disorders, amounting to more than 5 million patients in the United States. Current techniques for ammonia measurement suffer from limited range, poor resolution, false positives or large, complex sensor set-ups. Here we demonstrate a technique utilizing inexpensive reagents and simple methods for quantifying ammonia in 100 μL of whole blood. The sensor comprises a modified form of the indophenol reaction, which resists sources of destructive interference in blood, in conjunction with a cation-exchange membrane. The presented sensing scheme is selective against other amine containing molecules such as amino acids and has a shelf life of at least 50 days. Additionally, the resulting system has high sensitivity and allows for the accurate reliable quantification of ammonia in whole human blood samples at a minimum range of 25 to 500 μM, which is clinically for rare hyperammonemic disorders and liver disease. Furthermore, concentrations of 50 and 100 μM ammonia could be reliably discerned with p = 0.0001.

### Neuroprotection in acute brain injury: an up-to-date review [^114b4Q6a]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Preserving brain perfusion in sepsis

Brain dysfunction is frequent during sepsis and is associated with increased mortality and long-term cognitive dysfunction. The pathophysiology is complex and poorly understood, but decreased brain perfusion may be a major determinant. Some studies have shown lower CBF in septic patients than in healthy volunteers, but other factors, such as sedative agents or hypocapnia associated with hyperventilation, may also explain the CBF reduction in such patients. Sepsis is also associated with impaired CBF autoregulation, however, especially when shock is present. A low arterial carbon dioxide tension may enhance or restore the regulation of brain perfusion in septic patients, without significantly affecting cerebral oxygen metabolism. However, the impact of hypocapnia in these patients needs to be studied in larger cohorts. Brain dysfunction during sepsis also occurs in hemodynamically stable patients and experimental data have suggested that regional brain perfusion can become inadequate because of microcirculatory alterations.

An optimal threshold of blood pressure (or any other metric) to prevent brain hypoperfusion in septic patients has not yet been identified. Novel monitoring tools will hopefully help improve our understanding of CBF and microvascular regulation and facilitate identification of specific neuroprotective strategies to minimize secondary ischemic brain injuries in this setting.

Hepatic encephalopathy

Etiological factors in hepatic encephalopathy relate largely to increased circulating ammonia with changes in cellular glutamine/glutamate levels, altered neurotransmitter signaling and subsequent astrocyte swelling, and microglial and mitochondrial dysfunction. Drugs to decrease arterial ammonia levels have not been shown to be effective in acute liver failure but may have a role in cirrhosis. The use of novel agents to increase skeletal metabolism of ammonia has been shown to be effective in animal models. Ammonia levels may also be manipulated by renal replacement therapies. Control of the inflammatory phenotype may also be relevant, with animal studies showing that decreasing brain inflammation may be beneficial. Clinical studies in acute liver failure suggest that combined control of ammonia (with renal replacement therapy), inflammatory phenotype, temperature and hyponatremia may be beneficial. The long-term effects of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with acute liver failure have not been widely examined but those who recover are largely neurologically intact. In those individuals with cirrhosis, chronic encephalopathy can be seen and may be difficult to distinguish from other neurological syndromes. Liver transplantation largely results in resolution of encephalopathy.

### A capillary blood ammonia bedside test following glutamine load to improve the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhosis [^114PRnPL]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a frequent and severe complication of cirrhosis. A single determination of ammonia in venous blood correlates poorly with neurological symptoms. Thus, a better biological marker is needed.

Aim

To make a diagnosis of HE, we explored the value of ammonia in capillary blood, an equivalent to arterial blood, measured at bedside following an oral glutamine challenge.

Methods

We included 57 patients (age 56 yrs; M/F: 37/20) with cirrhosis (alcoholic = 42; MELD score 13.8 [7–29], esophageal varices = 38) and previous episodes of HE (n = 19), but without neurological deficits at time of examination, and 13 healthy controls (age 54 yrs). After psychometric tests and capillary (ear lobe) blood ammonia measurements, 20 gr of glutamine was administered orally. Tests were repeated at 60 minutes (+ blood ammonia at 30'). Minimal HE was diagnosed if values were > 1.5 SD in at least 2 psychometric tests. Follow-up lasted 12 months.

Results

The test was well tolerated (nausea = 1; dizziness = 1). Patients showed higher values of capillary blood ammonia over time as compared to controls (0'-30'-60 minutes: 75, 117, 169 versus 52, 59, 78 umol/L, p < 0.05). At baseline, 25 patients (44%) had minimal HE, while 38 patients (67%) met the criteria for HE at 60 minutes (chi2: p < 0.01). For the diagnosis of minimal HE, using the ROC curve analysis, baseline capillary blood ammonia showed an AUC of 0.541 (CI: 0.38–0.7, p = 0.6), while at 60 minutes the AUC was 0.727 (CI: 0.58–0.87, p < 0.006). During follow-up, 18 patients (31%) developed clinical episodes of HE. At multivariate analysis, the MELD score (1.12 [1.018–1.236]), previous episodes of HE (3.2[1.069–9.58]), but not capillary blood ammonia, were independent predictors of event.

Conclusions

In patients with cirrhosis and normal neurological examination, bedside determination of ammonia in capillary blood following oral glutamine load is well tolerated and achieves a better diagnostic performance for minimal HE than basal capillary ammonia levels. However, capillary blood ammonia is a poor predictor of development of clinically overt HE.

### Topiramate (Topamax) [^113quHek]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.12 Hyperammonemia and Encephalopathy (Without and With Concomitant Valproic Acid Use)

Topiramate treatment can cause hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. The risk for hyperammonemia with topiramate appears dose-related. Hyperammonemia has been reported more frequently when topiramate is used concomitantly with valproic acid. Postmarketing cases of hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy have been reported with topiramate and valproic acid in patients who previously tolerated either drug alone [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Clinical symptoms of hyperammonemic encephalopathy often include acute alterations in level of consciousness and/or cognitive function with lethargy and/or vomiting. In most cases, hyperammonemic encephalopathy abated with discontinuation of treatment.

The incidence of hyperammonemia in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age in the preventive treatment of migraine trials was 26% in patients taking TOPAMAX monotherapy at 100 mg/day, and 14% in patients taking TOPAMAX at 50 mg/day, compared to 9% in patients taking placebo. There was also an increased incidence of markedly increased hyperammonemia at the 100 mg dose.

Dose-related hyperammonemia was also seen in pediatric patients 1 to 24 months of age treated with TOPAMAX and concomitant valproic acid for partial-onset epilepsy and this was not due to a pharmacokinetic interaction.

In some patients, hyperammonemia can be asymptomatic.

Monitoring for Hyperammonemia

Patients with inborn errors of metabolism or reduced hepatic mitochondrial activity may be at an increased risk for hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy. Although not studied, topiramate treatment or an interaction of concomitant topiramate and valproic acid treatment may exacerbate existing defects or unmask deficiencies in susceptible persons.

In patients who develop unexplained lethargy, vomiting or changes in mental status associated with any topiramate treatment, hyperammonemic encephalopathy should be considered and an ammonia level should be measured.

### Do ammonia levels correlate with hepatic encephalopathy?… [^111L5xag]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy in patients with chronic liver dysfunction is believed to be caused by a failure of the liver to clear toxic products from the stomach. The exact toxins that cause hepatic encephalopathy have not been established, but ammonia may be involved. Many physicians determine ammonia levels to diagnose hepatic encephalopathy and as a guide to treatment. However, studies have shown that the correlation between serum ammonia levels and severity of hepatic encephalopathy is inconsistent. A recent study suggested that the partial pressure of ammonia may correlate more closely with the severity of hepatic encephalopathy than the total plasma ammonia level. Ong and associates evaluated the correlation between plasma ammonia levels and the severity of hepatic encephalopathy.

They also determined the best of the four types of ammonia measurements for this correlation by comparing arterial total ammonia, venous total ammonia, arterial partial pressure of ammonia, and venous partial pressure of ammonia. Consecutive patients who were admitted to a tertiary care center with the diagnosis of cirrhosis between September 1998 and December 1999 were enrolled in the study. The diagnosis of cirrhosis was established by biopsy or by signs of portal hypertension such as gastroesophageal varices, previous variceal bleeding, or ascites. Researchers collected clinical and laboratory data at the time of admission. The mental status of the patients was assessed using the West Haven Criteria for grading of mental status. A diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy was established when the patients' mental status was altered and other causes of mental status changes had been excluded.

After diagnosis, fasting arterial and venous blood samples were obtained, and total ammonia and partial pressure of ammonia were determined. All four measurements of ammonia increased with the severity of hepatic encephalopathy. The arterial total ammonia level had the highest correlation, but it was not statistically significant. Other variables that had a correlation to the severity of hepatic encephalopathy included International Normalized Ratio values, serum creatinine levels, bilirubin levels, and lactulose use. A multivariable ordered logistic regression analysis revealed that only serum ammonia levels and INR values were independently associated with the severity of hepatic encephalopathy. The authors conclude that venous total ammonia levels do correlate with severity of hepatic encephalopathy and should be adequate in evaluating patients with this condition.

Total arterial ammonia levels and partial pressure of ammonia levels had similar correlation but did not prove to be better markers than venous total ammonia levels.

### Recognition and treatment of alterations in ammonia metabolism… [^111ZxnRE]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

As clinical and experimental knowledge of ammonia metabolism increases, the relationship between increased concentrations of ammonia in the blood and the clinical state of "hepatic coma" becomes apparent. The occurrence of significantly increased concentrations of ammonia in the blood of patients with "hepatic coma" and the clearing of the sensorium that follows a reduction of the blood ammonia concentration both indicate that ammonia intoxication is an important factor in the production of hepatic encephalopathies. Further confirmation of an etiologic role of ammonia in "hepatic coma" is to be found in the fact that this syndrome can be reproduced in both experimental animals and human subjects by increasing the blood ammonia, either by the administration of ammonium salts or by the feeding of high-protein diets or urea. In patients who have had vascular shunting procedures done for portal hypertension, or in patients in whom chronic liver disease is associated with gastrointestinal.
