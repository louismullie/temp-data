## Question

Chronic kidney disease plan

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step chronic kidney disease (CKD) care plan, preserving the reasoning flow and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to structure the care plan into coherent phases. Then, I should verify the foundational principles that underpin modern CKD care. Next, I will review screening and diagnosis, followed by staging and risk stratification. After that, I need to examine core management domains, including lifestyle, blood pressure, glycemic control, cardiovascular risk, and complications. I will then consider special populations, conservative kidney management, and dialysis planning. Finally, I should confirm implementation supports, monitoring, and quality improvement elements, and close with a concise synthesis that aligns with guideline priorities [^113CYjQu].

> Let me first confirm the overarching framework so I don't miss anything important. Modern CKD care is organized into five phases: screening and diagnosis, staging and risk assessment, comprehensive management, advanced care planning, and ongoing monitoring and quality improvement, with patient-centered care and shared decision-making embedded throughout; I should double-check that this aligns with KDIGO 2024 and VA/DoD 2025, which both emphasize multidisciplinary, individualized care and SDM as core principles [^112gNvW4] [^115yxx4m].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to ensure the foundational principles are explicit before detailing steps. Patient-centeredness, shared decision-making, and multidisciplinary care are consistently recommended, and I should confirm that SDM is operationalized for complex choices like dialysis versus conservative management and medication trade-offs; KDIGO 2024 and VA/DoD 2025 both endorse SDM, and KDIGO explicitly calls for access to a multidisciplinary team including dietitians, pharmacists, and social workers, which I should keep front and center [^112gNvW4] [^115yxx4m].

> Next, I should review screening and diagnosis, and I need to check who to screen and how to confirm CKD. High-risk groups such as those with diabetes, hypertension, or cardiovascular disease warrant at least annual testing with serum creatinine/eGFR and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio; I initially thought the USPSTF endorsed universal screening, but wait, let me verify — USPSTF found insufficient evidence for population screening, so targeted screening in high-risk groups is the prudent approach, and diagnosis requires abnormalities persisting beyond 3 months or structural markers like albuminuria or hematuria [^117R5P3C] [^11684KQM] [^117NcKTA].

> I will now examine staging and risk stratification, and I should confirm the current classification. KDIGO 2024 uses a cause–GFR–albuminuria framework, replacing the older stage-only model; I need to ensure I incorporate both eGFR and albuminuria categories, and I should verify progression definitions — progression is a drop in GFR category with a 25% or greater fall from baseline, and rapid progression is a sustained decline greater than 5 mL/min/1.73 m²/year; risk tools like the Kidney Failure Risk Equation can refine referral timing and modality planning, which I should integrate into decisions [^117NcKTA] [^113zUTGV] [^116XpUd4].

> Let me consider core management next, starting with lifestyle, and I should double-check targets and feasibility. Sodium restriction to less than 2 g/day, weight management with individualized BMI goals, and at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity are recommended, with flexibility for tolerance; I need to ensure I tailor intensity and duration to cardiovascular and physical capacity, and I should remember that obesity is an independent risk factor for CKD progression, so structured weight programs can be appropriate when aligned with comorbidity profiles [^114mUJqB] [^114KV17y] [^115kMWGS].

> Now, blood pressure control — this is pivotal, so I should verify thresholds and agents. For CKD with hypertension, a target of less than 130/80 mmHg is reasonable if tolerated, and first-line therapy should be a renin–angiotensin system inhibitor with escalation to maximum tolerated dose; if albuminuria persists above 30 mg/g despite optimized RAAS blockade, I should consider adding a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist such as finerenone in appropriate patients with eGFR above 25 mL/min/1.73 m² and normal potassium, and I must monitor potassium closely given hyperkalemia risk [^1177jnLE].

> For glycemic management in diabetes with CKD, I need to check the hierarchy of therapies. Metformin remains first-line if eGFR is at least 30 mL/min/1.73 m², and SGLT2 inhibitors are strongly recommended for patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD because they reduce kidney failure, cardiovascular events, and heart failure; I should add GLP-1 receptor agonists for additional cardiorenal benefit when indicated, and I must remember to individualize A1c targets as kidney function declines to mitigate hypoglycemia risk [^113XH9Hi] [^113hL7bJ].

> Cardiovascular risk reduction deserves separate attention, and I should confirm statin use. Adults with CKD aged 50 years or older should receive statin therapy, and for ages 18–49, I should consider statins when diabetes, known coronary disease, prior ischemic stroke, or a 10-year coronary risk above 10% is present; PCSK9 inhibitors can be layered when LDL-C remains above goal or when very high-risk features exist, and I need to ensure I set a lower initiation threshold in younger high-risk CKD patients to maximize absolute risk reduction [^115dGtHR] [^113y6WAf] [^114JQ7YP] [^111XVMPf].

> I need to ensure I address CKD complications systematically. For CKD-MBD, I should trend labs rather than react to single values, restrict dietary phosphate and use binders as needed to move phosphate toward normal in stages G3a–G5, and manage osteoporosis in stages 1–2 per general population guidance; for anemia, I should maintain iron repletion and consider ESAs when benefits in quality of life or transfusion avoidance are expected, targeting hemoglobin roughly 100–120 g/L in adults; for hyperkalemia, I should individualize with diet, diuretics, and potassium binders, and for metabolic acidosis, I should consider oral bicarbonate when serum bicarbonate is below 22 mmol/L; I must also screen for uremic symptoms at each visit using validated tools as kidney function declines [^115ARtVm] [^1127r45y] [^114HZEMq] [^113cf2UM] [^1112dv8u] [^113YBNhE].

> Next, I should review special populations, and I need to check nuances for older adults, women of reproductive age, and those with low functional status. In older adults, creatinine-based eGFR may be misleading due to sarcopenia, so I should prioritize function, frailty, and quality of life over aggressive disease-modifying therapy when benefits are uncertain; for women considering pregnancy, I should counsel on maternal and fetal risks and coordinate preconception planning; for patients with high comorbidity burden or low functional status, I should favor early nephrology referral with sufficient time for conservative management planning and SDM rather than defaulting to dialysis [^11627RcP] [^112c17ZD] [^115X7SeW].

> Conservative kidney management needs explicit attention, and I should confirm when it is appropriate. For patients with advanced CKD unlikely to benefit from dialysis or who prefer nondialysis care, a structured conservative approach emphasizing symptom control, advance care planning, and quality of life is appropriate; decision aids and early SDM conversations can align care with patient values, and I should involve palliative care when needed to support goals-of-care discussions and symptom management [^117RJEsM] [^111qpKJ1] [^1156X7rC].

> Dialysis planning should start early, and I need to ensure logistics are addressed. Initial nephrology referral when eGFR is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or when 2-year ESKD risk exceeds 40% allows time for education, modality selection, and access planning; for hemodialysis, timely arteriovenous fistula creation is preferred when appropriate, but I should individualize access choice to patient anatomy, comorbidity, and preferences, and I must revisit goals of care periodically, especially in frail patients where survival benefit may be limited [^115ouhJr] [^114R235p] [^1156X7rC].

> Implementation support is essential, and I should double-check which levers most reliably change practice. Multidisciplinary clinics, pharmacist-led medication reconciliation, dietitian counseling, and nurse care coordination improve adherence and outcomes; clinical decision support embedded in the EHR can prompt guideline-concordant ordering and dosing; population health analytics can identify care gaps and stratify risk to trigger proactive outreach; and structured self-management education improves engagement and outcomes, particularly in diabetes with CKD [^1144t7nJ] [^113JEdBT] [^112cJeg6] [^114CKyA1].

> Monitoring and quality improvement should be iterative, and I need to ensure metrics align with patient-centered outcomes. I should track eGFR trajectories, albuminuria, blood pressure, A1c, LDL-C, and patient-reported outcomes such as quality of life and symptom burden; I should also monitor process measures like timely nephrology referral, vaccination status, and advance care planning completion; embedding these into learning health systems enables rapid-cycle improvement and equity-focused adjustments [^113THcNu] [^116KVGaM] [^112cJeg6].

> Finally, I should synthesize the plan succinctly while preserving the key guardrails. The care plan is anchored in patient-centered, multidisciplinary care with SDM; it uses cause–GFR–albuminuria risk stratification to guide intensity; it layers lifestyle, blood pressure control with RAAS blockade and MRAs when indicated, glycemic therapy with metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors, and statins for cardiovascular risk; it proactively manages complications and aligns advanced care with patient goals, leveraging early nephrology referral, conservative management when appropriate, and structured implementation supports to close gaps in care [^113CYjQu] [^112gNvW4].

A comprehensive CKD plan centers on **early detection** with eGFR and albuminuria [^117R5P3C], **risk stratification** using the Kidney Failure Risk Equation [^116XpUd4], and **shared decision-making** to align care with patient goals [^115yxx4m]. Core management includes **blood pressure control** (target < 130/80 mmHg) with ACEi/ARB [^114mUJqB], SGLT2 inhibitors for diabetes and high-risk non-diabetic CKD [^115dGtHR], and statins for cardiovascular risk [^114PHp5x]. Address complications (anemia, mineral bone disorder, hyperkalemia) [^115ARtVm] and provide dietary counseling, physical activity, and smoking cessation [^114mUJqB]. Refer to nephrology when eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², albuminuria ≥ 300 mg/g, or rapid progression [^117R5P3C]; for advanced CKD, discuss dialysis vs conservative management and plan access early [^114R235p]. Monitor eGFR, albuminuria, electrolytes, and blood pressure regularly, and use multidisciplinary care to improve outcomes [^112gNvW4].

---

## Detection and diagnosis

- **Screening**: Annual eGFR and albuminuria for high-risk patients (diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease) [^117R5P3C].

- **Diagnosis**: Persistent eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or markers (albuminuria, hematuria, abnormal imaging) for > 3 months [^117NcKTA].

- **Classification**: Use KDIGO 2024 cause–GFR–albuminuria framework to guide risk and management [^117NcKTA].

---

## Risk stratification and progression monitoring

Use the **Kidney Failure Risk Equation** to guide referral and intensity of care [^116XpUd4]. Define progression as a ≥ 25% drop in eGFR from baseline; rapid progression is a sustained decline > 5 mL/min/1.73 m²/year [^113zUTGV]. Monitor eGFR, albuminuria, blood pressure, electrolytes, and hemoglobin at least annually, or more often in advanced CKD [^notfound].

---

## Lifestyle interventions

- **Diet**: Sodium restriction, protein moderation, and potassium/phosphate control as indicated [^1112dv8u].

- **Physical activity**: ≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity exercise, tailored to tolerance [^114mUJqB].

- **Weight management**: Aim for BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m² [^115kMWGS].

- **Smoking cessation**: Strongly recommended [^115CEbns].

---

## Pharmacological management

| **Condition** | **Recommended pharmacotherapy** |
|-|-|
| Hypertension | ACE inhibitors or ARBs; add thiazide or loop diuretics as needed [^notfound] |
| Diabetes | - SGLT2 inhibitors (dapagliflozin, empagliflozin) [^114sMRip] <br/> - Add GLP-1 receptor agonists or metformin as appropriate [^113hL7bJ] |
| Dyslipidemia | Statins for adults ≥ 50 years; consider PCSK9 inhibitors if indicated [^115dGtHR] [^114JQ7YP] |
| Hyperkalemia | Dietary restriction, loop/thiazide diuretics, potassium binders [^1112dv8u] |
| Anemia | Iron supplementation, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents as indicated [^113cf2UM] |
| Mineral bone disorder | Phosphate binders, active vitamin D, calcimimetics as indicated [^notfound] |

---

## Multidisciplinary care and patient education

A **multidisciplinary team** should include nephrologists, primary care, dietitians, pharmacists, nurses, and social workers [^1178CPoD]. Provide education on disease progression, self-management, medication adherence, and symptom recognition [^115rMqTN]. Use shared decision-making for major decisions (e.g. dialysis modality, conservative care) [^1156X7rC].

---

## Referral to nephrology

Refer when **eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²**, **albuminuria ≥ 300 mg/g**, or there is **rapid progression** [^117R5P3C]. Early referral enables access planning, transplant evaluation, and preparation for dialysis or conservative management [^114R235p].

---

## Advanced care planning

Discuss **dialysis modalities** (HD, PD) vs conservative kidney management, incorporating patient preferences [^117RJEsM]. Engage in advance care planning with goals-of-care discussions and documentation [^116WbBGr]. Plan vascular or peritoneal access early if dialysis is chosen [^114R235p].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Track **eGFR, albuminuria, blood pressure, electrolytes, and hemoglobin** at least annually, or more often in advanced CKD [^117R5P3C]. Adjust therapy based on trends and patient response [^115ARtVm]. Maintain a high index of suspicion for complications (e.g. hyperkalemia, anemia, bone disease) [^1112dv8u].

---

## Quality improvement and outcomes

Track **CKD recognition, blood pressure control, medication adherence, and progression to ESRD** [^113THcNu]. Close care gaps using EHR-based population health tools and clinical decision support [^112cJeg6] [^113JEdBT]. Prioritize patient-reported outcomes and quality of life [^116KVGaM].

---

A comprehensive CKD plan integrates **early detection, risk stratification, lifestyle and pharmacologic therapy, multidisciplinary care, and shared decision-making** to slow progression, manage complications, and align care with patient goals [^114YYuwL].

The Chronic Kidney Disease Initiative was implemented at the request of the Council of American Kidney Societies to formulate a plan of action to solve many of the perceived problems associated with identifying, caring for, and attaining the best outcomes for patients with chronic kidney disease. With the assistance of a community of stakeholders and a formalized workshop and process, the Chronic Kidney Disease Initiative identified the barriers to solving this complicated problem. Barriers were given hierarchical significance, and solutions and action plans to the barriers were formulated. This article describes the process, the barriers encountered, and the solutions required to fully identify and manage this large and complicated population of patients.

Due to the multifaceted aspects of kidney function, the management of CKD not only requires knowledge of kidney physiology and pathophysiology but also a keen understanding of how to diagnose, treat, and monitor the metabolic derangements and complications of reduced kidney function. In this article, we provide questions that cover a broad range of clinical scenarios that may test the clinical acumen of a kidney health professional. Each question starts with a brief clinical scenario to guide the reader. Questions are followed by a selection of answers. As in most clinical situations, a variety of tests and/or interventions may be appropriate. As knowledge on the management of kidney diseases and associated complications evolve, the optimal choice for these questions may also evolve.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) updates the KDIGO 2012 guideline and has been developed with patient partners, clinicians, and researchers around the world, using robust methodology. This update, based on a substantially broader base of evidence than has previously been available, reflects an exciting time in nephrology. New therapies and strategies have been tested in large and diverse populations that help to inform care; however, this guideline is not intended for people receiving dialysis nor those who have a kidney transplant. The document is sensitive to international considerations, CKD across the lifespan, and discusses special considerations in implementation. The scope includes chapters dedicated to the evaluation and risk assessment of people with CKD, management to delay CKD progression and its complications, medication management and drug stewardship in CKD, and optimal models of CKD care. Treatment approaches and actionable guideline recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant studies and appraisal of the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations which followed the "Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation" (GRADE) approach. The limitations of the evidence are discussed. The guideline also provides practice points, which serve to direct clinical care or activities for which a systematic review was not conducted, and it includes useful infographics and describes an important research agenda for the future. It targets a broad audience of people with CKD and their healthcare, while being mindful of implications for policy and payment.

### Barriers to implementing the kidney disease outcomes quality initiative end-stage kidney disease life plan guideline [^116bwZTP]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The management of chronic diseases is complex, affects the daily lives of people who are impacted by chronic disease, and requires attention to the individual person's specific needs and preferences. In 2001, the Institute of Medicine deemed person-centered care to be one of the six pillars of quality health care. Person-centered care represents a shift from the traditional paradigm where the healthcare professional is the primary decision-maker towards a model that prioritizes individual wishes and requirements. While person-centered care has been shown to result in greater satisfaction with care and patient well-being, implementation of person-centered care continues to face multiple barriers, including the challenge of shifting traditional healthcare practices and structures.

End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a chronic disease that affects more than 780,000 Americans. In the United States, hemodialysis is the most common substitute kidney, necessitating vascular access. The 2006 National Kidney Foundation Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF K-DOQI) Clinical Practice Guideline for Vascular Access, in conjunction with "Fistula First", created an environment in which kidney care professionals were all encouraged to recommend arteriovenous fistula as the ideal hemodialysis vascular access for a given patient, regardless of the patient's individual characteristics and preferences. However, with newer data that indicates that fistula outcomes are not necessarily superior in all patient subgroups, the 2019 update of the K-DOQI Guidelines advocates for a substantial shift to a more patient-centered approach.

### Person centred care provision and care planning in chronic kidney disease: which outcomes matter? A systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies: care planning in CKD: which outcomes matter? [^115NK8tW]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this thematic synthesis of 46 qualitative studies, we explored the priorities regarding outcomes of patients with CKD and barriers encountered regarding person-centred care and care planning. The themes that emerged describe the health journey after diagnosis with CKD, underline the disruptiveness of CKD on all aspects of life, and the urgency felt for incorporation of person-centred care within routine medical care. We identified four major themes with six subthemes: pursuing normality and control (subthemes: pursuing normality; a search for knowledge); prioritizing outcomes (subthemes: reaching kidney failure; experienced health; social life; work and economic productivity); predicting the future and realising what matters. Three barriers relevant to person-centred care provision were embedded within these themes: untailored and incomprehensible information, the inability to accurately estimate risks, and differences in priorities regarding outcomes and care processes between patients and healthcare professionals. The overall completeness of reporting as assessed by the COREQ was moderate, especially so for the domain 'research team and reflexivity'.

Following the disrupting period after diagnosis of CKD, patients express the need to return to normality and regain control to avoid further deterioration of kidney function and associated physical and mental symptoms. However, as patients in early stages of CKD usually experience few symptoms, the initial shock of being diagnosed with a chronic disease subdues, and maintaining or ignoring the status quo turned out to be relatively easy. A complicating factor in regaining control was clearly described by many patients in our study, namely the struggle and frustration to gain comprehensible information tailored to their specific situation, which we identified as an important barrier for person centred care provision. As a consequence of both the absence of symptoms and the difficulties in obtaining relevant information, self-management strategies were postponed by patients. The delayed self-management activation but also the strive for normality in the earlier stages of disease are not unique to CKD, but are observed in other chronic diseases as well.

### Global kidney health 2017 and beyond: a roadmap for closing gaps in care, research, and policy [^112xUpnG]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

The global nephrology community recognises the need for a cohesive plan to address the problem of chronic kidney disease (CKD). In July, 2016, the International Society of Nephrology hosted a CKD summit of more than 85 people with diverse expertise and professional backgrounds from around the globe. The purpose was to identify and prioritise key activities for the next 5–10 years in the domains of clinical care, research, and advocacy and to create an action plan and performance framework based on ten themes: strengthen CKD surveillance; tackle major risk factors for CKD; reduce acute kidney injury-a special risk factor for CKD; enhance understanding of the genetic causes of CKD; establish better diagnostic methods in CKD; improve understanding of the natural course of CKD; assess and implement established treatment options in patients with CKD; improve management of symptoms and complications of CKD; develop novel therapeutic interventions to slow CKD progression and reduce CKD complications; and increase the quantity and quality of clinical trials in CKD. Each group produced a prioritised list of goals, activities, and a set of key deliverable objectives for each of the themes. The intended users of this action plan are clinicians, patients, scientists, industry partners, governments, and advocacy organisations. Implementation of this integrated comprehensive plan will benefit people who are at risk for or affected by CKD worldwide.

### Recommendations for the screening and management of patients with chronic kidney disease [^117CbiNA]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a major health problem associated with considerable increase in morbidity and mortality and with decreased quality of life. To slow the progression of kidney failure, to prevent the consequences of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and to decrease cardiovascular mortality associated with CKD, it is crucial to detect patients with CKD early and to optimize their care. To assist physicians in patient management, members of a working party for the management of CKD have identified several recommendations for the screening of patients at risk of CKD and for the management of patients with established CKD.

Appendix E — patient focus group findings report patient priorities for chronic kidney disease (CKD) care, noting that participants emphasized the importance of CKD screening and follow-up to ensure an accurate, timely diagnosis, advocated for the proper use of laboratory tests to screen and accurately diagnose CKD, and urged providers to attentively follow up on test results to diagnose CKD in a timely manner. Participants expressed the need for more information from providers on how to better prevent CKD progression and stabilize their disease, stated that their desire to stabilize their kidney function is driven by a preference to avoid dialysis and prolong the life of their transplanted kidney, and asserted that providers could support them by supplying more information on how to better manage their CKD. Participants valued effective patient-provider communication and emphasized the importance of direct and timely communication with providers, appreciated a multidisciplinary team approach when creating treatment plans and advocated for using this approach to create consistent diet plans, and used a variety of delivery options to receive care, including telehealth and face-to-face visits.

### Chronic kidney disease [^1169kRae]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is a general term for heterogeneous disorders affecting kidney structure and function. The 2002 guidelines for definition and classification of this disease represented an important shift towards its recognition as a worldwide public health problem that should be managed in its early stages by general internists. Disease and management are classified according to stages of disease severity, which are assessed from glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria, and clinical diagnosis (cause and pathology). Chronic kidney disease can be detected with routine laboratory tests, and some treatments can prevent development and slow disease progression, reduce complications of decreased GFR and risk of cardiovascular disease, and improve survival and quality of life. In this Seminar we discuss disease burden, recommendations for assessment and management, and future challenges. We emphasise clinical practice guidelines, clinical trials, and areas of uncertainty.

### Recommendations for the care of patients receiving conservative kidney management: focus on management of CKD and symptoms [^111qpKJ1]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conservative kidney management is increasingly accepted as an appropriate treatment option for patients with eGFR category 5 CKD who are unlikely to benefit from dialysis and/or who choose a nondialysis care option. However, there remains great variation in the delivery of their care. As part of the development of a conservative kidney management pathway that is undergoing evaluation, a set of recommendations specific to conservative kidney management for managing the complications of CKD and common symptoms was developed. These recommendations focus on the patient's values and preferences and aim to optimize comfort and quality of life. Explanations for the interventions are provided to support the shared decision-making process between health care professionals, patients, and family members. The recommendations generally emphasize the preservation of function (cognitive, physical, and kidney) and address symptom burden, acknowledging that management priorities can change over time. The recommendations should be used in conjunction with other key elements of conservative kidney management, including clear communication and shared decision making for choosing conservative kidney management, advance care planning, and psychosocial support. Although there are limitations to the existing evidence specific to conservative kidney management, these recommendations are intended as a starting point toward reaching consensus and generating further evidence.

### Person centred care provision and care planning in chronic kidney disease: which outcomes matter? A systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies: care planning in CKD: which outcomes matter? [^114WCbH4]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Pursuing normality and control

This theme comprises two subthemes: pursuing normality and a search for knowledge; both describing the need for certainty.

Pursuing normality

The gravity of being diagnosed with a life threatening disease, and the realization that with progression of time and decreasing kidney function various outcomes may occur, was unsettling for most: "Having CKD is just like walking in the valley of the shadow of death, and I can see no hope… My children are still so young. Death has cast a shadow over me, and I am very affected". In this disruptive and bewildering period, patients reached a moment where they felt the need to regain control of their disease and return to normality: "If you can't have some semblance of a normal life, then why would you want to live". Especially in the earlier phases of CKD, when few symptoms were experienced, feeling normal instead of feeling like a patient with a chronic disease was relatively easy. However, with the increase of disease severity, participants became more aware of their disease, and expressed an urgency to regain control and stop further deterioration of their health.

### Chronic kidney disease: detection and evaluation [^117R5P3C]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease affects 47 million people in the United States and is associated with significant health care costs, morbidity, and mortality. Because this disease can silently progress to advanced stages, early detection is critical for initiating timely interventions. Multiple guidelines recommend at least annual screening with serum creatinine, urine albumin/creatinine ratio, and urinalysis for patients with risk factors, particularly diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and a history of cardiovascular disease. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chronic kidney disease in the general population, and the American College of Physicians recommends against screening asymptomatic adults without risk factors. Persistently elevated serum creatinine and albuminuria are diagnostic and prognostic hallmarks of chronic kidney disease. Lower levels of albuminuria are associated with adverse renal and cardiovascular outcomes. Serum cystatin C is a novel biomarker that is most useful when a false-positive decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate calculated from serum creatinine is suspected. New guidelines incorporate albuminuria into the classification framework for chronic kidney disease and elaborate on identification of the disease, the frequency of follow-up, and recommendations for nephrology referral. Nephrology consultation is indicated for patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m2, persistent urine albumin/creatinine ratio greater than 300 mg per g or urine protein/creatinine ratio greater than 500 mg per g, or if there is evidence of a rapid loss of kidney function. A multidisciplinary approach between primary care physicians, nephrologists, and other subspecialists for implementing early interventions, providing education, and planning for advanced renal disease is key for effective management.

### Detecting and managing the patient with chronic kidney disease in primary care: a review of the latest guidelines [^116XpUd4]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major global health problem, affecting about 9.5% of the population and 850million people worldwide. In primary care, most CKD is caused by diabetes and/or hypertension, but a substantial proportion of cases may have alternative causes. During the early stages, CKD is asymptomatic, and many people are unaware that they are living with the disease. Despite the lack of symptoms, CKD is associated with elevated risks of cardiovascular disease, progressive kidney disease, kidney failure and premature mortality. Risk reduction strategies are effective and cost-effective but require early diagnosis through testing of the estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria in high-risk populations. Once diagnosed, the treatment of CKD centres around lifestyle interventions, blood pressure and glycaemic control, and preventative treatments for cardiovascular disease and kidney disease progression. Most patients with CKD should be managed with statins, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors. Additional treatment options to reduce cardiorenal risk are available in patients with diabetes, including glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. The Kidney Failure Risk Equation is a new tool that can support the identification of patients at high risk of progressive kidney disease and kidney failure and can be used to guide referrals to nephrology. This review summarizes the latest guidance relevant to managing adults with, or at risk of, CKD and provides practical advice for managing patients with CKD in primary care.

"Dialysis is a life-sustaining treatment", and in "frail and elderly patients, where survival benefit is less clear and the impact to QoL may be significant", "goals of care must be individualized to the preferences, values, and capabilities of the patient and their caregivers". "Involvement of geriatric and/or palliative care services to assist in SDM conversations and symptom management may be helpful", and when there is uncertainty, "palliative dialysis or a time-limited trial of KRT followed by re-engagement of the patient and caregivers in an SDM discussion may be appropriate". "Shared decision-making enables patients to make informed decisions about their care, and ensures that their values and preferences are reflected in their treatment decisions".

### Optimizing care for patients with CKD [^1144t7nJ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Care of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is complex and requires a standardized and multidisciplinary approach. A number of strategies have been suggested to improve care for patients with CKD, including the development of clinical practice guidelines and introduction of chronic disease management (CDM) programs. CDM programs represent a proactive approach to care by supporting the physician and patient, with an emphasis on prevention of exacerbations and complications achieved through a coordinated multidisciplinary team. In addition to targeting patients at highest risk, CDM programs also emphasize intensive monitoring and proactive follow-up. The expansion of professional roles may be an important component in ensuring the success of this approach. Although observational studies suggest that specific components of CDM programs may improve care for patients with CKD, further research is needed to evaluate the program component effectiveness in CKD prevention and management. This includes well-conducted randomized trials and long-term follow-up of patients with CKD to assess changes in adverse health outcomes.

### Person centred care provision and care planning in chronic kidney disease: which outcomes matter? A systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies: care planning in CKD: which outcomes matter? [^112Cvsnf]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a group of kidney diseases in which there usually is a gradual decrease in kidney function leading to kidney failure. The often asymptomatic nature of CKD, combined with the low awareness of kidney function in general, makes it difficult for patients to comprehend, cope and finally take control after the diagnosis of CKD. During the progression of CKD to kidney failure however, numerous physical and psychosocial symptoms may develop, overall reducing health-related quality of life (HRQOL). In this phase, kidney replacement therapy (KRT; kidney transplantation or dialysis), or alternatively conservative therapy is necessary, requiring an informed decision with knowledge of the disease, the possible outcomes and the chances of reaching these outcomes in combination with prioritization of what matters to the patient.

However, for most patients the period between CKD and kidney failure is marked by confusion about the disruptive transition from their pre- to their postdiagnosis self, and uncertainty about what to expect. Furthermore, it is increasingly acknowledged that outcomes prioritized by clinicians, such as planning for dialysis or transplant, and postponing kidney failure and death, do not adequately reflect patients' desired outcomes, which in contrast may include patient reported outcomes (PROs) like HRQOL or symptom burden. PRO measures (PROMs) have been developed to further implement person-centred care, by providing insight into outcomes and enhancing the patient-professional conversation about patients' needs and expectations. Such aspects of person-centred care show promising results but have yet to be fully incorporated into routine nephrological care.

In-depth knowledge about what matters to patients can also be obtained through qualitative research. Moreover, by using qualitative methods, answers to why patients value these outcomes can also be obtained, hereby providing an opportunity for deeper understanding of their motivations, behaviour and beliefs. Though frequently used as a first step for the development of PROMs, transferability to other populations than the study subjects of single qualitative studies remains a concern. Systematically reviewing and thematically synthesizing the data of these single studies can result in a greater conceptual understanding of the topic beyond the single studies.

Although person-centred care within CKD shows promising results, better understanding of patients' perspectives on what is important in nephrological care may help to further implement person-centred care. Hence, the aim of this study is to identify outcomes prioritized by patients with CKD, and barriers to person-centred care and care planning, by means of a systematic review and inductive thematic synthesis of qualitative studies among patients with CKD.

### Self-management interventions for chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115rMqTN]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive disease that leads to End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD: maintenance dialysis or kidney transplantation), cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Approximately 440,000 patients begin dialysis each year worldwide, and annual costs of dialysis and kidney transplants range between US $35,000 and 100,000. This can strain healthcare budgets. Clinical decision making for CKD is challenging due to the heterogeneity of kidney diseases, variability in rates of disease progression, and the competing risk of cardiovascular mortality, the most common cause of death worldwide. Furthermore, CKD is not included in the list of priorities for most non-communicable diseases (NCD), and few countries have clear policies or public programs to prevent and control CKD.

CKD management includes slowing the progression to ESRD and decreasing the risk of cardiovascular complications through management of kidney function and CKD progression risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes. In addition to medication, managing risk factors is important clinically because it can prevent, or at least minimize, the likelihood of further renal injury. Long-term CKD management requires a high level of patient involvement, both in decision-making and in the implementation of care. There is growing recognition that patients want to be involved as equal partners in their care. The goal of self-management is to identify strategies that can be used to help patients manage their condition(s) while leading active and productive lives. This includes goal setting, problem solving, symptom management, and shared decision-making, and these strategies are applicable for a diverse population. For patients with CKD, this encompasses a spectrum of behaviors ranging from adherence to medication, exercise, and diet recommendations (self-management maintenance) to recognition of early warning signs, and self-adjustment of home-care regimens.

Despite an established tradition of patient self-management of ESRD, and self-management being a well-established treatment strategy for other chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension, evidence to support its use for CKD non-dialysis is limited. To lighten the economic burden of ESRD, strategies must be implemented to prevent the progression from early-stage CKD. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we synthesized results from RCTs to evaluate the effects of self-management intervention on major renal outcomes and mortality in non-dialysis adults with CKD. We also assessed effect modification by proteinuria and blood pressure.

### Living with moderate to severe renal failure from the perspective of patients [^116W7Tc5]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Personalised care planning is a collaborative pro-active process used in the management of chronic diseases in which patients and professionals identify and discuss problems caused by or related to the patient's condition, developing a plan for tackling these. In essence, it is a conversation or series of conversations, in which they jointly agree on goals and actions for managing the patient's condition. Personalised care planning aims at ensuring that the individuals' values and concerns that shape the way long-term conditions are managed.

Instead of focusing on a standard set of disease management processes determined by healthcare professionals, this approach encourages patients to select treatment goals and work with clinicians to determine their specific needs for treatment and support. The results from this study can be used to set goals. The results also pinpoint the importance of holistic care, as Mangin previously described. Ideally the care for people with multiple long-term conditions like CKD should be holistic, which means person-centred rather than disease-focused. It should be responsive to individuals' experiences of illness and treatment effects and persons' individual priorities. Personalised care planning leads to people's increased capability to self-manage their condition when compared to usual care, as described in a recent systematic review.

KDOQI diabetes and chronic kidney disease — obesity mechanisms and weight management statements indicate that there is a body of evidence that obesity is a risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and that obesity is associated with the development of proteinuria and loss of kidney function; proposed mechanisms include physical compression of the kidneys by visceral obesity, RAS activation, hyperinsulinemia, sympathetic activation, overnutrition, glomerular hyperfiltration, proteinuria-associated kidney damage, and blood pressure elevation. Maintaining a normal body mass index (BMI) (18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2) reduces various risk factors for CKD and CVD, weight loss should be achieved by a balanced reduction in caloric intake rather than by diets that derive the majority of calories from animal protein, and weight management should include a plan for regular physical exercise. The health benefits of maintaining a normal BMI are not defined in people with diabetes and CKD, and optimal targets for BMI and weight loss should be determined.

### Chronic kidney disease of unknown aetiology: a real-world study [^114iZCMM]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Diagnosis of rare chronic kidney diseases (CKD) can be difficult with conventional diagnostic workup (laboratory tests including standard blood and urine investigations, imaging, and kidney biopsy). As such, a proportion of patients with rare CKD do not receive an underlying diagnosis. Their CKD is labelled CKD of Unknown Aetiology (CKDUA). CKDUA represents about 10% of patients diagnosed with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).

There are several benefits to receiving a diagnosis and these include: (1) potential change in management with the use of specific treatment (for example enzyme replacement therapy in Fabry's disease), (2) helping to guide kidney transplantation planning, (3) helping to screen potentially affected family members, (4) assisting with reproductive options, (5) highlighting possible extra renal features/renal sub-diseases which can potentially be screened for and detected earlier, (6) avoiding ineffective therapies in some cases, (7) guiding clinicians and patients regarding clinical trials in a specific disease area and (8) preventing progression towards ESKD and the need for costly renal replacement therapy (RRT).

### Disease management programs for CKD patients: the potential and pitfalls [^116MAvAJ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Disease management describes the use of a number of approaches to identify and treat patients with chronic health conditions, especially those that are expensive to treat. Disease management programs have grown rapidly in the United States in the past several years. These programs have been established for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), but some have been discontinued because of the high cost of the program. Disease management programs for CKD face unique challenges. Identification of patients with CKD is hampered by incomplete use of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes for CKD by physicians and the less than universal use of estimated glomerular filtration rate from serum creatinine measurements to identify patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). CKD affects multiple organ systems. Thus, a comprehensive disease management program will need to manage each of these aspects of CKD. These multiple interventions likely will make a CKD disease management program more costly than similar disease management programs designed for patients with diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, or other chronic diseases. The lack of data that can be used to develop effective disease management programs in CKD makes it difficult to determine goals for the management of each organ system affected by CKD. Finally, long periods of observation will be needed to determine whether a particular disease management program is effective in not only improving patient outcomes, but also decreasing both resource use and health care dollars. This long-term observation period is contrary to how most disease management contracts are written, which usually are based on meeting goals during a 1- to 3-year period. Until these challenges are resolved, it likely will be difficult to maintain effective disease management programs for CKD.

### Association of chronic condition special needs plan with hospitalization and mortality among patients with end-stage kidney disease [^116wZxmZ]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are logical candidates for coordinated care or disease management programs. Most have multiple chronic conditions, including heart failure, diabetes, and hypertension — conditions that can be successfully addressed via disease management programs. Clinical practice guidelines and evidence-based interventions can be used to support and manage their care. Moreover, they either receive treatment 3 times per week or have a regular evaluation at the dialysis clinic if being treated someplace else, such as at home. In addition, they often have a network of clinicians involved in their care to treat their multiple comorbidities.

Coordinated care programs for patients with ESKD evolved in the 1990s. Mortality rates and clinical parameters improved among patients in these programs compared with patients receiving general care, although hospitalizations were not significantly different between patient groups. Additional analyses suggested that a different care model, with a care manager, a quality management system, and differential physician engagement, reduced mortality and hospitalization. Based on these data, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) contracted with Medicare Advantage in a disease management demonstration to determine whether plan-based interventions and resources could improve clinical outcomes and reduce costs for patients with ESKD. Patient survival improved and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations declined compared with patients in the fee-for-service program during the demonstration's first 3 years. The demonstration also highlighted the benefits of ESKD-specific treatments, such as nutritional supplementation.

CMS subsequently included ESKD in the chronic or disabling conditions eligible for enrollment in chronic condition special needs plans (C-SNPs). C-SNPs are a type of Medicare Advantage offering targeted or specialized services for Medicare beneficiaries who have a severe or disabling chronic condition. The plan receives payments per member per month and is at risk for coordinating and managing the care of the individuals enrolled in the plan. The plan may also provide specific benefits and health care networks for the beneficiaries enrolled. These vary based on the plan and may include access to preventive vision and dental services, nutrition support, and access to transportation, among other options that are determined by the plan. Special needs plans also have to meet certain requirements, such as maintaining a model of care that outlines the plan's care coordination, care management, and quality strategies. Regulations require that CMS approves the model of care but do not specify the interventions to be included. In light of the theoretical and extrapolated benefits of C-SNPs, we examined whether C-SNP enrollment was associated with improved clinical outcomes and quality of life in a real-world setting among ESKD patients who met eligibility criteria.

### Use of administrative databases for health-care planning in CKD [^116B9ma9]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Good-quality information is required to plan healthcare services for patients with chronic diseases. Such information includes measures of disease burden, current care patterns and gaps in care based on quality-of-care indicators and clinical outcomes. Administrative data have long been used as a source of information for policy decisions related to the management of chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and hypertension. More recently, chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been acknowledged as a significant public health issue. Administrative data, particularly when supplemented by the use of routine laboratory data, have the potential to inform the development of optimal CKD care strategies, generate hypotheses about how to slow disease progression and identify risk factors for adverse outcomes. Available data may allow case identification and assessment of rates and patterns of disease progression, evaluation of risk and complications, including current gaps in care, and an estimation of associated costs. In this article, we use the example of the Alberta Kidney Disease Network to describe how researchers and policy makers can collaborate, using administrative data sources to guide health policy for the care of CKD patients.

### Optimizing outcomes in the elderly with end-stage renal disease – live long and prosper [^116HELBW]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The elderly form an expanding proportion of patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease worldwide. The increased physiological frailty and functional morbidity associated with the aging process pose unique challenges when planning optimal management of an older patient needing renal replacement therapy (RRT).

Aims

This position paper discusses current evidence regarding the optimal management of end-stage renal disease in the elderly with an emphasis on hemodialysis since it is the most common modality used in older patients. Further research is needed to define relevant patient-reported outcome measures for end-stage renal disease including functional assessments and psychological impacts of various forms of RRT. For those older patients who have opted for dialysis treatment, it is important to study the strategies that encourage greater uptake of home-based dialysis therapies and optimal vascular access.

Conclusions

The management of advanced chronic kidney disease in the elderly can be challenging but also extremely rewarding. The key issue is adopting a patient-focused and individualized approach that seeks to achieve the best outcomes based on a comprehensive holistic assessment of what is important to the patient.

### Meeting the challenges of the new K / DOQI guidelines [^114Y6ggm]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Substantial gains in the dialytic treatment of patients with end-stage renal disease have been made during the past several decades. However, inadequate attention has been given to the problem of chronic kidney disease (CKD) as a whole. CKD and its associated complications emerge years before patients develop kidney failure and become dialysis dependent. It now is evident that to improve dialysis outcomes, it is essential for practitioners to recognize the earlier stages of CKD, not only to retard disease progression, but also to prevent and treat its complications and comorbidities long before the need for dialysis arises. The recently published National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines identify the broad-based problem of CKD in the general population and introduce action plans that can be used at the different stages of CKD. This article discusses the process behind the development of the CKD guidelines and highlights the disease evaluation, classification, and stratification system provided by the guidelines. It is hoped that widespread implementation of these recommendations will increase the understanding of CKD among both providers and patients and eliminate many of the obstacles that nephrologists have faced in providing optimal care to dialysis patients in particular and to patients with CKD in general.

### Recommendations for a clinical decision support for the management of individuals with chronic kidney disease [^113JEdBT]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Care for advanced CKD patients is suboptimal. CKD practice guidelines aim to close gaps in care, but making providers aware of guidelines is an ineffective implementation strategy. The Institute of Medicine has endorsed the use of clinical decision support (CDS) for implementing guidelines. The authors' objective was to identify the requirements of an optimal CDS system for CKD management.

Design, Setting, Participants, and Measurements

The aims of this study expanded on those of previous work that used the facilitated process improvement (FPI) methodology. In FPI, an expert workgroup develops a set of quality improvement tools that can subsequently be utilized by practicing physicians. The authors conducted a discussion with a group of multidisciplinary experts to identify requirements for an optimal CDS system.

Results

The panel considered the process of patient identification and management, associated barriers, and elements by which CDS could address these barriers. The panel also discussed specific knowledge needs in the context of a typical scenario in which CDS would be used. Finally, the group developed a set of core requirements that will likely facilitate the implementation of a CDS system aimed at improving the management of any chronic medical condition.

Conclusions

Considering the growing burden of CKD and the potential healthcare and resource impact of guideline implementation through CDS, the relevance of this systematic process, consistent with Institute of Medicine recommendations, cannot be understated. The requirements described in this report could serve as a basis for the design of a CKD-specific CDS.

### Diagnosis and management of non-dialysis chronic kidney disease in ambulatory care: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines [^11444vMd]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Clinical Practice Guidelines are increasingly issued by various stakeholders to promote quality of care. The KDIGO guideline on diagnosis and management of CKD has been adapted in many countries and served as model for most guidelines included in this review. There was substantial variation in the quality of the guideline development process.

Although there is good agreement on most core recommendations, the scope of recommendations issued by the guidelines varied significantly. Many recommendations for management of CKD relyprimarily on consensus. The care for CKD in multimorbid patients might require more individualization based on patient preferences and circumstances than can be reflected by guideline recommendations based primarily on measurement of kidney function. Since subtle differences can have a significant impact on health resource utilization and increase burden of disease in affected patients, careful implementation and evaluation of benefits and harms in every health care system is warranted.

Outcomes — For the first key question, the critical outcome is point prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) by risk factor and patient demographics/characteristics, and important outcomes include probability of decline in eGFR, incident/worsening of albuminuria, or kidney failure; incidence rates of CKD diagnosis; CKD stage at diagnosis; kidney failure (treatment by dialysis or kidney transplant); and CKD diagnosis rate at different predefined timepoints. For the second key question, critical outcomes are risk of CKD progression to ESKD and validated surrogate markers/predictors of CKD progression, and important outcomes are mortality and cardiovascular composite outcome (e.g. MACE).

Realising what matters

On top of living in a vacuum of prognostic uncertainty, many patients described being misunderstood by their healthcare professionals. Although the exact instances varied widely, there were two main reasons patients felt unheard: 1) professionals displayed a mechanistic approach to disease without an interest in forming relationships, instead of a holistic and person centred approach: "I want to be more than my renal function. They don't see you as a person. ", and 2) a difference in priorities between healthcare professionals and patients: "My nephrologist just saw kind of being pregnant as an associated risk, not really as a human thing". The feeling that not they, but the healthcare professionals were in control of their disease trajectory often resulted in frustration and alienation. Nevertheless, the ' ultimate decision ' whether or not to start KRT was often left in the hands of, or at least influenced heavily by, their healthcare professionals: "I am an independent person and I would like to decide about most things. But I also think that if somebody comes and says this is a really bad decision you have made because this, and that and this is supported by arguments then well, I give in to that".

Description

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) organization updated its existing clinical practice guideline in 2024 to provide guidance on the evaluation, management, and treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults and children who are not receiving kidney replacement therapy.

Methods

The KDIGO CKD Guideline Work Group defined the scope of the guideline and determined topics for systematic review. An independent Evidence Review Team systematically reviewed the evidence and graded the certainty of evidence for each of the review topics. Latest searches of the English-language literature were done in July 2023. Final modification of the guideline was informed by a public review process during summer of 2023 involving registered stakeholders.

Recommendations

The full guideline included 28 recommendations and 141 practice points. This synopsis focuses on the recommendations that have the greatest evidence. Practice points reflect the expert opinion of the group where evidence is not that strong. Recommendations include greater emphasis on cystatin C for assessment of glomerular filtration rate, point-of-care testing in remote areas, a shift to an individualized risk-based approach to predict kidney failure, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors for some patients with CKD with and without diabetes, and statin use for adults older than 50 years and CKD. Together the recommendations and practice points provide guidance for how to evaluate and manage persons with CKD.

Chronic kidney disease definition and risk describe CKD as abnormalities of kidney structure or function characterized by a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 60 mL/min/1.73m2 or a normal GFR with other markers such as proteinuria, hematuria, or abnormal imaging of the kidneys, present for greater than three months, with implications for health. Classification frameworks noted include National Kidney Foundation guidelines that classified five stages of CKD based on declining estimated GFR (eGFR) and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidance updated in 2024 that classified CKD based on cause, GFR, and severity of albuminuria; the risk of kidney failure requiring dialysis, cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, and mortality increases with each higher stage of CKD, and for any given stage, the presence of albuminuria is associated with increasing risk of CKD progression, CVD events, and mortality.

People with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk for kidney failure, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and premature mortality. Recent clinical trials support new approaches to treat diabetes and CKD. The 2022 American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes and the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease each provide evidence-based recommendations for management. A joint group of ADA and KDIGO representatives reviewed and developed a series of consensus statements to guide clinical care from the ADA and KDIGO guidelines. The published guidelines are aligned in the areas of CKD screening and diagnosis, glycemia monitoring, lifestyle therapies, treatment goals, and pharmacologic management. Recommendations include comprehensive care in which pharmacotherapy that is proven to improve kidney and cardiovascular outcomes is layered on a foundation of healthy lifestyle. Consensus statements provide specific guidance on use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, metformin, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, and a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. These areas of consensus provide clear direction for implementation of care to improve clinical outcomes of people with diabetes and CKD.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^113cf2UM]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Guideline 3.1 - treatment of Anaemia - Erythropoiesis stimulating agents

We recommend that treatment with Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESAs) should be offered to patients with anaemia of CKD who are likely to benefit in terms of quality of life and physical function and to avoid blood transfusion; especially in patients considered suitable for transplantation. (1B)

Audit measure

Proportion of patients on renal replacement therapy (on haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis for more than 3 months) with Hb level < 100 g/L who are not prescribed an ESA.

Rationale

Treatment of anaemia in CKD with ESA can be expensive, takes time to work and carries a small but significant risk to the patient. It is therefore reasonable, as with any therapy, to treat only those who are expected to benefit in the time frame that therapy is being considered. For example, patients with severe sepsis/inflammation/acute bleeding are unlikely to respond.

Patients with a very short life expectancy (days or weeks) are not likely to survive long enough for therapy to provide benefit in terms of an increase in Hb. The clinician and patient should agree on a therapeutic plan and, at an appropriate time, review whether therapy is providing enough benefit to continue treatment.

Guideline 3.2 - treatment of Anaemia - choice of ESA

We recommend that the decision on the choice of ESA is based on local availability of ESAs. (1B)

Audit measure

Each renal unit should audit the type, route and frequency of administration and weekly dose of ESA prescribed.

Rationale

Many studies have been published comparing different ESA products against each other when used at different dosing intervals, by different routes of administration and in different patient groups. All the available products are efficacious when administered according to the manufacturers' recommendations. The choice of ESA will be dependent upon the clinician and patient agreeing a management plan and local supply arrangements.

Guideline 3.3 - treatment of Anaemia with ESA therapy - target Hb

We suggest that patients with CKD on ESA therapy should achieve Hb between:
100 and 120 g/L in adults, young people and children aged 2 years and older (2B)
95 and 115 g/L in children younger than 2 years of age (reflecting the lower normal range in that age (2B)

Guideline 3.4 - treatment of Anaemia without ESA therapy - target Hb

We suggest that these Hb targets apply exclusively to patients receiving ESA and are not intended to apply to the treatment of iron deficiency in patients receiving iron therapy without the use of ESAs. (2B)

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS BASED ON ADVANCED AGE AND REPRODUCTIVE EXPECTATIONS

In a separate section, in contrast to the 2012 guidelines, the 2024 CKD Guideline discusses several special populations which must be considered, especially those at advanced age. This reflects the important challenges in managing advanced CKD in this demographic (Fig. 1). The evaluation of eGFR may be misleading as creatinine-based equations may be inaccurate due to sarcopenia and quality of life may be prioritized over survival advantage, therefore appropriate diagnosis and shared decision-making are key.

Figure 1:

The special populations in terms of kidney health with important clinical considerations.

The deleterious effects of CKD on reproductive health and pregnancy outcomes are well-established, with a clear need for discussion with individuals considering pregnancy. Although the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline has taken a step forward to identify multiple special populations potentially differing in terms of CKD management, it is important to emphasize that the current knowledge of optimal approaches to care in these specific patient groups is limited and evidence-based recommendations are weak, highlighting the definitive need for future studies.

### Applying multiple interventions in chronic kidney disease [^1147hcZ1]. Seminars in Dialysis (2003). Low credibility.

The medical, social, and financial burdens posed by end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are many and growing rapidly. People generally reach ESRD as a result of chronic progressive kidney disease. Advancing kidney disease is associated with several treatable complications, which if poorly managed reduce the length and quality of life. In addition, there are strong links between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Many people with less advanced CKD will die or suffer complications of CVD before reaching ESRD. Efficacious interventions, such as lowering blood pressure and treating dyslipidemia, can substantially reduce the progression of both kidney and cardiovascular disease. Careful management of these complex and interrelated diseases and risk factors requires detailed longitudinal and focused care which does not seem to be optimally delivered by health service practitioners organized in traditional ways. A disease management approach offers promise in this setting, but requires further study of clinical and economic impact.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major global health priority affecting 10%–12% of the population (over 850 million people) with the number of affected individuals projected to increase rapidly over the next few decades. The prevalence of CKD is higher in those over 60 years of age, as well as in individuals with increased body mass index, diabetes and hypertension. Having CKD has significant negative implications for both life expectancy and quality of life, especially as a core component of the increasingly recognized cardio-kidney-metabolic multimorbidity syndrome. The 2024 Report from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study using 2021 data shows that CKD is the 11th leading cause of death, with 1.53 million deaths, with a further 2.1 million cardiovascular deaths attributable to CKD. CKD is also expected to rise from the 23rd leading cause of disease burden worldwide in 2022 to the 10th by 2050. However, much of the kidney disease burden globally, and its impact on outcomes of other conditions, remains uncounted, therefore these numbers are likely conservative estimates.

The new 2024 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of CKD, 12 years on from the previous guideline in 2012, are a very welcome update which emphasize both the advancements in the fields and the remaining gaps to fill. The document is an impressive text at 198 pages with 937 references, with multiple associated documents including supplementary material, executive summary and takeaway message summaries.

The purpose of this article is not to summarize the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline but, on behalf of the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) group of the European Renal Association (ERA), to highlight some of what is new and relevant, especially in the European context. Given the rapidly evolving and expanding field of treatment for CKD [for example, the FLOW trial data on Semaglutide, a Glucagon Like Peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1ra), on kidney disease progression which was published after the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline], we chose to focus on the remaining Achilles' heel of the global push to improve CKD care and outcomes — the first step towards effective management of the disease — evaluation and risk assessment in people with CKD.

Matters most to me — patient-centered CKD care and SDM: CKD patients face complex decisions and often need to make trade-offs, and some options such as initiation of dialysis have tremendous impact on lifestyle and quality of life (QoL) (see Recommendations 8–11); clinicians should assist patients in formulating and verbalizing goals of care when needed, include patient preferences and priorities for SDM that support the patient's goals of care, complete a life sustaining treatment directive (e.g., living will), and use conservative kidney management decision aids which may be useful.

### Evaluation and management of obesity in chronic kidney disease [^113PXxtW]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Obesity is arguably the premier global public health problem of our era. It is also an independent risk factor for the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and adverse outcomes in persons with CKD. Fortunately, effective treatment options for obesity have proliferated in just the last few years. These newer therapies in conjunction with older treatments offer great potential in treating obesity and CKD, though many questions remain about their use, efficacy, and place within the overall therapeutic plan. This paper will provide a discussion of the definition of obesity, its etiology, and its importance as a risk factor for CKD and other kidney-associated problems. It will then review current treatment options for obesity and the related evidence base. Finally, it will address major topics or controversies that remain unresolved and identify obstacles to effective treatment.

### Diabetes management in chronic kidney disease: synopsis of the KDIGO 2022 clinical practice guideline update [^114sMRip]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Description

The KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease is an update of the 2020 guideline from Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO).

Methods

The KDIGO Work Group updated the guideline, which included reviewing and grading new evidence that was identified and summarized. As in the previous guideline, the Work Group used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to appraise evidence and rate the strength of recommendations and expert judgment to develop consensus practice points. New evidence led to updating of recommendations in the chapters Comprehensive Care in Patients With Diabetes and CKD (Chapter 1) and Glucose-Lowering Therapies in Patients With T2D and CKD (Chapter 4). New evidence did not change recommendations in the chapters Glycemic Monitoring and Targets in Patients With Diabetes and CKD (Chapter 2), Lifestyle Interventions in Patients With Diabetes and CKD (Chapter 3), and Approaches to Management of Patients With Diabetes and CKD (Chapter 5).

Recommendations

The updated guideline includes 13 recommendations and 52 practice points for clinicians caring for patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). A focus on preserving kidney function and maintaining well-being is recommended using a layered approach to care, starting with a foundation of lifestyle interventions, self-management, and first-line pharmacotherapy (such as sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors) demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes. To this are added additional drugs with heart and kidney protection, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and interventions to control risk factors for CKD progression and cardiovascular events, such as blood pressure, glycemia, and lipids.

"The general treatment of diabetes is beyond the scope of this guideline and is addressed comprehensively in the ADA guidelines". The Work Group "divided its recommendations… between CPGs and CPRs", using Guidelines where "the strength of the evidence was sufficient to make definite statements", and offering CPRs "based on the best available evidence and expert opinion" when evidence was insufficient. It anticipates updates, as "the strength of the evidence for many of the CPRs may become sufficient for the CPRs to become CPGs", and the Background reviews content "in people with CKD stages 1 to 4", while "Specific recommendations for CKD stage 5 are provided in the NKF-KDOQI Guidelines for CVD in Dialysis Patients". Guideline development is framed as "an evolving process that seeks to ensure that each patient receives the best possible care within the context of presently available medical knowledge".

### Population health management for improving kidney health outcomes [^112cJeg6]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is globally prevalent, a leading cause of mortality, and is associated with poor patient outcomes and high health care costs. Gaps in guideline-concordant care are common across the continuum of CKD. These gaps lead to CKD progression, hospitalizations, and mortality and are potentiated by existing racial and socioeconomic disparities. A thoughtfully designed population health management approach that leverages electronic health records can modernize CKD care delivery and improve outcomes. Such an approach can potentially provide timely, equitable, resource- and cost-efficient care across health systems in a way that is scalable and data driven. Herein, we share our experiences with the implementation of nephrology population health initiatives at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center across the CKD spectrum, which include ongoing and planned programs in the primary care, kidney-palliative care, kidney transplantation, and transitions of care settings. Further, we discuss the challenges of population health management and future directions that can move health care toward personalized medicine.

ABSTRACT

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2024 Guideline for Identification and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a welcome development, coming 12 years after the paradigm-changing 2012 guidelines. We are living in an unprecedented era in nephrology with novel therapies, including sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, now being proven in multiple randomized controlled clinical trials to reduce both the progression of CKD and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline is aimed at a broad audience looking after children and adults with CKD and provide practical and actionable steps to improve care. This commentary reviews the guideline sections pertaining to the evaluation and risk assessment of individuals with CKD from a European perspective. We feel that despite the last guideline being published 12 years ago, and the fact that the assessment of CKD has been emphasized by many other national/international nephrology, cardiology and diabetology guidelines and societies, the diagnosis and treatment of CKD remains poor across Europe. As such, the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline should be seen as an urgent call to action to improve diagnosis and care of children and adults with CKD across Europe. We know what we need to do. We now need to get on and do it.

### Caring for older patients with advanced chronic kidney disease and considering their needs: a qualitative study [^116W7phn]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) among older patients is common in the United States and the prevalence among those aged ≥ 65 has increased from approximately 3 to 14% in the last two decades. Among patients who ultimately develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD), many are referred by their nephrologists for educational sessions to learn about different treatment options such as dialysis. However, ESRD patient education programs tend to focus on modality type, vascular access, and care setting rather than on how the different treatment modalities may affect patient lifestyles and goals of care. Few patients with advanced CKD are aware of treatment options such as conservative kidney management or advance care planning and seldom have an opportunity to discuss preferences with their clinicians or loved ones. One recent study of older patients with advanced CKD and ESRD showed that many did not fully understand dialysis and perceived it as the only alternative to death.

Emerging models of care demonstrate that integration of palliative care within nephrology practices can help promote conservative kidney management and advance care planning and also improve patient satisfaction among older patients; however, implementation has proved to be challenging. Previous research has demonstrated numerous clinician barriers to providing conservative kidney management and facilitating advance care planning including prognostic uncertainty, inconsistent collaboration between nephrologists and primary care physicians (PCP), and limited knowledge of ESRD treatment options. Although there is some literature that explores perceptions of ESRD treatment and end-of-life care options among older patients with advanced CKD and ESRD, it is unclear whether their views are consistent with their clinicians. To fill this knowledge gap, we sought to explore the alignment between clinician views of their responsibilities and patient clinical experiences via qualitative interviews with nephrologists, PCPs, patients, and caregivers regarding ESRD treatments and advance care planning.

Regarding medical management for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to RAAS inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist with proven kidney or cardiovascular benefit in adult patients with T2DM, eGFR > 25 mL/min/1.73 m², normal serum potassium level, and albuminuria > 30 mg/g despite maximum tolerated dose of renin-angiotensin system inhibitor.
Recognize that nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are most appropriate for adult patients with T2DM at high risk of CKD progression and cardiovascular events, as indicated by persistent albuminuria despite other standard-of-care therapies.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^117VEeXB]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD chronic kidney disease (CKD) primary care guideline — statin therapy evidence appraisal and strength. The Work Group categorized this recommendation as Reviewed, New-added, with High confidence in the quality of the evidence due to consistent findings in many studies incorporated in the meta-analysis. In patients with CKD not on dialysis, the benefits of reduced major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and mortality outweigh the potential harm of adverse events, and the Work Group decided upon a Strong for recommendation.
