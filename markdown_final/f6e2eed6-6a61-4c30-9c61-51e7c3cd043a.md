## Question

Does digoxin lower blood pressure?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether digoxin lowers blood pressure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about digoxin's primary pharmacologic effects and mechanism of action. Then, I should verify the direct hemodynamic data in heart failure and acute settings. Next, I will examine clinical trial signals and guideline positions for any blood pressure–lowering claims. After that, I need to check for indirect or context-dependent effects that could make blood pressure appear lower. Finally, I will consider special populations and drug interactions before synthesizing a clear conclusion with practical implications.

> Let me first confirm the core pharmacology, because I need to ensure I'm not conflating chronotropic and inotropic effects with antihypertensive actions. Digoxin inhibits Na+/K+-ATPase, increasing intracellular calcium and contractility while enhancing vagal tone and baroreceptor sensitivity. These effects increase stroke volume and cardiac output and slow AV nodal conduction, but they do not directly vasodilate or lower systemic vascular resistance as a primary action [^116HwK6y] [^114NANWE].

> Wait, let me verify the hemodynamic data in heart failure, since improved forward flow could theoretically unload the vasculature. The FDA labeling and contemporary reviews consistently show that digoxin increases cardiac output and lowers pulmonary pressures and filling pressures, with reductions in systemic vascular resistance in patients with heart failure; importantly, these changes are accompanied by improved ejection fraction and do not translate into a clinically meaningful reduction in systemic arterial blood pressure, and in fact some acute data show blood pressure may rise as cardiac output improves [^116HwK6y] [^114NANWE] [^116p8Rko].

> Hold on, I should double-check the acute heart failure with tachyarrhythmia data, because that's where confounders are common. In a prospective study of acute heart failure triggered by rapid atrial fibrillation, digoxin loading significantly reduced heart rate while systolic blood pressure increased at 24–48 hours, indicating that improved stroke volume and vasoconstriction from restored perfusion can raise arterial pressure rather than lower it in that context [^116p8Rko] [^114rsWVX].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to see if any recommend digoxin for hypertension. Contemporary heart failure and atrial fibrillation guidelines list digoxin for symptom control and rate control, respectively, but do not position it as an antihypertensive agent. Hypertension guidelines do not include digoxin among blood pressure–lowering therapies, reinforcing that it lacks a BP-lowering indication or consistent effect in practice [^115HmWDN] [^1173CYQ9] [^115nk6Yc] [^115E7Do6].

> But wait, what if indirect effects could lower blood pressure in some scenarios. Let me consider that digoxin's vagal effects and AV nodal slowing can reduce heart rate; in patients with very high sympathetic tone or fast atrial arrhythmias, slowing the heart rate may modestly improve diastolic filling and stroke volume without directly lowering arterial pressure, and in sedentary patients with AF, digoxin can be used for rate control when beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are limited by hypotension, which underscores that digoxin is less likely to cause hypotension than those alternatives rather than that it actively lowers BP [^1135qgne] [^117VoJwZ] [^115yhDec].

> I need to check special populations and interactions, because hypotension risk is not the same as BP lowering. In pulmonary arterial hypertension and right heart failure, digoxin has limited and mixed evidence and is not recommended to lower blood pressure; in fact, some observational data associate chronic digoxin with worse outcomes, likely reflecting confounding by severity rather than a causal BP-lowering effect, and guideline cautions emphasize potential hemodynamic harm rather than benefit in PAH [^1137RkbM] [^111uS1ZF] [^113KEoq4]. Regarding drug interactions, digoxin can be combined with agents that lower blood pressure, but the hypotension observed in trials is typically attributable to the co-administered vasodilator or negative chronotrope, not to digoxin itself, and digoxin levels may rise with interacting drugs, increasing toxicity risk without conferring antihypertensive benefit [^1137KKFU] [^117BJf8z] [^116FkwXo].

> Let me reconsider the mechanistic angle to ensure I'm not missing a vasodilatory pathway. Digoxin's indirect neurohormonal effects include baroreceptor sensitization and reduced sympathetic and renin-angiotensin activity in heart failure, which could theoretically modulate vascular tone, but clinically these effects manifest as improved cardiac output and symptom relief rather than a consistent reduction in systemic arterial pressure. Moreover, at higher concentrations digoxin can increase sympathetic outflow, which would not be expected to lower blood pressure [^116HwK6y] [^114NANWE].

> I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Digoxin does not meaningfully lower systemic blood pressure in typical clinical use; its principal hemodynamic profile in heart failure is increased cardiac output with reductions in filling pressures and sometimes systemic vascular resistance, while arterial blood pressure remains stable or may increase when cardiac output rises, and in acute tachyarrhythmic heart failure, systolic blood pressure has been shown to increase after digoxin loading, so it should not be used as an antihypertensive agent [^116HwK6y] [^114NANWE] [^116p8Rko].

> Finally, I need to ensure the practical implications are explicit. If a patient on digoxin experiences hypotension, I should look for co-administered vasodilators, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, or underlying hemodynamic instability rather than attributing it to digoxin. Conversely, if blood pressure is elevated, digoxin is not an appropriate therapy for hypertension control, and guideline-directed antihypertensives should be used instead [^115E7Do6] [^115nk6Yc].

---

Digoxin does not directly lower blood pressure; it is not an antihypertensive agent. While digoxin can reduce heart rate and improve cardiac output, its net effect on systemic vascular resistance is **minimal**, so blood pressure typically remains unchanged or may slightly increase [^116HwK6y] [^114NANWE]. Clinically significant hypotension is uncommon with digoxin alone and is more likely when combined with other agents that lower blood pressure or heart rate [^116FkwXo]. Digoxin is used for heart failure and atrial fibrillation rate control, **not for hypertension management** [^115HmWDN] [^115nk6Yc].

---

## Pharmacological mechanism of digoxin

Digoxin inhibits the **Na+/K+-ATPase** pump, increasing intracellular calcium and thereby enhancing myocardial contractility (positive inotropy) [^116HwK6y]. It also increases vagal tone, slowing AV nodal conduction and heart rate (negative chronotropy) [^114NANWE]. These effects improve cardiac output and reduce heart rate, but **do not directly vasodilate or lower systemic vascular resistance** [^notfound].

---

## Hemodynamic effects of digoxin

Digoxin produces characteristic hemodynamic changes, including **increased cardiac output** via positive inotropy, which improves stroke volume and overall cardiac performance [^116HwK6y]. It also causes **reduced heart rate** through vagal effects and AV nodal slowing, particularly useful in atrial fibrillation [^114NANWE]. However, digoxin has minimal effect on systemic vascular resistance, so its impact on blood pressure is limited [^111WmPCn].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding blood pressure effects

Clinical studies show digoxin has **minimal direct effect on blood pressure**:

- **Neutral effect**: Digoxin does not significantly lower blood pressure in most patients; its primary role is to improve cardiac output and control heart rate [^111WmPCn].
- **Slight increase**: In some cases, improved cardiac output may slightly increase systolic blood pressure, particularly in heart failure patients [^116p8Rko].
- **Hypotension risk**: Clinically significant hypotension is rare with digoxin alone and is more likely when combined with other medications that lower blood pressure or heart rate [^116FkwXo].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines do not recommend digoxin for **blood pressure control**. Its indications are limited to heart failure symptom management and atrial fibrillation rate control, not hypertension management [^115HmWDN] [^115nk6Yc].

---

## Situations where digoxin may indirectly affect blood pressure

Digoxin may indirectly influence blood pressure in specific scenarios:

- **Heart failure**: Improved cardiac output can slightly increase systolic blood pressure in some patients [^116p8Rko].
- **Drug interactions**: Combination with beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or diuretics may increase hypotension risk [^notfound].
- **Overdose**: Digoxin toxicity can cause bradycardia and hypotension, requiring immediate medical attention [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and precautions

When prescribing digoxin, clinicians should:

- **Monitor blood pressure**: Regularly assess blood pressure, especially when combined with other cardiovascular medications [^116FkwXo].
- **Adjust therapy**: Modify concomitant medications if hypotension occurs, particularly in patients on multiple agents [^117QxyEN].
- **Educate patients**: Inform patients about potential side effects, including dizziness and hypotension, especially when starting or adjusting therapy [^115yhDec].

---

## Conclusion

Digoxin does not directly lower blood pressure and is not indicated for **hypertension management**. Its primary role is to improve cardiac output and control heart rate in **heart failure** and atrial fibrillation. Clinically significant hypotension is uncommon with **digoxin** alone and is more likely in combination with other blood pressure–lowering medications [^116FkwXo].

### Does acute-phase beta blockade reduce left atrial appendage function in patients with chronic nonvalvular atrial fibrillation? [^113yZEms]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2001). Low credibility.

To investigate whether acute-phase beta-blocker therapy has a harmful effect on left atrial appendage (LAA) function in patients with chronic nonvalvular atrial fibrillation by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), we evaluated 21 patients with normal left ventricular systolic function and a poorly controlled ventricular rate, despite the use of digoxin. Baseline parameters that were obtained included heart rate, blood pressure, LAA emptying velocities, and left atrial spontaneous echo contrast intensity. Then, each patient was given a bolus dose of 5 mg metoprolol. Ten minutes later, a second set of assessments was performed. After the first TEE studies, each patient began treatment with metoprolol (50 mg orally twice daily for 1 week). A second TEE study was performed after 1 week of continuous oral metoprolol therapy at maintenance dose, and values were again determined. The average resting apical heart rate was 91 ± 7 bpm. As expected, beta-blocker therapy showed a marked decrease in heart rate at 10 minutes (79 ± 6 bpm, P < .001) and at 1 week (71 ± 4 bpm, P < .001). Beta-blocker therapy caused a significant reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressures (144 ± 16 / 93 ± 6 mm Hg at baseline, 137 ± 16 / 87 ± 9 mm Hg at 10 minutes, and 135 ± 12 / 86 ± 8 mm Hg at 1 week, P < .001). With the beta-blocker therapy, the baseline transesophageal Doppler parameter of LAA emptying velocities (at baseline 24 ± 7 cm/s) fell significantly at 10 minutes (19 ± 7 cm/s, P < .001) and at 1 week (17 ± 6 cm/s, P < .001) after initiation of beta-blocker therapy. After a bolus of metoprolol, spontaneous echo contrast intensity did not change in any patients, but 1 week later, it increased in 1 patient. In 2 patients who had not been found to have an LAA thrombus at baseline TEE study, the second TEE examination demonstrated new thrombi in the LAA. In conclusion, our findings suggest that in patients with chronic nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who have normal left ventricular systolic function and a poorly controlled ventricular rate despite the use of digoxin, acute-phase beta blockade may have a harmful effect on LAA function.

### Digoxin-mortality: randomized vs. observational comparison in the DIG trial [^114GeuTd]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

In both subpopulations (i) and (ii), pre-treated and not pre-treated patients were identically treated during the trial. Therefore, observed differences between patients previously treated and those newly treated with digoxin or placebo cannot be due to digoxin unless a potential withdrawal or add-on effect is present. These comparisons are 'observational' in that they are not based on the randomization in the trial.

We expected that — if the observational comparison was valid — the effect of digoxin should be the same irrespective of whether estimated from the randomized or the observational comparison after adjustment for population differences. The effect of digoxin is estimated with Cox proportional hazards regression in both approaches. In the observational approach (previous digoxin use vs. no previous digoxin use), the respective models are further adjusted for prognostic differences between patients pre-treated with digoxin and those not pre-treated. The following variables are included in the adjusted observational model (a P -value < 0.2 in baseline comparisons was used as a criterion for inclusion into the model, see Supplementary Appendix for the respective P -values): age (years), sex, race, systolic blood pressure (mmHg), diastolic blood pressure (mmHg), body mass index (kg/m 2), potassium serum level (mmol/L), ischaemic primary cause of congestive heart failure, duration of congestive heart failure (months), ejection fraction (%), chest X-ray (cardiothoracic ratio) ≤ 0.55, New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification III or IV, current angina, rales, elevated jugular venous pressure, peripheral oedema, dyspnoea at rest, dyspnoea at exertion, limitation of activity, S3, pulmonary congestion, previous myocardial infarction, history of hypertension, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use, hydralazine use, diuretics use, recommended digoxin dose (mg/day), and prescribed dose of study medication (mg/day). The model also includes the randomized treatment, as it may in principle alter prognosis. All analyses are performed using the SAS 9.3. Forest plots are created with R 3.3.1using the forestplot package.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Concomitant use of BREVIBLOC injection with other drugs that can lower blood pressure, reduce myocardial contractility, or interfere with sinus node function or electrical impulse propagation in the myocardium can exaggerate BREVIBLOC injection's effects on blood pressure, contractility, and impulse propagation. Severe interactions with such drugs can result in, for example, severe hypotension, cardiac failure, severe bradycardia, sinus pause, sinoatrial block, atrioventricular block, and/or cardiac arrest. In addition, with some drugs, beta blockade may precipitate increased withdrawal effects. (See clonidine, guanfacine, and moxonidine below.) BREVIBLOC injection should therefore be used only after careful individual assessment of the risks and expected benefits in patients receiving drugs that can cause these types of pharmacodynamic interactions, including but not limited to:

Digitalis glycosides: Concomitant administration of digoxin and BREVIBLOC injection leads to an approximate 10% to 20% increase of digoxin blood levels at some time points. Digoxin does not affect BREVIBLOC injection pharmacokinetics. Both digoxin and beta blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use increases the risk of bradycardia.
Anticholinesterases: BREVIBLOC injection prolonged the duration of succinylcholine-induced neuromuscular blockade and moderately prolonged clinical duration and recovery index of mivacurium.
Antihypertensive agents clonidine, guanfacine, or moxonidine: Beta blockers also increase the risk of clonidine-, guanfacine-, or moxonidine-withdrawal rebound hypertension. If, during concomitant use of a beta blocker, antihypertensive therapy needs to be interrupted or discontinued, discontinue the beta blocker first, and the discontinuation should be gradual.
Calcium channel antagonists: In patients with depressed myocardial function, use of BREVIBLOC injection with cardiodepressant calcium channel antagonists (e.g., verapamil) can lead to fatal cardiac arrests.
Sympathomimetic drugs: Sympathomimetic drugs having beta-adrenergic agonist activity will counteract effects of BREVIBLOC injection.
Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic agents: Because of the risk of reducing cardiac contractility in presence of high systemic vascular resistance, do not use BREVIBLOC injection to control tachycardia in patients receiving drugs that are vasoconstrictive and have positive inotropic effects, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine.

### Epoprostenol [^1137KKFU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Additional reductions in blood pressure may occur when epoprostenol for injection is administered with diuretics, antihypertensive agents, or other vasodilators. When other antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants are used concomitantly, there is the potential for epoprostenol for injection to increase the risk of bleeding. However, patients receiving infusions of epoprostenol in clinical trials were maintained on anticoagulants without evidence of increased bleeding. In clinical trials, epoprostenol was used with digoxin, diuretics, anticoagulants, oral vasodilators, and supplemental oxygen.

In a pharmacokinetic substudy in patients with congestive heart failure receiving furosemide or digoxin in whom therapy with epoprostenol was initiated, apparent oral clearance values for furosemide (n = 23) and digoxin (n = 30) were decreased by 13% and 15%, respectively, on the second day of therapy and had returned to baseline values by day 87. The change in furosemide clearance value is not likely to be clinically significant. However, patients on digoxin may show elevations of digoxin concentrations after initiation of therapy with epoprostenol, which may be clinically significant in patients prone to digoxin toxicity.

· Diuretics, antihypertensive agents, or other vasodilators: reduction in blood pressure (7)

· Antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants: increase the risk of bleeding (7)

· Patients on digoxin: elevations of digoxin concentrations clinically significant in patients prone to digoxin toxicity (7)

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to rate control, long-term control, digoxin, CCS/CHRS 2020 guidelines recommend to consider initiating digoxin monotherapy in older or sedentary patients with permanent AF, in patients with side effects or contraindications to first-line agents, or in addition to first-line agents in patients not achieving satisfactory symptom or HR control.

### Digoxin (digox) [^114qLPV4]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

Mechanism of Action

Digoxin inhibits sodium-potassium ATPase, an enzyme that regulates the quantity of sodium and potassium inside cells. Inhibition of the enzyme leads to an increase in the intracellular concentration of sodium and thus (by stimulation of sodium-calcium exchange) an increase in the intracellular concentration of calcium. The beneficial effects of digoxin result from direct actions on cardiac muscle, as well as indirect actions on the cardiovascular system mediated by effects on the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic effects include: (1) a vagomimetic action, which is responsible for the effects of digoxin on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular (AV) nodes; and (2) baroreceptor sensitization, which results in increased afferent inhibitory activity and reduced activity of the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin system for any given increment in mean arterial pressure. The pharmacologic consequences of these direct and indirect effects are: (1) an increase in the force and velocity of myocardial systolic contraction (positive inotropic action); (2) a decrease in the degree of activation of the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin system (neurohormonal deactivating effect); and (3) slowing of the heart rate and decreased conduction velocity through the AV node (vagomimetic effect). The effects of digoxin in heart failure are mediated by its positive inotropic and neurohormonal deactivating effects, whereas the effects of the drug in atrial arrhythmias are related to its vagomimetic actions. In high doses, digoxin increases sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system (CNS). This increase in sympathetic activity may be an important factor in digitalis toxicity.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 atrial fibrillation — pharmacological rate control (Class I): Measurement of the heart rate at rest and control of the rate with pharmacological agents are recommended for persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) (Level of Evidence: B). In the absence of preexcitation, intravenous beta blockers (esmolol, metoprolol, or propranolol) or nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists (verapamil, diltiazem) are recommended to slow the ventricular response to AF in the acute setting, with caution in hypotension or heart failure (HF) (Level of Evidence: B). Intravenous digoxin or amiodarone is recommended to control heart rate in patients with AF and HF without an accessory pathway (Level of Evidence: B). For patients with activity-related AF symptoms, adequacy of rate control should be assessed during exercise and pharmacological treatment adjusted to keep the rate in the physiologic range (Level of Evidence: C). Oral digoxin is effective to control resting heart rate in AF and is indicated for HF, left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, or sedentary individuals (Level of Evidence: C).

### Heart failure [^1111GovK]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure occurs in 3% to 4% of adults aged over 65 years, usually as a consequence of coronary artery disease or hypertension, and causes breathlessness, effort intolerance, fluid retention, and increased mortality. The 5-year mortality in people with systolic heart failure ranges from 25% to 75%, often owing to sudden death following ventricular arrhythmia. Risks of cardiovascular events are increased in people with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) or heart failure.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of non-drug treatments, and of drug and invasive treatments, for heart failure? What are the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in people at high risk of heart failure? What are the effects of treatments for diastolic heart failure? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 85 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: aldosterone receptor antagonists; amiodarone; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; angiotensin II receptor blockers; anticoagulation; antiplatelet agents; beta-blockers; calcium channel blockers; cardiac resynchronisation therapy; digoxin (in people already receiving diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors); exercise; hydralazine plus isosorbide dinitrate; implantable cardiac defibrillators; multidisciplinary interventions; non-amiodarone antiarrhythmic drugs; and positive inotropes (other than digoxin).

### Atrial fibrillation in heart failure: what should we do? [^112pv5Cs]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

β-Blockers

As previously discussed, β-blockers in HFrEF patients with AF do not appear to improve mortality or reduce hospital admissions. However, their use is widespread for control of heart rate in AF, both acutely and for long-term management. In the acute setting of HF with rapid AF, β-blockers are useful for rate-reduction and preferred to digoxin due to their effectiveness at high sympathetic tone. As β-blockers can initially be negatively inotropic, initiation of β-blockers requires a measured approach using incremental dosage to achieve a heart rate that balances the need for rate control with other haemodynamic parameters. For long-term control of heart rate, β-blockers are traditionally the first-line choice for clinicians.

Digoxin

Cardiac glycosides, such as digoxin and digitoxin, have seen recent declines in use after the publication of the DIG trial which showed no mortality benefit from digoxin in HF patients with sinus rhythm. Importantly, patients randomized to digoxin suffered less hospitalizations. In observational studies and post hoc analysis of RCTs, there have been concerns about increased mortality with digoxin, but equally a number of studies have found no association. – As clearly demonstrated in a systematic review of all digoxin vs. control studies, the main problem with non-randomized assessment is that clinicians are more likely to prescribe digoxin to the sickest patients with HF and/or AF, which results in bias that cannot be adjusted for, even with complex statistical modelling. Unfortunately, there are currently no direct RCT comparisons of digoxin use in patients with AF. Until further evidence becomes available, digoxin should be used cautiously in appropriate patients, with no expectation of any effect on mortality. In a crossover mechanistic RCT of 47 patients with HFrEF and AF, there were no differences in heart rate, blood pressure, walk distance, or LVEF comparing carvedilol and digoxin, although β-blockers did result in higher BNP levels (183 pg/mL with carvedilol vs. 79.5 with digoxin; P = 0.03). There was a small and marginally significant improvement in LVEF with combination β-blocker/digoxin compared with placebo/digoxin after 4 months of treatment (30.6 ± 9.6% vs. 26.0 ± 12.4%; P = 0.048).

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^117QxyEN]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation with heart failure — rate control pharmacotherapy: In RATE-AF, 160 patients (≥ 60 years) with persistent AF and HF (81% with LVEF ≥ 50%) were randomized to digoxin or bisoprolol; there was no significant difference in the primary QOL endpoint at 6 months, secondary outcomes (including natriuretic peptides) were lower with digoxin, resting heart rate did not differ at 12 months, and adverse effects were less common with digoxin. Post hoc analyses in HF on chronic digoxin associated serum digoxin levels ≥ 1 ng/mL with increased mortality and hospitalization, whereas levels < 0.8 ng/mL were associated with the lowest mortality rate. In DAAF, among 239 patients (12% with HF), intravenous digoxin significantly decreased heart rate at 2 hours versus placebo. In critically ill patients, a randomized trial of 60 patients (13 with HF) showed significant rate control with both intravenous diltiazem and amiodarone, with a higher frequency of hypotension requiring discontinuation with diltiazem; a retrospective intensive care unit series of 38 patients (9 with HF) found intravenous amiodarone lowered ventricular rate without BP decrease compared with intravenous diltiazem and digoxin. The text cautions that intravenous beta blockers may cause hypotension in hemodynamic instability, that intravenous amiodarone can also be associated with hypotension (especially with bolus), and that the possibility of conversion to sinus rhythm and thromboembolism should factor into risk–benefit decisions when choosing intravenous amiodarone for rate control.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^115E7Do6]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Hypertension, atrial fibrillation (AF), and other arrhythmias — key associations and treatment considerations are stated as follows: "Hypertension predisposes to cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular arrhythmias, but most commonly AF", and "High–normal BP is associated with incident AF, and hypertension is the most prevalent concomitant condition in AF patients". "AF adds to the risk of stroke and heart failure. AF necessitates stroke prevention with oral anticoagulation, with monitoring of the associated risks and prevention of bleeding". For rate control in AF with hypertension, "beta-blockers or non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists (e.g. diltiazem and verapamil) are recommended as antihypertensive agents", but "Non-dihydropyridine CCBs should be avoided in patients with reduced LV systolic function and may precipitate heart failure in some patients". "Beta-blockers are often indicated to reduce ventricular rate and may need to be combined with digoxin to obtain rate control". Regarding prevention of AF, "RAS blockers have been shown to reduce first occurrence of AF, compared with beta-blockers or CCBs", whereas "Beta-blockers do not prevent recurrence of paroxysmal or persistent AF", and "In patients with heart failure, beta-blockers and MRAs may also prevent AF".

### Digoxin (Lanoxin) [^112djH4e]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The dosage of digoxin IV for treatment of heart failure in adults (mild-to-moderate) is:

- Loading: 4–6 mcg/kg IV once followed by 2 doses of 2–3 mcg/kg every 6–8 hours
- Maintenance: 2.4–3.6 mcg/kg IV q24h

### Digoxin: the good and the bad [^113uzoLC]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

After 230 years of use, digitalis remains an important and useful therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and the 30–50% of patients with both conditions. Although the combination of positive inotropic activity with negative chronotropic effects has been shown to reduce hospital admissions in heart failure, there is a distinct lack of robust trial data, particularly in patients with atrial fibrillation. We recently performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of all digoxin studies and demonstrated a neutral effect on mortality. This contradicts prior observational data that overlook the fact that digitalis is usually given as second-line therapy to the sickest patients. Use of these agents in clinical practice should take account of appropriate dose, serum concentration, drug interactions, and potential side effects. The aim of this review is to evaluate the evidence base for cardiac glycosides and provide a pragmatic guide to their advantages and disadvantages.

RESULTS

Effects ofInhibition on‐Induced Hypertension and Sympathetic Activation

Compared with control rats, which showed no change in mean BP (MBP) from baseline, rats treated with ANG II exhibited a gradual increase in MBP, rising from a baseline of 113 ± 2 mm Hg to a peak of 164 ± 4 mm Hg by the end of week 2 (Figure 1A). Daily treatment with digoxin did not affect the increase in MBP during the first week of ANG II infusion, but it significantly prevented the rise of MBP during the second week compared with vehicle‐treated ANG II‐infused rats. There were no significant differences in heart rate among the groups (Figure 1B). Intraperitoneal injection of hexamethonium caused a significant reduction in MBP in all 3 groups (Figure 1C), but the decrease in MBP was significantly greater in ANG II‐infused rats compared with control rats.

### Digoxin therapy for heart failure: an update [^113E8c2J]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Digoxin therapy has long been used to treat heart failure; however, its effectiveness was not completely known until recently. Results of the Digitalis Investigation Group trial showed that adding digoxin to standard heart failure therapy had no effect on mortality. However, adding digoxin decreased hospitalizations related to heart failure and improved symptoms in patients treated for heart failure. Reanalyses of the trial's findings have raised new questions about the role of digoxin in heart failure treatment. These new analyses showed that low serum digoxin concentrations used in patients with more severe disease offered the most benefit. Digoxin use in women was associated with increased mortality risk. This finding should be interpreted with caution, however, because it was based on retrospective data, and the cause of this phenomenon has not been fully elucidated. Prospective clinical trials are needed to determine the serum digoxin concentration that is associated with the most clinical benefit and to determine the role of digoxin therapy for women. Digoxin generally does not have a role in the treatment of diastolic heart failure and is not a first-line therapy for managing atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure.

### Effect of chronic digoxin use on mortality and heart failure hospitalization in pulmonary arterial hypertension [^113KEoq4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

In the DIG (Digitalis Investigational Group) trial, chronic digoxin use decreases the risk of HF hospitalization in patients with reduced LV ejection fraction and sinus rhythm. Unlike the findings in this trial, there are no clinical data supporting the chronic use of digoxin in patients with PAH with or without concomitant right HF. The use of digoxin in PAH remains mainly at the discretion of medical providers and is largely based on limited preclinical and acute clinical hemodynamic studies. In 1954, Davis et al showed in a canine model of isolated RV failure induced by pulmonary artery banding that digoxin increased RV systolic pressure and CO, whilst decreasing right atrial pressure and total peripheral resistance. Subsequently, in 1998, Rich et al demonstrated in 17 patients with PAH and right HF that intravenous digoxin acutely elevates CO and reduces circulating norepinephrine.

In this analysis, chronic digoxin therapy was not associated with a reduction in all‐cause mortality or HF hospitalization in patients with PAH with RV failure. Paradoxically, digoxin use was associated with higher rates of mortality and HF hospitalization. There are several possible explanations for our observation. First, despite our attempts to control for confounding by propensity‐score matching, there is likely residual confounding whereby chronic digoxin therapy was more frequently prescribed in patients with more advanced PAH and right HF, a group destined for adverse outcomes. Thus, chronic digoxin use may just be a marker of severe PAH and right HF. However, this study raises the possibility that digoxin worsens mortality and morbidity in patients with PAH. Perhaps the use of digoxin heightens the risk of ventricular and atrial arrhythmias, which are known complications of digoxin. While the DIG trial shows there is a reduction in death because of HF with chronic digoxin use, there was a reciprocal heightened risk of mortality attributable to arrhythmias. In addition, myocardial ischemia increases the risk of fatal ventricular arrhythmias with digoxin therapy, which may be problematic for patients with PAH as they are at risk for RV ischemia because of loss of right coronary artery perfusion during systole and capillary rarefaction. Hence, chronic digoxin use may increase the risk of mortality attributable to arrhythmias in patients with PAH.

### Dose-dependent hemodynamic effect of digoxin therapy in severe verapamil toxicity [^114k4grJ]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Calcium chloride (CaCl(2)) alone is an ineffective antidote in severe calcium channel antagonist overdoses. Digoxin has been evaluated as a therapy to increase the effectiveness of calcium in severe calcium channel antagonist overdoses.

Objective

To determine if there is a dose-dependent hemodynamic effect of digoxin in the setting of severe verapamil toxicity treated with high-dose CaCl(2).

Methods

Eight dogs were instrumented to measure systolic and diastolic blood pressure, cardiac output, pulmonary artery pressures, and left ventricular pressures. Verapamil toxicity (50% decrease in mean arterial pressure) was induced with verapamil 6 mg/kg/hr and maintained for 30 minutes by titrating the verapamil rate. Following verapamil toxicity, each dog received one dose of digoxin equivalent to 0, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 times the loading dose of digoxin (0.009 mg/kg). The verapamil rate was changed to 4 mg/kg/hr and continued for the next five hours. CaCl(2) boluses were given (0.5 g immediately following verapamil toxicity and 1 g at one, two, and three hours). Measurements were compared with the loading dose of digoxin using linear regression analysis.

Results

Digoxin resulted in a dose-dependent increase in systolic blood pressure at 4 hours (10.23 mm Hg/loading dose of digoxin, 95% CI = 2.74 to 17.73), 4 hours, 15 minutes (13.9 mm Hg/loading dose of digoxin, 95% CI = 8.75 to 19.01), and 5 hours (17.04 mm Hg/loading dose of digoxin, 95% CI = 1.76 to 32.32). Digoxin resulted in a dose-dependent increase in maximal ventricular pressure at the end of hour 3 (8.55 mm Hg/loading dose of digoxin, 95% CI = 3.41 to 13.69), 3 hours, 15 minutes (11.81 mm Hg/loading dose of digoxin, 95% CI = 4.89 to 18.73), hour 4 (8.26 mm Hg/loading dose of digoxin, 95% CI = 1.03 to 15.48), and 4 hours, 15 minutes (9.74 mm Hg/loading dose of digoxin, 95% CI = 4.47 to 15.00). The authors were unable to detect a dose-dependent increase in other parameters, including diastolic relaxation (diastolic change in pressure over time) and time to onset of death. No ventricular arrhythmias developed in any dogs.

Conclusions

There is a dose-dependent effect of digoxin on systolic blood pressure and maximal ventricular pressure in the setting of severe verapamil toxicity treated with high-dose CaCl(2).

### Drugs that may cause or exacerbate heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^114H3JSp]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Complementary and alternative medications (CAMs)/nutraceuticals in HF — prevalence and guideline directives: "In a 2007 national survey, it was observed that 38% of adults in the United States use CAMs", and "1 in 4 individuals > 85 years of age reported the use of at least 1 CAM therapy". The 2010 HF practice guidelines state that "documentation of the type and dose of nutraceutical products used by patients with HF is recommended", and further specify: "No nutraceutical should be used for the management of HF symptoms or the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events"; "Ephedra-like products (ma-huang) should be avoided because of their stimulant effects on blood pressure and heart rate and their increased risk of mortality and morbidity"; and "Products with significant interactions with digoxin, vasodilators, β-blockers, antiarrhythmic agents, and anticoagulants should be avoided". Additionally, "The American College of Cardiology Foundation/ American Heart Association HF guidelines recommend that nutritional supplements not be used for the treatment of HF", and "There is evidence that supplementation with vitamin E ≥ 400 IU/d may increase the risk of developing new-onset HF; it seems prudent to avoid it in individuals with established HF".

### Supine parasympathetic withdrawal and upright sympathetic activation underly abnormalities of the baroreflex in postural tachycardia syndrome: effects of pyridostigmine and digoxin [^113pLinZ]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

See Editorial, pp

Standing upright (orthostasis) produces central hypovolemia by translocating blood to the dependent body. Orthostatic intolerance is defined by signs and symptoms, such as lightheadedness, exercise intolerance, tachycardia, hypotension, hypertension, headache, fatigue, cognitive deficits, and nausea, while upright relieved by recumbence.

Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is defined in adults by orthostatic intolerance symptoms plus an excessive increase in heart rate exceeding 30 beats/min within 10 minutes of standing or upright tilt. Systolic arterial pressure (SAP) is maintained and may increase. Larger heart rate increments by 40 beats/min or more are required to diagnose POTS in younger patients < 19 years old. – More than 85% are women aged 14 to 50 years.

POTS resembles hypovolemia with reduced systemic venous return and reduced cardiac output (CO). In some instances, absolute hypovolemia is found; in others, a redistributive central hypovolemia occurs when upright. The latter is designated neuropathic POTS and results from decreased adrenergic vasoconstriction in the legs, or splanchnic vasculature, causing baroreflex unloading, decreased reflex cardiovagal stimulation, increased reflex sympathetic excitation, and reflex tachycardia. An alternative form of POTS in which sympathetic adrenergic function is primarily increased is denoted hyperadrenergic POTS.

In both cases, baroreflex regulation is affected. Changes in blood pressure (BP) during orthostasis are primarily buffered by arterial baroreflexes, which are negative feedback inhibitory stretch reflexes. An increase in arterial pressure causes decreased heart rate mediated primarily by parasympathetic (cardiovagal) efferent activity, decreased peripheral vasoconstriction mediated primarily by reduced vascular synaptic sympathetic activity, and suppression of adrenal medullary epinephrine secretion POTS patients have normal muscle sympathetic nerve activity while supine, but increased muscle sympathetic nerve activity when upright compared with healthy controlssuggesting a reflex response with intact arterial baroreflexes afferents.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Heart failure with normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) — principles of treatment: In the absence of other controlled clinical trials, management is based on control of physiological factors (blood pressure, heart rate, blood volume, and myocardial ischemia) that affect ventricular relaxation. Physicians should make every effort to control both systolic and diastolic hypertension with effective antihypertensive therapy, with consideration at least to achieving blood pressure targets lower than those for uncomplicated hypertension, e.g., less than 130 mm Hg systolic and less than 80 mm Hg diastolic. Because myocardial ischemia can impair ventricular relaxation, coronary revascularization should be considered when ischemia is exerting a deleterious effect on cardiac function. Because tachycardia shortens filling and perfusion time, drugs that slow the heart rate or the ventricular response to atrial arrhythmias (beta-blockers, digoxin, and some calcium channel blockers) can provide symptomatic relief in HF with normal LVEF. Circulating blood volume is a major determinant of ventricular filling pressure, and the use of diuretics may improve breathlessness in HF with normal or reduced LVEF; other possible agents to reduce diastolic filling pressures are nitrates or agents that block neurohumoral activation, but hypotension may be a significant problem in this population, especially in the very elderly. Recommendations regarding anticoagulation and antiarrhythmic agents apply to all patients with HF, irrespective of LVEF.

### Esmolol hydrochloride [^1144Cm77]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Concomitant use of esmolol hydrochloride with other drugs that can lower blood pressure, reduce myocardial contractility, or interfere with sinus node function or electrical impulse propagation in the myocardium can exaggerate esmolol hydrochloride's effects on blood pressure, contractility, and impulse propagation. Severe interactions with such drugs can result in, for example, severe hypotension, cardiac failure, severe bradycardia, sinus pause, sinoatrial block, atrioventricular block, and/or cardiac arrest. In addition, with some drugs, beta blockade may precipitate increased withdrawal effects. (See clonidine, guanfacine, and moxonidine below.) Esmolol hydrochloride should therefore be used only after careful individual assessment of the risks and expected benefits in patients receiving drugs that can cause these types of pharmacodynamic interactions, including but not limited to:

Digitalis glycosides: Concomitant administration of digoxin and esmolol hydrochloride leads to an approximate 10% to 20% increase of digoxin blood levels at some time points. Digoxin does not affect esmolol hydrochloride pharmacokinetics. Both digoxin and beta blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use increases the risk of bradycardia.
Anticholinesterases: Esmolol hydrochloride prolonged the duration of succinylcholine-induced neuromuscular blockade and moderately prolonged clinical duration and recovery index of mivacurium.
Antihypertensive agents clonidine, guanfacine, or moxonidine: Beta blockers also increase the risk of clonidine-, guanfacine-, or moxonidine-withdrawal rebound hypertension. If, during concomitant use of a beta blocker, antihypertensive therapy needs to be interrupted or discontinued, discontinue the beta blocker first, and the discontinuation should be gradual.
Calcium channel antagonists: In patients with depressed myocardial function, use of esmolol hydrochloride with cardiodepressant calcium channel antagonists (e.g., verapamil) can lead to fatal cardiac arrests.
Sympathomimetic drugs: Sympathomimetic drugs having beta-adrenergic agonist activity will counteract effects of esmolol hydrochloride.
Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic agents: Because of the risk of reducing cardiac contractility in presence of high systemic vascular resistance, do not use esmolol hydrochloride to control tachycardia in patients receiving drugs that are vasoconstrictive and have positive inotropic effects, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine.

Digitalis glycosides: Risk of bradycardia (7)
Anticholinesterases: Prolongs neuromuscular blockade (7)
Antihypertensive agents: Risk of rebound hypertension (7)
Sympathomimetic drugs: Dose adjustment needed (7)
Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic effect substances: Avoid concomitant use (7)

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Digoxin use in heart failure — patient selection and rate control indicates that physicians may consider adding digoxin in patients with persistent symptoms of HF during therapy with diuretics, an ACEI or ARB, and a beta-blocker, and digoxin may also be added to the initial regimen in patients with severe symptoms who have not yet responded symptomatically during treatment with diuretics, an ACEI, and beta-blockers. Alternatively, treatment with digoxin may be delayed until the patient's response to ACEIs and beta-blockers has been defined and be used only in patients who remain symptomatic despite therapy with the neurohormonal antagonists, and yet another strategy is to initiate aldosterone antagonists and delay the addition of digoxin except in patients who do not respond or who cannot tolerate aldosterone antagonists. If a patient is taking digoxin but not an ACEI or a beta-blocker, treatment with digoxin should not be withdrawn, but appropriate therapy with the neurohormonal antagonists should be instituted. For rate control, digoxin is prescribed routinely in patients with HF and chronic atrial fibrillation, but beta-blockers are usually more effective when added to digoxin in controlling the ventricular response, particularly during exercise, and because beta blockers improve survival and may be effective in controlling rate alone, digoxin should be considered as an adjunctive agent for rate control.

### Digoxin and clinical outcomes in systolic heart failure patients on contemporary background heart failure therapy [^112FiZ4E]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Previous trials have shown that digoxin was beneficial in patients with heart failure (HF). However, these studies were conducted before the incorporation of beta blockers as standard therapy for patients with HF. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of digoxin in patients with HF on a contemporary regimen of renin-angiotensin inhibition and beta blockade. In 347 almost exclusively men, data pertaining to the index hospitalization and occurrence of all-cause mortality or readmission for HF were collected. Cox proportional hazard modeling was used. Patients on digoxin therapy had a lower left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF), higher prevalence of previous hospitalizations for HF and atrial fibrillation, and lower prevalence of hypertension. After adjustment for age, LVEF, history of HF hospitalizations, New York Heart Association class, presence of chronic renal insufficiency, presence of atrial fibrillation, and prescriptions for beta blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, HF hospitalizations (hazard ratio 1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77 to 1.50, p = 0.66), total mortality (hazard ratio 1.03, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.35, p = 0.85), or the combined end point of HF hospitalization and total mortality (hazard ratio 1.11, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.53, p = 0.52) were not different in patients using digoxin compared with those not using digoxin. Clinical outcomes were not different in subgroups of patients with EF ≤ 25%, New York Heart Association class III or IV, atrial fibrillation, heart rate ≤ 60 beats/min, or patients on beta-blocker therapy. In conclusion, digoxin use was not associated with a decrease in HF hospitalizations or overall mortality rates in a cohort of hospitalized patients with HF with LV systolic dysfunction on contemporary background HF treatment including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers.

### Digoxin [^113unv1r]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

After 200 years of use, digitalis still appears to have a place in our armamentarium for heart failure and atrial fibrillation despite the proven survival benefits with ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers. Digoxin therapy is inexpensive and well tolerated and may result in considerable savings. Digoxin is the only oral inotrope that does not increase mortality in heart failure patients, particularly if low doses are being used. Digoxin therapy should be used in patients with systolic heart failure who continue to have signs and symptoms despite therapeutic doses of ACE inhibitors or diuretics or in patients with atrial fibrillation with or without heart failure for rate control.

### Review of cardiovascular drugs in pregnancy [^1169QB9X]. Journal of Women's Health (2019). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is now the leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths in the United States. Increasing maternal mortality in the United States underscores the importance of proper cardiovascular management. Significant physiological changes during pregnancy affect the heart's ability to respond to pathological processes such as hypertension and heart failure. These physiological changes further affect the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of cardiac medications. During pregnancy, these changes can significantly alter medication efficacy and metabolism. This article systematically reviews the literature on safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of cardiovascular drugs used for hypertension and heart failure during pregnancy and lactation. The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association hypertension guidelines recommend transitioning pregnant patients to methyldopa, nifedipine, or labetalol. Heart failure medications, including beta-blockers, furosemide, and digoxin, are relatively safe and can be used effectively. Medications that block the renin angiotensin-aldosterone system have been shown to be beneficial in the general population; however, they are teratogenic and, therefore, contraindicated in pregnancy. Cardiovascular medications can also enter breast milk and, therefore, care must be taken when selecting drugs during the lactation period. A summary of the safety of drugs during pregnancy and lactation from an online resource, LactMed by the National Library of Medicine's TOXNET database, is included. High-risk pregnant patients with cardiovascular disease require a multispecialty team of doctors, including health care providers from obstetrics and gynecology, maternal fetal medicine, internal medicine, cardiovascular disease specialists, and specialized pharmacology expertise.

Recommendations for use of cardiac glycosides in clinical practice

Cardiac glycosides should only be used with proper clinical indications according to best evidence recommended by current guidelines (ESC) as well as very recently reviewed for the increasing number of patients suffering from HF and/or AF: –

Cardiac glycosides still may be considered in symptomatic HF patients (NYHA II–IV) in sinus rhythm despite treatment with ACE inhibitor (or angiotensin receptor blocker), beta-blocker, and a mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonist to reduce risk of hospitalization (ESC HF guidelines, class IIb recommendation). Cardiac glycosides are recommended (with/without beta-blocker) for rate control of AF in HF patients with an ejection fraction ≤ 40% (ESC AF guidelines, class I recommendation). For patient safety, target serum concentrations should be 0.5–0.9 ng/mL for digoxin and 8–18 ng/mL for digitoxin, which is in the lower part of the so called 'therapeutic' range (Figure 3). Furthermore, target serum concentrations should be controlled, especially for digoxin in chronic kidney disease due to its predominant renal excretion, whereas excretion of digitoxin is still sufficient even in advanced chronic kidney disease due to its pronounced entero-hepatic recycling.

Figure 3
Recommendations for the use of cardiac glycosides in clinical practice for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and/or atrial fibrillation (AF). Therapy with cardiac glycosides should be preferred in certain populations and target serum concentrations for digoxin and digitoxin should be in the lower part of the so called 'therapeutic' range as described. *Lower daily doses of digitoxin are recommended by the authors to achieve target serum concentrations of 8–18 ng/mL digitoxin. This differs from the recommended daily dose of 0.05–0.3 mg digitoxin for rate control in ESC guidelines for management of AF, which do not recommend certain target serum concentrations for digitoxin.

### Digoxin antibody prevents cerebral hemorrhage-induced hypertension [^1146FT9b]. American Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Brain injury may induce hypertension. Because serum ouabain-like compound (OLC) has vasoconstrictor activity, digoxin antibody antihypertensive effects were evaluated using an intracerebroventricular (ICV) hemorrhage rat model.

Methods

Four ICV infused Wistar rat groups were studied: control; blood; blood plus digoxin antibody, and cerebrospinal fluid-like solution. Tail-cuff blood pressure, cumulative sodium balance, and serum OLC were measured.

Results

The ICV blood infusion increased blood pressure (BP) and OLC without sodium balance change. Digoxin antibody prevented BP and OLC rise. Blood pressure was positively correlated with OLC in blood and blood plus digoxin antibody rats (R = 0.63; P < .05).

Conclusions

Cerebral hemorrhage increased OLC and BP, which were reversed by digoxin antibody administration.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Supraventricular Tachycardia

In two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled comparisons of esmolol hydrochloride with placebo and propranolol, maintenance doses of 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride were found to be more effective than placebo and about as effective as propranolol, 3 to 6 mg given by bolus injections, in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia, principally atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. The majority of these patients developed their arrhythmias postoperatively. About 60 to 70% of the patients treated with esmolol hydrochloride developed either a 20% reduction in heart rate, a decrease in heart rate to less than 100 bpm, or, rarely, conversion to normal sinus rhythm and about 95% of these patients did so at a dosage of 200 mcg/kg/min or less. The average effective dosage of esmolol hydrochloride was approximately 100 mcg/kg/min in the two studies. Other multicenter baseline-controlled studies gave similar results. In the comparison with propranolol, about 50% of patients in both the esmolol hydrochloride and propranolol groups were on concomitant digoxin. Response rates were slightly higher with both beta blockers in the digoxin-treated patients.

In all studies significant decreases of blood pressure occurred in 20 to 50% of patients, identified either as adverse reaction reports by investigators, or by observation of systolic pressure less than 90 mmHg or diastolic pressure less than 50 mmHg. The hypotension was symptomatic (mainly hyperhidrosis or dizziness) in about 12% of patients, and therapy was discontinued in about 11% of patients, about half of whom were symptomatic. Hypotension was more common with esmolol hydrochloride (53%) than with propranolol (17%). The hypotension was rapidly reversible with decreased infusion rate or after discontinuation of therapy with esmolol hydrochloride. For both esmolol hydrochloride and propranolol, hypotension was reported less frequently in patients receiving concomitant digoxin.

### Efficacy and safety of digoxin in acute heart failure triggered by tachyarrhythmia [^116p8Rko]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The primary efficacy outcome was heart rate reduction at 24 h and 48 h after 0.75 mg or more of digoxin was given. The primary safety outcomes were AEs possibly related to digoxin, transfer to the ICU, and those observed compared to predicted 30‐day mortality. MEESSI score was calculated to compare observed and predicted mortality. Secondary endpoints included change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at 24 h and 48 h.

Among 210 patients recruited between January 2012 and December 2018, the mean age was 79 years, 61% were women, and most had mild‐to‐moderate renal dysfunction (Table S1). Twenty‐three percent of patients had received intravenous beta blockers in the ED prior to receiving digoxin. No patient received additional intravenous beta blocker within 48 h of digoxin (Table S2). One hundred and fifty‐seven patients (75%) remained in atrial fibrillation 48 h after receiving at least 0.75 mg of digoxin. Ninety‐one patients (43%) were discharged with the maintenance dose of digoxin. One hundred and twenty‐two patients (58%) received at least 0.75 mg digoxin within 24 h of admission, while 26% received it within 48 h and the rest of the patients received it after 48 h of admission. Among these patients, heart rate was significantly reduced from 141 ± 22 beats per minute (bpm) at presentation to 101 ± 23 bpm at 24 h and 98 ± 22 bpm at 48h (both p < 0.001). Systolic blood pressure increased significantly after 24 h and 48 h (p < 0.001) with a consistent response irrespective of sex or renal function (Fig. 1, Tables S3 and S4). One patient (0.5%) experienced relevant nausea possibly related to digoxin (Table S5). Predicted and observed 30‐day mortality (10.9% [95% confidence Interval (CI): 9.4–12.5] and 9.0% [95% CI 5.9–13.7], respectively) were comparable.

### Diltiazem hydrochloride (DILTIAZEM HYDROCHLORIDE in SODIUM CHLORIDE) [^115jPeiT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

In domestic controlled trials in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, bolus administration of diltiazem hydrochloride injection was effective in reducing heart rate by at least 20% in 95% of patients. Diltiazem hydrochloride injection rarely converts atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter to normal sinus rhythm. Following administration of one or two intravenous bolus doses of diltiazem injection, response usually occurs within 3 minutes and maximal heart rate reduction generally occurs in 2 to 7 minutes. Heart rate reduction may last from 1 to 3 hours. If hypotension occurs, it is generally short-lived, but may last from 1 to 3 hours.

A 24-hour continuous infusion of diltiazem injection in the treatment of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter maintained at least a 20% heart rate reduction during the infusion in 83% of patients. Upon discontinuation of infusion, heart rate reduction may last from 0.5 hours to more than 10 hours (median duration 7 hours). Hypotension, if it occurs, may be similarly persistent.

In the controlled clinical trials, 3.2% of patients required some form of intervention (typically, use of intravenous fluids or the Trendelenburg position) for blood pressure support following diltiazem hydrochloride injection.

In domestic controlled trials, bolus administration of diltiazem hydrochloride injection was effective in converting PSVT to normal sinus rhythm in 88% of patients within 3 minutes of the first or second bolus dose.

Symptoms associated with the arrhythmia were improved in conjunction with decreased heart rate or conversion to normal sinus rhythm following administration of diltiazem hydrochloride injection.

In controlled clinical trials, therapy with antiarrhythmic agents to maintain reduced heart rate in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter or for prophylaxis of PSVT was generally started within 3 hours after bolus administration of diltiazem hydrochloride. These antiarrhythmic agents were intravenous or oral digoxin, Class 1 antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide), calcium channel blockers, and oral beta-blockers.

The possibility of hypotensive effects can be minimized by either decreasing the dose of or discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with perindopril. If diuretic therapy cannot be altered, provide close medical supervision with the first dose of ACEON, for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for another hour [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

The rate and extent of perindopril absorption and elimination are not affected by concomitant diuretics. The bioavailability of perindoprilat was reduced by diuretics, however, and this was associated with a decrease in plasma ACE inhibition.

7.2 Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics

ACEON may increase serum potassium because of its potential to decrease aldosterone production. Use of potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene and others), potassium supplements or other drugs capable of increasing serum potassium (indomethacin, heparin, cyclosporine and others) can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, monitor the patient's serum potassium frequently.

7.3 Lithium

Increased serum lithium and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving concomitant lithium and ACE inhibitor therapy. Frequent monitoring of serum lithium concentration is recommended. Use of a diuretic may further increase the risk of lithium toxicity.

7.4 Gold

Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE Inhibitor therapy including ACEON.

7.5 Digoxin

A controlled pharmacokinetic study has shown no effect on plasma digoxin concentrations when coadministered with ACEON, but an effect of digoxin on the plasma concentration of perindopril/perindoprilat has not been excluded.

7.6 Gentamicin

Animal data have suggested the possibility of interaction between perindopril and gentamicin. However, this has not been investigated in human studies.

### The central mechanism underlying hypertension: a review of the roles of sodium ions, epithelial sodium channels, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, oxidative stress and endogenous digitalis in the brain [^1167ejJM]. Hypertension Research (2011). Low credibility.

The central nervous system has a key role in regulating the circulatory system by modulating the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, pituitary hormone release, and the baroreceptor reflex. Digoxin- and ouabain-like immunoreactive materials were found > 20 years ago in the hypothalamic nuclei. These factors appeared to localize to the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei and the nerve fibers at the circumventricular organs and supposed to affect electrolyte balance and blood pressure. The turnover rate of these materials increases with increasing sodium intake. As intracerebroventricular injection of ouabain increases blood pressure via sympathetic activation, an endogenous digitalis-like factor (EDLF) was thought to regulate cardiovascular system-related functions in the brain, particularly after sodium loading. Experiments conducted mainly in rats revealed that the mechanism of action of ouabain in the brain involves sodium ions, epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) and the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), all of which are affected by sodium loading. Rats fed a high-sodium diet develop elevated sodium levels in their cerebrospinal fluid, which activates ENaCs. Activated ENaCs and/or increased intracellular sodium in neurons activate the RAAS; this releases EDLF in the brain, activating the sympathetic nervous system. The RAAS promotes oxidative stress in the brain, further activating the RAAS and augmenting sympathetic outflow. Angiotensin II and aldosterone of peripheral origin act in the brain to activate this cascade, increasing sympathetic outflow and leading to hypertension. Thus, the brain Na + –ENaC–RAAS–EDLF axis activates sympathetic outflow and has a crucial role in essential and secondary hypertension. This report provides an overview of the central mechanism underlying hypertension and discusses the use of antihypertensive agents.

### Digoxin therapy for heart failure: an update… [^1122v8hg]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

The DIG investigators concluded that adding digoxin to standard heart failure therapy significantly decreased hospitalizations for worsening heart failure and improved exercise performance. However, adding digoxin to standard therapy did not improve cardiovascular or all-cause mortality during the trial.
9. SERUM DIGOXIN CONCENTRATIONS Retrospective subgroup analysis of the DIG trial showed increased mortality in men who received serum digoxin concentrations of more than
1. 0 ng per mL and showed decreased mortality in men with serum digoxin concentrations of 0. 5 ng per L to
0. 8 ng per mL. Reanalysis of the PROVED and RADIANCE trials indicated that patients with low serum digoxin concentrations experienced similar benefits regarding symptoms of heart failure, improvement in LVEFs, and increased treadmill time compared with patients with moderate to high serum digoxin concentrations.
15. Available clinical trial data indicate that digoxin therapy for heart failure is most beneficial in symptomatic patients with enlarged hearts, poor pump function, and low ejection fractions. 9–12, 14 Digoxin therapy is unlikely to benefit patients with stage A or B heart failure. In these patients, it is important to first implement risk factor reduction and then initiate therapy with ACE inhibitors and beta blockers when indicated. Therefore, it is reasonable to prescribe digoxin for symptomatic patients who are already undergoing adequate diuretic therapy and taking ACE inhibitors with or without beta blockers.
10.

HEART FAILURE AND CONCOMITANT ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Digoxin has electrophysiologic effects that decrease atrioventricular node conduction, making it potentially useful for controlling ventricular rates in patients with heart failure and concomitant atrial fibrillation. However, digoxin appears to be most effective in controlling heart rate at rest in this population. Large doses of digoxin often are required when digoxin is used alone, usually resulting in higher serum digoxin concentrations. The ACC/AHA guidelines.

### Perindopril treatment for congestive heart failure [^115CmcKf]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Congestive heart failure (CHF) is the most common and lethal consequence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, with a prevalence estimated between 1% and 10%, and very high associated mortality. Preventing the continued progression of established heart failure and improving the prognosis for patients with this disease is difficult, but angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to be effective in reducing mortality in patients with CHF. In a review of the worldwide literature of the efficacy and safety of perindopril erbumine for the treatment of patients with CHF, once-daily treatment with this ACE inhibitor was shown to be effective in patients with CHF of all severities. Its use is associated with a low risk of first-dose hypotension and no unwanted effects on blood pressure in normotensive patients. Perindopril also improves arterial compliance and reverses left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with hypertension. It is well tolerated and has no significant effects on heart rate, indexes of renal function, or plasma lipid profile. It also has no clinically significant interactions with other drugs, including digoxin, likely to be taken by patients with CHF.

### 2023 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^115yhDec]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation in HFpEF — rate control and anticoagulation are addressed, with beta-blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers often considered as first-line for heart rate control, and aggressive rate control should be avoided. In RATE-AF, at 6 months rate control and quality of life were similar between bisoprolol and digoxin, while several secondary endpoints favored digoxin at 12 months but with higher rates of dizziness, lethargy, and hypotension with beta-blockers. Thus, in specific cases, digoxin may be considered as an add-on strategy if beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers are inadequate or contraindicated in individuals with HFpEF. Anticoagulation is recommended based on the CHA2DS2-VASc score to mitigate thromboembolic risk, and given the prevalence of hypertension and older age, anticoagulation should thus be considered in practically all individuals with AF and HFpEF unless contraindicated.

### The hemodynamic effects of intravenous digoxin-binding fab immunoglobulin in severe preeclampsia: a double-blind, randomized, clinical trial [^113TVjDN]. Journal of Perinatology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

An endogenous digitalis-like factor (EDLF) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia (PE). This hypothesis is supported by two cases of preeclampsia in which administration of digoxin immune Fab (DIF) reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP).

Study Design

To study this observation further, we performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial to examine the effects on MAP of intravenous DIF given after delivery in 26 subjects with severe preeclampsia. Treating obstetricians were blinded to subject assignment and were allowed to use standard antihypertensive drugs during the trial.

Results

The primary outcome, a significant difference in blood pressure between the two groups over the 24-h period of observation after the intervention, was not supported. However, mean MAP was significantly lower in the DIF-treated subjects for the first 4 h after therapy as compared with controls (P = 0.05). Six subjects (46.2%) in the placebo arm were given conventional antihypertensive medications by their obstetrician for blood pressure > 160 mm Hg systolic or > 110 mm Hg diastolic, compared with zero subjects in the treatment arm (P = 0.01). A trend towards increased creatinine clearance was observed in DIF-treated subjects (137.6 ± 42.6 versus 104.1 ± 43.4, P = 0.07).

Conclusion

These results support the hypothesis that EDLF contributes to the elevated blood pressure in preeclampsia and suggests a possible role for DIF as a treatment for this condition.

### Towards appropriate polypharmacy in older cardiovascular patients: how many medications do I have to take? [^1146n45V]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1.4 Arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia seen in older adults with prevalence increasing with age. 43 The primary goals of AF management include prevention of thromboembolic events, primarily ischemic stroke, and reduction of symptoms and hospitalizations. 43

Anticoagulation: Systemic anticoagulation should be considered in all patients with atrial fibrillation; however, concern over falls and subsequent bleeding may lead to under‐prescribing. Implementation of the HAS‐BLED and CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc scores may help guide pharmacotherapy decision‐making. 44, 45 Newer agents such as the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are now considered the preferred option demonstrating similar efficacy in preventing stroke and systemic embolism, with a lower risk of major bleeding compared to warfarin. 46 Warfarin also seems to be associated with increased risk of osteoporotic fractures compared to the DOACs. 47 All DOACs require dose adjustments for renal function. Apixaban is often considered the preferred agent for older adults, as it has lower renal excretion than dabigatran and rivaroxaban. For those with end stage renal disease, either apixaban or warfarin is reasonable.

Rate vs rhythm control: Symptomatic management of AF consists of either rhythm control or rate control. Rhythm control was shown to be inferior to rate control with respect to mortality in older adults and is associated with more adverse drug events and hospitalizations. 48 Moreover, antiarrhythmic agents use is limited in this population due to co‐morbidities including structural heart disease, heart failure, and renal dysfunction. Amiodarone may often be the only appropriate option, although its use is associated with many long term side effects. Once AF becomes permanent and the decision to pursue rate control is made, all antiarrhythmic agents should be discontinued. Rate control is usually achieved with beta‐blockers, or a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB) such as diltiazem. 49 Atenolol should be avoided in this population due to its renal excretion. Digoxin may also be used for rate control when hypotension limits beta‐blocker or CCB use, but it requires strict monitoring to ensure therapeutic drug levels. Chronic digoxin use appears to be associated with increased mortality. 50 Therefore, initiation of digoxin therapy in older adults with atrial fibrillation alone should generally be avoided when possible.

### GDMT for heart failure and the clinician's conundrum [^111XEMAx]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

5 BETA BLOCKERS IN HEART FAILURE PATIENTS WITH OTHER CO‐MORBIDITIES

Adverse effects of beta blockers have also been reported in patients of heart failure with certain co‐morbid conditions. Bisoprolol has been reported to reduce cardiac output and 6 minute walk distance in patients with right ventricular dysfunction due to pulmonary hypertension, 51 while Metoprolol succinate decreased cardiac index and increased NT‐pro BNP in patients with mild to moderate aortic stenosis even when LVEF was normal. 52 Effectiveness of beta blockers in patients of heart failure with these common co‐morbidities have not been discussed in the guidelines, and their use appears mere extrapolation of the data of the trials. The observational report of heart failure hospitalization in the ARIC cohort showed that, initiation of GDMT reduced mortality at 1 year, but 23% patients needed GDMT modification predicted by selected comorbidities and disease acuity. 53

These reports may suggest that patients with advanced heart failure are better served with withdrawal or reduction in dosage of beta‐blockers. NYHA III, C patients may need digoxin to balance overall myocardial depressant effect of beta‐blockers to reduce heart failure admissions and delay progression to Stage D.

Patients eligible for this strategy have been identified in routine practice by their repeated hospital admissions, escalated need for diuresis, low SBP, worsening renal function, and restrictive mitral inflow pattern with RV dysfunction on echocardiography despite continued GDMT.

Digoxin in acute decompensation and conduction disease — contraindications and cautions specify that digoxin is not indicated as primary therapy for the stabilization of patients with an acute exacerbation of HF symptoms, including fluid retention or hypotension, and such patients should first receive appropriate treatment for HF (usually with intravenous medications); therapy with digoxin may be initiated after stabilization as part of an effort to establish a long-term treatment strategy. Patients should not be given digoxin if they have significant sinus or atrioventricular block, unless the block has been addressed with a permanent pacemaker, and the drug should be used cautiously in patients taking other drugs that can depress sinus or atrioventricular nodal function or affect digoxin levels (e.g., amiodarone or a beta-blocker).

### Efficacy and safety of digoxin in acute heart failure triggered by tachyarrhythmia [^114rsWVX]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Efficacy of digoxin. Panels A and B show changes in heart rate from 0 (baseline) to 24 h and 48 h after receiving digoxin (at least 0.75 mg) in all patients and stratified by sex, respectively. Panels C and D show changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline to 24 h and 48 h after receiving digoxin (at least 0.75 mg) in all patients and stratified by sex, respectively. Panels E and F show changes in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from baseline to 24 h and 48 h after receiving digoxin (at least 0.75 mg) in all patients and stratified by sex, respectively. The solid line indicates the mean. Panels G, H, and I show the median dose, interquartile range, and 25% and 75% percentiles of digoxin, beta blocker (metoprolol equivalent dose), and amiodarone at 0, 24, and 48 h, respectively. In panel I, the median dose, interquartile range, and 25% and 75% percentiles of amiodarone at 0, 24, and 48 h are all zero (0). The dots represent the outliers.

These findings extend and corroborate observations from two propensity score‐matched studies regarding long‐term outcomes in patients hospitalized for AHF and atrial fibrillation in the United States.

Digoxin initiation was associated with a lower risk of AHF readmission and not with mortality.

These findings also seem to support the safety of an unadjusted loading dose in elderly patients with mild‐to‐moderate renal dysfunction, although this was not formally tested.

Some limitations warrant consideration when interpreting the findings of this study. First, this was a single‐center study. Second, this was an uncontrolled study and co‐administration of other negative chronotropic drugs after digoxin loading could have confounded the effect of digoxin. Therefore, it is important to highlight that no relevant changes in the doses of the beta blocker occurred and less than 10% of patients received additional doses of amiodarone within the 48 h study period.

In conclusion, digoxin was very effective in reducing the heart rate among patients with AHF triggered by tachyarrhythmia with a favorable safety profile. It offers physicians a widely available and inexpensive treatment option for these patients.

### Effect of chronic digoxin use on mortality and heart failure hospitalization in pulmonary arterial hypertension [^1164vdqa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a fatal disease that affects the pulmonary vasculature through vasoconstriction and adverse vascular remodeling that obliterates and stiffens the pulmonary vasculature resulting in increased pulmonary artery pressures, pulmonary vascular resistance, and pulmonary vascular stiffness. The resulting increase in right ventricular (RV) afterload eventually leads to RV dysfunction and failure, which remains the strongest predictor of death.,

While currently approved PAH therapies reduce RV afterload, they do not directly target the RV dysfunction, and mortality still remains high in intermediate‐ and high‐risk patients in the modern era. The main treatments for RV dysfunction and right heart failure (HF) in patients with PAH are supportive therapies, including diuretics and digoxin. Digoxin, a cardiac glycoside, provides ionotropic support for patients with ventricular dysfunction, but the long‐term benefits of digoxin use in HF remain controversial. Chronic digoxin reduces HF hospitalization in patients with LV systolic dysfunction in sinus rhythm; however the evidence for its utility in isolated RV dysfunction due to PAH is scarce. Although 1 study shows digoxin acutely increases cardiac output (CO) and reduces circulating norepinephrine levels, the effect of long‐term digoxin therapy in patients with PAH remains unclear. Furthermore, digoxin use is not without risk as there is an increased risk of mortality among patients using digoxin in an atrial fibrillation population.

Hence, we aimed to describe patients with PAH treated with chronic digoxin therapy and to examine the association of digoxin use with all‐cause mortality and HF‐related hospitalization in patients with PAH using the Minnesota Pulmonary Hypertension Repository.

### Expert consensus on the diagnosis and management of digoxin toxicity [^1152sAET]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

While there has been a decline in the use of digoxin in patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation, acute and chronic digoxin toxicity remains a significant clinical problem. Digoxin's narrow therapeutic window and nonspecific signs and symptoms of toxicity create clinical challenges and uncertainty around the diagnostic criteria of toxicity and responsive treatment choices for the bedside clinician. A systematic review of published literature on digoxin toxicity (34,587 publications over 6 decades, with 114 meeting inclusion criteria) was performed to develop 33 consensus statements on diagnostic and therapeutic approaches which were then evaluated through a modified Delphi process involving a panel of experts in cardiology, nursing, emergency medicine, and medical toxicology. The results demonstrate agreement about the need to consider time of ingestion and nature of the exposure (ie, acute, acute-on-chronic, chronic) and the use of digoxin immune Fab for life-threatening exposure to decrease risk of death. While several areas of continued uncertainty were identified, this work offers formalized guidance that may help providers better manage this persistent clinical challenge.

Timolol: Hypotension is more likely to occur if dihydropryridine calcium antagonists such as nifedipine are co-administered with timolol.

Central Alpha1-Blockers

Doxazosin: Healthy volunteers participating in a multiple dose doxazosin-nifedipine interaction study received 2 mg doxazosin q.d. alone or combined with 20 mg nifedipine ER b.i.d. Co-administration of nifedipine resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmaxof doxazosin to 83% and 86% of the values in the absence of nifedipine, respectively. In the presence of doxazosin, AUC and Cmaxof nifedipine were increased by factors of 1.13 and 1.23, respectively. Compared to nifedipine monotherapy, blood pressure was lower in the presence of doxazosin. Blood pressure should be monitored when doxazosin is co-administered with nifedipine, and dose reduction of nifedipine considered.

Digitalis

Digoxin: The simultaneous administration of nifedipine and digoxin may lead to reduced clearance resulting in an increase in plasma concentrations of digoxin. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine extended-release tablets, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting and discontinuing nifedipine extended-release tablets to avoid possible over- or under- digitalization.

### The central mechanism underlying hypertension: a review of the roles of sodium ions, epithelial sodium channels, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, oxidative stress and endogenous digitalis in the brain [^113WPLWa]. Hypertension Research (2011). Low credibility.

The role of endogenous digitalis in hypertension

Is third factor endogenous digitalis?

Continuous administration of mineralocorticoids leads to sodium retention, which in turn leads to natriuresis when the sodium level exceeds a threshold. This phenomenon is known as 'mineralocorticoid escape'.The two major causes of natriuresis are increased glomerular filtration rate and decreased aldosterone levels, but neither is involved in mineralocorticoid escape. The factor involved in this phenomenon is thus referred to as 'the third factor', and the most likely candidate for this third factor is an EDLF: suppression of renal tubular Na +, K + -ATPase activity markedly increases sodium excretion, and EDLFs suppress this enzyme. Supporting this, a Na +, K + -ATPase inhibitor is increased in the circulation and tissue Na +, K + -ATPase activity is suppressed when animals are fed high-sodium diets. An extensive search for the third factor began a few decades ago. Of note, pigs treated with subcutaneous administration of deoxycorticosterone acetate plus 1% sodium chloride as drinking water develop antinatriuresis in the initial 2 days; at this point, digitalis-like Na +, K + -ATPase inhibitory activity increases at least 30-fold compared with baseline and natriuresis occurs (Figure 2).

Endogenous digoxin was first explored as an EDLF

Digoxin is used clinically as a CTS to treat arrhythmia and cardiac failure. As administration of excessive doses of digoxin leads to serious arrhythmias, the circulating levels of immunoreactive digoxin are monitored during digoxin therapy. Even when digoxin has not been given to patients, digoxin-like immunoreactivity (DLI) is sometimes detected in the plasma, possibly due to an EDLF that cross-reacts with the anti-digoxin antibody. In fact, DLI is higher in deoxycorticosterone acetate–salt hypertensive rats than in control rats, and circulating DLI increases with sodium loading in rats. In humans, urinary DLI correlates with blood pressure and with urinary sodium. In 2000, our group identified circulating DLI as digoxin using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry.

### Digoxin in patients with mild to… [^113kCXRq]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Over the past decade, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and other new findings, such as the successful use of lower dosages, have revived interest in the use of digoxin in the treatment of heart failure. One study 18 demonstrated that compared with placebo, digoxin improved signs and lessened symptoms in patients with heart failure who had normal sinus rhythm and were receiving maintenance diuretic therapy. The benefits of digoxin were greatest in patients with more severe heart failure, a third heart sound gallop, left ventricular enlargement and a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction. who received digoxin had significantly fewer hospital admissions when the drug was given in addition to diuretics and ACE inhibitors. 17 Compared with the placebo group, the digoxin-treated group had 270 fewer patients who required hospital admission for worsening heart failure.

Furthermore, there were 626 fewer hospital admissions in patients with worsening heart failure as the primary diagnosis. The trial showed little evidence of risks related to digoxin therapy. 21 The neurohormonal effect of digoxin was first demonstrated in a small study in 1987. 22 The study findings showed that digoxin reduced plasma norepinephrine levels; these results were validated in other studies. 23, 24 The explanation for this effect was that digoxin improves impaired baroreceptor reflexes in heart failure.
25. Digoxin may also lower plasma renin levels, 24 either because of a direct renal effect or secondary to inhibition of sympathetic activity. By inhibiting sodium-potassium ATPase in the kidney, digoxin decreases renal tubular reabsorption of sodium, thereby increasing delivery of sodium to the distal tubules and suppressing renin secretion.

In the DIG trial, 17 a subgroup of nearly 1, 000 patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45 percent or greater experienced a reduction in congestive heart failure end points similar to patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 25 to 45 percent. One group of investigators 27 suggested that this effect may be the result of digoxin's ability to reduce neurohormonal activities. However, they concluded that information about the effect of digoxin in patients with congestive heart failure and preserved left ventricular systolic function is limited and does not warrant routine use of the drug in this setting until the results of more studies are available.

Additional reductions in blood pressure may occur when VELETRI is administered with diuretics, antihypertensive agents, or other vasodilators. When other antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants are used concomitantly, there is the potential for VELETRI to increase the risk of bleeding. However, patients receiving infusions of epoprostenol in clinical trials were maintained on anticoagulants without evidence of increased bleeding. In clinical trials, epoprostenol was used with digoxin, diuretics, anticoagulants, oral vasodilators, and supplemental oxygen.

In a pharmacokinetic substudy in patients with congestive heart failure receiving furosemide or digoxin in whom therapy with epoprostenol was initiated, apparent oral clearance values for furosemide (n = 23) and digoxin (n = 30) were decreased by 13% and 15%, respectively, on the second day of therapy and had returned to baseline values by day 87. The change in furosemide clearance value is not likely to be clinically significant. However, patients on digoxin may show elevations of digoxin concentrations after initiation of therapy with epoprostenol, which may be clinically significant in patients prone to digoxin toxicity.

Diuretics, antihypertensive agents, or other vasodilators: reduction in blood pressure (7)
Antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants: increase the risk of bleeding (7)
Patients on digoxin: elevations of digoxin concentrations clinically significant in patients prone to digoxin toxicity (7)

### Verapamil hydrochloride (isoptin SR) [^1178AMDN]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

A decrease in metoprolol and propranolol clearance has been observed when either drug is administered concomitantly with verapamil. A variable effect has been seen when verapamil and atenolol were given together.

Digitalis: Clinical use of verapamil in digitalized patients has shown the combination to be well tolerated if digoxin doses are properly adjusted. Chronic verapamil treatment can increase serum digoxin levels by 50 to 75% during the first week of therapy, and this can result in digitalis toxicity. In patients with hepatic cirrhosis the influence of verapamil on digoxin kinetics is magnified. Verapamil may reduce total body clearance and extrarenal clearance of digitoxin by 27% and 29%, respectively. Maintenance and digitalization doses should be reduced when verapamil is administered, and the patient should be carefully monitored to avoid over or underdigitalization. Whenever overdigitalization is suspected, the daily dose of digitalis should be reduced or temporarily discontinued. Upon discontinuation of ISOPTIN (verapamil HCI), the patient should be reassessed to avoid underdigitalization.

Antihypertensive Agents: Verapamil administered concomitantly with oral antihypertensive agents (e.g., vasodilators, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, beta blockers) will usually have an additive effect on lowering blood pressure. Patients receiving these combinations should be appropriately monitored. Concomitant use of agents that attenuate alpha-adrenergic function with verapamil may result in a reduction in blood pressure that is excessive in some patients. Such an effect was observed in one study following the concomitant administration of verapamil and prazosin.

### Effect of digoxin in patients with heart failure and mid-range (borderline) left ventricular ejection fraction [^113xJ9yU]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

To evaluate the effects of digoxin in patients with the newly described phenotype of heart failure (HF) and mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF), attributed to mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

Methods and Results

We carried out a retrospective analysis of the Digitalis Investigation Group (DIG) trial which had 7788 patients available for analysis with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ranging between 3% and 85%. We compared the effect of digoxin to placebo in three mutually exclusive groups of patients defined by LVEF category: < 40% (HF with reduced LVEF, HFrEF, n = 5874), 40–49% (HFmrEF, n = 1195) and ≥ 50% (HF with preserved LVEF, HFpEF, n = 719). The primary outcome was the composite of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalisation. Patients with HFmrEF resembled patients with HFrEF, more than those with HFpEF, with respect to age, sex and aetiology but were more like HFpEF patients with respect to blood pressure and the prevalence of hypertension. Event rates in patients with HFmrEF were similar to those in HFpEF and much lower than in HFrEF. Digoxin reduced the primary endpoint in patients with HFrEF, mainly due to reduced HF hospitalisation: the digoxin/placebo hazard ratio (HR) for HF hospitalisation was 0.71 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65–0.77]. The digoxin/placebo HR for HF hospitalisation in patients with HFmrEF was 0.80 (95% CI 0.63–1.03) and 0.85 (95% CI 0.62–1.17) in those with HFpEF. The digoxin/placebo HR for the composite of HF death or HF hospitalisation was 0.74 (95% CI 0.68–0.81) in HFrEF, 0.83 (95% CI 0.66–1.05) in HFmrEF and 0.88 (95% CI 0.65–1.19) in HFpEF.

Conclusions

In this study, event rates in patients with HFmrEF were closer to those in HFpEF than HFrEF. Digoxin had most effect on HF hospitalisation in patients with HFrEF, an intermediate effect in HFmrEF, and the smallest effect in HFpEF.

### Clinical assessment of clonidine in the treatment of new-onset rapid atrial fibrillation: a prospective, randomized clinical trial [^1148p2Tm]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

The role of digoxin and verapamil in the control of ventricular response in rapid atrial fibrillation is well established. This study investigates how clonidine compares with these standard therapies in rate control for new-onset rapid atrial fibrillation. We set out to test the hypothesis that clonidine effectively reduces heart rate in patients with new-onset rapid atrial fibrillation.

Subjects and Methods

Forty patients were seen in the emergency department with new-onset (≤ 24 hours' duration), stable, rapid atrial fibrillation. Eligible patients were randomized to receive either clonidine, digoxin, or verapamil. Changes in heart rate and blood pressure over 6 hours, as well as frequency of conversion to sinus rhythm were recorded and analyzed.

Results

The mean reduction in heart rate over 6 hours was 44.4 beats/min (95% confidence interval [CI] 28.4–60.4 beats/min) in the clonidine group, 52.1 beats/min (95% CI 40.8–63.4 beats/min) in the digoxin group, and 41.8 beats/min (95% CI 22.5–61.0 beats/min) in the verapamil group. Analysis of variance of the heart rate changes in the 3 groups after 6 hours was not significant (P = .55). At 6 hours, 7 of 12 clonidine patients, 8 of 15 digoxin patients, and 7 of 13 verapamil patients remained in atrial fibrillation (P = .962 on chi(2)).

Conclusion

Clonidine controls ventricular rate in new-onset atrial fibrillation with an efficacy comparable to that of standard agents.

### Cardiovascular effects of energy drinks in the pediatric population [^117YEfJq]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Consumption of energy drinks in the pediatric population is correlated with more emergency department visits and causes adverse reactions, such as neurological, psychiatric, gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular effects. These cardiovascular complications include increased cardiometabolic risk with high intake of sugar, short-term blood pressure increases and a decrease in cerebral blood flow due to the caffeine content, increased or decreased blood pressure from taurine, unmasked cardiac conditions, such as channelopathies, and atrial and ventral fibrillations. Cardiovascular complications can also arise when energy drinks are mixed with pharmaceutical drugs, such as amiodarone, potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, warfarin, digoxin, or corticosteroids. Combining energy drinks with alcohol also precipitates adverse cardiovascular events, posing a risk to the health of children and adolescents. This review further explores the ingredients in energy drinks and their mechanism of action in causing these cardiovascular complications.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^113QfNeL]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Cardiac amyloidosis — strategies to avoid because of harm concern: Digoxin should be avoided in patients with amyloidosis (Level of Evidence C). Digoxin binds to amyloid fibrils and thus can predispose to toxicity even in the setting of normal serum digoxin levels. Calcium channel antagonists (nifedipine or verapamil) should not be administered, because they bind to amyloid fibrils and can result in exaggerated hypotensive and negative inotropic responses (Level of Evidence C).

### Safety and efficacy of digoxin: systematic review and meta-analysis of observational and controlled trial data [^11171SDs]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Digoxin has a neutral effect on all cause mortality in randomised trials and is associated with a reduction in hospital admission. This finding is based on a comprehensive systematic review including over 600 000 patients, with meta-analysis incorporating a combined total of four million patient years of follow-up. Based on our analysis, observational studies that report increased mortality with digoxin use (regardless of statistical methods) were unable to adjust for systematic differences in the type of patients who received digoxin. Uniquely, we were able to show that studies exhibiting a higher risk of bias reported a stronger association with all cause mortality, highlighting the need to base clinical decisions relating to patient management on high quality data derived from controlled trials, rather than post hoc or observational data.

Heart failure and atrial fibrillation cause a substantial burden of disease worldwide. Throughout most of the past century, digoxin was routinely used to improve cardiac output and to avoid admission to hospital. Based on information from large randomised trials, the use of digoxin has been eclipsed by the widespread initiation of drugs with prognostic benefit, including ACE inhibitors, β blockers (in sinus rhythm), and aldosterone antagonists. This decline in use followed evidence from the DIG Trial that digoxin does not reduce mortality in patients with heart failure, despite high rates of concomitant digoxin use in most trials of treatment for heart failure. Currently, European and American guidelines recommend digoxin for persistent symptoms, despite optimal treatment, or as an alternative/adjunct to reduce hospital admissions. Atrial fibrillation guidelines preferentially suggest treatment with β blockers over digoxin, except in sedentary patients or as an adjunct for additional rate control.

### Pharmacologic management of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^111kXZAH]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an overview of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF), as well as its pathophysiology, diagnosis, and clinical evidence regarding its pharmacologic management.

Data Sources

Peer-reviewed articles were identified from MEDLINE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and Current Contents (all 1966-August 2010) using the search terms heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, diastolic dysfunction, diastolic heart failure, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), digoxin, β-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and vasodilators. Citations from available articles were also reviewed for additional references.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Fourteen published manuscripts relating to pharmacologic management of HFPEF were identified.

Data Synthesis

The prevalence of HFPEF has continued to increase. Compared to heart failure with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, HFPEF has been largely understudied. Unlike in the management of heart failure with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, β-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists did not demonstrate mortality benefit in HFPEF, with the exception of one small study evaluating the use of propranolol. However, this study enrolled a small number of patients with recent history of myocardial infarction, which limited the generalizability of the results. Most of the current evidence centers on morbidity benefits and symptom reduction. One study showed that treatment with candesartan reduced hospital admissions in this population of patients. Management of HFPEF still focuses on optimally managing underlying diseases (eg, hypertension).

Conclusions

Much remains to be learned about the appropriate pharmacologic management of patients with HFPEF. Hypertension is in most cases the predominant contributor to its development and progression. For this reason, antihypertensive treatment, including ACE inhibitors, ARBs, β-blockers, and calcium-channel blockers, has been evaluated and is recommended to control the disease in this patient population, although these agents have not demonstrated significant benefit beyond blood pressure control. Further research into the pathophysiology of HFPEF may contribute to identifying the most optimal agent in managing this disease.

### Rate control versus rhythm control in atrial fibrillation: lessons learned from clinical trials of atrial fibrillation [^111yoNhZ]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Ample evidence supports the statement that in patients with atrial fibrillation in whom treatment is warranted, either rhythm control or rate control are acceptable primary therapeutic options. If a rhythm control strategy is chosen, it is important to consider that recurrence of atrial fibrillation is not treatment failure per se. Occasional recurrence, with cardioversion if necessary, may be quite acceptable. The latter will depend on the frequency, duration and symptoms associated with recurrence, and may require a change in the rhythm control therapy, e.g., change the antiarrhythmic drug, or initiate or redo atrial fibrillation ablation. And a rhythm control strategy should include careful attention to and treatment of comorbidities (hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, etc.). If a rate control strategy is chosen, treatment with a beta blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker is almost always required to achieve adequate rate control. Digoxin is often useful to obtain satisfactory rate control in combination with a beta blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. Digoxin may be useful as primary therapy in the presence of hypotension or heart failure. Satisfactory ventricular rate control is usually a resting rate less than 110 beats per minute, although resting rates below 90 beats per minute are probably wiser. Finally, when pursuing a rhythm control strategy, because recurrence of atrial fibrillation is common, rate control therapy should be a part of the treatment regimen.

### Temporal trends in antihypertensive drug prescriptions in Canada before and after introduction of the Canadian Hypertension Education Program [^1126CLTW]. Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Poor control of hypertension is a world-wide health issue. In 1999, the Canadian Hypertension Education Program (CHEP) was launched to annually develop and implement evidence-based hypertension guidelines in an effort to improve hypertension control rates. This study was designed to examine temporal trends in antihypertensive drug prescribing and to explore whether drug prescriptions changed after initiation of the new CHEP guideline process.

Design and Methods

We used longitudinal Canadian dispensing data (from the IMS CompuScript database; IMS Health, Pointe-Claire, Quebec) to examine antihypertensive prescriptions in the 3 years prior to and the 3 years following introduction of the new CHEP process. To control for temporal changes in the incidence of other cardiovascular conditions for which antihypertensive agents may be prescribed for their non-blood pressure-lowering effects (for example, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for heart failure or coronary artery disease), prescription rates for digoxin, loop diuretics, and nitrates were also examined.

Results

Prescriptions for all antihypertensive agents increased significantly between 1996 and 2001 [11% for thiazides, 45% for beta-blockers, 68% for ACE inhibitors, 19% for calcium channel blockers, and 4332% for angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)]. Loop diuretic prescriptions increased 27%, but prescriptions for digoxin (-19%) and nitrates (-8%) declined over this time frame. Time series analyses demonstrated increases in the prescription growth rate for all four antihypertensive drug classes recommended in CHEP for the period 1999–2001 compared with 1996–1998, which were statistically significantly and of substantial magnitude (absolute annual increase in prescription growth rate of 4.6% (95% confidence interval 3.5–5.9%) for thiazides, 3.0% (1.8–4.2%) for beta-blockers, 8.2% (6.7–9.7%) for ACE inhibitors, and 6.1% (4.4–7.8%) for calcium channel blockers). The growth rate in nitrate prescriptions did not significantly change [1.1% (-0.6 to +3.0%)] and, although the changes in growth rate for loop diuretics [4.7% (3.2–6.3%)] and digoxin [2.1% (0.6–3.5%)] were statistically significant, they were of smaller magnitude than the changes in the four recommended antihypertensive agents. Similar results were observed when analysis was restricted to new prescriptions only.

Conclusions

Prescriptions for all antihypertensive drugs increased substantially in Canada between 1996 and 2001; the rate of increase was significantly greater after 1999 for all four drugs recommended as first-line therapy in the annual CHEP guidelines. This preliminary data is encouraging, but a national survey of blood pressure control is needed to fully evaluate the impact of the new Canadian guideline process.

### 2022 ESC / ERS guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension [^111uS1ZF]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) — use of cardiovascular drugs for left-sided disease explains that no data from rigorous clinical trials are available on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs), sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is), beta-blockers, or ivabradine in PAH, and in this group these drugs may cause potentially dangerous drops in blood pressure, heart rate, or both. The efficacy of digoxin/digitoxin has not been documented in PAH, although these agents may be used to slow ventricular rate in PAH patients with atrial tachyarrhythmias.

Europace (2018). Medium credibility.

Antiarrhythmic drug pharmacodynamics — key interaction risks and monitoring are described: for Class I antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD), "Combinations of these drugs reduce cardiac contractility and increase the risk of bradycardia, intracardiac conduction disturbances, and proarrhythmia", and "Co-administration of Class I AAD with beta-blockers, diltiazem, verapamil, or digoxin increases the risk of bradycardia, AV block and hypotension"; "Lidocaine is less effective in the presence of hypokalaemia; therefore, it should be corrected", and "Propafenone increases the effects of cyclosporin, desipramine, and theophylline"; with beta‑blockers, "Their combination with Class I AAD, digoxin or amiodarone increases the risk of bradycardia, AV block and myocardial depression… [and] The combination with diltiazem and verapamil should be avoided because it increases the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, AV block, and heart failure"; for amiodarone, "Co-administration with digoxin, beta-blockers, verapamil, or diltiazem increases the risk of bradycardia and AV block and hypotension; thus, ECG and blood pressure should be monitored… Severe bradycardia has been reported when amiodarone is coadministered with hepatitis C antiviral drugs (daclatasvir, ledipasvir, and sofosbuvir)", while "Combination of amiodarone with fentanyl may cause hypotension, bradycardia, and decreases cardiac output" and "Higher IV doses of dopamine and dobutamine are needed in patients on amiodarone"; torsade risk is highlighted as "Class I and III AAD (particularly dofetilide, ibutilide, and sotalol) prolong the QT interval and should be used with caution (or avoided)… [and] Hypokalaemia increases the risk of torsades de pointes and potentiates digoxin-induced arrhythmias; thus, it should be corrected"; for nondihydropyridine calcium‑channel blockers, "Co-administration of diltiazem or verapamil with disopyramide or inhaled anaesthetics decreases cardiac contractility and increases the risk of bradycardia, AV block, and hypotension; therefore, it should be avoided"; for adenosine, "Its coadministration with beta-blockers, digoxin, diltiazem, or verapamil increases the risk of bradycardia and AV block… Dipyridamole inhibits the uptake of adenosine potentiating its effects; theophylline blocks adenosine receptors and decreases the effects of adenosine".

### The central mechanism underlying hypertension: a review of the roles of sodium ions, epithelial sodium channels, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, oxidative stress and endogenous digitalis in the brain [^116EpNae]. Hypertension Research (2011). Low credibility.

Future tasks

Despite the long history of hypertension research, some of the possible mechanisms of action of antihypertensive agents have been ignored. Although the brain controls the sympathetic nervous system (and thus hypertension), it seemed unlikely to researchers that antihypertensive therapies targeted the brain. This may be why it took so long to elucidate the pathogenesis of hypertension. We can now forget that such agents can change patients' personalities and may have other serious side effects. Physiological variables such as respiration and body temperature are controlled by the CNS, and the CNS is the overall regulator of many physiological functions, including blood pressure. Sympathetic activation represents a hallmark of the essential hypertensive state and its complications. Some issues remain to be clarified, including the following:
Does ouabain, digoxin or another Na +, K + -ATPase inhibitor function as an EDLF in the CNS?
The evidence establishing the connections in the Na–ENaC–RAAS–EDLF network remains incomplete.
The expression of genes associated with the Na–ENaC–RAAS–EDLF network must be determined.
Most evidence supporting the central role of this network in blood pressure regulation was obtained in animal models or cultured cells. We must determine whether there is a similar series of responses in humans.

Despite these remaining questions, the paths that lead to hypertension are becoming clearer, and a full understanding of the mechanisms underlying hypertension may be close at hand.

### Effect of digoxin vs bisoprolol for heart rate control in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation… [^117AtGMT]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

The median NT-proBNP level was 1057 pg/mL and 19% of patients had LVEF of less than 50% on their echocardiograms. The groups were well balanced at baseline. However, there were more signs of heart failure among those randomized to digoxin. At 6 months, 73 of 76 patients randomized to digoxin were still taking the drug, the mean dose was 161 µg/d, and the mean digoxin level was 0. 78 ng/mL. At 12 months, compared with patients randomized to bisoprolol, patients randomized to digoxin had significantly better normalized SF-36 scores for vitality, general health at baseline to 1058 pg/mL at 6 months, and then to 960 pg/mL at 12 months.

The daily activities and treatment satisfaction subscales of the AFEQT were significantly better in the digoxin group, compared with the bisoprolol group, at both time points. Treatment with digoxin was associated with significantly lower NYHA class, compared with the bisoprolol group, at both 6 months, an electrophysiological component, a cellular component, and resultant hemodynamic changes. 13 In contrast, β-blockers are used to target β1-adrenergic receptors.

### Digitalis toxicity: a fading but crucial complication to recognize [^117Bm8dH]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Digoxin usage has decreased in the treatment of congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation as a result of its inferiority to beta-adrenergic inhibitors and agents that interfere with the deleterious effects of the activated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. As a result of reduction of usage and dosage, glycoside toxicity has become an uncommon occurrence but may be overlooked when it does occur. Older age, female sex, low lean body mass, and renal insufficiency contribute to higher serum levels and enhanced risk for toxicity. Arrhythmias suggesting digoxin toxicity led to its recognition in the case presented here.

### The importance of beta blockers in the treatment of heart failure [^112FaXSM]. American Family Physician (2000). Low credibility.

Heart failure, the only cardiovascular disease with an increasing incidence, is associated with significant mortality and poses a considerable economic burden. Traditionally, beta blockers have been considered to be contraindicated in patients with heart failure. Recently, however, several large randomized, controlled mortality trials have been stopped early because of significant improvement in mortality rates in patients with heart failure who were given beta blockers in addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics and, sometimes, digoxin. Beta blockers should now be considered standard therapy in patients with New York Heart Association class II or class III heart failure who are hemodynamically stable, who do not have dyspnea at rest and who have no other contraindications to the use of these agents.

### Digoxin (digox) [^116cFWYx]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

Special Populations: Race differences in digoxin pharmacokinetics have not been formally studied. Because digoxin is primarily eliminated as unchanged drug via the kidney and because there are no important differences in creatinine clearance among races, pharmacokinetic differences due to race are not expected.

The clearance of digoxin can be primarily correlated with renal function as indicated by creatinine clearance. The Cockcroft and Gault formula for estimation of creatinine clearance includes age, body weight, and gender. Table 5 that provides the usual daily maintenance dose requirements of Digoxin Tablets based on creatinine clearance (per 70 kg) is presented in the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section.

Plasma digoxin concentration profiles in patients with acute hepatitis generally fell within the range of profiles in a group of healthy subjects.

Pharmacodynamic and Clinical Effects: The times to onset of pharmacologic effect and to peak effect of preparations of digoxin are shown in Table 2:

Hemodynamic Effects: Digoxin produces hemodynamic improvement in patients with heart failure. Short- and long-term therapy with the drug increases cardiac output and lowers pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and systemic vascular resistance. These hemodynamic effects are accompanied by an increase in the left ventricular ejection fraction and a decrease in end-systolic and end-diastolic dimensions.

Chronic Heart Failure: Two 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies enrolled 178 (RADIANCE trial) and 88 (PROVED trial) patients with NYHA class II or III heart failure previously treated with digoxin, a diuretic, and an ACE inhibitor (RADIANCE only) and randomized them to placebo or treatment with digoxin. Both trials demonstrated better preservation of exercise capacity in patients randomized to digoxin. Continued treatment with digoxin reduced the risk of developing worsening heart failure, as evidenced by heart failure-related hospitalizations and emergency care and the need for concomitant heart failure therapy. The larger study also showed treatment-related benefits in NYHA class and patients' global assessment. In the smaller trial, these trended in favor of a treatment benefit.

### Digoxin (digox) [^112pQ1z1]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Heart Failure: Digoxin is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate heart failure. Digoxin increases left ventricular ejection fraction and improves heart failure symptoms as evidenced by exercise capacity and heart failure symptoms as evidenced by exercise capacity and heart failure-related hospitalizations and emergency care, while having no effect on mortality. Where possible, digoxin should be used with a diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, but an optimal order for starting these three drugs cannot be specified.

Atrial Fibrillation: Digoxin is indicated for the control of ventricular response rate in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation.

### Esmolol hydrochloride (esmolol hydrochloride in water) [^117AVFou]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Concomitant use of esmolol hydrochloride with other drugs that can lower blood pressure, reduce myocardial contractility, or interfere with sinus node function or electrical impulse propagation in the myocardium can exaggerate esmolol hydrochloride's effects on blood pressure, contractility, and impulse propagation. Severe interactions with such drugs can result in, for example, severe hypotension, cardiac failure, severe bradycardia, sinus pause, sinoatrial block, atrioventricular block, and/or cardiac arrest.

Digitalis glycosides: Concomitant administration of digoxin and esmolol hydrochloride leads to an approximate 10% to 20% increase of digoxin blood levels at some time points. Digoxin does not affect esmolol hydrochloride pharmacokinetics. Both digoxin and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use increases the risk of bradycardia.
Anticholinesterases: Esmolol hydrochloride prolonged the duration of succinylcholine-induced neuromuscular blockade and moderately prolonged clinical duration and recovery index of mivacurium.
Antihypertensive agents clonidine or guanfacine: Beta-blockers also increase the risk of clonidine-, or guanfacine-withdrawal rebound hypertension. If, during concomitant use of a beta-blocker, antihypertensive therapy needs to be interrupted or discontinued, discontinue the beta-blocker first, and the discontinuation should be gradual.
Calcium channel antagonists: In patients with depressed myocardial function, use of esmolol hydrochloride with cardiodepressant calcium channel antagonists (e.g., verapamil) can lead to fatal cardiac arrests.
Sympathomimetic drugs: Sympathomimetic drugs having beta-adrenergic agonist activity will counteract effects of esmolol hydrochloride.
Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic agents: Because of the risk of reducing cardiac contractility in presence of high systemic vascular resistance, do not use esmolol hydrochloride to control tachycardia in patients receiving drugs that are vasoconstrictive and have positive inotropic effects, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine.

Digitalis glycosides: Risk of bradycardia (7)
Anticholinesterases: Prolongs neuromuscular blockade (7)
Antihypertensive agents: Risk of rebound hypertension (7)
Sympathomimetic drugs: Dose adjustment needed (7)
Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic effect substances: Avoid concomitant use (7)

### Nifedipine (adalat CC) [^116xi8Zv]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

Digitalis

Digoxin: The simultaneous administration of nifedipine and digoxin may lead to reduced clearance resulting in an increase in plasma concentrations of digoxin. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and Adalat CC, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting and discontinuing Adalat CC to avoid possible over- or under- digitalization.

Antithrombotics

Coumarins: There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain.

Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors

Clopidogrel: No clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when clopidrogrel was co-administered with nifedipine.

Tirofiban: Co-administration of nifedipine did not alter the exposure to tirofiban importantly.

Other

Diuretics, PDE5 inhibitors, alpha-methyldopa: Nifedipine may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of these concomitantly administered agents.

Antifungal Drugs

Ketoconazole, itraconazole and fluconazole are CYP3A inhibitors and can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered.

### Digoxin (Lanoxin) [^114NANWE]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

All of digoxin's actions are mediated through its effects on Na-K ATPase. This enzyme, the "sodium pump", is responsible for maintaining the intracellular milieu throughout the body by moving sodium ions out of and potassium ions into cells. By inhibiting Na-K ATPase, digoxin

causes increased availability of intracellular calcium in the myocardium and conduction system, with consequent increased inotropy, increased automaticity, and reduced conduction velocity
indirectly causes parasympathetic stimulation of the autonomic nervous system, with consequent effects on the sino-atrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) nodes
reduces catecholamine reuptake at nerve terminals, rendering blood vessels more sensitive to endogenous or exogenous catecholamines
increases baroreceptor sensitization, with consequent increased carotid sinus nerve activity and enhanced sympathetic withdrawal for any given increment in mean arterial pressure
increases (at higher concentrations) sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system (CNS) to both cardiac and peripheral sympathetic nerves
allows (at higher concentrations) progressive efflux of intracellular potassium, with consequent increase in serum potassium levels.

The cardiologic consequences of these direct and indirect effects are an increase in the force and velocity of myocardial systolic contraction (positive inotropic action), a slowing of the heart rate (negative chronotropic effect), decreased conduction velocity through the AV node, and a decrease in the degree of activation of the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin system (neurohormonal deactivating effect).

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The times to onset of pharmacologic effect and to peak effect of preparations of LANOXIN are shown in Table 7.

Hemodynamic Effects: Short- and long-term therapy with the drug increases cardiac output and lowers pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and systemic vascular resistance in patients with heart failure. These hemodynamic effects are accompanied by an increase in the left ventricular ejection fraction and a decrease in end-systolic and end-diastolic dimensions.

ECG Changes: The use of therapeutic doses of LANOXIN may cause prolongation of the PR interval and depression of the ST segment on the electrocardiogram. LANOXIN may produce false positive ST-T changes on the electrocardiogram during exercise testing. These electrophysiologic effects are not indicative of toxicity. LANOXIN does not significantly reduce heart rate during exercise.

### Digoxin use and risk of mortality in hypertensive patients with atrial fibrillation [^116GjYqB]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Digoxin is widely used for rate control of atrial fibrillation. However, recent studies have reported conflicting results on the association of digoxin with mortality when used in patients with atrial fibrillation. Moreover, the relationship of digoxin use to mortality in hypertensive patients with atrial fibrillation has not been examined.

Methods and Results

All-cause mortality was examined in relation to in-treatment digoxin use in 937 hypertensive patients with ECG left ventricular hypertrophy in atrial fibrillation at baseline (n = 134) or who developed atrial fibrillation during follow-up (n = 803), randomly assigned to losartan or atenolol-based treatment, in post-hoc analysis of a substudy of the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint Reduction in hypertension (LIFE) trial. During 4.7 ± 1.1 years of mean follow-up, 167 patients died (17.8%) and 372 (39.7%) were treated with digoxin. In univariate Cox analyses, in-treatment digoxin use, entered as a time-varying covariate, was associated with a 61% higher risk of dying (hazard ratio 1.61, 95% confidence interval 1.18–2.19, P = 0.003). After adjusting for other univariate predictors of death in this population, including age, diabetes, history of ischemic heart disease, stroke, or heart failure, baseline Cornell product, QRS duration, heart rate, serum glucose, creatinine and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and a propensity score for digoxin use entered as standard covariates, and for in-treatment heart rate, pulse pressure, and Sokolow-Lyon voltage treated as time-varying covariates, digoxin use was no longer a significant predictor of mortality (hazard ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval 0.73–1.48, P = 0.839).

Conclusion

In hypertensive patients with ECG left ventricular hypertrophy with existing or new atrial fibrillation, digoxin use is not associated with a significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality after adjusting for other independent predictors of death and for the factors associated with the propensity to use digoxin in this population. These findings suggest that factors other than digoxin use may account for the increased mortality found with digoxin use in some studies.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115HmWDN]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Stage C HFrEF — digoxin pharmacological treatment: COR 2b; LOE B-R state, "In patients with symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) despite guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) (or who are unable to tolerate GDMT), digoxin might be considered to decrease hospitalizations for HF". Evidence cited notes only one large randomized trial predating current GDMT in NYHA class II to III patients, with 2 to 5 years of digoxin showing no effect on mortality but a modest reduction in the combined risk of death and hospitalization and no significant effect on health-related QOL; use "requires caution" and is reserved for those symptomatic despite optimization of GDMT. Dosing and safety notes include that digoxin is usually initiated at a low dose; GDMT is expected to be optimized before considering addition; higher serum digoxin concentrations are linked to higher death risk (≥ 1.2 ng/mL and ≥ 1.6 ng/mL); therapy may be continued in the absence of a contraindication or discontinued with caution; clinical worsening after withdrawal has been shown; and typical dosing is 0.125 to 0.25 mg daily, with low doses (0.125 mg daily or every other day) initially if the patient is > 70 years.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Antihypertensive medications — pharmacokinetic drug–drug interactions are outlined across absorption, metabolism, elimination, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) effects with mitigation where stated. Thiazide-type diuretics with cholestyramine produce decreased absorption leading to reduced BP lowering, and methyldopa with iron salts decreases absorption leading to reduced BP lowering. Potassium binder (patiromer) decreases absorption of several antihypertensives; to mitigate this, administer the antihypertensives at least 3 h before or after taking the potassium binder. With potassium binder (sodium zirconium cyclosilicate), furosemide has increased absorption with increased clinical effects and the effect is diminished with separation of administration by 2 h. CYP2D6 inhibitors with bisoprolol, carvedilol, or metoprolol cause increased BB concentration leading to enhanced clinical effects (eg, hypotension and bradycardia). CYP3A4 inhibitors with diltiazem or verapamil increase nondihydropyridine concentration, whereas CYP3A4 inducers decrease nondihydropyridine CCB concentration leading to reduced clinical effects. CYP3A4 inhibition via amlodipine, verapamil, or diltiazem increases tacrolimus or cyclosporine concentrations with increased risk for side effects. Lithium with thiazide-type diuretics or RAS blockers reduces lithium clearance leading to increased lithium toxicity risk. Via P-gp inhibition, verapamil increases dabigatran levels with a higher risk of bleeding, and verapamil and carvedilol increase digoxin levels with a higher risk of digoxin toxicity.

### Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride [^112yA2Jv]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Concomitant use of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection with other drugs that can lower blood pressure, reduce myocardial contractility, or interfere with sinus node function or electrical impulse propagation in the myocardium can exaggerate esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection's effects on blood pressure, contractility, and impulse propagation. Severe interactions with such drugs can result in, for example, severe hypotension, cardiac failure, severe bradycardia, sinus pause, sinoatrial block, atrioventricular block, and/or cardiac arrest. In addition, with some drugs, beta blockade may precipitate increased withdrawal effects. (See clonidine, guanfacine, and moxonidine below.) Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection should therefore be used only after careful individual assessment of the risks and expected benefits in patients receiving drugs that can cause these types of pharmacodynamic interactions, including but not limited to:

Digitalis glycosides: Concomitant administration of digoxin and esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection leads to an approximate 10% to 20% increase of digoxin blood levels at some time points. Digoxin does not affect esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection pharmacokinetics. Both digoxin and beta blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use increases the risk of bradycardia.
Anticholinesterases: Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection prolonged the duration of succinylcholine-induced neuromuscular blockade and moderately prolonged clinical duration and recovery index of mivacurium.
Antihypertensive agents clonidine, guanfacine, or moxonidine: Beta blockers also increase the risk of clondidine-, guanfacine-, or moxonidine-withdrawal rebound hypertension. If, during concomitant use of a beta blocker, antihypertensive therapy needs to be interrupted or discontinued, discontinue the beta blocker first, and the discontinuation should be gradual.
Calcium channel antagonists: In patients with depressed myocardial infarction, use of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection with cardiodepressant calcium channel antagonists (e.g., verapamil) can lead to fatal cardiac arrests.
Sympathomimetic drugs: Sympathomimetic drugs having beta-adrenergic agonist activity will counteract effects of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection.
Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic agents: Because of the risk of reducing cardiac contractility in presence of high systemic vascular resistance, do not use esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection to control tachycardia in patients receiving drugs that are vasoconstrictive and have positive inotropic effects, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine.

### Digoxin [^116HwK6y]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

All of digoxin's actions are mediated through its effects on Na-K ATPase. This enzyme, the "sodium pump", is responsible for maintaining the intracellular milieu throughout the body by moving sodium ions out of and potassium ions into cells. By inhibiting Na-K ATPase, digoxin

causes increased availability of intracellular calcium in the myocardium and conduction system, with consequent increased inotropy, increased automaticity, and reduced conduction velocity
indirectly causes parasympathetic stimulation of the autonomic nervous system, with consequent effects on the sino-atrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) nodes
reduces catecholamine reuptake at nerve terminals, rendering blood vessels more sensitive to endogenous or exogenous catecholamines
increases baroreceptor sensitization, with consequent increased carotid sinus nerve activity and enhanced sympathetic withdrawal for any given increment in mean arterial pressure
increases (at higher concentrations) sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system (CNS) to both cardiac and peripheral sympathetic nerves
allows (at higher concentrations) progressive efflux of intracellular potassium, with consequent increase in serum potassium levels.

The cardiologic consequences of these direct and indirect effects are an increase in the force and velocity of myocardial systolic contraction (positive inotropic action), a slowing of the heart rate (negative chronotropic effect), decreased conduction velocity through the AV node, and a decrease in the degree of activation of the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin system (neurohormonal deactivating effect).

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Digitalis glycosides — mechanism and clinical effects summarize that the digitalis glycosides exert their effects in patients with HF by virtue of their ability to inhibit sodium-potassium (Na+-K+) adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), and although a variety of digitalis glycosides have been used in the treatment of HF for the last 200 years, the most commonly used preparation in the United States is digoxin. Several placebo-controlled trials have shown that treatment with digoxin for 1 to 3 months can improve symptoms, quality of life, and exercise tolerance in patients with mild to moderate HF, and these benefits have been seen regardless of the underlying rhythm, cause of HF, or concomitant therapy. In a long-term trial, treatment with digoxin for 2 to 5 years had no effect on mortality but modestly reduced the combined risk of death and hospitalization.

### The use of digoxin in patients with worsening chronic heart failure: reconsidering an old drug to reduce hospital admissions [^111WmPCn]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Digoxin is the oldest cardiac drug still in contemporary use, yet its role in the management of patients with heart failure (HF) remains controversial. A purified cardiac glycoside derived from the foxglove plant, digoxin increases ejection fraction, augments cardiac output, and reduces pulmonary capillary wedge pressure without causing deleterious increases in heart rate or decreases in blood pressure. Moreover, it is also a neurohormonal modulator at low doses. In the pivotal DIG (Digitalis Investigation Group) trial, digoxin therapy was shown to reduce all-cause and HF-specific hospitalizations but had no effect on survival. With the discovery of neurohormonal blockers capable of reducing mortality in HF with reduced ejection fraction, the results of the DIG trial were viewed as neutral, and the use of digoxin declined precipitously. Although modern drug and device-based therapies have dramatically improved the survival of ambulatory patients with HF, outcomes for patients with worsening chronic HF, defined as deteriorating signs and symptoms on standard therapy often leading to unscheduled clinic or emergency department visits or hospitalization, have largely remained unchanged over the past 2 decades. The available data suggest that a therapeutic trial of digoxin may be appropriate in patients with worsening chronic heart failure who remain symptomatic.

### Heart failure [^111ErPmn]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure occurs in 3–4% of adults aged over 65 years, usually as a consequence of coronary artery disease or hypertension, and causes breathlessness, effort intolerance, fluid retention, and increased mortality. The 5-year mortality in people with systolic heart failure ranges from 25–75%, often due to sudden death following ventricular arrhythmia. Risks of cardiovascular events are increased in people with LVSD or heart failure.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of non-drug treatments, and of drug and invasive treatments for heart failure? What are the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in people at high risk of heart failure? What are the effects of treatments for diastolic heart failure? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to January 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 72 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: amiodarone, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, anticoagulation, antiplatelet agents, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, cardiac resynchronisation therapy, digoxin (in people already receiving diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), eplerenone, exercise, implantable cardiac defibrillators, multidisciplinary interventions, non-amiodarone antiarrhythmic drugs, positive inotropes (other than digoxin), and spironolactone.
