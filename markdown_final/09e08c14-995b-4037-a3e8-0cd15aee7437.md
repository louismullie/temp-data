## Question

Neurogenic cough

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about diagnosing and managing neurogenic cough. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about establishing a definition and conceptual framework. Then, I should verify the epidemiology and risk factors. Next, I will examine the clinical phenotype and supportive diagnostic clues. After that, I must review the diagnostic workup and how to exclude common causes. Then, I will appraise pharmacologic therapies, speech pathology, and procedural options, including the evidence strength and where it is weak. Finally, I should integrate guideline-aligned sequencing, follow-up metrics, and a pragmatic decision pathway with acknowledgment of controversies and knowledge gaps, while double-checking any assumptions that might be overstatements and correcting them explicitly.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiologic framework so I don't anchor prematurely. Neurogenic cough is best conceptualized as a chronic cough driven by sensory neuropathy of the upper airway afferents, typically idiopathic but sometimes postviral, characterized by laryngeal paresthesia and cough triggered by innocuous stimuli, aligning with the broader construct of cough hypersensitivity syndrome and a diagnosis of exclusion once common causes are addressed or ruled out [^111iNfDa] [^1168c9SX] [^113JQPJr].

> I should double-check prevalence and epidemiology to avoid overgeneralization. Wait, let me verify the often-cited "11% of Americans" figure. It appears in a 2022 systematic review, but I need to be cautious because estimates vary by population and setting, with refractory or unexplained chronic cough generally estimated around 4–10% globally, so the 11% estimate likely reflects a specific cohort and should be framed as a conservative upper bound rather than a universal prevalence [^112ycEsW] [^11479PFD]. I should also confirm the demographic signal of female predominance and middle-aged onset that consistently emerges in cough clinic cohorts, which supports clinical vigilance in that group while recognizing it is not exclusive [^11479PFD] [^117CL7RD].

> Next, I will characterize the clinical phenotype and look for features that raise suspicion of neurogenic cough. Patients typically report a dry, laryngeal-localized cough with a premonitory tickle or itch, allotussia to talking, laughing, or temperature changes, and hypertussia to tussive agents, alongside associated laryngeal symptoms such as globus or dysphonia. I should confirm that laryngoscopy may reveal subtle vocal fold motion asymmetry or adductor paresis, which, while not diagnostic, correlate with a sensory neuropathy and can enrich pretest probability and prognostication for neuromodulator response [^111iNfDa] [^1168c9SX] [^116Vdf7K].

> Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic workup sequence to ensure we truly exclude common causes before labeling the cough as neurogenic. A guideline-concordant approach includes history, exam, chest radiograph, spirometry, and targeted empiric trials for upper airway cough syndrome, asthma or eosinophilic bronchitis, and reflux when indicated; importantly, empiric high-dose PPI monotherapy for presumed reflux without classic symptoms has not improved cough quality of life in trials, so I need to avoid reflex PPI escalation without supportive features and consider objective reflux testing if symptoms persist despite reasonable trials [^113jzXcQ] [^112jkGbt] [^114vDBiZ]. Let me also remember that neurogenic cough is a diagnosis of exclusion, so I should confirm that an adequate, guideline-based evaluation has been completed before assigning the label, ideally with follow-up reassessment within 4–6 weeks to verify trajectory and treatment fidelity [^113JQPJr] [^11552WaB].

> Now, I will examine pharmacologic therapies and their evidentiary footing. I need to ensure I differentiate between higher-certainty RCT evidence and lower-certainty observational data. For gabapentin, there are randomized trials showing improvement in cough-specific quality of life and symptom burden in unexplained or refractory chronic cough, and observational data suggest higher response when vocal fold motion asymmetry is present, though I should note that the best evidence comes from the UCC/RCC literature rather than exclusively "neurogenic" cohorts; pregabalin has supportive retrospective series and is mechanistically plausible but lacks high-quality RCTs; amitriptyline has historical prospective data with notable symptom reductions in idiopathic cough cohorts, albeit with small samples and low-level evidence; tramadol has only a small uncontrolled series suggesting benefit and should be reserved for select, refractory cases given misuse risk; and morphine has RCT signals in UCC/RCC but with sedation and constipation trade-offs requiring careful selection and consent [^112GA35u] [^112jkGbt] [^116Vdf7K] [^1168c9SX] [^112rvPji] [^116YNHKH]. I should also confirm emerging targeted therapies: gefapixant, a P2X3 antagonist, has regulatory approval in several regions and reduces cough frequency in trials, and camlipixant has promising phase 2b results; however, availability and payer coverage vary, and patient selection should be individualized [^112GA35u] [^11479PFD].

> Next, I should review nonpharmacologic interventions, especially speech pathology, and ensure I cite the right guideline touchpoints. Speech pathology–based cough suppression therapy has consistent benefits across studies and is recommended by CHEST for difficult-to-treat cough; techniques adapted from hyperfunctional voice disorders can reduce cough frequency and improve quality of life, and combining speech therapy with neuromodulators is a common strategy in refractory cases, although I need to confirm local expertise and access before prescribing this path [^117TZ2n7] [^112jkGbt] [^117SkAoc]. Wait, let me verify the comparative data for combined modalities; a systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that while both medical and speech therapies improve outcomes, direct head-to-head comparisons are limited, so shared decision-making and sequencing based on patient preference and tolerability are prudent [^112ycEsW].

> I will now examine procedural options, but I should be careful not to overstate indications. Superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) block with steroid and local anesthetic has growing evidence, including a placebo-controlled trial showing significant improvement in cough quality of life, and observational series suggesting enhanced response in patients with vocal fold abnormalities; botulinum toxin injection to the thyroarytenoid muscle has supportive retrospective data in refractory cases but remains lower-certainty and best reserved for patients failing or intolerant to medical therapy, ideally in centers with laryngology expertise [^116SsKC4] [^113QAYc6] [^113JQPJr]. But wait, what if systemic steroids help via a neuroinflammatory mechanism? An intramuscular steroid trial is underway; while mechanistically plausible and related to hypotheses about glial-neuroimmune pathways, I should not jump to conclusions until results are available, so I will mention it as investigational rather than standard care [^111CZkCU].

> Let me consider a stepwise, treatable-trait–informed algorithm so the care pathway is practical. Initially, I should confirm duration, screen for red flags, and address the big three drivers of chronic cough: upper airway cough syndrome, asthma or eosinophilic bronchitis, and reflux, tailoring trials and diagnostics to pretest probability and patient comorbidities. If cough persists beyond a reasonable window, I should escalate to a neurogenic framework with a trial of a neuromodulator such as gabapentin and referral for speech pathology, using validated outcomes like the Leicester Cough Questionnaire and Cough Severity Index to track response. If response is partial or absent, I should consider SLN block or botulinum toxin in experienced hands, and throughout I should maintain 4–6 week reassessments to verify fidelity and adjust the plan [^117TZ2n7] [^113JQPJr] [^113RoK2m]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines also discourage open-ended empiricism; yes, structured algorithms with defined endpoints and follow-up are preferred to optimize outcomes and minimize therapeutic drift [^11552WaB].

> I should double-check adjunctive measures and potential pitfalls so I don't overlook simple wins. Trigger reduction strategies, including laryngopharyngeal reflux dietary modifications and nasal hygiene for upper airway drivers, may reduce irritant load and improve symptoms in selected patients and can be trialed before or alongside neuromodulators; however, evidence quality is low and responses are heterogeneous, so I will frame these as optional, time-limited trials with measurable outcomes rather than substitutes for guideline-based therapy [^111eUxVN]. I also need to ensure medication contributors such as ACE inhibitors are not overlooked and to consider that sitagliptin has been associated with cough in case reports, so a careful medication reconciliation with deprescribing trials is essential before concluding refractoriness [^114vDBiZ].

> But wait, what about prognosis and natural history; I should confirm what we can and cannot claim. Neurogenic cough is typically chronic and can persist for months to years without targeted therapy, yet response rates to multimodal treatment are meaningful, with a recent cohort showing approximately three-quarters of patients improving and about one-tenth achieving complete resolution, underscoring the value of persistence and stepwise escalation rather than premature abandonment of therapy [^113JQPJr]. I need to ensure I set expectations realistically: most patients improve but not all resolve, and central sensitization features may persist even after peripheral triggers are addressed, which aligns with the chronic pain–like model of cough hypersensitivity [^111iNfDa] [^115pU6u8].

> Finally, I should review controversies and knowledge gaps so we communicate uncertainty transparently. There are no universally accepted diagnostic criteria for neurogenic cough, no validated biomarkers to confirm sensory neuropathy, and much of the interventional evidence base consists of small studies or observational designs. Heterogeneity of definitions and outcome measures further complicate comparisons, and the optimal sequencing of neuromodulators, speech therapy, and procedures remains unsettled, reinforcing the need for shared decision-making, careful documentation of response, and participation in registries or trials when available [^112ycEsW] [^112Gh2KE] [^111dxFS9]. Let me reconsider any overstatements: while the mechanistic rationale for neuropathic cough is compelling, causality is not fully established in all patients, and a subset may have overlapping drivers that respond to multimodal therapy rather than a single dominant pathway, which argues for iterative, measurable trials rather than a one-size-fits-all approach [^111iNfDa] [^115pU6u8].

Neurogenic cough is a **chronic cough > 8 weeks** driven by sensory neuropathy of the laryngopharynx, most often idiopathic or post-viral [^115SqsSG], and is diagnosed by exclusion after ruling out asthma, GERD, upper airway cough syndrome, and medication effects [^113JQPJr]. It presents with a dry, paroxysmal cough triggered by innocuous stimuli (talking, laughing, cold air, odors) and often a throat tickle or globus sensation [^115pU6u8] [^1111HSro]. First-line treatment is **neuromodulators** (gabapentin, pregabalin, amitriptyline) [^117TZ2n7] with speech therapy; refractory cases may benefit from superior laryngeal nerve block or botulinum toxin injection [^116SsKC4] [^112ycEsW]. Emerging therapies include P2X3 antagonists (gefapixant) [^112GA35u] and other targeted agents [^117446YZ]. Prognosis is variable: many improve with therapy, but some have persistent symptoms and quality-of-life impairment [^113JQPJr] [^115pU6u8].

---

## Pathophysiology

Neurogenic cough reflects **sensory neuropathy** of the laryngopharynx, often idiopathic or post-viral, causing peripheral sensitization and central amplification of the cough reflex [^1168c9SX] [^115SqsSG]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Peripheral sensitization**: Increased excitability of airway sensory nerves (C-fibers, Aδ fibers) after inflammation or injury, lowering cough thresholds [^111iNfDa] [^115JtTy3].

- **Central sensitization**: Heightened brainstem and cortical responsiveness, with abnormal urge-to-cough and impaired suppression [^1111HSro] [^113wQAYy].

- **Neuroplasticity**: Increased nerve density and branching in airway epithelium, contributing to hyperexcitability [^1113eBey].

---

## Clinical presentation

Neurogenic cough has a characteristic **clinical profile**:

| **Feature** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Cough duration | Chronic (> 8 weeks) [^114z828C] |
| Cough quality | Dry, paroxysmal, often triggered by innocuous stimuli (talking, laughing, cold air, odors) [^1113eBey] |
| Sensory symptoms | Throat tickle, itch, globus sensation [^1111HSro] |
| Laryngoscopic findings | Often normal; may show subtle vocal fold motion asymmetry or adductor paresis [^116Vdf7K] |
| Comorbidities | Common: reflux, anxiety, depression, paradoxical vocal fold motion [^115pU6u8] |

---

## Diagnostic criteria and evaluation

Neurogenic cough is a **diagnosis of exclusion**, requiring:

- **Comprehensive history**: Onset, triggers, associated symptoms, medication use, comorbidities [^113jzXcQ].

- **Physical examination**: ENT exam, laryngoscopy, respiratory exam [^1168c9SX].

- **Pulmonary function tests**: Spirometry, FeNO, methacholine challenge if indicated [^notfound].

- **Imaging**: Chest radiograph, sinus CT if indicated [^112EoMEf].

- **Empiric trials**: Reflux therapy, asthma treatment, upper airway management [^112TQUjk].

- **Exclusion of other causes**: Asthma, GERD, upper airway cough syndrome, medication-induced cough (e.g. ACE inhibitors) [^113jzXcQ].

---

## Treatment strategies

### Pharmacological interventions

Pharmacologic therapy is **first-line**, with neuromodulators as the cornerstone [^112GA35u]:

- **Gabapentin**: RCTs show significant improvement in cough severity and quality of life; start 100–300 mg at bedtime, titrate to 900–1800 mg/day [^112jkGbt].

- **Pregabalin**: Alternative neuromodulator; 50–75 mg twice daily, titrate to 150–300 mg/day [^1168c9SX].

- **Amitriptyline**: Tricyclic antidepressant; 10–25 mg at bedtime, titrate to 50–75 mg/day [^112rvPji].

- **Botulinum toxin**: Intralaryngeal injection for refractory cases; 70–80% response in small series [^113JQPJr].

---

### Non-pharmacological interventions

Speech therapy with **cough suppression** techniques and laryngeal retraining significantly improves symptoms and quality of life [^112jkGbt]. Superior laryngeal nerve block with steroid and local anesthetic is effective in refractory cases [^116SsKC4] [^113QAYc6].

---

## Emerging therapies

Several **targeted therapies** are under investigation:

- **P2X3 receptor antagonists**: Gefapixant (approved in EU, UK, Japan) reduces cough frequency; camlipixant in phase 3 trials [^112GA35u].

- **TRPV1 antagonists**: Mixed results; reduce cough reflex sensitivity but limited clinical impact [^113ikaBP].

- **NK1 receptor antagonists**: Orvepitant in phase 2 trials [^notfound].

- **Voltage-gated sodium channel blockers**: Ralfinamide in development [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and quality of life

Neurogenic cough significantly impairs **quality of life**, causing sleep disturbance, social isolation, anxiety, depression, and physical complications (rib fractures, incontinence) [^112ycEsW]. Prognosis is variable: many improve with neuromodulators and speech therapy, but some have persistent symptoms requiring multimodal or procedural therapy [^113JQPJr].

---

## Current research and future directions

Current research focuses on **personalized medicine** via endotype stratification and biomarker development, and on advancing neuromodulator trials with larger RCTs and longer follow-up [^1132ANRb] [^112jkGbt]. Additional priorities include exploring central mechanisms with neuroimaging and developing novel targets such as glial modulators and neuropeptide antagonists [^116cegH9] [^111CZkCU] [^114sAqQr].

---

Neurogenic cough is a chronic cough driven by laryngopharyngeal sensory neuropathy, diagnosed by exclusion and managed with neuromodulators, speech therapy, and procedural options; emerging therapies like P2X3 antagonists offer promise, but **individualized, multimodal care** remains essential [^111iNfDa] [^112GA35u].

### Anatomy and neurophysiology of the cough reflex: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^112srRRm]. Chest (2006). Medium credibility.

Clinical perspective — clinical cough is a reflex event beginning with activation of vagal afferent sensory nerves located in pulmonary and extrapulmonary sites that project the signal centrally, where it undergoes modulation, resulting in the generation of the appropriate efferent motor response. This concept of distinct afferent sites has provided the rationale for use of the anatomic diagnostic protocol to evaluate and manage patients with cough, and this approach has become embedded in clinical practice, leading to a broad recognition that asthma, GERD, and upper airways disease are, at least in adult patients, the most common causes of chronic cough; adequate treatment of one or more of these causes is effective in the majority, although a significant minority remains troubled with unexplained, refractory chronic cough despite extensive investigation and trials of therapy. The most sensitive regions of the airways for mechanically eliciting cough are the larynx and the tracheal and bronchial bifurcations.

### Branching out in chronic cough: evidence for increased airway nerve density [^1113eBey]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic cough is believed to affect up to 12% of the general population and most commonly occurs as a consequence of cigarette smoking and chronic respiratory diseases (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and bronchiectasis). In patients presenting to specialist cough clinics, the cause is often less obvious, and the cough is more likely to be associated with nasal disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, or asthma. In some patients, the chronic cough may not improve with the treatment of these conditions and is termed "refractory" or if no cause can be identified, "unexplained". Patients attending cough clinics mainly describe a dry/minimally productive cough triggered by trivial exposures to innocuous stimuli such as changes in temperature, environmental irritants (e.g. perfumes and cleaning products) and use of their voice. Coughing occurs typically hundreds of times per day and has significant quality of life impacts, especially if treatment of associated conditions is not beneficial. Currently there are no licensed therapies for chronic cough, and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In recent years, it has become increasingly accepted that a hyperexcitability of the neuronal pathways controlling cough is likely to be a fundamental component of the pathophysiology. Indeed, heightened cough reflex responses have been demonstrated in patients with chronic cough in studies experimentally evoking cough. However, the precise nature of this hyperexcitability remains unclear, and the extent to which this may reflect changes in activation/function of the airway nerves responsible for initiating cough and/or their connections in the central nervous system is unknown.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114TdJrD]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Guideline scope and evidence strength note that, compared to the 2006 guideline, there is now high-quality evidence for some aspects of managing chronic cough in children, reflected in Grades within each recommendation, and that 16 recommendations are Grade 1. The report states the general guideline does not substitute for sound clinical judgement, requires appropriate adaptations in population settings where disease patterns are different, and is not intended to be used as a definitive protocol for the management of all children with a coughing illness.

### Cough in children: when does it matter? [^114m8yE5]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Cough is a common presenting symptom to paediatricians and paediatric respiratory physicians. The causes of chronic cough in childhood are significantly different from those in adults, and a different approach to diagnosis and management is needed. In most cases cause can be identified or a satisfactory label given. This review will cover the approach to cough in children and cover some specific causes of troublesome cough not discussed elsewhere in this mini-symposium.

### Managing cough in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^115GHtNs]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

In many studies, more than one-half of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) endorse cough. In IPF (as in other conditions), when chronic, cough may be frustrating and lead to significant impairments in quality of life. In patients with IPF, comorbid conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux can cause or contribute to cough; when stemming from IPF itself, chronic cough likely arises from multiple mechanisms including mechanical and neurosensory changes. In this article, we review our approach at attempting to identify causes of chronic cough in patients with IPF; these include gastroesophageal reflux disease or upper airway cough syndrome and IPF itself. We cursorily summarize the current evidence for the treatment of chronic cough in IPF, briefly review data on the treatment of unexplained chronic cough and extrapolate it to the treatment of refractory cough in IPF, but we focus our attention on our approaches to evaluation and management, recognizing that some may not be supported by a robust cache of data.

### What is chronic cough? Terminology [^117EKXxC]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Terminology used to define clinical cough is based on features such as duration, underlying causes, and associated characteristics such as whether the cough is "dry" or "productive". Terms such as "refractory chronic cough", "unexplained chronic cough", and "idiopathic cough" are commonly used to describe a cough that persists despite extensive investigation and therapeutic trials. The use of these terms, sometimes interchangeably, has led to a degree of confusion and with the emergence of the new clinical and mechanisitic concept associated with cough, "cough hypersensitivity syndrome", there is a need for some clarity in the nomenclature used to describe this condition.

### Treatment of unexplained chronic cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111dxFS9]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Chronic cough registries — registries for unexplained chronic cough (UCC) could be used to document patient characteristics and outcomes, serve as a source of research participants, and allow phenotyping by age, sex, cough duration, cough severity, and cough reflex sensitivity (C2 and C5); registries can also be used for genetic studies, and the panel members were aware of several completed clinical trials with memantine, theobromine, P2X3 antagonists, pregabalin, and physiotherapy and speech and language therapy intervention.

### Cough. 1: chronic cough in adults [^111nhwuv]. Thorax (2003). Low credibility.

The investigation and treatment of chronic cough in adults is generally rewarding, provided there is an understanding of its aetiology, particularly when it arises from sites outside the respiratory tract.

### Trigger reduction prior to systemic drugs for neurogenic chronic cough [^111eUxVN]. The Laryngoscope (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective/Hypothesis

Neurogenic chronic cough typically presents as a postviral chronic cough, often with paroxysms of coughing preceded by a tickle sensation with multiple triggers and often recalcitrant to multiple treatments for reflux disease, sinus disease, and asthma. Current treatment uses neuromodulating agents with moderate success. Post nasal drainage and laryngopharyngeal reflux can be triggers in the setting of laryngopharyngeal hypersensitivity. Treatment will focus on trigger reduction using nasal toilet and a dietary regimen for laryngopharyngeal reflux.

Study Design

Systematic review of retrospective cohort studies METHODS: One-year retrospective review of new patients with cough (R05.0) excluding asthma, proton pump inhibitor response, and sinus or pulmonary disease. Cough severity index (CSI) and reflux symptom index (RSI) were evaluated initially and 6 weeks after trigger-reduction treatment using nasal saline irrigation, nasal steroids, nasal antihistamines, and a plant-based diet with alkaline water.

Results

Of 119 patients, 29 met the criteria. Using the six-point reduction (improvement) in RSI as an accepted response, 20 of 29 patients (68.9%, P = 0.0014) experienced a clinical response. Using reduction in RSI and CSI as a continuous variable to assess response, patients experienced a 10 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.75–13.2) and 10.9 (95% CI: 7.4–14.3) mean point reduction, respectively. The mean percent reduction in RSI following 6 weeks of treatment was 54.7% (95% CI: 41.5–68.0; p = 0.0001). These patients experienced a 59.8% (95% CI: 43.4–76.2; p = 0.0001) reduction in CSI.

Conclusions

A trigger-reduction approach using nasal toilet and a plant-based diet in patients with neurogenic chronic cough prior to the initiation of systemic neuromodulating medications should be considered.

### Overview of the management of cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116yimQc]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

CHEST cough guideline methodology and scope — the Expert Panel unanimously decided to cover the same comprehensive spectrum of topics, in a different order, using more rigorous evidence-based methodologies; the CHEST organization's Guidelines Oversight Committee approved a hybrid model that provides a combination of recommendations derived from clinical practice guideline methodology and suggestions derived from consensus statement methodology (including a modified Delphi process); CHEST has implemented a "living guidelines" model whereby topics are reviewed for possible updating on an annual basis, updates are added as soon as finalized, and the full scope of topics will appear over a 4-year period; in addition, the current set of topics focuses on the concept of intervention fidelity.

### Classification of cough as a symptom in adults and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116g381C]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

CHEST guideline — acute cough evidence base included only three studies meeting quality assessment, all with a high risk of bias; all were prospective with no harms reported, and none had a control group or used a validated outcome tool for cough assessment; two studies defined acute cough as < 3 weeks and the third as no more than 28 days; all the subjects (N = 308) sought medical attention for complaints of cough < 3 weeks' duration; the most common causes were respiratory infections, most likely of viral cause.

### Anatomy and neurophysiology of the cough reflex: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^115JtTy3]. Chest (2006). Medium credibility.

Anatomy and Neurophysiology of Cough — CHEST Guideline and Expert Panel Report explains that bronchopulmonary C-fibers and a subset of mechanically sensitive, acid-sensitive myelinated sensory nerves play essential roles in regulating cough, and these vagal sensory nerves terminate primarily in the larynx, trachea, carina, and large intrapulmonary bronchi; other bronchopulmonary sensory nerves, sensory nerves innervating other viscera, as well as somatosensory nerves innervating the chest wall, diaphragm, and abdominal musculature regulate cough patterning and cough sensitivity. The brainstem and higher brain control systems that process this sensory information are complex, but our current understanding of them is considerable and increasing, and the relevance of these neural systems to clinical phenomena, such as urge to cough and psychologic methods for treatment of dystussia, is high, with modern imaging methods having revealed potential neural substrates for some features of cough in the human. Cough preserves the gas-exchanging functions of the lung by facilitating clearance of aspirate, inhaled particulate matter, accumulated secretions, and irritants that are either inhaled or formed at sites of mucosal inflammation, and an impaired cough reflex can have acute, dire consequences. Under normal conditions, therefore, cough serves an important protective role in the airways and lungs; however, cough is also a mechanism for the spread of life-threatening respiratory tract infections.

### Efficacy of intramuscular steroid injection for chronic cough… [^111CZkCU]. ClinicalTrials (2024). Medium credibility.

Efficacy of Intramuscular Steroid Injection for Chronic Cough. ClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview. A significant subset of patients are found to have "unexplained chronic cough", which is a diagnosis of exclusion. For these patients, the etiology of the cough is often not isolated. However, the cause is thought to be related to hypersensitivity and inflammation of both the nerves involved in cough sensation and/or mucosa of the larynx. A similar theory described by Driessen et al. hypothesizes that neuroinflammation related to glial cells in central and peripheral neural pathways may contribute to chronic cough in a similar way to how chronic pain is mediated by this pathway. Glial cells in the central and peripheral nervous system may be an important target for steroid hormones and their metabolites, which may have impact on inflammation and excitatory action.

Superior laryngeal nerve injections have been well studied in literature and were recently studied here at the Medical University of South Carolina in a prospective placebo-controlled trial for use in neurogenic cough. This study showed that there was a significant improvement in cough compared to placebo. This study was completed using randomization of 17 patients into the control and steroid/lidocaine injection groups. The hypothesis revolves around the idea that SLN blocks may actually work systemically, so the site of injection may not be the key in cough improvement. This combined with the theory on glial cell involvement and systemic steroid use to inhibit the neuroinflammatory pathway leads us to believe that intramuscular steroid injections could improve chronic cough. Therefore, this study focuses on the use of systemic intramuscular steroids in patients with chronic cough and we hypothesize that patients will have improvement in cough severity.

By opening another treatment option that could be utilized by general otolaryngologists, access to care and treatment may be improved for patients with chronic cough. Drug: Triamcinolone Acetonide Injectable Suspension Drug: Saline injection

### The clinical approach to chronic cough [^112GA35u]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic cough remains a significant clinical challenge, affecting approximately 10% of the population and leading to significant impairment in psychological, social, and physical quality of life. In recent years, efforts have intensified to elucidate the mechanisms underlying chronic cough and to focus on investigating and treating refractory chronic cough (RCC). A "treatable trait" approach, which focuses on identifying and addressing the specific associated causes of chronic cough, has gained traction. In some patients, RCC is likely driven by a neuropathic mechanism due to dysregulation of the neuronal pathways involved in the cough reflex, often clinically described as cough hypersensitivity syndrome. Although the initial treatment of underlying conditions remains central to managing treatable traits, the therapeutic options for RCC have expanded to include targeting cough hypersensitivity. First-line treatments now include neuromodulators and speech therapy with one P2X3 receptor antagonist (gefapixant) recently licensed in the European Union, United Kingdom, and Japan. Despite these advances, patient responses remain variable, underscoring the ongoing need for research into the pathophysiology and treatment of RCC. This article reviews current investigations and management options in treating chronic cough and RCC.

### Management of cough [^117SkAoc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

People with chronic cough can experience significant quality-of-life impairment. New concepts based around cough reflex hypersensitivity are leading to improved management strategies and showing promise in relieving the distress from persistent cough. The clinical cough assessment seeks to classify patients on the basis of symptom duration, and to identify and manage exposures and diseases that activate the afferent limb of the cough reflex. Cough hypersensitivity is also addressed by managing laryngeal dysfunction with speech pathology therapy and managing central cough reflex sensitization with neuromodulators. There are prospects for novel therapies based around several new treatment targets.

### Overview of the management of cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114tMyKL]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

CHEST (American College of Chest Physicians) guideline overview — cough pathophysiology, measurement, and clinical significance are summarized as follows: Cough arises following activation of a complex sensorimotor reflex arc, and its distinctive sound is generated by the explosive release of trapped and pressurized intrathoracic air from the sudden opening of the vocal folds. Because cough is an easily described and recognizable physical act, patient surveys on the prevalence of cough have credibility, enabling development of cough-specific, patient-reported outcome tools by which physicians can assess the impact of cough on patients. Because the sound resulting from coughing has a typical acoustic waveform profile, software detection algorithms for automatic monitoring have been developed for cough counting. While cough in healthy individuals is physiologically important, it typically is of little clinical importance because it is normally a very uncommon event, yet it assumes importance as a defense mechanism when it helps clear excessive secretions and foreign material from the airways and as a factor in the spread of infection. The report states that cough is a common and potentially expensive health-care problem and that the panel's purpose is to synthesize current knowledge to aid clinical decision-making for the diagnosis and management of cough across disciplines and to identify gaps in knowledge and treatment options.

### Mechanisms and rationale for targeted therapies in refractory and unexplained chronic cough [^1111HSro]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Pathologic cough responses

Chronic cough is thought to arise from dysregulation of the vagal sensory nerves that mediate cough. The causative factors that contribute to this dysregulation are the subject of intense investigation and could include both pathologic processes and genetic risk factors. Here, we focus our discussion on the pathologic processes as the potential roles of genetic factors that may influence this dysregulation are not currently well understood and are considered outside the scope of the current review.

The clinical characteristics of patients with CC have been previously described. Many patients with CC may exhibit features of hypersensitivity that are analogous to mechanisms that underly chronic pain. 17, 24, 27 For example, many patients with CC exhibit laryngeal paresthesia, often reported as an abnormal sensation or irritability in the throat. 27, 28, 29 Hypertussivity, which could be analogous to hyperalgesia, is characterized by stronger cough reactions in response to tussive agents. 24, 27 Allotussia occurs when low‐level stimuli that do not usually evoke cough (e.g. talking, singing, and laughing) lead to a strong urge to cough, a feature similar to allodynia. 27, 28, 29 Such features are sufficiently typical in CC that the term "cough hypersensitivity syndrome" has been endorsed to describe this condition. 24

Multiple interrelated mechanisms have been hypothesized to contribute to cough hypersensitivity syndrome, although direct evidence for neural dysfunction in humans is currently limited. 24, 29 These mechanisms include increased activation or excitability of sensory neurons to chemical stimulation in the periphery or the heighted responsivity of CNS cough networks to peripheral inputs, respectively termed peripheral and central sensitization. The current state‐of‐the art mechanistic understanding of these two processes are described below.

### Global physiology and pathophysiology of Cough: part 2. demographic and clinical considerations: CHEST expert panel report [^1148Zbhq]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Cough characteristics vary between patients, and this can impact clinical diagnosis and care. The purpose of part two of this state-of-the-art review is to update the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) 2006 guideline on global physiology and pathophysiology of cough.

Study Design and Methods

A review of the literature was conducted using PubMed and MEDLINE databases from 1951 to 2019 using prespecified search terms.

Results

We describe the demographics of typical patients with cough in the clinical setting, including how cough characteristics change across age. We summarize the effect of common clinical conditions impacting cough mechanics and the physical properties of mucus on airway clearance.

Interpretation

This is the second of a two-part update to the 2006 CHEST cough guideline; it complements part one on basic phenomenology of cough by providing an extended clinical picture of cough along with the factors that alter cough mechanics and efficiency in patients. A greater understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of cough will improve clinical management.

### Global physiology and pathophysiology of cough: part 1: cough phenomenology-CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^117CL7RD]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Cough physiology and pathophysiology — conclusions emphasize that chronic cough is more often encountered as a clinical problem in older women and that physicians should recognize comorbidities when managing troublesome cough. Conditions associated with impairment in the nervous or muscular systems may contribute to deficits in cough mechanics, the consequences of which in some cases can be predicted by assessing cough peak flow (CPF) and other measures, and airway secretion properties may impact cough efficiency. Respiratory maneuvers and devices can augment CPF, whereas medications can modify the physical properties of secretions, and these approaches may be of particular help with cough efficiency in some patients, especially with neuromuscular weakness or with difficulty in sputum expectoration. Cough testing approaches vary greatly in the type of cough measured and reported measures, with most studies reporting CPF only, and in populations with ineffective cough there is reduced cough output as opposed to the hypersensitive, increased output seen with chronic cough. The focus with these populations is evaluating the ability to effectively clear the airways, there is critical need to develop therapeutic techniques with this goal, yet despite many airway clearance devices and medications there are few well-controlled randomized controlled trials evaluating their safety and effectiveness, and the design and delivery of such trials remain a priority. A heightened cough reflex sensitivity in women is widely reported but poorly understood, and creating normative values and a standardized methodology for CPF and other clinically meaningful cough metrics represent important knowledge gaps.

### Leukotriene receptor antagonist for prolonged non-specific cough in children [^115Xm6ar]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Non-specific cough is defined as non-productive cough in the absence of identifiable respiratory disease or known aetiology. It is commonly seen in paediatric practice. These children are treated with a variety of therapies including a variety of asthma medications. The leukotriene pathway is reported to be involved in the sensory (neurogenic) pathway, which is a mechanism thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic cough.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) in treating children with prolonged non-specific cough.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched by the Cochrane Airways Group. The latest searches were carried out in September 2005.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials comparing LTRA with a placebo medication in children with non-specific cough.

Data Collection and Analysis

Results of searches were reviewed against pre-determined criteria for inclusion. One eligible trial was identified but no data was available for analysis. It was not possible to separate results from children with non-specific cough from those without.

Main Results

There was no significant difference in all study endpoints between the montelukast and placebo groups (total N = 256).

Authors' Conclusions

With the lack of evidence, the routine use of LRTA in treating children with non-specific cough cannot be recommended.

Interstitial lung disease (ILD)-associated cough — conclusions state that cough associated with ILD can be due to underlying lung disease, and co-morbid conditions such as upper airway disease or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and in some patients it remains unexplained. The approach to managing ILD-associated cough needs to be individualized for the patient, and further clinical trials of neuromodulator therapies and speech pathology/physiotherapy-based cough suppression are needed.

### Mechanisms and rationale for targeted therapies in refractory and unexplained chronic cough [^113P5vYx]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

CC is a burdensome condition that is thought to be characterized by dysregulation of the vagal sensory neurons that mediate cough. Several molecular targets have been investigated on the basis of their potential roles in the underlying pathophysiology of RCC and UCC. Although results to date have varied between investigative approaches and there are currently no new approved treatments with indications for these conditions, promising results have been reported for some investigated pharmacologic treatments. Owing to the heterogeneity underlying chronic cough, it is likely that the best therapeutic approach will vary by patient and further multidisciplinary research is needed to establish the best treatment pathways for this patient population.

### COUGH… [^113ZapTk]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Cough may be either a voluntary or an involuntary act; perhaps most often it is an involuntary act reinforced by volition. Semicough, 1 commonly called "clearing the throat" and expressed in lay literature as "ahem, " is always voluntary, though nerve-cell habit may make it an almost subconscious act. It is only the involuntary cough of purely reflex character that will be considered here. The following brief and clear statement of the physiologic mechanism of cough by my colleague Prof. Albert P. Brubaker is authoritative: "The cause of the cough is an irritation in the area of distribution of the glossopharyngeal, the trigeminal and perhaps other sensory nerves as well. In the unconditioned or purely reflex cough, the local irritation develops nerve impulses which are transmitted by the vagus from the air passages". My colleague Dr. F. J. Kalteyer, in a personal communication, calls my attention to the fact that MacKenzie JACKSON C.

### Methodologies for the development of the management of cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^1131Cxg4]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

Background

This series of guidance documents on cough, which will be published over time, is a hybrid of two processes: (1) evidence-based guidelines and (2) trustworthy consensus statements based on a robust and transparent process.

Methods

The CHEST Guidelines Oversight Committee selected a nonconflicted Panel Chair and jointly assembled an international panel of experts in each clinical area with few, if any, conflicts of interest. PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcome)-based key questions and parameters of eligibility were developed for each clinical topic to inform the comprehensive literature search. Existing guidelines, systematic reviews, and primary studies were assessed for relevance and quality. Data elements were extracted into evidence tables and synthesized to provide summary statistics. These, in turn, are presented to support the evidence-based graded recommendations. A highly structured consensus-based Delphi approach was used to provide expert advice on all guidance statements. Transparency of process was documented.

Results

Evidence-based guideline recommendations and consensus-based suggestions were carefully crafted to provide direction to health-care providers and investigators who treat and/or study patients with cough. Manuscripts and tables summarize the evidence in each clinical area supporting the recommendations and suggestions.

Conclusions

The resulting guidance statements are based on a rigorous methodology and transparency of process. Unless otherwise stated, the recommendations and suggestions meet the guidelines for trustworthiness developed by the Institute of Medicine and can be applied with confidence by physicians, nurses, other health-care providers, investigators, and patients.

### Methodologies for the development of the management of cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^11781PdA]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

CHEST cough guideline development framework — living guidelines and evidence grading states that CHEST has embarked on a model of creating living guidelines to continually update recommendations as new evidence, pharmacotherapies, or medical technologies become available and now uses a more rigorous approach to grading evidence resulting in the downgrading of much of the cough research in some clinical areas. Where there are insufficient levels of evidence to create recommendations based on a systematic search of the literature, consensus suggestions are developed and revised using a modified Delphi approach, and CHEST's consensus-based approach combined with the evidence-based model results in a hybrid process supported by both evidence and expertise. The 2006 guidelines called for an empirical integrated approach to the diagnosis and management of cough, proposed future directions for research, and defined two new terminologies: upper airway cough syndrome and unexplained cough.

### Methodology and grading of the evidence for the diagnosis and management of cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116YQJ6G]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assemble a multidisciplinary, geographically diverse panel of experts in the diagnosis and treatment of cough with the intention of developing clinically relevant practice guidelines for pulmonary and primary care physicians, including recommendations covering many etiologies of cough, adult and pediatric evaluation and treatment, and empiric yet integrative algorithms for the management of the patient with cough.

Methods

The Duke University Center for Clinical Health Policy Research was selected to review and summarize the current evidence in this area. The expert panel established clinical recommendations and algorithms founded on the synthesis of this evidence.

Conclusions

This section describes the approach used to develop the guidelines, including identifying, evaluating, and synthesizing the evidence, assessing the strength of evidence pertinent to individual guidelines, and grading the guideline recommendations.

### Are otolaryngologists seeing more cough? Longitudinal trends and patterns [^113k94pJ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this study is the first to use a nationwide cohort database to quantify longitudinal trends of cough visits attributed to otolaryngologists and to investigate demographic factors that influence patients to consult surgical specialists, especially otolaryngologists, for cough. The study indicates an increase in the proportion of these visits to surgical specialists, especially otolaryngologists, between 2005 and 2019. Based on the sensitivity analysis of the multivariable model, Hispanic or Latino patients and patients living outside of metropolitan areas were less likely to see surgical specialists than primary care doctors for their cough. Patients who were referred and patients with chronic cough were more likely to access a surgical specialist.

The observed increase in cough‐related visits to surgical specialists, and specifically otolaryngologists, may be linked to greater recognition of various cough etiologies among both healthcare providers and patients. This increased awareness might be redirecting patients from primary care or internal medicine to otolaryngologists for what otolaryngologists can offer to patients that other specialists cannot, especially for patients with complex manifestations and etiologies of refractory chronic cough. Cough is a nonspecific symptom with numerous possible etiologies, including infectious, rhinologic, neurologic, allergic, esophageal, behavioral, and systemic conditions. Patients may seek otolaryngologic care for conditions or complaints not typically handled by primary care or internal medicine. This study also identified an upswing in the role of surgical specialists in cough management starting between 2012 and 2014, coinciding with the release of evidence‐based cough management guidelines like the 2006 American College of Chest Physicians and 2007 British Thorax Society guidelines, which recommend multidisciplinary care for cough. These guidelines propose a systematic approach to evaluating cough and recognize the value of multidisciplinary specialized cough clinics. The required changes in clinical practice likely contributed to the delay in their widespread adoption, a common trend with new guidelines.

### Cough hypersensitivity and chronic cough [^111iNfDa]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2022). High credibility.

Chronic cough is globally prevalent across all age groups. This disorder is challenging to treat because many pulmonary and extrapulmonary conditions can present with chronic cough, and cough can also be present without any identifiable underlying cause or be refractory to therapies that improve associated conditions. Most patients with chronic cough have cough hypersensitivity, which is characterized by increased neural responsivity to a range of stimuli that affect the airways and lungs, and other tissues innervated by common nerve supplies. Cough hypersensitivity presents as excessive coughing often in response to relatively innocuous stimuli, causing significant psychophysical morbidity and affecting patients' quality of life. Understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to cough hypersensitivity and excessive coughing in different patient populations and across the lifespan is advancing and has contributed to the development of new therapies for chronic cough in adults. Owing to differences in the pathology, the organs involved and individual patient factors, treatment of chronic cough is progressing towards a personalized approach, and, in the future, novel ways to endotype patients with cough may prove valuable in management.

### Outcomes of a step-up approach to the treatment of neurogenic cough [^113JQPJr]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neurogenic cough (NC) is thought to be related to sensory neuropathy in the hypopharynx and larynx. Defined as a cough persisting longer than 8 weeks refractory to standard therapy, it is a diagnosis of exclusion when other common etiologies (asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), medication side effects) are ruled out. It affects roughly 11% of Americans and can negatively impact quality of life.

Methods

Following institutional review board approval, we evaluated the medical records of adult patients seen at the University of Arizona's tertiary laryngology center from 2018 to 2023. Patients were included if their cough persisted for > 8 weeks, and they either did not respond to prior proton pump inhibitor and asthma therapy or had GERD and asthma ruled out. These patients underwent a progressive escalation of therapy, which included neuromodulators with or without cough suppression therapy, superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) block, and laryngeal botulinum toxin injections. The primary outcome was patient-reported improvement in cough symptoms rated on a 1–5 scale: 1 = no response, 2 = mild improvement, 3 = moderate improvement, 4 = significant improvement, 5 = complete resolution.

Results

A total of 56 patients were included. Mean (SD) age was 64.6 (14.8) years, and 66% were female. Overall, 42 patients (75.0%) responded to treatment. Among responders, 7 (16.7%) experienced mild improvement, 14 (33.3%) experienced moderate improvement, 17 (40.5%) experienced significant improvement, and 4 (9.5%) experienced complete resolution of their cough. 33 patients (58.9%) were managed exclusively with neuromodulators ± cough suppression therapy; 27 responded, with an average response rating of 3.0 (SD = 1.2). 11 patients (19.6%) failed medical therapy and underwent SLN block without subsequent botox treatment; 7 responded, with an average response rating of 2.5 (SD = 1.4). 9 patients (16.1%) failed all previous therapies and underwent laryngeal botulinum toxin injections; 6 responded with an average response rating of 2.4 (SD = 1.3). The remaining 3 patients underwent cough suppression therapy alone, with 2 responding and an average response rating of 3.3 (SD = 1.7).

Conclusions

Neurogenic cough can be effectively treated with a stepwise multimodal approach, including neuromodulators, cough suppression therapy, SLN block, and laryngeal botulinum toxin injections.

### Mechanisms and rationale for targeted therapies in refractory and unexplained chronic cough [^114sAqQr]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic cough, defined as a cough lasting > 8 weeks, is a common medical condition that exerts a substantial physical, mental, and social burden on patients. A subset of patients with chronic cough are troubled with a cough that persists despite optimal treatment of presumed associated common and uncommon conditions (refractory chronic cough; RCC) or in which no diagnosable cause for cough can be identified despite extensive assessment (unexplained chronic cough; UCC). Many of these patients exhibit clinical features of cough hypersensitivity, including laryngeal paresthesia, hypertussia, and allotussia. Over‐the‐counter cough remedies are ineffective and can lead to intolerable side effects when used for RCC/UCC, and the lack of approved treatments indicated for these conditions reflects a major unmet need. An increased understanding of the anatomy and neurophysiology of protective and pathologic cough has fostered a robust clinical development pipeline of several targeted therapies for RCC/UCC. This manuscript reviews the mechanisms presumed to underly RCC/UCC together with the rationale and clinical evidence for several targeted therapies currently under clinical investigation, including transient receptor potential channel antagonists, P2X3‐receptor antagonists, voltage‐gated sodium channel blockers, neuromodulators, and neurokinin‐1–receptor antagonists. Finally, we provide an overview of targets that have been investigated in preclinical models of cough and other airway diseases that may hold future promise for clinical studies in RCC/UCC. Development of targeted therapies with different sites of action may foster a precision medicine approach to treat this heterogeneous, underserved patient population.

### Unexplained cough in the adult [^114N3FZR]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Unexplained cough is a diagnosis of exclusion that should not be made until a thorough validated diagnostic evaluation is performed, specific and appropriate validated treatments have been tried and failed, and uncommon causes have been ruled out. When chronic cough remains troublesome after the initial work up, determine that a protocol has been used that has been shown to lead to successful results. If such a protocol has been used, next consider whether or not pitfalls in management have been avoided. If they have been, the frequency of truly unexplained chronic cough usually should not exceed 10%. While patients with truly unexplained coughs have an overly sensitive cough reflex, the mere presence of an overly sensitive cough reflex does not by itself explain why they do not get better, because most patients with chronic cough, even those who respond to treatment and get better, have demonstrable heightened cough sensitivity. Management options include referral to a cough clinic with interdisciplinary expertise, speech therapy, and self-limited trials of drugs, preferentially with those shown to be effective in randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trials in patients with unexplained chronic cough.

### Methods of cough assessment [^113RoK2m]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

The accurate and consistent assessment of cough is essential not only for optimum standards of clinical care but also to drive forward advances in our understanding of cough. A range of tools for the subjective and objective measurement of cough exists, and their ongoing development has coincided with growth in clinical and preclinical research in cough, resulting in novel findings and promising new treatments. The most widely used and most fruitful approaches to assessing cough are discussed, along with some newer and preliminary techniques and directions for the future. These include methods for measuring cough-specific quality of life, subjective severity, cough frequency, intensity, and sensitivity of the underlying cough reflex. Ongoing development and more widespread adoption of cough assessment tools should help describe the heterogeneity of cough phenotypes, and may better guide treatment by enabling prediction of responses to pharmacological and nonpharmacological antitussive therapies. More detailed assessments of cough may also bring benefits in measuring the transmission of respiratory infections, or in managing reduced airway protection in neuromuscular disease. Population-wide assessments should also help understand the epidemiology of cough and assist in screening for disease.

Spinal cord injury and cough — respiratory impairment includes weak or absent coughs, and assisted techniques can help: individuals can have major changes in respiratory and cough function because of loss of nerves and connectivity at multiple levels, most evident in high cervical cord injuries and resulting in low lung volumes, weak or absent coughs, and increased secretions; mechanically assisted coughing can be beneficial to increase peak airflows to clear secretions from the lower airways; electrical stimulation of the abdominal muscles may improve cough by enhancing dynamic compression of the airways when delivered as patients begin coughing.

### Comprehensive evidence-based review on European antitussives [^116C3ZhR]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Acute cough is perhaps the most common symptom to afflict mankind. While it is usually a benign and self-limiting illness, the amount of morbidity endured as a consequence of acute viral respiratory tract infection has enormous consequences on humanity. By the use of evidence-based treatment, significant improvement in patient outcomes can be achieved. While there are many gaps in the knowledge of our therapy in acute cough, our improved understanding of the mechanism of cough hypersensitivity brings rational treatment choices a step closer. A greater understanding of how drugs may normalise this aberrant reflex, thus bringing relief and shortening the duration of illness, may be of enormous benefit to the whole of society.

### The heterogeneity of chronic cough: a case for endotypes of cough hypersensitivity [^1132ANRb]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Cough is a troublesome and difficult-to-treat symptom that accompanies a diverse range of pulmonary and extrapulmonary conditions. Although considerable advances have been made over recent years in basic cough biology, this has not translated into improved clinical management. A major challenge has been in understanding the heterogeneity underlying the development and persistence of chronic cough in different patients. We present evidence that such heterogeneity begins with the multiple peripheral and central neural pathways capable of eliciting cough and associated respiratory behaviours, and extends to incorporate the diversity of diseases that underlie cough and the clinical phenotypic and pathological endotypic presentations that can vary substantially between individual patients with cough. A better understanding of how these sources of heterogeneity are expressed across individual patients with chronic cough is needed to better predict the efficacy of clinical management strategies and of specifically targeted therapies, which will facilitate the development of more personalised clinical approaches to treat patients with chronic cough.

### Office management of the patient with chronic cough [^112oAzPy]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic cough is a common complaint in the ambulatory setting and can result in significant compromise in quality of life and, uncommonly, is a presenting symptom of serious or life-threatening disease. Although there are many potential causes, an organized approach to diagnosis that may include therapeutic trials of select medications can establish the diagnosis in over 90% of presenting patients. Management hinges on accurate etiologic diagnosis. Consultation with a pulmonologist, otolaryngologist, or allergist is indicated in selected cases where diagnosis is unclear or specific therapy is mandated.

### Curbing the cough: multimodal treatments for neurogenic cough: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112ycEsW]. The Laryngoscope (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Neurogenic cough affects 11% of Americans and causes significant detriment to quality of life. With the advent of novel therapies, the objective of this review is to determine how procedural therapies (e.g., superior laryngeal nerve block) compare to other established pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments for neurogenic cough.

Methods

With the assistance of a medical librarian, a systematic review was performed using PICOS (patients, interventions, comparator, outcome, study design) format: adults with neurogenic cough receiving any pharmacologic or non-pharmacologic treatment for neurogenic cough compared to adults with neurogenic cough receiving any other relevant interventions, or treated as single cohorts, assessed with cough-specific quality of life outcomes, in all study designs and case series with ≥ 10 cases. Case reports, review articles, non-human studies, non-English language articles, and unavailable full-text articles were excluded.

Results

There were 2408 patients with neurogenic cough in this review, treated with medical therapy (77%), speech therapy (19%), both medical and speech therapy (1%), and procedural therapy (3%). The included studies ranged from low to intermediate quality. Overall, most interventions demonstrated successful improvement in cough. However, the heterogeneity of included study designs precluded direct comparisons between intervention types.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis compared various treatments for neurogenic cough. Procedural therapy should be considered in the armamentarium of neurogenic cough treatments, particularly in patients refractory to, or intolerant of, the side effects of medical therapy. Lastly, this review illuminates key areas for improving neurogenic cough diagnosis, such as strict adherence to diagnostic and treatment guidelines, sophisticated reflux testing, and standardized, consistent outcome reporting.

### Therapeutic and mechanistic advances in chronic cough [^112NbbbN]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Cough is one of the most common reasons patients seek medical care in the outpatient setting. Chronic cough (CC) in adults is defined as a cough lasting more than 8 weeks, with a global prevalence of approximately 10%. CC significantly impairs quality of life, affecting physical, social, and psychological well-being. In most cases, CC is attributed to 1 or more of the following 3 key conditions: upper airway cough syndrome, gastroesophageal or laryngopharyngeal reflux, and asthma or non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis-assuming a normal chest x-ray result and no use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. If the cough persists despite thorough guideline-based evaluation and treatment, it is classified as refractory CC (RCC). RCC is thought to arise from neuronal dysregulation involving both peripheral and central mechanisms, termed cough hypersensitivity syndrome. This is typically characterized by a tickle or itch sensation in the throat, leading to an urge to cough in response to seemingly harmless stimuli. Current treatment options for RCC include "off-label" use of centrally acting neuromodulators and speech therapy. In addition, a new peripherally acting oral P2×3 receptor antagonist, gefapixant, has been approved in the European Union, United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Japan, though not in the United States or Canada. Emerging treatments hold promise for improving management in the future.

### Somatically evoked cough responses help to identify patients with difficult-to-treat chronic cough: a six-month observational cohort study [^111U6YiH]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Even though the symptom-driven treatment of cough-associated symptoms almost invariably resulted in a marked decrease of symptoms other than cough itself in both SPC+ and SPC− patients, the cough scores only improved in SPC− patients. To explain this, it can be hypothesised that in SPC+ patients peripheral stimuli activating the cough reflex also generate a state of central hypersensitivity that may persist over time irrespective of the disappearance of the peripheral stimulus initiating cough. It has been shown that synaptic plasticity taking place in sensory pathways, from the spinal dorsal horn to cortical areas, contributes to chronic pain. Potentiation at synapses of nociceptive nerve fibres constitutes a powerful model for pain amplification following trauma, inflammation and nerve injury. Since cough can be considered a defensive response to nociceptive stimulation, it is not surprising that mechanisms underlying nociception and cough may share similar features leading to the development of pain and cough hypersensitivities. These mechanisms might constitute the neurophysiological basis of clinical forms of chronic cough - conventionally referred to as refractory or unexplained chronic cough - of which SPCs may represent a clinical hallmark.

### Chronic cough: evaluation and management [^113jzXcQ]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Although chronic cough in adults (cough lasting longer than eight weeks) can be caused by many etiologies, four conditions account for most cases: upper airway cough syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux disease/laryngopharyngeal reflux disease, asthma, and nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis. Patients should be evaluated clinically (with spirometry, if indicated), and empiric treatment should be initiated. Other potential causes include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use, environmental triggers, tobacco use, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. Chest radiography can rule out concerning infectious, inflammatory, and malignant thoracic conditions. Patients with refractory chronic cough may warrant referral to a pulmonologist or otolaryngologist in addition to a trial of gabapentin, pregabalin, and/or speech therapy. In children, cough is considered chronic if present for more than four weeks. In children six to 14 years of age, it is most commonly caused by asthma, protracted bacterial bronchitis, and upper airway cough syndrome. Evaluation should focus initially on these etiologies, with targeted treatment and monitoring for resolution.

### Treatment of unexplained chronic cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112jkGbt]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Unexplained chronic cough (UCC) therapy — Neuromodulator therapy was found to significantly improve cough quality of life in three RCTs, with studies using gabapentin or morphine, and the largest study found that gabapentin reduced cough frequency in UCC. A treatment suggestion regarding neuromodulators for UCC recognized limitations including the paucity and small size of studies and that one of the three RCTs had a moderate risk of bias, making the estimate of treatment effect imprecise; adverse effects were mainly predictable central nervous system effects, and for gabapentin were reportedly managed by modification to dose. Speech pathology was found to have a positive effect on cough severity and in an open-label study showed positive effects on cough quality of life and objective cough counts. Proton pump inhibitors are recommended for chronic cough caused by GERD, but in the absence of typical GERD symptoms an RCT found the empiric use of a high-dose proton pump inhibitor was not effective at improving cough quality of life, and macrolides did not improve quality of life in patients with UCC.

### Laryngoscopic findings and response to gabapentin… [^116Vdf7K]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

The presence of vocal fold motion asymmetry may be considered as a part of a clinical picture consistent with neurogenic cough that responds to gabapentin. Importance Chronic cough is a debilitating, often multifactorial problem. Vagal neuropathy has been proposed as a cause for a fraction of these cases. There are certain features that support the clinical diagnosis of vagal neuropathy. It is hypothesized that patients with neurogenic cough who have vocal fold motion asymmetry on laryngoscopy will be more likely to respond to gabapentin. Main Outcomes and Measures Response to gabapentin was defined by physician-documented subjective patient report of improvement in cough symptoms. Results. Neurogenic cough is considered to be a symptom of vagal neuropathy. In previously published studies, neurogenic cough was suspected as a diagnosis of exclusion following consideration of a wide differential.

1–3 The initial management of a newly diagnosed chronic cough varies, but commonly used approaches include pulmonary function tests, noncontrast computed tomography of the sinuses, an empirical trial of laryngeal irritant avoidance with proton pump inhibitors, and pH testing. can trigger coughing paroxysms in these patients. 6 Although neurogenic cough associated with PVVN is considered a disordered sensory phenomenon, 49% to 71% of patients have a concurrent motor neuropathy. 4, 7 The initial description of PVVN included the association with an antecedent upper respiratory tract illness prompting the theory of viral cause, 5 but a definitive viral causation has not been established and the term PVVN limits the discussion to neuropathies suspected to be viral in origin. Several neuromodulators have been successfully used to treat cough related to VN. 2, 8–11 Gabapentin, an analog of γ-aminobutyric acid, inhibits voltage-gated, calcium-channel–mediated release of neurotransmitters.

3 A number of studies support its efficacy including a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. 11 However, not every patient responds to treatment with gabapentin. Although VN is an uncommon cause of chronic cough, it can be beneficial to identify patients with neurogenic cough, because pharmacologic therapy has been well demonstrated to be effective in these patients. 1–4, 7, 11, 14, 15 In this study, we present an association between VFMA noted on videostroboscopy and response to gabapentin therapy in patients with suspected neurogenic cough related to VN.

Cough hypersensitivity

In chronic cough (CC), recent evidence suggests that neurogenic or neuropathic mechanisms may be responsible. The symptom profile is akin to that of chronic pain, with increased response to tussive (hypertussia) and nontussive (allotussia) stimuli. Biopsies from the airway of patients with CC suggest that nerve length and branching points within the epithelium are increased, suggesting neural hyperplasticity. Functional magnetic resonance imaging also suggests that there are functional differences within the brain of people with CC compared with healthy controls, which correlate with capsaicin sensitivity. Patients with CC also exhibit an impaired ability to suppress cough in response to tussive stimuli, and cough responds to treatments aimed at peripheral and central nerves including Gefapixtant (P2X3 inhibitor), gabapentin, and morphine, as well as cough suppression speech therapy.

In patients with ILD, several studies have demonstrated hypersensitivity to tussive stimuli such as capsaicin or substance P. Neurotrophins including nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are found at increased levels in the sputum of patients with IPF when compared to healthy controls and may play a role in hypersensitivity to tussive stimuli. Patients with ILD exhibit features of cough hypersensitivity including allotussia, hypertussia and laryngeal paraesthesia. We discuss several potential mechanisms which might drive cough hypersensitivity in patients with ILD here (Fig. 1), although it should be noted that it is by no means certain that this is the mechanism by which patients with ILD develop chronic cough.

Proposed mechanisms for cough in interstitial lung disease may be categorised into exposures; treatable traits; cough hypersensitivity and gastro-oesophageal reflux.

### Management of chronic cough [^111BRZhf]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Cough that remains unexplained after basic clinical assessment is a common reason for referral to secondary care. Much of the evidence about management of isolated chronic cough is derived from case series; this evidence suggests that isolated chronic cough is usually due to asthma, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, and upper airway conditions, and that it can be cured in most people by treatment of these conditions. However, there is increasing recognition that satisfactory control of chronic cough is not achieved in a substantial number of patients seen in secondary care. Moreover, there is a concern that perpetuation of the belief that chronic cough is solely due to the effects of comorbid conditions is inhibiting research into the pathophysiology of an abnormally heightened cough reflex, and jeopardising development of improved treatments. We advocate a change in emphasis, which makes a clear distinction between cough due to corticosteroid-responsive eosinophilic airway diseases and corticosteroid-resistant non-eosinophilic cough. We recommend that some factors with weak evidence of an association with cough are best viewed as potential aggravating factors of an intrinsic abnormality of the cough reflex, rather than the cause. We call for more research into the basic mechanisms and pharmacological control of an abnormally heightened cough reflex, and recommend ways to assess the effects of potentially antitussive treatments.

### An empiric integrative approach to the management of cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^112TQUjk]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Review the literature to provide a comprehensive approach, including algorithms for the clinician to follow in evaluating and treating the patient with acute, subacute, and chronic cough.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE (through May 2004) for studies published in the English language since 1980 on human subjects using the medical subject heading terms "cough", "treatment of cough", and "empiric treatment of cough". We selected case series and prospective descriptive clinical trials. We also obtained any references from these studies that were pertinent to the topic.

Results

The relative frequency of the disorders (alone and in combination) that can cause cough as well as the sensitivity and specificity of many but not all diagnostic tests in predicting the cause of cough are known. An effective approach to successfully manage chronic cough is to sequentially evaluate and treat for the common causes of cough using a combination of selected diagnostic tests and empiric therapy. Sequential and additive therapy is often crucial because more than one cause of cough is frequently present.

Conclusion

Algorithms that provide a "road map" that the clinician can follow are useful and are presented for acute, subacute, and chronic cough.

### Nonallergic rhinopathy: a comprehensive review of classification, diagnosis, and treatment [^111wvd7v]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic nonallergic rhinitis syndromes encompass various conditions, of which vasomotor rhinitis is the most common form, representing approximately 80% of patients, also referred to as nonallergic rhinopathy (NAR), nasal hyperreactivity, neurogenic rhinitis, or idiopathic rhinitis. Expert panels have recommended replacing vasomotor rhinitis terminology because it is more descriptive of this condition that is characterized by symptoms triggered by chemical irritants and weather changes through chemosensors, mechanosensors, thermosensors, and/or osmosensors activated through different transient receptor potential calcium ion channels. Elucidating the specific role of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1, triggered by capsaicin, has been an important advancement in better understanding the pathophysiology of NAR because it has now been shown that downregulation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 receptors by several therapeutic compounds provides symptomatic relief for this condition. The classification of NAR is further complicated by its association with allergic rhinitis referred to as mixed rhinitis, which involves both immunoglobulin E-mediated and neurogenic mechanistic pathways. Comorbidities associated with NAR, including rhinosinusitis, headaches, asthma, chronic cough, and sleep disturbances, underscore the need for comprehensive management. Treatment options for NAR include environmental interventions, pharmacotherapy, and in refractory cases, surgical options, emphasizing the need for a tailored approach for each patient. Thus, it is extremely important to accurately diagnose NAR because inappropriate therapies lead to poor clinical outcomes and unnecessary health care and economic burdens for these patients. This review provides a comprehensive overview of NAR subtypes, focusing on classification, diagnosis, and treatment approaches for NAR.

### Chronic cough as a neuropathic disorder [^115SqsSG]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Chronic cough is a common symptom that can be a daunting challenge for clinicians since treatment of the underlying cause does not always provide adequate relief, an obvious cause can remain elusive, and current antitussives have fairly poor efficacy and undesirable side-effects. Patients with chronic cough typically describe a range of sensory symptoms suggestive of upper-airway and laryngeal neural dysfunction. Additionally, patients often report cough triggered by low-level physical and chemical stimuli, which is suggestive of cough-reflex hyperresponsiveness. Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying peripheral and central augmentation of the afferent cough pathways have been identified, and compelling evidence exists for a neuropathy of vagal sensory nerves after upper-respiratory viral infections or exposure to allergic and non-allergic irritants. In this Personal View, we argue that chronic cough is a neuropathic disorder that arises from neural damage caused by a range of inflammatory, infective, and allergic factors. In support of this idea, we discuss evidence of successful treatment of chronic cough with agents used for treatment of neuropathic pain, such as gabapentin and amitriptyline. Regarding cough as a neuropathic disorder could lead to new, more effective antitussives.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® chronic cough [^112EoMEf]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic cough is defined by a duration lasting at least 8 weeks. The most common causes of chronic cough include smoking-related lung disease, upper airway cough syndrome, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis. The etiology of chronic cough in some patients may be difficult to localize to an isolated source and is often multifactorial. The complex pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and variable manifestations of chronic cough underscore the challenges faced by clinicians in the evaluation and management of these patients. Imaging plays a role in the initial evaluation, although there is a lack of high-quality evidence guiding which modalities are useful and at what point in time the clinical evaluation should be performed. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Are otolaryngologists seeing more cough? Longitudinal trends and patterns [^115sFBAQ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Cough is a very common chief complaint in outpatient medicine. While typically self‐limited and benign, it can significantly affect quality of life and has been found to be the most frequent ambulatory visit complaint across all ages in the United States.

Acute cough (< 3 weeks) is most commonly caused by upper respiratory infection, while subacute cough (lasting 3‐8 weeks) could point to a lingering infection or postinfectious inflammation such as postviral bronchitis. Cough persisting over 8 weeks is classified as chronic and warrants further investigation; common etiologies for chronic cough include benign conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux, asthma, and allergies, but chronic cough can also be a sign of more serious underlying conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or malignancy. Understanding the nuance of cough characterization allows clinicians to direct patients appropriately within the spectrum of medical specialties, if specialist management is needed.

This broad differential diagnosis is likely related to the wide range of medical and surgical specialties involved in cough evaluation and management, including primary care, pulmonology, gastroenterology, neurology, and otolaryngology. Otolaryngologist evaluation, in particular, has been recommended in prior studies to treat complex etiologies of cough such as those rooted in neurogenic or rhinologic processes. However, the care of most patients with cough likely does not require the relatively high‐cost and procedure‐intensive involvement of a specialist. According to guidelines from the New England Journal of Medicine and the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST), common causes of cough should typically be addressed before considering subspecialty evaluation. A recent review by Dicpinigaitis et al. further highlights the importance of primary care physicians (PCPs) in the initial work‐up of cough, emphasizing their role before referring patients to specialists for interdisciplinary collaboration in the diagnosis and management of chronic cough.

### The efficacy of superior laryngeal nerve block for neurogenic cough: a placebo-controlled trial [^116SsKC4]. The Laryngoscope (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Chronic cough is a common and debilitating problem. The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) block for neurogenic cough through a placebo-controlled, prospective trial.

Methods

Patients were recruited in an outpatient tertiary care center. Inclusion criteria included a history consistent with neurogenic cough and age ≥ 18. Exclusion criteria included patients with untreated other etiologies of chronic cough (i.e., uncontrolled reflux) and current neuromodulating medication use. Patients were randomized into the treatment (1–2mL of a 1:1 triamcinolone 40mg: 1% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrines) or placebo (saline) group and received two unilateral injections at approximately 2-week intervals. Outcomes were measured primarily by the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) and a patient symptom log including a visual analog scale of cough severity.

Results

17 patients completed the study, including 10 in the treatment group and seven in the placebo group. Eight (80%) patients in the treatment group reported improvement with at least one of the injections, whereas only 1 (14.3%) patient reported improvement in the placebo group (p < 0.0001). Average total LCQ scores increased in the treatment group from 10.09 to 13.15 (p = 0.03), with the most change occurring in the social domain. There was no statistically significant change in LCQ scores for the placebo group. There were no serious adverse events.

Conclusion

An SLN block is a safe and efficacious procedure for the treatment of neurogenic cough. Further studies are needed to optimize treatment protocol and assess long-term follow-up of patient outcomes.

Methods

This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statementand was registered on PROSPERO before the completion of the initial search (Registration No: CRD42022345940). The ethical approval was waived for this study type.

Search strategy

PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Ovid databases were systematically searched for RCTs published from January 1, 2008 to March 1, 2023. The search strategy used the following terms: (("refractory chronic cough") OR ("unexplained chronic cough")) AND (("therapy") OR ("medication∗")); (("chronic cough") OR ("idiopathic chronic cough")) AND (("treatment") OR ("medication∗")).

### Somatic cough syndrome (previously referred to as psychogenic cough) and tic cough (previously referred to as habit cough) in adults and children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111RQ6FG]. Chest (2015). Medium credibility.

Psychogenic, habit, and tic cough — systematic review scope and key findings: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus were searched from the earliest inception of each database to September 2013, and from September 2013 to January 9, 2015 an additional 135 citations were discovered with none revealing new or relevant information affecting results. The review identified a total of 18 uncontrolled studies that had enrolled 223 patients, 96% consisting of children or adolescents, 54% of whom were female. The systematic review only identified low-quality evidence to support a particular strategy to define and treat psychogenic, habit, and tic cough, and for diagnosis and management recommendations the Panel heavily depended on patient values, preferences, and availability of potential therapies. Of the three cough descriptors embodied within the clinical question, psychogenic cough was the diagnosis most commonly used; limitations included lack of control groups or any validated cough assessment tool, the retrospective nature of all studies, heterogeneity of definitions and diagnostic criteria, and a very high likelihood of reporting bias. The clinical research question asked: In adults and children with presumed psychogenic cough, habit cough, or tic cough, what are the most effective pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies?

### Neurogenic cough [^1168c9SX]. The Laryngoscope (2015). Low credibility.

We review contemporary concepts of the pathophysiology of neurogenic cough, and its evaluation and treatment based on scientific publications addressing neurogenic cough. Neurogenic cough is thought to be the result of sensory neuropathy, most commonly idiopathic. Because it is principally a sensory phenomenon, clinical evaluation is challenging, the diagnosis most often being made by exclusion. Identification of motor paresis, either by laryngoscopy or laryngeal electromyography, may suggest the presence of sensory neuropathy. The utility of amitriptyline and gabapentin has been demonstrated in randomized clinical trials, and retrospective series and case reports have suggested efficacy of pregabalin, baclofen, and botulinum toxin. Sensory neuropathy appears to be an important cause of chronic refractory cough, and appears amenable to treatment with a variety of pharmacologic agents.

### Activity and mechanism of naringin in the treatment of post-infectious cough [^112utVvp]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

After the resolution of acute-phase symptoms of a respiratory viral infection, patients may continue to experience a prolonged cough, clinically referred to as PIC. PIC typically presents as an irritating dry cough or a cough producing scant white mucus sputum, lasting between 3 to 8 weeks (subacute cough), with some cases persisting beyond 8 weeks, resulting in chronic cough that significantly impairs the patient's quality of life. However, the Chinese national guideline on diagnosis and management of cough (2021) does not recommend specific medications specifically for PIC. The etiology of PIC remains incompletely understood in both Chinese and Western medicine. Western medicine posits that PIC is generally self-limiting and may not require treatment in mild cases; in severe cases, antihistamines, cough suppressants, or corticosteroids may be employed, though these medications often have numerous side effects, limited overall efficacy, and may lead to refractory cough. TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) offers unique advantages in symptom improvement and disease course reduction, emphasizing a holistic and evidence-based approach. Nonetheless, existing clinical studies are superficial, lacking in-depth exploration and analysis of therapeutic mechanisms and pharmacological effects.

Naringin, a natural flavonoid glycoside predominantly found in citrus fruits of the Brassicaceae family and in Chinese herbal medicines such as Hovenia dulcis, Fructus Forskohlii, and Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae, exhibits various pharmacological activities including anti- inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer effects, garnering significant attention in both TCM and modern pharmaceutical research. Furthermore, evidence has demonstrated that naringin exerts antitussive effects in physiologically induced experimental cough, chronic airway inflammation, and cough triggered by airway neurogenic inflammation. Although extensive studies have been conducted on naringin, its intervention mechanisms in PIC remain unreported. To address this gap, the present study established a PIC model and employed network pharmacology prediction combined with animal pharmacological validation to investigate the inhibitory effects of naringin on PIC.

### Management of chronic refractory cough [^115pU6u8]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Chronic refractory cough (CRC) is defined as a cough that persists despite guideline based treatment. It is seen in 20–46% of patients presenting to specialist cough clinics and it has a substantial impact on quality of life and healthcare utilization. Several terms have been used to describe this condition, including the recently introduced term cough hypersensitivity syndrome. Key symptoms include a dry irritated cough localized around the laryngeal region. Symptoms are not restricted to cough and can include globus, dyspnea, and dysphonia. Chronic refractory cough has factors in common with laryngeal hypersensitivity syndromes and chronic pain syndromes, and these similarities help to shed light on the pathophysiology of the condition. Its pathophysiology is complex and includes cough reflex sensitivity, central sensitization, peripheral sensitization, and paradoxical vocal fold movement. Chronic refractory cough often occurs after a viral infection. The diagnosis is made once the main diseases that cause chronic cough have been excluded (or treated) and cough remains refractory to medical treatment. Several treatments have been developed over the past decade. These include speech pathology interventions using techniques adapted from the treatment of hyperfunctional voice disorders, as well as the use of centrally acting neuromodulators such as gabapentin and pregabalin. Potential new treatments in development also show promise.

### Camlipixant in refractory chronic cough: a phase 2b, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (SOOTHE) [^11479PFD]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In adults, chronic cough is defined as a cough lasting for > 8 weeks. Estimates of the global prevalence of chronic cough vary between 4% and 10% and may differ by region, ranging from 2% to 18%. Chronic cough can impose considerable physical and psychosocial burdens on patients, including interference with social interactions, sleep disruption, fatigue, urinary incontinence, and anxious and depressive symptoms. Other serious physical outcomes associated with chronic cough include hernias, rib fractures, and cough syncope. After considering critical conditions in patients presenting with chronic cough, current guidelines suggest carrying out investigations such as full blood counts, chest radiography, and spirometry, and a sequential trial of different therapies is recommended.

A substantial proportion of patients (between 38% and 64%) presenting with chronic cough are estimated to have refractory chronic cough (RCC; including unexplained chronic cough). However, the exact prevalence of RCC in patients with chronic cough is unknown. RCC is a disease believed to arise from a primary disorder of the neuronal pathways controlling cough and manifests as a long-term cough that persists for > 8 weeks despite treatment of other possible underlying cough-related etiologies or has no diagnosable cause (i.e. unexplained chronic cough). Patients with RCC have a clinical profile similar to that of other patients presenting with chronic cough, with an average age of onset of over 40 years old and a high proportion of women being affected.

### Global physiology and pathophysiology of cough: part 1: cough phenomenology-CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116cegH9]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Gaps in knowledge in cough neurophysiology — developmental maturation, sex and age differences, and neuroimaging — are highlighted as priorities for research that could aid clinical management. The authors identified several knowledge gaps which if filled could help improve clinical management, including an improved understanding of cough reflex maturation from infancy to adulthood to help protect children from silent and recurrent small volume aspiration. Linked needs include understanding how integration between the peripheral and central nervous systems is impacted by sex, aging, or acute and chronic neurologic disease. A preliminary functional MRI assessment demonstrated sex-related differences in somatosensory cortex activity during inhaled capsaicin challenges, and similar imaging strategies could distinguish between central sensory and motor neural changes that accompany altered coughing seen clinically. The perception of pain, which shares neurologic similarities with cough, differs with respect to sex and age and shows changes with acute and chronic neurologic disease, and brain imaging has offered insights into putative mechanisms contributing to pain plasticity.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113dD3d4]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Classification and evaluation of pediatric cough — at first presentation, specific cough overlaps with non-specific cough and the latter overlaps with 'expected cough'. 'Expected cough' refers to coughing illness reflective of common upper respiratory viral infections in an otherwise child where the cough duration is usually < 2 weeks but may be longer in a small minority. Children with a chronic cough should be reevaluated until a diagnosis is found with resolution of the cough (if possible). The presence of any specific cough pointer indicates an etiology of chronic cough and when any of these symptoms and signs are present, the cough is referred to as 'specific cough'. In some children, the quality of cough is recognizable and suggestive of specific etiology. Non-specific cough is more likely to resolve without specific treatment and it is characterized by a dry/nonproductive cough in the absence of specific cough pointers with normal CXR and spirometry. Contributing exacerbating factors such as tobacco smoke exposure and parental expectations should also be evaluated, irrespective of the underlying etiology.

### Sensory neuropathic cough: a common and treatable cause of chronic cough [^112rvPji]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe our experience with chronic sensory neuropathic cough and its response to amitriptyline in a first group of patients.

Study Design and Setting

A prospective cohort of patients is described in detail. Each was referred to an academic laryngological practice after extensive prior negative workup for cough and failure to respond to various treatments. Each of these patients was treated with amitriptyline and asked to report the effect on the cough at fixed intervals by means of telephone interviews.

Results

A first cohort of 12 consecutive patients with a chronic, nonproductive cough that lasted between 2 months and 20 years, with no (formerly) discernible cause is described. Purely clinical criteria of inclusion and exclusion are proposed. All patients had at least 40% reduction of self-reported symptoms, with most describing between 75% to 100% short-term relief.

Conclusion

Sensory neuropathic cough can be diagnosed clinically in patients with chronic idiopathic cough. A trial of amitriptyline 10 mg or of other anti-neuralgia type medications may be helpful. Longer term and controlled trials are warranted to validate this entity and prove efficacy of neurologic medication in chronic sensory neuropathic cough.

### Treatment of neurogenic cough with tramadol: a pilot study [^116YNHKH]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

This study employs validated cough assessment tools to prospectively determine the impact of tramadol on cough severity and quality of life in subjects with neurogenic cough. The study was a prospective case series with planned data collection at a tertiary care academic medical center laryngology practice. Sixteen consecutive collected subjects with neurogenic cough prospectively completed pre- and posttreatment validated cough assessment tools, the cough severity index (CSI) and Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ). All subjects in the study reported at least some improvement in their cough symptoms. In a Wilcoxon signed rank test that compared paired results, CSI scores improved from 23 to 14 and LCQ scores improved from 74 to 103 (P = 0.003 and P = 0.005, respectively). This small preliminary assessment suggests that tramadol warrants additional evaluation as a treatment for neurogenic cough.

### Superior laryngeal nerve block for treatment of neurogenic cough [^113QAYc6]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to add to the body of evidence for efficacy of Superior Laryngeal Nerve (SLN) blocks for treatment of neurogenic cough. Efficacy at short- and long-term intervals are presented as well as relationships with laryngoscopic findings.

Methods

A retrospective chart review of patients treated with SLN block between 2018 and 2020 was conducted. Patient demographics, videostroboscopic findings, and patient-subjective perception of outcomes were recorded and analyzed. Cough Severity Index (CSI) scores from pre-injection, short-term follow-up, and long-term follow-up were compared.

Results

Twenty patients underwent SLN block in the clinic setting. Four patients were excluded for incomplete records. The indication was neurogenic cough refractory to medical management and/or cough suppression therapy. Patients with short-term follow-up (n = 13) had statistically significant decrease in CSI scores, with a mean baseline CSI of 24.3 decreasing to 16.15 (P = 0.006). Patients with evidence of Vocal Fold Motion/Vibratory Abnormalities (VFA) (n = 8) showed improvement in short-term CSI scores, with a mean baseline CSI of 24.13 decreasing to 14.5 (P = 0.004). Those without evidence of VFA did not have statistically significant improvement in short-term CSI scores. At long-term follow-up, patients with VFA had improvements that approached statistical significance with a mean baseline CSI of 22.56 decreasing to 14.56 (P = 0.057), while patients without VFA showed no improvement.

Conclusions

Our results are consistent with previous literature indicating efficacy of SLN block. The presence of VFA may be an indicator of patients who experience increased therapeutic effect.
