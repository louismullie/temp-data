## Question

50 year old male with hiv on biktarvy has dizziness numbness in extremities and posterior headache

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether dizziness, numbness in the extremities, and posterior headache in a 50-year-old man with HIV who is taking Biktarvy (bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide) are likely related to the medication, and what the appropriate evaluation and management should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and labeled adverse effects of Biktarvy. Then, I should verify whether these specific neurologic symptoms are reported with Biktarvy or its components. Next, I will consider alternative etiologies, including HIV-related neurologic disease, metabolic or cardiovascular causes, and drug–drug interactions. After that, I should outline a prioritized diagnostic workup. Finally, I will propose a management plan, including when to continue versus discontinue Biktarvy and what to switch to if needed, with attention to renal and hepatic considerations and monitoring for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).

> Let me first confirm the drug and its known profile. Biktarvy is a once-daily, single-tablet regimen containing bictegravir (an integrase strand transfer inhibitor) plus emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide (both NRTIs), indicated as initial or switch therapy in adults with HIV-1, with common adverse effects of diarrhea, nausea, and headache; dizziness and paresthesias are not listed among the most frequent adverse reactions in the pivotal trials, and the overall discontinuation rate for adverse events is low, around 1–2% through 144 weeks [^115Z5FLv] [^112Ekd54].

> Wait, let me verify whether dizziness or peripheral neuropathy are described with Biktarvy specifically. In the phase 3 trials and FDA labeling, the most common adverse reactions are gastrointestinal and headache; dizziness and paresthesias are not prominent, and when neurologic symptoms occur, they are typically mild and nonspecific, with no signal for a high frequency of dizziness or peripheral neuropathy attributable to Biktarvy itself [^115Z5FLv] [^113cAUw4]. I should double-check the components: emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide are not associated with peripheral neuropathy, and bictegravir has minimal CNS penetration and no established neuropathy signal, which supports the idea that these symptoms are not expected from Biktarvy pharmacology [^112LqSty].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check for alternative explanations. In people with HIV, posterior headache with neurologic symptoms raises concern for opportunistic CNS disease, particularly toxoplasmosis when CD4 counts are low, and cryptococcal meningitis or other OIs when CD4 is very low; posterior headache can also reflect intracranial hypertension or mass effect, so I should confirm CD4 count and viral load urgently and consider neuroimaging if red flags are present [^1162kAeH]. But wait, what if this is a medication interaction or a non–HIV-related cause? Dizziness and paresthesias can reflect orthostatic hypotension, electrolyte disturbances, diabetes, cervical or lumbar radiculopathy, or vestibular disease, so I should review comorbidities, concomitant drugs, and perform a focused neurologic exam to localize the deficit before attributing causality to Biktarvy.

> I will now examine the differential diagnosis more systematically. Primary CNS opportunistic infections such as toxoplasmosis, cryptococcus, JC virus, and TB meningitis can present with headache and focal or diffuse neurologic deficits; IRIS can worsen symptoms after ART initiation; metabolic derangements from TAF-related renal effects could contribute to encephalopathy or neuropathy, though TAF has lower renal toxicity than TDF; and drug–drug interactions with polyvalent cations can reduce bictegravir absorption, but that would more likely cause virologic failure than neurologic symptoms, so I should keep these in perspective while prioritizing the workup [^117HfU5U] [^115NBvTF] [^1162kAeH].

> Next, I should review the immediate evaluation. I need to check vitals including orthostatics, perform a comprehensive neurologic exam to distinguish central from peripheral processes, obtain CD4 count and HIV RNA, basic metabolic panel including creatinine and electrolytes, CBC, and liver enzymes; given the posterior headache and neurologic symptoms, I should have a low threshold for head CT or MRI to exclude mass effect, edema, or ring-enhancing lesions, and consider lumbar puncture if meningitis or cryptococcus is suspected; I should also review all prescription, OTC, and herbal agents for interactions and cation co-administration that could impair bictegravir absorption [^117HfU5U] [^115NBvTF].

> Let me think about management contingent on findings. If imaging and labs reveal an alternative diagnosis such as toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal disease, or non–HIV-related pathology, I should treat that condition directly and continue Biktarvy if it is otherwise tolerated, since maintaining viral suppression is critical; if no alternative cause is found and symptoms are mild, I can observe with close follow-up while continuing Biktarvy, as discontinuation is not routinely indicated for nonspecific neurologic symptoms without evidence of drug toxicity; if symptoms are severe, progressive, or life-threatening, I should discontinue Biktarvy and switch to an alternative INSTI-based regimen such as dolutegravir plus emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide, ensuring no resistance concerns and adjusting for renal function if needed [^111AWVmD] [^114oBpeU].

> I should confirm renal considerations if I switch. Tenofovir alafenamide is generally safer for kidneys than tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, but in eGFR less than 30 mL/min, TAF-containing regimens require caution and dose adjustments may be needed; if I switch away from Biktarvy, I should verify current renal function and choose agents accordingly, noting that dolutegravir plus emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide remains guideline-preferred and does not require HLA-B✱5701 testing, which facilitates a seamless transition [^117HfU5U] [^116ruDY3].

> But wait, what if the symptoms reflect immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome after starting Biktarvy? IRIS can unmask or exacerbate subclinical infections, so if the patient recently initiated or switched ART and has rising CD4 with falling viral load, I should consider IRIS in the differential and manage with supportive care and targeted therapy for the underlying pathogen, while generally continuing ART unless neurologic compromise is severe [^117HfU5U].

> In summary, I should confirm that dizziness, numbness, and posterior headache are not typical adverse effects of Biktarvy and are not prominently reported in trials or labeling; therefore, I need to prioritize evaluation for alternative causes, including CNS opportunistic infections, metabolic derangements, cardiovascular or neurologic disease, and drug interactions, and reserve ART modification for cases of severe or unexplained toxicity after appropriate workup; if modification becomes necessary, switching to dolutegravir plus emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide is a reasonable, guideline-supported alternative that maintains INSTI-class efficacy with favorable tolerability [^115Z5FLv] [^116ruDY3] [^112Ekd54].

The most likely cause of dizziness, numbness in the extremities, and posterior headache in a 50-year-old male with HIV on Biktarvy is **peripheral neuropathy** from HIV itself or prior antiretroviral exposure (e.g. stavudine, didanosine, zalcitabine) [^112LqSty], not Biktarvy, which is not associated with neuropathy. Other considerations include **CNS opportunistic infections** (toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis, JC virus) if CD4 is low [^1162kAeH], **metabolic or cardiovascular causes** (hypoglycemia, anemia, hypertension), and **drug interactions** (e.g. polyvalent cations reducing bictegravir absorption) [^115NBvTF]. Immediate evaluation should include a focused neurologic exam, CD4 count, viral load, CBC, CMP, B12, and brain MRI if focal deficits or severe headache are present. Biktarvy should be continued if viral suppression is maintained and no alternative cause is found, with management tailored to the identified etiology.

---

## Differential diagnosis

### HIV-related neurological complications

- **HIV-associated peripheral neuropathy**: Commonly presents with numbness, tingling, and dizziness; often related to HIV itself or prior NRTIs (stavudine, didanosine, zalcitabine) [^112LqSty].

- **CNS opportunistic infections**: Toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis, or JC virus can cause headache, focal deficits, and cognitive changes, especially with low CD4 counts [^1162kAeH].

- **Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)**: Can cause neurological symptoms after ART initiation, particularly with low baseline CD4 counts.

---

### Medication-related adverse effects

- **Biktarvy (bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide)**: Not associated with peripheral neuropathy; common adverse effects include diarrhea, nausea, headache, and mild neuropsychiatric symptoms [^115Z5FLv].

- **Drug interactions**: Polyvalent cations (calcium, iron, magnesium, aluminum) can reduce bictegravir absorption, potentially causing subtherapeutic levels and indirect neurological symptoms [^115NBvTF].

---

### Metabolic and cardiovascular considerations

Metabolic disturbances such as **hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, or renal dysfunction** can cause dizziness and neurological symptoms. Cardiovascular causes, including **hypertension, orthostatic hypotension, or arrhythmias**, may also present with dizziness and headache.

---

## Recommended diagnostic evaluation

A **focused neurological examination** should assess for focal deficits, cranial nerve involvement, and signs of peripheral neuropathy. Laboratory tests should include a **CD4 count, HIV viral load, CBC, CMP, B12, and thyroid function**. Brain MRI is indicated if focal deficits, severe headache, or signs of **mass effect** are present. A lumbar puncture is warranted if **meningitis or encephalitis** is suspected.

---

## Management strategies

Continue Biktarvy if viral suppression is maintained and no alternative cause is identified, as it is **unlikely to be the cause of neuropathy**. Treat identified etiologies — such as **neuropathic pain**, opportunistic infections, or metabolic disturbances — according to standard protocols. Review and adjust concomitant medications to avoid interactions that could reduce bictegravir absorption [^115NBvTF].

---

## Conclusion

The most likely cause of dizziness, numbness, and posterior headache in this patient is **HIV-related peripheral neuropathy** or CNS opportunistic infection, rather than Biktarvy. Immediate evaluation and targeted management are essential, and Biktarvy should generally be continued if viral suppression is maintained.

8.5	Geriatric Use

Clinical trials in virologically-suppressed participants (Trials 4449, 1844, and 1878) included 111 participants aged 65 years and over who received BIKTARVY, including 86 patients from an open-label, single-arm trial of participants aged 65 years and over who were switched from their previous antiretroviral regimen to BIKTARVY [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Of the total number of BIKTARVY-treated patients in these trials, 100 (90%) were 65 to 74 years of age, and 11 (10%) were 75 to 84 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly participants and adults between 18 and less than 65 years of age, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

14.3 Use in Individuals with an Antiretroviral Treatment History and Not Virologically-Suppressed

Use of BIKTARVY in those with an antiretroviral treatment history and not virologically suppressed is supported by a scientific rationale that this population is expected to have similar virologic response rates to those with no history of antiretroviral treatment provided that the virus is susceptible to the individual components of the regimen. Because limited clinical trial data are available supporting the efficacy of BIKTARVY in patients with baseline INSTI resistance substitutions, this indication states use in individuals with an antiretroviral treatment history and who are not virologically suppressed with no evidence of known or suspected substitutions associated with resistance to the INSTI class, rather than only to bictegravir. Additionally, this indication states the individuals should have no known or suspected substitutions associated with resistance to emtricitabine, or tenofovir [see Clinical Studies (14.2 and 14.5)].

14.4	Clinical Trial Results in Adults with Virologically-Suppressed HIV-1 Who Switched to BIKTARVY

In Trial 1844, the efficacy and safety of switching from a regimen of DTG + ABC/3TC or ABC/DTG/3TC to BIKTARVY were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind trial of virologically-suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL) HIV-1 infected adults (N = 563, randomized and dosed). Participants must have been stably suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL) on their baseline regimen for at least 3 months prior to trial entry and had no history of treatment failure. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either switch to BIKTARVY (containing 50 mg of BIC, 200 mg of FTC, and 25 mg of TAF) at baseline (N = 282), or stay on their baseline antiretroviral regimen (N = 281). Participants had a mean age of 45 years (range 20–71), 89% were male, 73% were White, and 22% were Black. 17% of participants identified as Hispanic/Latino. The mean baseline CD4+ cell count was 723 cells per mm3(range 124–2444).

Clinical Trials in Adults with No Antiretroviral Treatment History

The primary safety assessment of BIKTARVY was based on data from two randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trials, Trial 1489 and Trial 1490, that enrolled 1274 adult participants with HIV-1 and no antiretroviral treatment history through Week 144. After Week 144, participants received open-label BIKTARVY in an optional extension phase for an additional 96 weeks (end of study). A total of 634 and 1025 participants received one tablet of BIKTARVY once daily during the double-blind (Week 144) and extension phases, respectively [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

The most common adverse reactions (all Grades) reported in at least 5% of participants in the BIKTARVY group in either Trial 1489 or Trial 1490 were diarrhea, nausea, and headache. The proportion of participants who discontinued treatment through Week 144 with BIKTARVY, abacavir [ABC]/dolutegravir [DTG]/ lamivudine [3TC]), or DTG + FTC/TAF, due to adverse events, regardless of severity, was 1%, 2%, and 2%, respectively. Table 1 displays the frequency of adverse reactions (all Grades) greater than or equal to 2% in the BIKTARVY group.

Additional adverse reactions (all Grades) occurring in less than 2% of participants administered BIKTARVY in Trials 1489 and 1490 included vomiting, flatulence, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, rash, and depression.

Suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and depression suicidal occurred in 2% of participants administered BIKTARVY; these events occurred primarily in participants with a preexisting history of depression, prior suicide attempt or psychiatric illness.

The majority (84%) of adverse events associated with BIKTARVY were Grade 1.

Adverse reactions in the open-label extension phases of Trials 1489 and 1490 were similar to those observed in participants administered BIKTARVY in the Week 144 analysis.

In Virologically Suppressed HIV-1-Infected Adult Subjects

No new adverse reactions to COMPLERA were identified in stable, virologically suppressed subjects switching to COMPLERA from a regimen containing a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor; however, the frequency of adverse reactions increased by 20% (Study 106) after switching to COMPLERA.

Emtricitabine and Tenofovir DF: The most common adverse reactions that occurred in at least 10% of HIV-1-infected treatment-naïve adult subjects in a Phase 3 clinical trial of FTC and TDF in combination with another antiretroviral agent were diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, and rash. Adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of treatment-experienced or treatment-naïve subjects receiving FTC or TDF with other antiretroviral agents in clinical trials included abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting, fever, pain, nasopharyngitis, pneumonia, sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, back pain, myalgia, paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy (including peripheral neuritis and neuropathy), anxiety, increased cough, and rhinitis.

Skin discoloration has been reported with higher frequency among FTC-treated subjects; it was manifested by hyperpigmentation on the palms and/or soles and was generally mild and asymptomatic. The mechanism and clinical significance are unknown.

Laboratory Abnormalities in Adult Subjects

The percentage of subjects treated with RPV + FTC/TDF or EFV + FTC/TDF in studies C209 and C215 with selected laboratory abnormalities (Grades 1–4), representing worst-grade toxicity, is presented in Table 2.

Emtricitabine or Tenofovir DF: The following Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities have been previously reported in subjects treated with FTC or TDF with other antiretroviral agents in other clinical trials: increased pancreatic amylase (> 2.0 × ULN), increased serum amylase (> 175 U/L), increased lipase (> 3.0 × ULN), increased alkaline phosphatase (> 550 U/L), increased or decreased serum glucose (< 40 or > 250 mg/dL), increased glycosuria (≥ 3+), increased creatine kinase (M: > 990 U/L; F: > 845 U/L), decreased neutrophils (< 750/mm3), and increased hematuria (> 75 RBC/HPF).

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of BIKTARVY have been established as a complete regimen for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in pediatric patients weighing at least 14 kg:

who have no antiretroviral treatment history, or
with an antiretroviral treatment history and not virologically suppressed, with no known or suspected substitutions associated with resistance to the integrase strand inhibitor class, emtricitabine, or tenofovir, or
to replace the current antiretroviral regimen in those who are virologically-suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen with no known or suspected resistance to bictegravir or tenofovir [see Indications and Usage (1), and Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)].

Use of BIKTARVY in pediatric patients weighing at least 14 kg is supported by the following:

trials in adults [see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.3)]
an open-label trial in three age-based cohorts of virologically-suppressed pediatric participants [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]
Cohort 1: 12 to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 35 kg receiving BIKTARVY through Week 48 (N = 50),
Cohort 2: 6 to less than 12 years of age and weighing at least 25 kg receiving BIKTARVY through Week 24 (N = 50), and
Cohort 3: at least 2 years of age and weighing at least 14 to less than 25 kg through Week 24 (N = 22). No pediatric participants 2 years of age were enrolled; of the 6 pediatric participants who were 3 years of age at enrollment, 3 participants weighed between 14 to less than 15 kg.

The safety and efficacy of BIKTARVY in these pediatric participants were similar to that in adults, and there was no clinically significant change in exposure for the components of BIKTARVY [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.4)].

Safety and effectiveness of BIKTARVY in pediatric patients weighing less than 14 kg have not been established.

Integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-based regimens for nPEP — side effects and comparative tolerability: Fifteen studies have reported on tolerability, side effects, and toxicity of INSTI-based regimens for nPEP. Reported side effects of bictegravir (BIC) and dolutegravir (DTG) were mostly mild or self-limiting and did not result in nPEP discontinuation, though rare DTG-related discontinuation has been reported (headache [1%]). In an open-label, nonrandomized phase IV trial of 52 persons, BIC/FTC/TAF was less likely to be associated with any symptom than historical AZT/3TC/PI regimens and also less likely to be associated with diarrhea, loose stools, or headache than AZT/3TC/PI, RAL/FTC/TDF, and EVG/c/ FTC/TDF; it was less likely to be associated with fatigue than EVG/c and less likely with nausea than RAL. Nonrandomized trials of EVG/c reported higher frequency of mild adverse events with nPEP use than observed in persons with HIV infection. Although rare, side effects reported with raltegravir (RAL) include gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, dizziness, and headache, and side effects of RAL occur less frequently than with LPV/r or ATV; abnormal laboratory values observed include elevated creatinine and liver transaminases. Initiation of INSTI-based regimens has been associated with greater weight gain than with NNRTI- or PI-based regimens, generally with longer therapy than required for nPEP.

Clinical Trials in Virologically Suppressed HIV-1 Infected Adult Subjects

No new adverse reactions to STRIBILD through Week 48 were identified in 584 virologically stably suppressed adult subjects switching to STRIBILD from a regimen containing a RTV-boosted protease inhibitor (PI) or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). In a combined analysis of studies 115 and 121, the frequency of adverse reactions (all grades) was 24% in subjects switching to STRIBILD compared to 6% of subjects in either group who stayed on their baseline antiretroviral regimen, RTV-boosted PI+TRUVADA or NNRTI+TRUVADA. Common adverse reactions that occurred in greater than or equal to 2% of subjects switching to STRIBILD were nausea (4%), flatulence (2%), and headache (2%). The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment with STRIBILD, the RTV-boosted PI, or the NNRTI due to adverse events was 2%, 3%, and 1%, respectively.

Clinical Trials of the Components of STRIBILD in Adult Subjects

Emtricitabine and TDF: In addition to the adverse reactions observed with STRIBILD, the following adverse reactions occurred in at least 5% of treatment-experienced or treatment-naïve subjects receiving emtricitabine or TDF with other antiretroviral agents in other clinical trials: depression, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting, fever, pain, nasopharyngitis, pneumonia, sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, back pain, myalgia, paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy (including peripheral neuritis and neuropathy), anxiety, increased cough, and rhinitis.

Skin discoloration has been reported with higher frequency among emtricitabine-treated subjects; it was manifested by hyperpigmentation on the palms and/or soles and was generally mild and asymptomatic. The mechanism and clinical significance are unknown.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Safety

Overall rates of any AEs, drug-related AEs, and discontinuation due to AEs through week 96 were lower in the DOR/3TC/TDF group than in the EFV/FTC/TDF group, consistent with the results from week 48 (Table 4). Through week 96, a total of 38 participants experienced AEs that resulted in discontinuation from the study (11 [3.0%] in the DOR/3TC/TDF group and 27 [6.6%] in the EFV/FTC/TDF group). This total included 1 additional participant from the DOR/3TC/TDF group (depression) and 3 additional participants who discontinued since the week 48-time point in the EFV/FTC/TDF group (1 each with dizziness/headache/somnolence, sleep disorder, and abnormal dreams). The most common AE that led to discontinuation in the EFV/FTC/TDF group was rash, with 10 participants total; only 1 additional case of rash was reported in the EFV/FTC/TDF group after week 48. No participants in the DOR/3TC/TDF group discontinued due to rash. No AE leading to discontinuation in the DOR/3TC/TDF group occurred in > 1 participant.

### Efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [^1157yRQR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Analysis of long-term data from Study 006 showed that, beyond 24 weeks of therapy, the incidences of new-onset nervous system symptoms among EFV-treated subjects were generally similar to those in the indinavir-containing control arm.

Late-onset neurotoxicity, including ataxia and encephalopathy (impaired consciousness, confusion, psychomotor slowing, psychosis, delirium), may occur months to years after beginning EFV therapy. Some events of late-onset neurotoxicity have occurred in patients with CYP2B6 genetic polymorphisms which are associated with increased EFV levels despite standard dosing of EFV. Patients presenting with signs and symptoms of serious neurologic adverse experiences should be evaluated promptly to assess the possibility that these events may be related to EFV use, and whether discontinuation of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is warranted.

Patients receiving efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate should be alerted to the potential for additive central nervous system effects when efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is used concomitantly with alcohol or psychoactive drugs.

Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms such as dizziness, impaired concentration, and/or drowsiness should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating machinery

Summary of Changes in CD4 and Total Lymphocyte Counts

AEs occurred in 90.6% of doravirine/islatravir (100/0.75 mg)–treated and 87.3% of bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide–treated participants. The most frequently reported AEs (≥ 10%) were coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19; 14.1%), lymphocyte count decreased (13.4%), and headache (10.4%) with doravirine/islatravir and COVID-19 (16.4%) and headache (11.0%) with bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide. Infection rates were comparable (54.7% vs 51.5%; Table 4, Supplementary Table 6). There were 2 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention AIDS-Defining Category C events with doravirine/islatravir (Pneumocystis jirovecii, disseminated tuberculosis) and 1 with bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (cytomegalovirus colitis). These events occurred at or near the start of study intervention in participants with baseline CD4 counts < 20 cells/µL and were not considered treatment-related. Two deaths in the doravirine/islatravir group (gunshot wound, P. jirovecii pneumonia) were unrelated to treatment.

### Bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide versus dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine for initial treatment of HIV-1 infection (GS-US-380-1489): a double-blind, multicentre, phase 3, randomised controlled non-inferiority trial [^113cAUw4]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) are recommended components of initial antiretroviral therapy with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Bictegravir is a novel, potent INSTI with a high in-vitro barrier to resistance and low potential as a perpetrator or victim of clinically relevant drug-drug interactions. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of bictegravir coformulated with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide as a fixed-dose combination versus coformulated dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine.

Methods

We did this double-blind, multicentre, active-controlled, randomised controlled non-inferiority trial at 122 outpatient centres in nine countries in Europe, Latin America, and North America. We enrolled HIV-1 infected adults (aged ≥ 18 years) who were previously untreated (HIV-1 RNA ≥ 500 copies per mL); HLA-B✱5701-negative; had no hepatitis B virus infection; screening genotypes showing sensitivity to emtricitabine, tenofovir, lamivudine, and abacavir; and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 50 mL/min or more. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), via a computer-generated allocation sequence (block size of four), to receive coformulated bictegravir 50 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg, and tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg or coformulated dolutegravir 50 mg, abacavir 600 mg, and lamivudine 300 mg, with matching placebo, once daily for 144 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by HIV-1 RNA (≤ 100000 copies per mL, > 100000 to ≤ 400000 copies per mL, or > 400000 copies per mL), CD4 count (< 50 cells per μL, 50–199 cells per μL, or ≥ 200 cells per μL), and region (USA or ex-USA). Investigators, participants, and study staff giving treatment, assessing outcomes, and collecting data were masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL at week 48, as defined by the US Food and Drug Administration snapshot algorithm, with a prespecified non-inferiority margin of -12%. All participants who received one dose of study drug were included in primary efficacy and safety analyses. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02607930.

Findings

Between Nov 13, 2015, and July 14, 2016, we randomly assigned 631 participants to receive coformulated bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide (n = 316) or coformulated dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine (n = 315), of whom 314 and 315 patients, respectively, received at least one dose of study drug. At week 48, HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL was achieved in 92.4% of patients (n = 290 of 314) in the bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide group and 93.0% of patients (n = 293 of 315) in the dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine group (difference -0.6%, 95.002% CI -4.8 to 3.6; p = 0.78), demonstrating non-inferiority of bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide to dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine. No individual developed treatment-emergent resistance to any study drug. Incidence and severity of adverse events was mostly similar between groups except for nausea, which occurred less frequently in patients given bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide than in those given dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine (10% [n = 32] vs 23% [n = 72]; p < 0.0001). Adverse events related to study drug were less common with bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide than with dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine (26% [n = 82] vs 40% [n = 127]), the difference being driven by a higher incidence of drug-related nausea in the dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine group (5% [n = 17] vs 17% [n = 55]; p < 0.0001).

Interpretation

At 48 weeks, coformulated bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide achieved virological suppression in 92% of previously untreated adults and was non-inferior to coformulated dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine, with no treatment-emergent resistance. Bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide was safe and well tolerated with better gastrointestinal tolerability than dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine. Because coformulated bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide does not require HLA-B✱5701 testing and provides guideline-recommended treatment for individuals co-infected with HIV and hepatitis B, this regimen might lend itself to rapid or same-day initiation of therapy in the clinical setting.

Introduction

Efavirenz (EFV) played a decisive role in HIV treatment strategies because of therapeutic effectiveness and regimen simplicity, but nowadays, the use of EFV-based combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) remains an alternative option for first-line therapy as stated by some international guidelines for reasons, including neuropsychological tolerability. Though the appearance of neuropsychiatric symptoms, usually short-lasting after therapy initiation, well recognized and mostly transient, like abnormal dreams, dizziness, somatization, irritability, and stress can persist in some individuals for several months or years with a proportion of individuals who may experience depression at any time during the treatment with EFV. In contrast, the association between EFV and neurocognitive impairment (NCI) remains unclear and controversial: worst neurocognitive performances have been associated with EFV in some cohort studies but not in others. Moreover, replacing EFV seems not to be associated with a change in neurocognitive performance in prospective studies.

Bictegravir (BIC) is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) approved as first-line in cART-naive and virologically suppressed individuals combined with emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF) in a single tablet regimen (STR).

Whether changes in ART toward more innovative regimens, such as BIC/F/TAF, have an impact on neuropsychological symptoms and/or cognition has not yet been investigated.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Doravirine/islatravir is an investigational, once-daily regimen being studied for HIV-1 treatment.

Methods

In this phase 3, double-blind, non-inferiority trial, previously untreated people with HIV-1 (≥ 18 years) were randomized (1:1) and stratified by HIV-1 RNA (≤ / > 100,000 copies/mL) and CD4 count (< / ≥ 200 cells/µL) to doravirine/islatravir (100/0.75 mg) or bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (50/200/25 mg) orally once-daily, with matching placebos (NCT04233879). The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of participants with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at week 48 (FDA snapshot; non-inferiority margin 10%).

Results

597 participants were randomized and treated; enrollment stopped early due to decreases in CD4 and lymphocyte counts observed in other islatravir studies. At week 48, doravirine/islatravir (100/0.75 mg) was non-inferior to bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide: 265/298 (88.9%) versus 264/299 (88.3%) had HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL (difference 0.5%, 95%CI -4.7 to 5.6). Mean change from baseline in CD4 count was +182 and +234 cells/µL (difference -50, 95%CI -79 to -21) with doravirine/islatravir versus bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide. Mean change in lymphocyte count was 0.01 and 0.21 x 109/L (difference -0.20, 95%CI -0.30 to -0.10). Adverse events (AEs) occurred in 90.6% and 87.3% of participants, with COVID-19 being the most common (14.1%, 16.4%). Treatment-related AEs were similar (28.9%, 25.8%). AEs leading to discontinuations were higher with doravirine/islatravir (8.7%, 3.7%) due to protocol-specified criteria requiring discontinuation for decreased CD4 and lymphocyte counts.

Conclusions

Doravirine/islatravir (100/0.75 mg) once-daily was non-inferior to bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide through week 48 for initial HIV-1 treatment. Due to decreases in CD4 and lymphocyte counts, development of this dose of doravirine/islatravir was stopped.

Clinical Trial in Adults with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Receiving Chronic Hemodialysis

The safety of FTC and TAF (components of BIKTARVY) was evaluated in a single arm, open-label trial (Trial 1825) in virologically-suppressed adults with ESRD (estimated creatinine clearance of less than 15 mL/min) on chronic hemodialysis treated with FTC+TAF in combination with elvitegravir and cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet for 96 weeks (N = 55). The most commonly reported adverse reaction (adverse event assessed as causally related by investigator and all grades) was nausea (7%). Serious adverse events were reported in 65% of participants and the most common serious adverse events were pneumonia (15%), fluid overload (7%), hyperkalemia (11%) and osteomyelitis (7%). Overall 7% of participants permanently discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. In an extension phase of Trial 1825 in which 10 participants switched to BIKTARVY for 48 weeks, the safety findings were similar to those in the initial phase of the open-label trial [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Studies (14.3)].

Abstract

Background

Doravirine/islatravir is an investigational regimen that is being studied for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) treatment.

Methods

In this phase 3, double-blind, double-dummy trial (NCT04233879), previously untreated adults with HIV-1 were randomized (1:1) and stratified by HIV-1 RNA (≤ / > 100 000 copies/mL) and CD4 count (< / ≥ 200 cells/µL) to doravirine/islatravir (100/0.75 mg) or bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (50/200/25 mg) orally once-daily (primary endpoint: percentage of participants with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at week 48; US Food and Drug Administration snapshot, 10% noninferiority margin).

Results

Overall, 597 participants were treated; enrollment stopped early due to decreases in CD4 and lymphocyte counts observed in other islatravir studies. Doravirine/islatravir was noninferior to bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide: 265 of 298 (88.9%) versus 264 of 299 (88.3%) had HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL (difference, 0.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: −4.7, 5.6). Mean change from baseline in CD4 count was +182 and +234 cells/µL (difference, −50; 95% CI: −79, −21) with doravirine/islatravir versus bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide. Mean change in lymphocyte count was 0.01 and 0.21 × 10⁹/L (difference, −0.20; 95% CI: −0.30, −0.10). Adverse events (AEs) occurred in 90.6% and 87.3% of participants, with coronavirus disease 2019 being most common (14.1%, 16.4%). Treatment-related AEs were similar (28.9%, 25.8%). AEs that led to discontinuations were higher with doravirine/islatravir (8.7%, 3.7%) due to protocol-specified criteria that required discontinuation for decreased CD4 and lymphocyte counts.

Conclusions

Doravirine/islatravir (100/0.75 mg) once-daily was noninferior to bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide through week 48 for initial HIV-1 treatment. Due to decreases in CD4 and lymphocyte counts, development of this dose of doravirine/islatravir was stopped.

Treatment Differences in Virologic Outcomes at Week 48, by Subgroup

Three participants met protocol-defined criteria for resistance testing; all were in the DTG group. No emergent virologic resistance was detected to any component of their regimen.

Both treatments were well tolerated through median duration of exposure of 58.6 (interquartile range [IQR], 53.1–63.3) weeks for the B/F/TAF group and 58.3 (IQR, 52.3–63.3) weeks for the DTG + F/TAF group. Most AEs were mild or moderate in severity. Table 4 shows AEs reported by 5% or more of participants in either group. AEs leading to study drug discontinuation occurred in 2% of participants in each group (6/284 B/F/TAF, 6/281 DTG + F/TAF). Study drug–related AEs were reported for 41 participants (14%) on B/F/TAF and 28 (10%) on DTG + F/TAF; events were primarily mild or moderate in severity. Most common drug-related AEs were diarrhea and headache; each was reported in 1% on B/F/TAF and 2% on DTG + F/TAF. One participant in each group died during the study. In the B/F/TAF group, 1 individual died of cardiopulmonary arrest, assessed as not related to study drug by the investigator. In the DTG + F/TAF group, 1 participant died of suspected myocardial infarction, assessed as related to the study drug by the investigator. No pregnancies were reported during the study.

### Bictegravir / emtricitabine / tenofovir alafenamide as initial treatment for HIV-1: five-year follow-up from two randomized trials [^116Wvvnf]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) is a single-tablet regimen recommended for HIV-1 treatment. The safety and efficacy of B/F/TAF as initial therapy was established in two Phase 3 studies: 1489 (vs dolutegravir [DTG]/abacavir/lamivudine) and 1490 (vs DTG + F/TAF). After 144 weeks of randomized follow-up, an open-label extension evaluated B/F/TAF to 240 weeks.

Methods

Of 634 participants randomized to B/F/TAF, 519 completed the double-blinded treatment, and 506/634 (80%) chose the 96-week open-label B/F/TAF extension, which was completed by 444/506 (88%) participants. Efficacy was based on the secondary outcome of the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 240 by missing = excluded and missing = failure methods. All 634 participants who were randomized to B/F/TAF and received at least one dose of B/F/TAF were included in efficacy and safety analyses. (Study 1489: ClinicalTrials.govNCT02607930; EudraCT 2015-004024-54. Study 1490: ClinicalTrials.govNCT02607956; EudraCT 2015-003988-10).

Findings

Of those with available virologic data, 98.6% (95% CI [97.0%-99.5%], 426/432) maintained HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 240 (missing = excluded); when missing virologic data were considered as failure, 67.2% (95% CI [63.4%-70.8%], 426/634) maintained HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL. Mean (SD) change in CD4+ count from baseline was +338 (236.2) cells/μL. No treatment-emergent resistance to B/F/TAF was detected. Adverse events led to drug discontinuation in 1.6% (n = 10/634) of participants (n = 5 with events considered drug-related). No discontinuations were due to renal adverse events. Median (IQR) total cholesterol increased 21 (1,42) mg/dL from baseline; the change in total cholesterol:HDL was 0.1 (-0.5,0.6). Median (IQR) weight change from baseline was +6.1 kg (2.0, 11.7) at Week 240. In Study 1489, hip and spine bone mineral density mean percent changes from baseline were ≤ 0.6%.

Interpretation

Through 5 years of follow-up, B/F/TAF maintained high rates of virologic suppression with no treatment-emergent resistance and rare drug discontinuations due to adverse events. These results demonstrate the durability and safety of B/F/TAF in people with HIV.

### Switch to bictegravir / emtricitabine / tenofovir alafenamide from dolutegravir-based therapy [^111dKA86]. AIDS (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of 96weeks of bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) treatment in participants switching from dolutegravir (DTG)-based therapy.

Design

Studies 1489 (NCT02607930) and 1490 (NCT02607956) were phase 3 randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, first-line therapy trials in people with HIV-1. After 144weeks of DTG-based or B/F/TAF treatment, participants could enter a 96-week open-label extension (OLE) of B/F/TAF.

Methods

A pooled analysis evaluated viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA < 50copies/ml) and changes in CD4 + cell count at OLE Weeks 48 and 96, treatment-emergent resistance, safety, and tolerability after switch from a DTG-based regimen to B/F/TAF. Outcomes by prior treatment were summarized using descriptive statistics and compared by two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test.

Results

At OLE Week 96, participants who switched to B/F/TAF (N = 519) maintained high levels of virologic suppression (99.5 and 99.1% in those switching from DTG/abacavir/lamivudine and DTG+F/TAF, respectively) and CD4 + cell count, with no treatment-emergent resistance to B/F/TAF. Twenty-one participants experienced drug-related adverse events after switching, with diarrhea, weight gain, and headache occurring most commonly. There were no cases of proximal renal tubulopathy, drug-related Grade 4 adverse events, or serious adverse events. Two participants discontinued B/F/TAF due to treatment-related adverse events. Participants who switched from DTG/abacavir/lamivudine experienced statistically significant greater weight gain than those who switched from DTG+F/TAF; however, median weight change from the blinded phase baseline to OLE Week 96 was numerically similar across treatment groups.

Conclusion

This medium-term analysis demonstrates the safety and efficacy of switching to B/F/TAF from a DTG-containing regimen in people with HIV-1.

### Severe rhabdomyolysis and acute asymptomatic pancreatitis following the concomitant use of biktarvy in the setting of hyperosmolar diabetic crisis [^115oReSq]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Biktarvy (bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafemanide), which has been recently approved for the treatment of HIV, is a single-pill regimen that associates bictegravir and a novel integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) with a combination of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafemanide. Among treatment complications, rhabdomyolysis has been reported in association with some NRTI and INSTI but never with bictegravir. Acute pancreatitis has also been reported recently with another INSTI, dolutegravir. We report here a 62-year-old man with diabetes and HIV infection, and receiving Biktarvy for 1month. He presented to the emergency department for muscular pain and fatigue. He was on treatment with Descovy (tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine) and Viramune (nevirapine) for 2years but he recently asked for a regimen simplification. Severe rhabdomyolysis and acute pancreatitis were diagnosed. Although the aetiology of these events could be multifactorial, it cannot be ruled out that this episode could be linked to a potential side effect of bictegravir.

5.6 Nervous System Symptoms

Fifty-three percent (531/1,008) of subjects receiving EFV in controlled trials reported central nervous system symptoms (any grade, regardless of causality) compared to 25% (156/635) of subjects receiving control regimens. These symptoms included dizziness (28.1% of the 1,008 subjects), insomnia (16.3%), impaired concentration (8.3%), somnolence (7.0%), abnormal dreams (6.2%), and hallucinations (1.2%). Other reported symptoms were euphoria, confusion, agitation, amnesia, stupor, abnormal thinking, and depersonalization. The majority of these symptoms were mild to moderate (50.7%); symptoms were severe in 2.0% of subjects. Overall, 2.1% of subjects discontinued therapy as a result. These symptoms usually begin during the first or second day of therapy and generally resolve after the first 2 to 4 weeks of therapy. After 4 weeks of therapy, the prevalence of nervous system symptoms of at least moderate severity ranged from 5% to 9% in subjects treated with regimens containing EFV and from 3% to 5% in subjects treated with a control regimen. Patients should be informed that these common symptoms were likely to improve with continued therapy and were not predictive of subsequent onset of the less frequent psychiatric symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Dosing at bedtime may improve the tolerability of these nervous system symptoms [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

### Switching to bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide in virologically suppressed adults with human immunodeficiency virus [^111huDs7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Bictegravir (B)/emtricitabine (F)/tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is guideline-recommended treatment for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). We evaluated whether people receiving dolutegravir (DTG) plus F/TAF or F/TDF (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) with viral suppression can switch to B/F/TAF without compromising safety or efficacy, regardless of preexisting nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) resistance.

Methods

In this multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, active-controlled, noninferiority trial, we enrolled adults who were virologically suppressed for ≥ 6 months before screening (with documented/suspected NRTI resistance) or ≥ 3 months before screening (with no documented/suspected NRTI resistance) on DTG plus either F/TDF or F/TAF. We randomly assigned (1:1) participants to switch to B/F/TAF or DTG + F/TAF once daily for 48 weeks, each with matching placebo. The primary endpoint was proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL at week 48 (snapshot algorithm); the prespecified noninferiority margin was 4%.

Results

Five hundred sixty-seven adults were randomized; 565 were treated (284 B/F/TAF, 281 DTG + F/TAF). At week 48, B/F/TAF was noninferior to DTG + F/TAF, as 0.4% (1/284) vs 1.1% (3/281) had HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL (difference, −0.7% [95.001% confidence interval {CI}, −2.8% to 1.0%]). There were no significant differences in efficacy among participants with suspected or confirmed prior NRTI resistance (n = 138). No participant had treatment-emergent drug resistance. Median weight change from baseline at week 48 was +1.3 kg (B/F/TAF) vs +1.1 kg (DTG + F/TAF) (P = 0.46). Weight change differed by baseline NRTIs (+2.2 kg [F/TDF] and +0.6 kg [F/TAF], P < .001), with no differences between B/F/TAF and DTG + F/TAF.

Conclusions

The single-tablet regimen B/F/TAF is a safe, effective option for people virologically suppressed on DTG plus either F/TDF or F/TAF, including in individuals with preexisting resistance to NRTIs.

Central nervous system (CNS) symptoms have been reported in clinical trials and case reports in patients receiving raltegravir. We investigated CNS symptoms in 453 HIV-infected patients. Of these 47 (10.4%) developed at least one drug-related CNS symptom. Predictors of CNS symptoms were concomitant therapy with tenofovir or with proton pump inhibitors that can increase raltegravir concentration. Thus, our data suggest a possible correlation between high raltegravir plasma concentrations and CNS symptoms, and therefore their monitoring in clinical practice.

Methods

Study setting

We analysed the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) database, a large prospective and ongoing cohort study in Switzerland with continuous enrolment of HIV-infected individuals of 16 years or older. In the SHCS, basic sociodemographic characteristics, clinical course, ART, reasons for discontinuation or change of the ART regime, comedication, immunological, and virological data as well as information on comorbidity and coinfections are collected at registration into the study and every 6 months thereafter on standardized protocols. For the present analysis we used SHCS database update of January 2017.

Study population

All HIV-infected individuals participating in the SHCS starting an antiretroviral regime containing raltegravir or dolutegravir combined with appropriate backbone between 1 April 2006 and 31 December 2015 and who had a follow-up of at least 12 months were eligible for this study.

Definitions

Treatment modification was defined as discontinuation or switch of ART within the first year of treatment. Discontinuation was defined as stopping dolutegravir or raltegravir for at least 4 weeks. A switch to another regimen was defined as changing one or more drugs within 4 weeks after stopping ART. The main reason for treatment modification was classified as treatment failure, intolerance, and/or toxic effects, the patient's choice, the physician's decision, and other reasons. Since 2014 more detailed reasons for drug discontinuation were introduced and prospectively collected in the SHCS database, including treatment simplification, concerns about drug interactions and adherence. Toxicity, predominantly from the nervous system was specifically coded detailed as neuropsychiatric toxicity, headache, or peripheral neuropathy.

Safety

B/F/TAF was well tolerated. Only 19 (3.7%) patients discontinued owing to adverse events as follows: neurocognitive toxicity, five; gastrointestinal toxicity, four; weight gain, three; renal toxicity, two; muscle pain, two; metabolic toxicity, one; pruritus, one; and rash, one. Six patients died during follow-up, although reasons of death were probably not related with B/F/TAF [sudden death, 3 (probably cardiovascular disease); prostate cancer, 1; lung disease, 1; and SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 1].

In 12 cases, patients or doctors decided to change medication for reasons not related to toxicity (simplification or other), and 23 (4.5%) patients were missing at week 48 [probably owing to access problems during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in most cases].

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Clinical Trials in Adult Subjects

Study 934 was an open-label active-controlled trial in which 511 antiretroviral-naïve subjects received either FTC + TDF administered in combination with EFV (N = 257) or zidovudine (AZT)/lamivudine (3TC) administered in combination with EFV (N = 254).

The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10%, any severity) occurring in Study 934 include diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, and rash. Adverse reactions observed in Study 934 were generally consistent with those seen in previous trials of the individual components (Table 1).

Table 1 Selected Adverse Reactions (Grades 2 to 4) Reported in ≥ 5% in Either Treatment Group in Study 934 (0 to 144 Weeks)

In Study 073, subjects with stable, virologic suppression on antiretroviral therapy and no history of virologic failure were randomized to receive efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or to stay on their baseline regimen. The adverse reactions observed in Study 073 were generally consistent with those seen in Study 934 and those seen with the individual components of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets when each was administered in combination with other antiretroviral agents.

### Coformulated bictegravir, emtricitabine, tenofovir alafenamide after initial treatment with bictegravir or dolutegravir and emtricitabine / tenofovir alafenamide [^114qP3QM]. AIDS (2018). Low credibility.

Ninety-two of 98 participants (94%) completed the blinded phase, all of whom switched to a fixed-dose combination of B/F/TAF, 62 from the BIC and F/TAF arm and 30 from the DTG and F/TAF arm. Data were collected until all participants completed at least 72 weeks of treatment including at least 12 weeks of open-label B/F/TAF. At the time of analysis, the median exposure to BIC including blinded and open-label treatment was 75 weeks (interquartile 18, 76).

At week 72, 91 of 92 participants (99%) who enrolled in the open-label phase remained on study and all had HIV-1 RNA suppressed less than 50 copies/ml. One other participant withdrew consent in the open-label phase prior to week 72 and had an HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/ml at the time of discontinuation. In the open-label phase, no subjects met criteria for confirmed virologic failure or resistance testing. Through 72 weeks, no subject treated with B/F/TAF developed resistance to any component of their antiviral regimen.

Adverse events were similar in the blinded and open-label treatment phases. Amongst the 62 subjects randomized to BIC and F/TAF who continued B/F/TAF in the open-label phase, there were 21 adverse events occurring in 16 participants (26%); 18 events were mild in severity (Grade 1), three were moderate in severity (back pain, diarrhea, and hemorrhoids all Grade 2), and none were judged to be related to medications by the investigator. No subject reported a Grade 3 or 4 adverse event. Nine of the 30 participants (30%) who switched to B/F/TAF from DTG and F/TAF reported at least one adverse event after switching, all were mild in severity (Grade 1). Two of these adverse events were judged by the investigator to be related to switching from DTG and F/TAF to B/F/TAF; diarrhea and nausea, which were both Grade 1 events, self-limited and resolved without treatment interruption. No adverse event led to interruption or discontinuation of B/F/TAF in the open-label extension phase. There were no drug-related serious adverse events in either the randomized or open-label extension phases.

Central nervous system toxicity — antiretroviral therapy–associated neuropsychiatric adverse effects in children include anxiety; self-harm thoughts, suicidal ideation, or attempted/completed suicide; drowsiness; neurocognitive deficits; and other manifestations such as sleep disturbances, dizziness, and headache. In children in the ODYSSEY trial, suicidal ideation or behavior was higher with DTG at 2.3% versus 1.4% with SOC ARVs, and overall neuropsychiatric adverse events were 4.3% with DTG versus 2.2% with SOC ARVs; most were transient and did not lead to treatment changes. In adults, 2.7% of neuropsychiatric adverse events in a large prospective cohort resulted in treatment discontinuation, with a higher frequency reported with DTG than with other INSTIs and a suggested class effect. Risk factors noted include higher frequency of overall neuropsychiatric symptoms when DTG is coadministered with ABC and of depression and dizziness when coadministered with RPV, though evidence is conflicting for ABC association.

### Management of HIV-associated tuberculosis in resource-limited settings: a state-of-the-art review [^111Ai3L2]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Co-trimoxazole prophylaxis and ART are recommended for all patients with HIV-associated MDR-TB regardless of CD4 count and the timing of ART initiation is similar as for drug-susceptible TB. Many of the second-line MDR-TB drugs are poorly tolerated and drug discontinuation rates are high as a result of adverse effects. MDR-TB may be a risk factor for TB IRIS in view of slow mycobacterial antigen clearance. Nutritional depletion and co-morbid conditions may further undermine outcomes.

Adverse events are frequent in HIV-infected patients receiving MDR treatment, the most common being gastrointestinal symptoms, peripheral neuropathy, hypothyroidism, deafness, psychiatric symptoms and hypokalemia. In up to 40% of patients these adverse events are severe. This relates to the inherent toxicity associated with MDR drugs; it does not appear that HIV-infected patients experience a higher incidence of adverse events than HIV-uninfected patients, nor that coadministration with ART increases toxicity.

Antiretroviral drugs do share common toxicities with second-line antituberculosis drugs, however (Table 7). Some of the most challenging of these are neuropsychiatric side effects. EFV causes inattention, vivid dreams and dizziness in up to 50% of patients, but in a minority these can be severe with mood disturbance or psychosis. Cycloserine (or terizidone) is a well recognized cause of psychosis, seizures and other CNS side effects although several other drugs such as the quinolones, ethionamide and high dose isoniazid can also cause CNS side effects. If patients develop severe CNS side effects it may be necessary to withdraw all possible culprit drugs with careful sequential reintroduction once resolved. Cycloserine should probably be regarded as the most likely culprit for psychosis and seizures. Antipsychotic or antidepressant medications may be required. EFV should not be routinely avoided because the majority of MDR-TB patients tolerate it well.

For more information about side effects, see the section " What are the possible side effects of TRUVADA? "

Other important information for people who take TRUVADA to help reduce their risk of getting human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection, also called pre-exposure prophylaxis or "PrEP":

Before taking TRUVADA to reduce your risk of getting HIV-1 infection:

You must be HIV-1 negative to start TRUVADA. You must get tested to make sure that you do not already have HIV-1 infection.
Do not take TRUVADA for HIV-1 PrEP unless you are confirmed to be HIV-1 negative.
Some HIV-1 tests can miss HIV-1 infection in a person who has recently become infected. If you have flu-like symptoms, you could have recently become infected with HIV-1. Tell your healthcare provider if you had a flu-like illness within the last month before starting TRUVADA or at any time while taking TRUVADA. Symptoms of new HIV-1 infection include:
tiredness
fever
joint or muscle aches
headache
sore throat
vomiting or diarrhea
rash
night sweats
enlarged lymph nodes in the neck or groin

While you are taking TRUVADA for HIV-1 PrEP:

TRUVADA does not prevent other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Practice safer sex by using a latex or polyurethane condom to reduce the risk of getting STIs.
You must stay HIV-negative to keep taking TRUVADA for HIV-1 PrEP.
Know your HIV-1 status and the HIV-1 status of your partners.
Ask your partners with HIV-1 if they are taking anti-HIV-1 medicines and have an undetectable viral load. An undetectable viral load is when the amount of virus in the blood is too low to be measured in a lab test. To maintain an undetectable viral load, your partners must keep taking HIV-1 medicines every day. Your risk of getting HIV-1 is lower if your partners with HIV-1 are taking effective treatment.
Get tested for HIV-1 at least every 3 months or when your healthcare provider tells you.
Get tested for other STIs such as syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea. These infections make it easier for HIV-1 to infect you.
If you think you were exposed to HIV-1, tell your healthcare provider right away. They may want to do more tests to be sure you are still HIV-1 negative.
Get information and support to help reduce sexual risk behaviors.
Do not miss any doses of TRUVADA. Missing doses increases your risk of getting HIV-1 infection.
If you do become HIV-1 positive, you need more medicine than TRUVADA alone to treat HIV-1. TRUVADA by itself is not a complete treatment for HIV-1.
If you have HIV-1 and take only TRUVADA, over time your HIV-1 may become harder to treat.

### Sex differences in discontinuations due to side effects of second-generation integrase strand transfer inhibitors: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116CGaeo]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Given the inconsistent findings, a synthesis of existing literature is needed to better understand trends in side effects of second-generation INSTIs between sexes. Furthermore, an objective measure, such as discontinuations due to side effects, allows for comparisons between studies and facilitates an evaluation of side effects with a clear clinical impact. Therefore, we conduct a systematic review to assess the differences in discontinuation of dolutegravir or bictegravir-based regimens due to general side effects and neuropsychiatric side effects in women compared to men living with HIV.

### Impact of switching from efavirenz / emtricitabine / tenofovir disoproxil fumarate to bictegravir / emtricitabine / tenofovir alafenamide on psychiatric symptoms and neurocognition [^112PjQvf]. AIDS (2025). Medium credibility.

Overall, the proportion of participants with impaired neurocognitive performances at baseline and after 48 weeks from the switch remained stable. Specifically, NPA revealed NCI in 40.5% of participants at T0 and 42.1% at T1 (P = 0.746).

Among participants with NCI at T0 (51/126), 35% (18/51) improved their performance after the switch, and among those without NCI (75/126) at baseline, 27% (20/75) worsened at w48. At T1, we observed a worsening in NPZ-12 score [median of change between baseline and week 48 = −0.18 (IQR −0.42 to 0.01); P < 0.001] (Fig. 1 c) and particularly, in all domains but that of fine motor functioning (Fig. 1 d). We observed ANI in 5.6% at T0 and 7.9% at T1. No MND or HAD were found. No significantly associated factors with these changes were found nor with NPZ score (Supplemental Fig. 1).

A few central nervous system (CNS) adverse events were observed, all mild: 7 of 126 participants reported insomnia, 4 headaches, 1 asthenia, 1 seizure episode, 1 temporary amnesia, and 4 participants experienced a neurological complication not drug related.

### Fulminant diffuse cerebral toxoplasmosis as the first manifestation of HIV infection [^1162kAeH]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Individuals with HIV may present to the emergency department with HIV-related or HIV-unrelated conditions, toxicity associated with antiretroviral therapy or primary HIV infection (seroconversion). In individuals with HIV infection, central nervous system toxoplasmosis occurs from reactivation of disease, especially when the CD4+ count is < 100cells/μL, whereas in those taking immunosuppressive therapy, this can be either due to newly acquired or reactivated latent infection. It is a rare occurrence in immune-competent patients. Vertical transmission during pregnancy can manifest as congenital toxoplasmosis in the neonate and is often asymptomatic until the second or third decade of life when ocular lesions develop. Toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by the intracellular protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii and causes zoonotic infection. It can cause focal or disseminated brain lesions leading to neurological deficit, coma and death. Typical radiological findings are multiple ring-enhancing lesions. Histopathological examination demonstrating tachyzoites of T. gondii and the presence of nucleic material in the spinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) confirms the diagnosis. The authors present the case of a 52-year-old male UK resident, born in sub-Saharan Africa, with a 3-week history of visual hallucinations. He attended the emergency department on three occasions. Laboratory investigations and a CT head were unremarkable. He was referred to psychological medicine for further evaluation. On his third presentation, 2months later, a CT head showed widespread lesions suggestive of cerebral metastasis. Dexamethasone was initiated and he developed rigours. An MRI head showed multiple ring-enhancing lesions disseminated throughout his brain parenchyma. CSF analysis and serology confirmed the diagnosis of HIV and toxoplasmosis, respectively. His CD4 count was 10 and his viral load (VL) was 1245003. He was then initiated on Biktarvy 50mg/200mg/25mg, one tablet daily, which contains 50mg of bictegravir, 200mg of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate equivalent to 25mg of tenofovir alafenamide. After 3 months of antiretroviral therapy, his HIV VL reduced to 42. However, his abbreviated mental test remained at 2/10. Despite presenting with neurocognitive impairment and being born in a HIV prevalent region, an HIV test was not offered. This case highlights missed opportunities to request HIV serology and raises awareness that cerebral toxoplasmosis can occur as the first manifestation of HIV. Prompt diagnosis and early initiation of antiretroviral therapy reduces morbidity and mortality in this patient cohort.

Bictegravir

BIC was not carcinogenic in a 6-month rasH2 transgenic mouse study at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day in males and 300 mg/kg/day in females. BIC was not carcinogenic in a 2-year rat study at doses up to 300 mg/kg/day, which resulted in exposures of approximately 31 times the exposure in humans at the recommended dose of BIKTARVY.

BIC was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial test (Ames test), mouse lymphoma or rat micronucleus assays.

BIC did not affect fertility, reproductive performance or embryonic viability in male and female rats at 29 times higher exposures (AUC) than in humans at the recommended dose of BIKTARVY.

Emtricitabine

In long-term carcinogenicity studies of FTC, no drug-related increases in tumor incidence were found in mice at doses up to 750 mg per kg per day (25 times the human systemic exposure at the recommended dose of BIKTARVY) or in rats at doses up to 600 mg per kg per day (30 times the human systemic exposure at the recommended dose of BIKTARVY).

FTC was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial test (Ames test), mouse lymphoma or mouse micronucleus assays.

FTC did not affect fertility in male rats at approximately 140 times or in male and female mice at approximately 60 times higher exposures (AUC) than in humans given the recommended dose of BIKTARVY. Fertility was normal in the offspring of mice exposed daily from before birth (in utero) through sexual maturity at daily exposures (AUC) of approximately 60 times higher than human exposures at the recommended dose of BIKTARVY.

At week 48, doravirine/islatravir (100/0.75 mg) was noninferior to bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide for the primary endpoint of HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL (88.9% vs 88.3%; difference, 0.5; multiplicity-adjusted 95% CI: −4.7 to 5.6) in the FAS (Table 2). The efficacy of doravirine/islatravir was comparable to that of bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide across all subgroups (Figure 2). In participants with a baseline HIV-1 RNA > 100 000 copies/mL, 75.9% (41 of 54) on doravirine/islatravir and 85.0% (51 of 60) on bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide had HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL (difference, −9.1; 95% CI: −24.1 to 5.6). Three participants in the doravirine/islatravir group and 6 in the bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide group had HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL. The remaining participants (10 of 54 doravirine/islatravir vs 3 of 60 bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide) had missing data in the week 48 window; nearly all (8 of 10 vs 3 of 3) achieved viral suppression at their last visit (data on file). No differences between groups were observed for HIV-1 RNA < 40 and < 200 copies/mL (Table 2). PPS results were consistent with the FAS (Supplementary Table 3).
