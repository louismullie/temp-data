## Question

1. A positive number $x$ was increased by $69 \%$. By what percentage did the number $\sqrt{\frac{x}{5}}$ increase?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how much the expression (\\sqrt{\\frac{x}{5}}) increases when the positive number (x) is increased by 69%. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to represent the 69% increase in (x) algebraically. Then, I should compute the new value of (\\sqrt{\\frac{x}{5}}) after the increase. Next, I will calculate the relative change and convert it to a percentage. Finally, I should verify the result and consider whether any rounding or simplification is appropriate before stating the answer.

> Let me first confirm the setup. A 69% increase in (x) means the new value is (x + 0.69x = 1.69x), so I should substitute (1.69x) into the expression (\\sqrt{\\frac{x}{5}}) to get the new value (\\sqrt{\\frac{1.69x}{5}}) [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the algebraic simplification. I can factor out the constant inside the square root: (\\sqrt{\\frac{1.69x}{5}} = \\sqrt{1.69} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{x}{5}}). Since (\\sqrt{1.69} = 1.3), the new expression is (1.3 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{x}{5}}), which means the original expression has been multiplied by 1.3 [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the percentage increase. I initially thought "multiplied by 1.3 equals a 30% increase", but that would be incorrect because a multiplier of 1.3 corresponds to a 30% increase only when the original value is 1. Here, the correct way is to compute the relative change as (\\frac{\\text{new} - \\text{old}}{\\text{old}} = \\frac{1.3 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{x}{5}} - \\sqrt{\\frac{x}{5}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{x}{5}}} = 1.3–1 = 0.3), which is a 30% increase [^notfound].

> I should double-check that this result is independent of the specific value of (x). Because the transformation is a scalar multiplication of the original expression, the percentage change in (\\sqrt{\\frac{x}{5}}) is indeed the same for any positive (x), confirming generality of the 30% increase [^notfound].

> Final answer: The number (\\sqrt{\\frac{x}{5}}) increases by 30% when (x) is increased by 69% [^notfound].

---

The expression (\\sqrt{\\frac{x}{5}}) increases by **30%** when (x) is increased by 69%. This is because increasing (x) by 69% multiplies it by 1.69, and since the square root of 1.69 is 1.3, the new value of (\\sqrt{\\frac{x}{5}}) is 1.3 times the original, representing a 30% increase.

---

## Step-by-step solution

Let the original value of (x) be (x_0). After a 69% increase, the new value is:

[
x_{\\text{new}} = x_0 + 0.69x_0 = 1.69x_0
]

Now, consider the original expression (\\sqrt{\\frac{x_0}{5}}). After the increase, the new expression is:

[
\\sqrt{\\frac{x_{\\text{new}}}{5}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1.69x_0}{5}} = \\sqrt{1.69} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{x_0}{5}} = 1.3 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{x_0}{5}}
]

Thus, the new value is 1.3 times the original, which corresponds to a **30% increase**.

---

## General principle

This result illustrates a general principle: when a variable inside a square root is scaled by a factor, the square root scales by the square root of that factor. Here, scaling (x) by 1.69 scales (\\sqrt{x}) by (\\sqrt{1.69} = 1.3), yielding a 30% increase.

---

## Conclusion

When (x) increases by 69%, (\\sqrt{\\frac{x}{5}}) increases by **30%**.

### Fractional response analysis reveals logarithmic cytokine responses in cellular populations [^3e14a7a3]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Fractional response curves

Outcomes of physiological processes, e.g. of inflammation or stress responses, depend on the number of cells with specific responses, rather than on their mean or median, which constitutes the fraction of cells with a given response as a biologically relevant variable. We proposed, therefore, to quantify dose–responses in terms of cellular fractions and show here how this can be achieved for multivariate data.

We first introduced the fractional response curve (FRC) that quantifies fractions of cells that exhibit different responses to a change in dose, or in fact any other experimental condition. For each subsequent dose, the increase of FRC reflects the fraction of cells that exhibit responses different from lower doses. Adding cumulatively distinct fractions results in counting the number of distinct response distributions.

For an illustration of FRC, in addition to the formal definition derived in Methods, we considered a simple hypothetical example involving one signaling effector and three doses, although the approach extends to a general multivariate scenario. Response distributions to three doses, x 1, x 2, x 3, which can be interpreted as control, intermediate, and high dose, are shown in Fig. 2a. When dose 1 was considered alone, fractions of cells with all possible responses sum up to 1 (Fig. 2b). Therefore, we defined the value of the FRC for dose 1 to be 1, and write r(x 1) = 1. We then asked what fraction of the cellular population exhibits different responses after the change from dose 1 to dose 2. The fraction of cells exhibiting different responses is equivalent to the overall increase in the frequency of responses (Fig. 2c, green region). The overall fractional increase, denoted as ∆ r, is calculated as the area of the green region, and ∆ r = 0.31, represents the 31% of the cellular population exhibiting different responses due to dose increase. Therefore, we defined the value of the FRC for dose 2 to be the sum of the previous value and the fractional increment, r (x 2) = r (x 1) + ∆ r = 1.31. When dose 3 was considered, the fraction of cells that exhibited different responses is again equivalent to the overall increase in the frequency of different responses, now compared with the two lower doses (Fig. 2d). As before, the overall increase, ∆ r, is equivalent to the area of the yellow region (Fig. 2d), with ∆r = 0.74, representing 74% of cells stimulated with dose 3 exhibiting responses different to populations stimulated with lower doses. Again, the value of the FRC for dose 3 was defined as the sum of the previous value and the fractional increment, r(x 3) = r(x 2) + ∆r = 2.05. Changes in the FRC show what fraction of cells exhibit different responses owing to the dose increase. Adding subsequent fractional increments, ∆r, leads to the value of FRC expressed in terms of the cumulative fraction of cells that exhibit different responses due to dose change.

### The athlete's hematological response to hypoxia: a meta-analysis on the influence of altitude exposure on key biomarkers of erythropoiesis [^d766b8bc]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

Altitude training is associated with changes in blood markers, which can confound results of the Athlete?s Biological Passport (ABP). This meta-analysis aims to describe the fluctuations during- and post-altitude in key ABP variables; hemoglobin concentration ([Hb]), square-root transformed reticulocyte percentage (sqrt(retic%)) and the OFF-score. Individual de-identified raw data were provided from 17 studies. Separate linear mixed effects analyses were performed for delta values from baseline for [Hb], sqrt(retic%) and OFF-score, by altitude phase (during and post). Mixed models were fitted with the hierarchical structure: study and subject within study as random effects. Delta values as response variables and altitude dose (in kilometer hours; km.hr = altitude (m) / 1000 x hours), sex, age, protocol and baseline values as fixed effects. Allowances were made for potential autocorrelation. Within two days at natural altitude [Hb] rapidly increased. Subsequent delta [Hb] values increased with altitude dose, reaching a plateau of 0.94 g/dL [95%CI (0.69, 1.20)] at ~1000 km.hr. Delta sqrt(retic%) and OFF-score were the first to identify an erythrocyte response, with respective increases and decreases observed within 100 to 200 km.hr. Post-altitude, [Hb] remained elevated for two weeks. Delta sqrt(retic%) declined below baseline, the magnitude of change was dependent on altitude dose. Baseline values were a significant covariate (p < 0.05). The response to altitude is complex resulting in a wide range of individual responses, influenced primarily by altitude dose and baseline values. Improved knowledge of the plausible hematological variations during- and post-altitude provides fundamental information for both the ABP expert and sports physician.

### Cost implications of PSA screening differ by age [^914a7a96]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

In Fig. 2, we show how different screening prevalences among men from different age groups influence costs. Increasing the prevalence of screening from the observed baseline in the multispecialty group (where the baseline prevalence is represented by the point each line intersects with the x-axis) is associated with increased costs from the current scenario. As the groups increased in age, there was a greater effect on overall cost from varying screening rate with the highest costs associated with changing screening amongst the oldest men. For each 5-percentage point increase in PSA screening among men 70 years and older, the total costs to the health care system increased by 13.8%. A 5-percentage point increase in PSA screening among men age 50–54 and 55–69 resulted in a smaller increase in total costs: 2.3% and 7.3% increase in total costs from the current scenario, respectively.

Fig. 2
Change in the percentage of total costs of prostate cancer screening, diagnosis, treatment, and associated complications as a function of PSA screening prevalence among eligible men. Observed screening prevalence at the multispecialty group is represented by the point each line intersects with the x-axis

In assessing the cost impact of men age 70 and older with low risk prostate cancer choosing active surveillance instead of radical prostatectomy, we used $3,782 as the cost of active surveillance over a 1-year time frame in contrast to the 30 day-time frame (radiation) and 90-day time frame (prostatectomy) used to determine the costs of active treatment. In our initial scenario, only 7.7% of the 26 men over 70 diagnosed with low risk disease were estimated to receive active surveillance. For every 10-percentage point increase in the proportion of low risk men 70+ who elect active surveillance, there would be a resulting 2.1% reduction in costs treating men in this age group and a more modest 1.1% reduction in total costs compared to the current scenario.

### Understanding relative risk, odds ratio, and related terms: as simple as it can get [^6f692c2d]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Risk, and related measures of effect size (for categorical outcomes) such as relative risks and odds ratios, are frequently presented in research articles. Not all readers know how these statistics are derived and interpreted, nor are all readers aware of their strengths and limitations. This article examines several measures, including absolute risk, attributable risk, attributable risk percent, population attributable risk percent, relative risk, odds, odds ratio, and others. The concept and method of calculation are explained for each of these in simple terms and with the help of examples. The interpretation of each is presented in plain English rather than in technical language. Clinically useful notes are provided, wherever necessary.

### A randomized trial of continuous positive airway pressure for the asthma of obesity [^35cd8cd4]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 5
Effect of CPAP treatment on airway responsiveness in people with asthma and controls

1 p value for Wilcoxon rank sum for % changes, and log-transformed values for Mean ΔPC100A X

2 One participant in CPAP and one in sham group unable to complete methacholine at Visit 3

3 Positive value indicates greater response at visit 3, i.e. increase in airway responsiveness

4 Concentration of methacholine producing 100% increase in A X could not be determined in 2 participants in group A, and 1 in group B, because test was terminated when R 5 increased by 50%

5 Value shown is ln LS mean (SE) difference between methacholine concentration producing 100% increase in A X between visit 2 and 3, negative value indicates a decrease in methacholine concentration at visit 3, i.e. increase in airway responsiveness

There were no significant differences in the response to methacholine in either R 5 or A X in people with asthma (Table 5; Fig. 2). There was a small but significant difference in the R 5 response in people with obesity but without asthma, although this would have disappeared with a correction for multiple comparisons. There was merely a trend towards a small improvement in the A X response, so the somewhat larger response in R5 could mean that there was more of an effect on ASM compared to lung derecruitment.

### Excess deaths in the United States during the first year of COVID-19 [^b9a073b5]. Preventive Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Accurately determining the number of excess deaths caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is hard. The most important challenge is determining the counterfactual count of baseline deaths that would have occurred in its absence. Flexible estimation methods were used here to provide this baseline number and plausibility of the resulting estimates was evaluated by examining how changes between baseline and actual prior year deaths compared to historical year-over-year changes during the previous decade. Similar comparisons were used to examine the reasonableness of excess death estimates obtained in prior research. Total, group-specific and cause-specific excess deaths in the U.S. from March 2020 through February 2021 were calculated using publicly available data covering all deaths from March 2009 through December 2020 and provisional data for January 2021 and February 2021. The estimates indicate that there were 649,411 (95% CI: 600,133 to 698,689) excess deaths in the U.S. from 3/20–2/21, a 23% (95% CI: 21%-25%) increase over baseline, with 82.9% (95% CI: 77.0% - 89.7%) of these attributed directly to COVID-19. There were substantial differences across population groups and causes in the ratio of actual-to-baseline deaths, and in the contribution of COVID-19 to excess mortality. Prior research has probably often underestimated baseline mortality and so overstated both excess deaths and the percentage of them attributed to non-COVID-19 causes.

### Reassessment intervals for transition from low to high fracture risk among adults older than 50 years [^a918c006]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics for demographic and baseline characteristics are presented as mean (SD) for normally distributed continuous variables, median (interquartile range [IQR]) for continuous variables with a nonnormal distribution, or number (percentage) for categorical variables. There were no missing data for the analytic cohort. Parametric (t tests) and nonparametric (Mann-Whitney test, χ 2 test) methods were used to compare population characteristics according to subsequent treatment threshold qualifications. The Cochran-Armitage test was used to test for linear trend in reaching high fracture risk according to baseline risk categories. We examined the absolute and relative change in MOF and hip fracture risk over time according to change in the number of FRAX clinical risk factors (decrease, no change, or increase). Loess curve smoothing was performed and curves interpolated to 0.1-year increments. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to construct the cumulative incidence of reaching high fracture risk according to fraction of treatment threshold at baseline (< 25%, 25%-49%, 50%-74%, and 75%-99%), and groups were compared using the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate time in years (with 95% CIs) for 10% of the population to reach the treatment threshold according to fraction of the treatment threshold at baseline and change in number of FRAX clinical risk factors (minimum of 1 year and maximum of 15 years at 0.1-year increments). Model covariates included fraction of treatment threshold at baseline, change in the number of FRAX clinical risk factors, and the 2-way interaction term of these variables. The proportional hazards assumptions were tested and confirmed by examining Schoenfeld residuals. The choice of 10% for transition to the treatment threshold was selected based on similar previous analyses. Separate analyses were conducted for the 3 different treatment strategies described previously. In sensitivity analyses, time for 5%, 20%, or 50% of the population to reach the treatment threshold was modeled, and change in the number of FRAX clinical risk factors was substratified as an increase of 1 vs 2 or more. Statistical analyses were performed with Statistica, version 13.0 (StatSoft Inc) and curve smoothing with figure generation using Sigmaplot, version 13.0 (Systat Software Inc). A 2-sided P ≤ .05 indicated statistical significance.

### Can change in FRAX score be used to "treat to target"? A population ‐ based cohort study [^dbddab41]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2014). Low credibility.

It is unknown how responsive the Fracture Risk Assessment (FRAX) tool is to osteoporosis treatment (OTX) or whether it can serve as a target for "goal‐directed" treatment. We studied 11,049 untreated women aged ≥ 50 years undergoing baseline and follow‐up DXA examinations in Manitoba, Canada. We identified clinical risk factors, intervening OTX based on medication possession ratios (MPR), and incident fractures. FRAX scores for major osteoporotic and hip fractures were computed for each scan using the most current(updated) FRAX inputs. Over 4 years, median FRAX scores showed an increase of 1.1% for major fractures and 0.3% for hip fractures, including women highly adherent to OTX (0.6% and 0.1% increases). Few (2.2%) highly adherent women had a decrease in major fracture probability exceeding 4%, whereas 9.0% had a decrease in hip fracture probability exceeding 1%. Compared with untreated women, OTX was associated with a higher dose‐dependent likelihood of attenuating the expected increase in major fracture risk:adjusted odds ratios (aOR) 2.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8–2.9) for MPR < 0.50; 7.3 (95% CI 5.6–9.6) for MPR 0.50–0.79; and 12.0(95% CI 9.5–15.2) for MPR ≥ 0.80. In the 4 years after the second DXA scan, 620 (6%) women had major fractures (152 hip fractures). FRAX scores were strongly predictive of incident major fractures (adjusted hazard ratios [aHR] per SD increase in FRAX 1.8, 95%CI 1.7–1.9) and hip fractures (aHR per SD 4.5, 95% CI 3.7–5.7); however, change in FRAX score was not independently associated with major fracture (p = 0.8) or hip fracture (p = 0.3). In conclusion, FRAX scores slowly increased over time, and this increase was attenuated but not prevented by treatment. Few women had meaningful reductions in FRAX scores, and change in FRAX score did not independently predict incident fracture, suggesting that FRAX with BMD is not responsive enough to be used as a target for goal‐directed treatment.

### American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery review of the body mass index [^c066451d]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Body mass index (BMI) — relationship to body fat mass and percentage shows strong population-level correlations: in 2543 adults measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, total body fat mass was highly correlated with BMI with a correlation coefficient of .825 after adjustment for sex and age, and for each 5-point increase in BMI, total body fat mass increased ~10 kilograms on average; the relationship to body fat percentage followed a more curvilinear (quadratic) pattern that leveled off at higher BMI, with caution advised due to moderate variability around the mean.

### Exploring the impact of cancer registry completeness on international cancer survival differences: a simulation study [^8aede496]. British Journal of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Figure 4 shows the bias — i.e. the degree to which survival is underestimated (expressed in absolute percentage point differences) — in age-standardised 1- and 5-year net survival for scenarios A–C. In the figure it can be seen that the bias increases as the proportion of missed cases increases. The degree of missingness causes the greatest bias and thus has potentially the greatest impact on comparing net survival, among the four factors assessed in the simulation. Further, it can be seen that a smaller relative difference (e.g. RR of 1.5 versus 5) in the risk of being missed between those with the Factor X compared to those without Factor X leads to a larger bias. A higher probability of successful trace-back (0.9 versus 0.7) also results in a larger bias, as does an incorrect date of diagnosis found by trace-back. The bias in both 1- and 5-year survival is largest for cancers with intermediate survival, but cancers with higher survival have a smaller bias in 1-year survival than cancers with lower survival, while the converse is observed for 5-year survival. The largest observed bias in Fig. 4 is just under 3 percentage points for 1-year survival slightly less than 4 percentage points for 5-year survival.

### Average remaining lifetimes can increase as human populations age [^15c585b3]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

Increases in median ages, the most commonly used measure of population ageing, are rapid in today's wealthier countries, and population ageing is widely considered to be a significant challenge to the well-being of citizens there. Conventional measures of age count years since birth; however, as lives lengthen, we need to think of age also in terms of years left until death or in proportion to the expanding lifespan. Here we propose a new measure of ageing: the median age of the population standardized for expected remaining years of life. We show, using historical data and forecasts for Germany, Japan and the United States, that although these populations will be growing older, as measured by their median ages, they will probably experience periods in which they grow younger, as measured by their standardized median ages. Furthermore, we provide forecasts for these countries of the old-age dependency ratio rescaled for increases in life expectancy at birth. These ratios are forecasted to change much less than their unscaled counterparts, and also exhibit periods when the population is effectively growing younger.

### Fractional response analysis reveals logarithmic cytokine responses in cellular populations [^db94414a]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Calculation of the FRC

Calculation of the FRC can be conveniently performed using the typical fractions, as defined above, rather than through integration of Eq. 4. Precisely, to calculate the FRC for the dose, x i, consider doses x 1,…, x i in isolation from higher doses. Then, the sum of typical fractions v 11,…, v ii is equivalent to FRC for the dose x i The equivalency of the above equation and Eq. 4 is derived in the Supplementary Methods.

### An environmental justice analysis of air pollution emissions in the United States from 1970 to 2010 [^30f9fe1b]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

County-level disparities by racial/ethnic groups and socioeconomic status

In a longitudinal analysis from 1970 to 2010, we evaluate the relationship between relative decennial emissions changes and racial/ethnic groups (White, Black, Asian, American Indian, Hispanic) as well as socioeconomic indicators (median family income, median property value, percent poverty, percent unemployment) at the county level across the United States. Figures 2 (racial/ethnic) and 3 (socioeconomic) show all the association curves and we describe our results below. Numeric effect estimates for the linear associations are in Supplementary Table 1. Note that for both linear and nonlinear associations, a positive association indicates percentage point increases in the relative emissions change — i.e. larger relative emissions increases (e.g. from 5 to 10%) or smaller emissions decreases (e.g. from −10 to −5%) — per increase in the demographic variable of interest. Conversely, a negative association indicates percentage point decreases in the relative emission change — i.e. smaller increases (e.g. from 10 to 5%) or more prominent decreases (e.g. from −5 to −10%) — per increase in the demographic variable of interest.

Fig. 2
Association curves for the racial/ethnic groups.

All models are adjusted for population density, urbanicity, EPA geographic region, and year. The x-axis was scaled to improve the visibility of the curve in the low/high x values (squared root for the percent White population and squared for the other demographics). The curves represent the relationship between the demographic variables and change in the relative emissions (percentage point difference) relative to the mean of the demographic variable (e.g. from the national Hispanic population average of 4.5% [during the study period] to 75%, energy NO x relative emissions increase 50 percentage points). The shaded area on the curve is the 95% confidence interval. Linear associations are indicated by the "Linear" label. Density plots for the independent variables are shown at the top of each column.

### Genetic structure characterization of Chileans reflects historical immigration patterns [^226ffbeb]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Increasing the size of the AFR reference panel causes an increase in the global estimates of AFR ancestry proportion, mainly at the expense of EUR ancestry estimates. We start with (NAT, EUR, AFR) reference panels of size (X N = 176, X E = 410, X 0 = 130), and increase the number of haplotypes in the AFR reference panel. Estimates of ancestry percentages change from (41.22, 57.17 and 1.61%) to (41.17, 56.77 and 2.06%) for the total number of haplotypes. The small changes observed in the percentages of ancestry are expected as the Chilean population have small percentages of African ancestry. We set x A = 458 at which it is reached a minimum median s.d. of median sd = 6.75 e −07. Figure 8c shows box plots of the distribution of the s.d. of the estimates of African ancestral proportion as we vary the size of this reference panel.

SNP density effect on global ancestry estimation

We measure the s.d. on the global ancestry estimators of each individual by sampling randomly 10 times different sets of SNPs of the same sample size from chromosome 1. Figure 8d–f shows box plots of the distributions of the s.d. over the Chilean sample at each sample size and for each ancestral population. Note a rapid decay on the median s.d. as SNP density increases. For the Native-American ancestry, the median s.d. starts at 0.108 for a SNP density of 10 and ends at 1.5 e −05 for a SNP density of 10,000. Similarly for the European ancestry, the median s.d. starts at 0.112 for a SNP density of 10 and ends at 1.8 e −05 for a SNP density of 10,000. For the African ancestry, the median s.d. starts at 4.69 e −02 for a SNP density of 10 and ends at 1.68 e −05 for a SNP density of 10,000.

### Biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction in relation to impaired carbohydrate metabolism following pregnancy with gestational diabetes mellitus [^25a04f70]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2014). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

Baseline data were summarized by means and standard deviations (SD) in case of continuous variables as well as by counts and percentages in case of categorical variables. Differences of metric scaled parameters in more than two groups were assessed by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Linear trend analysis was used to assess trends of endothelial biomarkers according to subgroups categorized by their status of insulin sensitivity. The influence of continuous covariates on sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and sE-selectin was assessed by correlation analysis (Pearson's product moment correlation or Spearman's rank correlation) and multivariable regression models, respectively. Fractional polynomials (by using a backward selection algorithm for suitable transformations as proposed by with a family-wise error rate of 5%) were used to model the relationship between endothelial biomarkers and insulin sensitivity. Data transformations were performed in case of skewed distributed baseline variables: PAI-1, triglycerides: ln(x); usCRP, IL-6: ln(x +1). The proportional hazard model (and a survival regression for sensitivity analyis to account for interval censoring) was used to examine the associations of sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and sE-selectin with the incidence of type 2 diabetes during the follow-up period. Analyses of longitudinal data were examined by linear mixed effects models (random intercepts and random slopes by subjects). For some models the random slope was excluded if this was necessary to achieve convergence. A spatial exponential covariance structure was used to model the correlations between repeated measurements. sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 were log transformed (ln(x)) and sE-selectin was square root transformed (sqrt(x)) for longitudinal analyses. IMT data (83 measurements in 69 subjects) was analysed by using a random intercept model accounting for correlated residuals due to repeated measurements in some subjects. In case of linear relationships regression coefficients (β) represent the mean change in the dependent variable for the increase of the independent variable by one unit. If the independent variable is a factor (e.g. GDM status) they can be interpreted as the mean differences of factor levels (i.e. GDM vs. NGT), adjusted for other variables in the model.

Commercial: NO x emissions

The associations between racial/ethnic groups and the relative decennial change in commercial NO x emissions were nonlinear. We found a positive association in county-level White population percentages below 80% and a negative association above that. In the case of the Black population percentage, the association was overall positive. For the Asian percentage population, the association was positive below ~5% and null above that percentage. We found no association with the American Indian percentage population. The Hispanic population percentage was positively associated with the relative change in commercial NO x emissions in population percentages below ~5% and null after that.

The associations between socioeconomic variables and the change in NO x emissions were all nonlinear. Unemployment was positively associated with the relative decennial change in commercial NO x emissions below 5% and negative at higher values. Percent poverty and median property value were overall negatively associated with the relative change in commercial NO x emissions. In the case of percent poverty, the association plateaued after ~20% and for property value, the association was stronger after ~$500 K. The association between median family income and the relative change in commercial NO x emissions was positive below ~$75 K and negative above that.

We have summarized all results described above in Fig. 4.

Fig. 4
Summary of results categorizing the associations into four groups.

(1) Positive association (orange): a unit increase in the demographic variable is associated with a percentage point increase in the relative emissions change (e.g. a larger relative emissions increase or a smaller relative reduction); (2) Negative associations (green): a unit increase in the demographic variable is associated with a percentage point decrease in the relative emissions change (e.g. a smaller relative emissions increase or larger relative reduction); (3) No association (blue) indicates no association between the demographic variable and the decennial relative emission change; and (4) Positive/Negative association (bi-color orange and green): a positive association in the lower values of the demographic variable and a negative in the higher values. This is an oversimplification of results. For detailed results, see Figs. 2 and 3.

### Once-weekly semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity [^3d584436]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

The study STEP 1 was published by John P H Wilding and colleagues in 2021 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Obesity. In the STEP 1 study, the trial question was: what is the role of once weekly semaglutide as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention in adults with overweight or obesity? In the STEP 1 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the STEP 1 study, the population was: 1961 patients (1453 female, 508 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with a BMI of ≥ 30 (or ≥ 27 with ≥ 1 weight-related coexisting condition) who did not have diabetes. The key exclusion criteria were HbA1c ≥ 6.5%, self-reported change in body weight > 5 kg (11 lbs) within 90 days before screening, previous treatment with glucose-lowering agents or any antiobesity medications within the past 90 days before screening. In the STEP 1 study, the interventions were: n = 1306 semaglutide (initiated at 0.25 mg SC once weekly for the first 4 weeks and titrated every 4 weeks to the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly by week 16, plus diet and physical activity counseling) n = 655 placebo (matching placebo once weekly plus diet and physical activity counseling). In the STEP 1 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in relative weight reduction at week 68 (14.9% vs. 2.4%; AD 12.4%, 95% CI 11.5 to 13.4). In the STEP 1 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 10% at week 68 (69.1% vs. 12%; OR 14.7, 95% CI 11.1 to 19.4) Significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a reduction in weight by ≥ 15% at week 68 (50.5% vs. 4.9%; OR 19.3, 95% CI 12.9 to 28.8) Significant increase in absolute weight reduction from baseline to week 68 (15.3 kg vs. 2.6 kg; AD 12.7 kg, 95% CI 11.7 to 13.7). In the STEP 1 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in overall adverse events. significant differences in serious adverse events (9.8% vs. 6.4%), gastrointestinal disorders (74.2% vs. 47.9%), treatment discontinuation due to gastrointestinal events (4.5% vs. 0.8%). In the STEP 1 study, the conclusion was: in patients with a BMI of ≥ 30 (or ≥ 27 with ≥ 1 weight-related coexisting condition) who did not have diabetes, semaglutide was superior to placebo with respect to relative weight reduction at week 68.

### Osteoporosis in men: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^bcb5d653]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Bone mineral density (BMD) monitoring in men — variability, least significant change, and intervals are described as follows: Stable or increasing BMD appears to indicate a good response, and in women with osteopenia the least significant change at the spine and hip is between 3 and 5% in the short term; in studies cited, spine BMD changes were greater than the least significant change in most men treated for 2 yr. Because whether change in BMD is a suitable surrogate for fracture risk reduction in men is unclear, it is noted that in women BMD response to treatment accounts for 4–41% of fracture risk reduction. When the expected rate of bone loss is slow (e.g. untreated men), it may be better to wait longer between measurements (e.g. 2–3 yr), and degenerative change in the spine in older men may falsely give the impression of a gain in BMD.

Longitudinal analysis of induced sputum neutrophil measurements

Bland Altman plots for sputum percentage and numbers/ml at baseline and 1 year are shown in Figure 2. For percentages, the mean change was a 3.5% increase at year 1 compared to baseline, with limits of agreement at 32.3% to -25.4%. The changes between repeated measurements at baseline and 1 year were smaller for samples with higher neutrophil %, with most variability observed at lower neutrophil %. The same pattern was observed for neutrophil numbers/ml. Greater variability was observed for neutrophil numbers/ml, as the limits of agreement showed that a repeated measurement can be between 0.003 and 518.7 times the initial measurement. In contrast, for neutrophil %, the ratios lie between 0.61 and 1.50 times the initial measurement.

### Genetic structure characterization of Chileans reflects historical immigration patterns [^88cabb7a]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

LAI's sensitivity to the size of the reference panels

We measure the global ancestry proportions, using LAMP-LD's LAI, in the Chilean sample as we increase the size of each of the three reference panels simultaneously from 10 until 176 haplotypes. We estimate the variability on the global proportions estimate for each individual by repeating the procedure 10 times. Supplementary Figure 1 shows how the mean and s.d. of the Chilean global ancestry proportion estimates vary as a function of the size of the reference panels. We select X 0 = 130 haplotypes per reference panels as the minimum starting size for the three ancestry panels.

We start with X 0 = 130 haplotypes per reference panel and increase the number of Native-American reference haplotypes. Native-American ancestry estimates increase from 42.23 to 43.03%, while European dropped from 55.45 to 54.72% and African dropped from 2.32 to 2.25%. Figure 8a shows the distribution of the s.d. of the estimates of Native-American proportion as we increase the ancestral reference panel for this population. This figure shows stable and similar distribution as we increase the size of the Native-American reference panel, at X Am = 176 a slightly smaller median s.d. is achieved (median sd = 1.06 e −04). We fix X Am = 176.

Increasing the size of the EUR reference panel caused an increase in the global estimates of EUR ancestry proportion, at the expense of both AFR and NAT ancestry estimates. We start with haplotype reference panels of size X Am = 176 in NAT, 130 in EUR and 130 in AFR. We increase the number of EUR haplotypes in tens until the maximum number of 1822 haplotypes is reached. Estimates of ancestry percentages change from 43.03, 54.72 and 2.25% to 40.75, 57.84 and 1.41% in NAT, EUR, AFR, respectively. A combination of reference panel sizes such as the latter, where two sets are relatively small compared with the third one, might cause an overestimation of ancestry proportions related to the largest reference panel. We set the optimal number of EUR haplotypes to X E = 410 for which we find a minimum median s.d. of median sd = 5.53 e −05. Figure 8b shows box plots of the distribution of the s.d. of the estimates of European ancestral proportion as we vary the size of this reference panel.

Anterior Chamber Cell Count and Flare

In the PP population (n = 171), the percentage of patients with grade 0 (no cells) at day 1 (primary efficacy endpoint) was similar between PRO-145 and prednisolone groups (3.5% vs 2.3%, X 2 (1) = 0.218, p = 0.682). By the final visit, there was a significant improvement in AC cell grade in both groups, compared to day 1 (p = 0.0001). The percentage of patients with AC cell grade of 0 (i.e. no cells), increased for the PRO-145 group by D7 (41.2% [n = 35] vs 3.5% [n = 3], p = 0.0001), D14 (77.6% [n = 66] vs 3.5%, p = 0.0001) and by the end of 29-day protocol period (88.2% [n = 69] vs 3.5%, p = 0.0001). Meanwhile, for the prednisolone group this increase was also observed by D7 (27.9% [n = 24] vs 2.3%, p = 0.0001), D14 (80.2% [n = 69] vs 2.3%, p = 0.0001) and D29 (88.4% [n = 76] vs 2.3%, p = 0.0001). No significant differences were observed between groups at any time point (p-values; 0.078, 0.711 and 1.000 at D7, D14 and D29, respectively).

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation, management, and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^70213da7]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

KDIGO 2025 ADPKD Practice Point 1.3.7 — people with no known family history and incidentally detected kidney cysts — imaging and follow-up: For people with no known family history of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) but with incidentally detected kidney cysts, kidney imaging can help to make a diagnosis. Abdominal imaging should be considered for consenting parents, siblings, and/or adult children; and if a positive family history is found, the scheme as indicated in Figure 1 should be followed. If multiple bilateral cysts are identified with increased kidney volume, with or without liver cysts, and no other disease features are suggestive of a different cause of kidney cysts, the presumptive diagnosis is ADPKD. If only a few incidental cysts are identified without kidney enlargement or liver cysts, no clear cutoff has been established; population data show that in a study of contrast-enhanced CT in 2012 potential kidney donors, 39% in the age range of 19–49 years had at least one cyst of size ≥ 2 mm, increasing to 63% for people 50–75 years, and the 97.5th percentile for number of total cysts ≥ 5 mm was 10 for men and 4 for women aged 60–69 years; the > 97.5th percentile group was made up of those for whom an underlying genetic cause is suspected. Therefore, in people with a limited number of cysts and no increase or a minimal increase in TK, periodic follow-up (every 5 years) is suggested, and if cysts were first detected by ultrasound, follow-up imaging by MRI or CT and/or genetic testing are indicated when findings suggest another form of PKD.

### Trends in cervical cancer screening in title X-funded health centers-United States, 2005–2015 [^c06c43f6]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, FPAR lacks data on cervical cancer screening by age group and type of screening test. This limitation prevents the calculation and analysis of screening rates for younger age groups (< 21 and 21–29 years) and for females aged ≥ 30 years by test type. Second, the aggregate nature of FPAR data prevents a comparison of cervical cancer screening across important client characteristics (e.g. race, ethnicity, income level, or insurance status) or an assessment of whether cervical cancer screening for individual clients is conducted per recommendations or is received elsewhere. Third, the downward trend in cervical cancer screening coincided with a decline in the total number of female Title X clients served by the 64 grantees in this study (4.14 million in 2005 and 3.22 million in 2015) and an increase in the percentage of female Title X clients in the older (≥ 25 years) age groups. From 2005 to 2015, the percentage of females aged ≤ 19 years declined from 27% (2005) to 18% (2015) while the percentage of females aged ≥ 20 years increased from 73% (2005) to 82% (2015). Because of the increased percentage of female Title X clients in age groups for which regular but less frequent (every 3 or 5 years) cervical cancer screening was recommended, the decline in screening might be even more pronounced. According to grantee comments accompanying cervical cancer screening data reported in FPAR, increased provider adherence to recommendations was a primary reason given for the decline in screening. Finally, during 2005–2015 the number of female Title X clients served by grantees in this study both rose (2005–2009) and fell (2009–2015); in 2015, the number of female Title X clients served was 1.1 million (25%) lower than in 2009. From 2010 to 2015, a 16% decline (by $253.3 million in 2016 constant dollars) in total program revenue (i.e. from Title X and all other sources) reported by all grantees (89 grantees in 2010 and 91 grantees in 2015) was likely an important contributing cause to the decline in number of clients (9). Other plausible reasons for the decline in clients include increased use of long-acting contraceptive methods that require fewer visits and health system changes, which might have resulted in some newly insured clients seeking care elsewhere. Aggregate FPAR data are suitable for exploring some but not all of the possible reasons for this decline in clients.

### Trends in supply of nursing home beds, 2011–2019 [^92eff99c]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Although the overall population-adjusted supply of nursing home beds declined, these declines were not distributed evenly across nursing home bed characteristics. Overall, there was a small increase in the share of for-profit beds and a small decrease in the share of beds that were 4- or 5-star beds between 2011 and 2019 (< 1 percentage point) (Table 2). In counties where the supply of nursing home beds declined, the percentage of beds that were for-profit or 4- or 5-star rating increased by less than 1 percentage point over the study period. However, in counties where the supply of nursing home beds increased, the share of beds that were for-profit grew by 2.3 percentage points and the share of beds that were 4- or 5-star declined by 5.5 percentage points in these counties.

Table 2.
Nursing Home Bed Characteristics Across Counties Categorized by Increasing and Decreasing of Nursing Home Beds, 2011–2019 a

When examining trends from 2011 to 2020 as a sensitivity analysis, we observed a more dramatic decrease in the number of beds per 10 000 adults aged 65 years or older than when examining trends from 2011 to 2019 (158.4 vs 113.5, respectively). Trends in beds across other nursing home characteristics were variable (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). Results of the sensitivity analysis using an alternative threshold of positive or negative 2.5% change in number of beds to indicate meaningful change were also consistent with overall findings (eTable 2 in Supplement 1).

Cyclosporine dosing and formulation considerations — Increase the dose by 0.5 mg/kg/day until adequate control is obtained, and patients with severe disease who require rapid improvement can be started at a dose of up to 5 mg/kg/day and subsequently tapered once improvement has been achieved; the modified microemulsion is more steadily absorbed and is recommended in low (2–3 mg/kg/d) or ultralow (1–2 mg/kg/d) doses. In obese patients, dosing according to actual body weight is noted as more effective, and weight loss in obese (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2) patients treated with cyclosporine can increase treatment efficacy. In a randomized study of 61 obese patients, at 24 weeks the intervention group lost 7.0% ± 3.5% of body weight and two-thirds achieved PASI 75, whereas the control group lost only 0.2% ± 0.9% and only 29% achieved PASI 75. The study compared 2 different fixed dosing schedules of the cyclosporine microemulsion — 100 mg once daily or 50 mg twice daily; there were no statistically significant differences in the percentage of patients achieving PASI 75 and PASI 90 between the 2 groups, with improvement rates 69.4% ± 4.8% once-daily and 73.4% ± 4.3% twice-daily.

### Why population attributable fractions can sum to more than one [^48796442]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Population attributable fractions (PAFs) are useful for estimating the proportion of disease cases that could be prevented if risk factors were reduced or eliminated. For diseases with multiple risk factors, PAFs of individual risk factors can sum to more than 1, a result suggesting the impossible situation in which more than 100% of cases are preventable.

Methods

A hypothetical example in which risk factors for a disease were eliminated in different sequences was analyzed to show why PAFs can sum to more than 1.

Results

PAF estimates assume each risk factor is the first to be eliminated, thereby describing mutually exclusive scenarios that are illogical to sum, except under special circumstances. PAFs can sum to more than 1 because some individuals with more than one risk factor can have disease prevented in more than one way, and the prevented cases of these individuals could be counted more than once. Upper and lower limits of sequential attributable fractions (SAFs) can be calculated to describe the maximum and minimum proportions of the original number of disease cases that would be prevented if a particular risk factor were eliminated.

Conclusions

Improved descriptions of the assumptions that underlie the PAF calculations, use of SAF limits, or multivariable PAFs would help avoid unrealistic estimates of the disease burden that would be prevented after resources are expended to reduce or eliminate multiple risk factors.

### Ratio of FEV / slow vital capacity of… [^be9a8a55]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Mild expiratory flow limitation may not be recognized using traditional spirometric criteria based on the ratio of FEV 1 /FVC.

Research Question

Does slow vital capacity (SVC) instead of FVC increase the sensitivity of spirometry to identify patients with early or mild obstructive lung disease?

Study Design and Methods

We included 854 current and former smokers from the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study cohort with a postbronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC ≥ 0.7 and FEV 1% predicted of ≥ 80% at enrollment. We compared baseline characteristics, chest CT scan features, exacerbations, and progression to COPD (postbronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC, < 0.7) during the follow-up period between 734 participants with postbronchodilator FEV 1 /SVC of ≥ 0.7 and 120 with postbronchodilator FEV 1 /SVC < 0.7 at the enrollment. We performed multivariate linear and logistic regression models and negative binomial and interval-censored proportion hazards regression models adjusted for demographics and smoking exposure to examine the association of FEV 1 /SVC < 0.7 with those characteristics and outcomes.

Results

Participants with FEV 1 /SVC < 0.7 were older and had lower FEV 1 and more emphysema than those with FEV 1 /SVC ≥ 0.7. In adjusted analysis, individuals with postbronchodilator FEV 1 /SVC < 0.7 showed a greater percentage of emphysema by 0.45% (95% CI, 0.09%-0.82%), percentage of gas trapping by 2.52% (95% CI, 0.59%-4.44%), and percentage of functional small airways disease based on parametric response mapping by 2.78% (95% CI, 0.72%-4.83%) at baseline than those with FEV 1 /SVC ≥ 0.7. During a median follow-up time of 1,500 days, an FEV 1 /SVC < 0.7 was not associated with total exacerbations (incident rate ratio [IRR], 1.61; 95% CI, 0.97–2.64), but was associated with severe exacerbations (IRR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.04–4.89). An FEV 1 /SVC < 0.7 was associated with progression to COPD during a 3-year follow-up even after adjustment for demographics and smoking exposure (hazard ratio, 3.93; 95% CI, 2.71–5.72). We found similar results when we examined the association of prebronchodilator FEV 1 /SVC < 0.7 or FEV 1 /SVC less than the lower limit of normal with chest CT scan features and progression to COPD.

Interpretation

Low FEV 1 to SVC in current and former smokers with normal spirometry results can identify individuals with CT scan features of COPD who are at risk for severe exacerbations and is associated with progression to COPD in the future.

### Article 5. An introduction to estimation – 2: from z to T [^fb82b806]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Provided the sample size is large enough (that is, n greater than 100), the z statistic can be used to determine the confidence interval estimation of the population mean even when the sigma is not known. In these cases the estimation of the standard error of the mean is used. The z statistic is also valid when determining the population's proportion based upon a large sample. However, when dealing with smaller samples, the z statistic is replaced by the t statistic. This makes it possible to estimate, in a population with an unknown standard deviation: The probability of getting a sample mean greater than or equal to a particular value The value of a sample mean with a particular probability of occurring The probability of getting a sample mean between two particular values The confidence interval for the estimation of the population mean can also be determined using the t statistic.

### Quantitative imaging metrics for the assessment of pulmonary pathophysiology: an official American Thoracic Society and Fleischner society joint workshop report [^5292d530]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Reference space definition for quantitative imaging states that "It is crucial to define and measure a biologically meaningful reference space… as the starting point for analysis and endpoint for data reporting". Ratio-only expressions are vulnerable to the "reference trap", where changes can stem from numerator, denominator, or both. "An efficient way of measuring volume, point counting, is used to quantify acinar components by micro-CT and extrapulmonary organ volume by CT", a forerunner of voxel-by-voxel volume summation by computed tomography (CT).

### Committee opinion no. 691: carrier screening for genetic conditions [^e017efb6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Fragile X syndrome — Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability, occurs in approximately 1 in 3,600 males and 1 in 4,000–6,000 females, and is transmitted as an X-linked disorder. The cause is expansion of a cytosine–guanine–guanine repeat in the FMR1 gene, with repeat-size categories classified as unaffected (5–44 repeats), intermediate (45–54 repeats), premutation (55–200 repeats), and full mutation (greater than 200 repeats). A person with 55–200 repeats does not have features of fragile X syndrome but is at increased risk of fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome and FMR1-related premature ovarian failure, whereas with more than 200 repeats an individual has a full mutation with full expression in males and variable expression in females; the large number of repeats in a full mutation allele causes the FMR1 gene to become methylated and inactivated. Fragile X syndrome is a common known cause of autism or autism spectrum disorder behaviors with intellectual disability, with the diagnosis occurring in approximately 25% of affected individuals. Transmission of a disease-producing mutation depends on the sex of the parent and the number of repeats, with repeats very rarely expanding during spermatogenesis such that only an affected male can transmit the full mutation to his female offspring, whereas repeats in females may expand during oogenesis such that women with the premutation may transmit a full mutation resulting in an affected child.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists / American college of endocrinology clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis-2020 update [^cafea19d]. Endocrine Practice (2020). High credibility.

Bone mineral density categories and fracture risk — osteoporosis is defined by a T-score at or below −2.5 and osteopenia as a T-score between −1.0 and −2.5 based on dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and these criteria are useful for classification and risk stratification but are not intended as treatment thresholds. More than 80% of fragility fractures occur in women with BMD in the "osteopenia" range, and it is now recommended that treatment decisions include consideration of fracture probability; BMD results should be combined with other clinical risk factors, and FRAX® integrates the contribution of BMD and other clinical risk factors and calculates an individual's probability of fracture over 10 years.

### Quadrupling inhaled glucocorticoid dose to abort asthma exacerbations [^84841f98]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

The study FAST was published by McKeever T and colleagues in 2018 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Severe asthma phenotypes and Asthma. In the FAST study, the trial question was: what is the effect of temporary quadrupling of the dose of ICSs in patients who had a severe asthma exacerbation? In the FAST study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the FAST study, the population was: 1922 patients (1305 female, 617 male). The inclusion criteria were adult and adolescent patients with asthma who were receiving ICSs, with or without add-on therapy, and who had at least one exacerbation in the previous 12 months. The key exclusion criteria were history of smoking related to COPD, on maintenance oral corticosteroids, use of a corticosteroid/long-acting bronchodilator combination inhaler for both maintenance and relief treatment, an exacerbation within four weeks of randomization, pregnancy. In the FAST study, the interventions were: n = 957 quadrupling (increased bronchodilator medication and an increase in the dose of ICSs by a factor of 4) n = 965 non-quadrupling (increased bronchodilator medication alone). In the FAST study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in the rate of severe exacerbation of asthma in the year after randomization (45% vs. 52%;). In the FAST study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in use of systemic corticosteroids (33% vs. 40%; RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.7 to 0.96) Significant decrease in unscheduled healthcare consultation (41% vs. 47%; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.99) Significant increase in mean AUC of the peak flow (1166 L/min/day vs. 1130 L/min/day; AD 38 L/min/day, 95% CI 13 to 62). In the FAST study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in pneumonia or lower respiratory tract infection. significant difference in serious adverse events (2% vs. 4%) and nonserious adverse events (7% vs. 2%). In the FAST study, the conclusion was: in adult and adolescent patients with asthma who were receiving ICSs, with or without add-on therapy, and who had at least one exacerbation in the previous 12 months, quadrupling was superior to non-quadrupling with respect to the rate of severe exacerbation of asthma in the year after randomization.

### Treatment of multiple myeloma: ASCO and CCO joint clinical practice guideline [^209e3476]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria — progressive disease — require an increase of ≥ 25% from the lowest response value in any one or more of: serum M-component (the absolute increase must be ≥ 0.5 g/dL), urine M-component (the absolute increase must be ≥ 200 mg/24 h), in patients without measurable serum and urine M-protein the difference between involved and uninvolved free light chain (FLC) levels (absolute increase must be > 10 mg/L), or bone marrow plasma cell percentage (absolute percentage must be ≥ 10%); or definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or definite increase in the size of existing lesions; or development of hypercalcemia with corrected serum calcium > 11.5 mg/dL or 2.65 mmol/L attributable to the plasma cell proliferative disorder; additionally, for progressive disease, serum M-component increases of ≥ 1 g/dL are sufficient to define relapse if starting M-component is ≥ 5 g/dL.

### Variability of functional and biodiversity responses to perturbations is predictable and informative [^ed71d7d6]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Geometrical approach

To understand what can be learned from the variability of aggregate properties' responses to perturbations, we transpose the ecological problem to a more abstract, but simpler, geometrical setting (described more formally in Box 2).

First, we consider the effects of perturbations on populations as displacement vectors in the ecosystem's state-space, where axes report the biomass of all constituent species (Fig. 2 A). This vector is the difference between initial and perturbed states. It encodes the response to the perturbation at the population level at a given time and can be applied to both press perturbations (where the community may be expected to stay at the perturbed state for some time) and pulse perturbations (where the community may be expected to return to the initial state from the perturbed state). We then see ecosystem functions as positive directions in this same state space (Fig. 2 B). Total biomass for example is the sum of all the species' biomass and its direction lies exactly between all the axes, giving equal weight to all species. Other functions may not be influenced by the biomass of all species equally. In the hypothetical example shown in Fig. 2 B, general decomposition is slightly more sensitive to the biomass of fungi than to the biomass of bacteria, plastic decomposition is primarily carried out by bacteria, and chemical production is primarily carried out by fungi. In general, a positive direction is spanned by a vector of positive values representing the per-capita contribution of each species to the function of interest. Our approach therefore aligns with Grime's "biomass-ratio hypothesis" where species contributions to ecosystem functions increase with increasing biomass. The "broadest" function, total biomass, is made up entirely of ones. The "narrowest" functions, are made up entirely of zeroes, except on the entry associated with the only contributing species.

### Screening for lung cancer: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (2nd edition) [^9a04d4f5]. Chest (2007). Medium credibility.

Low-dose CT (LDCT) screening interval and duration — modeling and trials show start/stop age and interval trade-offs. The interval and duration of screening were explored in the CISNET modeling study that informed the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). Regarding duration, as the age to begin screening increases, lung cancer mortality reduction decreases, with about one-quarter of the mortality reduction lost by increasing the age from 50 to 60 years, while the number of scans decreases by a similar amount. As the age to end screening increases, both the mortality reduction and the number of scans increase slightly (~ 10% increase in both for a 5-year increase in the age at which screening is ended), and the USPSTF concluded that screening from 50 to 80 years of age was a reasonable balance of trade-offs. Extended screening evidence includes the MILD trial, which continued screening for 10 years and showed increased benefits beyond 5 years, and a follow-up 5 to 7 years after prior LDCT screening in which 21% of patients had developed lung cancer. Interval findings include NELSON's schedule of LDCT at baseline, 1 year, 3 years, and 5.5 years; stage shift was less favorable with a 2.5-year interval than a 1-year interval (stage I: 61% vs 76%, stage IV: 13% vs 3%, respectively), and stage IIB/IV accounted for 15% in the 1-year interval and 35% in the 2.5-year interval. CISNET models also found that scanning every 2 to 3 years vs annually diminished lung cancer mortality reduction but decreased costs.

### Geospatial analysis and scale-up modelling of the impact of mobile programming on access to essential childhood vaccinations in Yemen [^831e6a99]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

At the governorate level, we find substantial variability in access. Table 1 shows the number of children under age 5 and the percentage of the under-5 population living within a 30-minute travel time of EPI services, disaggregated by governorate. For fixed facility services only, we find that the percentage of the under-5 population within a 30-minute walk of EPI service ranged from a high of 87.9% and 72.5% in Sana'a City and Aden, to a low of 4.8% and 37.2% in Socotra and Raymah governorates, respectively. In 10 of 22 governorates, less than 50% of the population lived within a 30-minute walk of a facility offering EPI.

Table 1
Number and percent of children under 5 living within a 30-minute walk of EPI services, by delivery modality and governorate

The presence of mobile health teams augmented access in many, although not all, governorates. The largest increases in access (by absolute percentage of the governorate under-5 population) were seen in Socotra (+69.5%), Al Bayda (+30.4%), Shabwah (+26.2%) and Dhamar (+25.5%). The smallest percent increases were seen in Aden (+0.2%), Sana'a City (+0.7%), Al Hodeidah (+1.0%), and Lahj (+1.1%).

Even with the contributions from mobile health teams, geographic access to vaccination sites remains poor in several governorates. We find that in Raymah and Sa'dah governorates, only 47.2% of the under-5 population lives within a 30-minute walk of a fixed facility or mobile health team offering EPI services. In 16 of 22 governorates, the percentage of the under-5 population with EPI access remains below 70%, even after accounting for the contribution of mobile services.

### Change in the estimated glomerular filtration rate over time and risk of all-cause mortality [^d076400b]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Using a community-based cohort we studied the association between changes in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) over time and the risk of all-cause mortality. We identified 529,312 adults who had at least three outpatient eGFR measurements over a 4-year period from a provincial laboratory repository in Alberta, Canada. Two indices of change in eGFR were evaluated: the absolute annual rate of change (in ml/min per 1.73m(2) per year) and the annual percentage change (percent/year). The adjusted mortality risk associated with each category of change in eGFR was assessed, using stable eGFR (no change) as the reference. Over a median follow-up of 2.5 years there were 32,372 deaths. Compared to the reference participants, those with the greatest absolute annual decline less than or equal to 5ml/min per 1.73m(2) per year had significantly increased mortality (hazard ratio of 1.52) adjusted for covariates and kidney function at baseline (last eGFR measurement). Participants with the greatest increase in eGFR of 5ml/min per 1.73m(2) per year or more also had significantly increased mortality (adjusted hazard ratio of 2.20). A similar pattern was found when change in eGFR was quantified as an annual percentage change. Thus, both declining and increasing eGFR were independently associated with mortality and underscore the importance of identifying change in eGFR over time to improve mortality risk prediction.

### Association of physician characteristics with early adoption of virtual health care [^3a0a4a77]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

After accounting for other characteristics in logistic regression modeling, we found that the physician characteristics associated with the likelihood of innovator or early adopter status were generational demographic cohort (odds ratio [OR], 0.39 for Silent Generation relative to Generation X; 95% CI, 0.24–0.65), female gender (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.06–1.44), specialty class (relative to medical specialties, OR for primary care 1.69 [95% CI, 1.36–2.09]; OR for surgical, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.38–0.57]; and OR for behavioral health, 2.92; [95% CI, 2.11–4.04]), physicians' number of patients (OR, 1.01 per 10-patient increase; 95% CI, 1.01–1.01), physicians' proportion of patients from a racial or ethnic minority (OR, 0.94 per 5% increase; 95% CI, 0.90–0.98), physicians' proportion of patients preferring to speak a language other than English (OR, 1.09 per 5% increase; 95% CI, 1.01–1.17), and physicians' percentage of patients with an activated portal (OR, 1.18 per 5% increase; 95% CI, 1.14–1.21) (Table 2). The results were similar when we used age categories in place of generational demographic cohorts (eTable 2 and eFigure 2 in the Supplement). The results of the models testing interaction terms are given in eTable 3 and eTable 4 the Supplement.

### Relapse in clinically stable adult patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder: evidence-based criteria derived by equipercentile linking and diagnostic test accuracy meta-analysis [^6f7d00cd]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

Background

There is no consensus on defining relapse in schizophrenia, and scale-derived criteria with unclear clinical relevance are widely used. We aimed to develop an evidence-based scale-derived set of criteria to define relapse in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.

Methods

We searched the Yale University Open Data Access (YODA) for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in clinically stable adults with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, and obtained individual participant data on Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Clinical Global Impression Severity (CGI-S), Personal and Social Performance (PSP), and Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS). Our main outcomes were PANSS-derived criteria based on worsening in PANSS total score. We examined their relevance using equipercentile linking with CGI-S and functioning scales, and their test-performance in defining relapse with diagnostic test accuracy meta-analysis against CGI-S worsening (≥ 1-point increase together with a score ≥ 4 points) and psychiatric hospitalisation.

Findings

Based on data from seven RCTs (2354 participants; 1348 men [57·3%] and 1006 women [42·7%], mean age of 39·5 years [SD 12·0, range 17–89]; 303 Asian [12.9%], 255 Black [10.8%], 1665 White [70.7%], and other or unspecified 131 [5.6%]), an increase of 12 points or more in PANSS total (range 30–210 points) corresponded to clinically important deterioration in global severity of illness (≥ 1 point increase in CGI-S, range 1–7) and functioning (≥ 10 points decline in PSP or SOFAS, range 1–100). The interpretation of percentage changes varied importantly across different baseline scores. An increase of 12 points or more in PANSS total had good sensitivity and specificity using CGI-S as reference standard (sensitivity 82·1% [95% CI 77·1–86·4], specificity 86·9% [82·9–90·3]), as well as good sensitivity but lower specificity compared to hospitalisation (sensitivity 81·7% [74·1–87·7], specificity 69·2% [60·5–76·9]). Requiring either an increase in PANSS total or in specific items for positive and disorganization symptoms further improved test-performance. Cutoffs for situations where high sensitivity or specificity is needed are presented.

Interpretation

An increase of either 12 points or more in the PANSS total score, or worsening of specific positive and disorganisation symptom items could be a reasonable evidence-based definition of relapse in schizophrenia, potentially linking symptoms used to define remission and relapse. Percentage changes should not be used to define relapse because their interpretation depends on baseline scores.

### A family-based education program for obesity: a three-year study [^3ff86e13]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Negative results were observed in 25.7% (27) of children (5 overweight and 22 obese, 59% females, aged 5.25–14.1 years, mean 8.98 ± 3.1) and 4 became severely obese during the follow-up.

There is a significant difference between the percentages of reduction of severely obese children following the two treatments (X 2 test p < 0.001).

The BMI% at baseline showed a positive correlation with age (linear regression p < 0.05) in the children of the two groups.

After follow-up, the BMI% of pre-pubertal children belonging to the TEP group decreased by 5.48 ± 13.9% (BMI SDS reduction of 0.42 ± 0.8), while the BMI% of pubertal children in TEP group decreased by 14.07 ± 15.8% (BMI SDS reduction of 0.48 ± 0.6); there was no statistical difference. The BMI% reduction positively correlates with the age (p < 0.05) and the stage of puberty, ranging from 1 to 5 (p < 0.01), but not with follow-up span.

The total number of "Positive" or "Successful" children (i.e. with a stable BMI%) in the TEP group was significantly higher (X 2 test p < 0.01), while that of "Negative" children (i.e. with a BMI% increase ≥ 10%) remained significantly lower in TEP compared to that of DT group (X 2 test p < 0.05). No significant difference (X 2 test) was seen in the two groups between children who normalized their weight.

The total numbers of "Positive" and "Stabilized" children was high both in TEP (72) and DT group (69), but with a significant difference (X 2 test p < 0.01), (84.7% vs 65.7%). BMI% values decreased by 13.28 ± 13% in the TEP group and by 5.18 ± 9.1% in the DT group; while BMI SDS value decreased by 0.55 ± 0.7 in the TEP group and only by 0.16 ± 0.4 in the DT group.

Results

This analysis included 4840 participants. Of these, 2435 (53%) were women, 993 (10.4%) were non-Hispanic Black, and 887 (5.1%) were Mexican American (Table). A total of 1165 deaths occurred during a mean (SEM) follow-up of 10.1 (0.1) years.

Adjusted hazard ratios changed from 0.69 to 0.28 across increasing activity categories (vs 0–19 minutes per day). Hazard ratios used to generate the PAFs for the 8 activity categories were as follows: 1.00 (reference) for 0 to 19 (548 [7.9%]), 0.69 (95% CI, 0.55–0.85) for 20 to 39 (616 [10.0%]), 0.51 (95% CI, 0.42–0.63) for 40 to 59 (635 [11.8%]), 0.40 (95% CI, 0.29–0.55) for 60 to 79 (614 [12.7%]), 0.34 (95% CI, 0.25–0.47) for 80–99 (633 [14.4%]), 0.32 (95% CI, 0.21–0.48) for 100 to 119 (508 [12.1%]), 0.30 (95% CI, 0.19–0.48) for 120–139 (384 [9.3%]), and 0.28 (95% CI, 0.18–0.42) for 140 or more (902 [21.7%]) minutes per day. The number of participants with frailty or needing special equipment was 280 (49.4%) for 0 to 19, 164 (26.3%) for 20 to 39, 94 (12.4%) for 40 to 59, 66 (9.5%) for 60 to 79, 42 (5.1%) for 80 to 99, 31 (4.7%) for 100 to 119, 20 (2.9%) for 120 to 139, and 35 (2.7%) for 140 or more minutes per day.

### Mass critical care surge response during COVID-19: implementation of contingency strategies – A preliminary report of findings from the task force for mass critical care [^07a44652]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Risk for ICU admission delays vs transfer during pandemic surge (Table 5) outlines quantified risks and mitigation strategies. For patients awaiting ICU admission (≥ 6 h), there is increased risk for persistent organ dysfunction or death, with OR increases 1.77/h of ED boarding time, OR increases 5.32 for PACU patients waiting ≥ 6 h, and 1.5% mortality risk/h ICU wait time for ward patients. Risks during transfer include adverse events, especially respiratory or hemodynamic deterioration, greater risk for increasing number of organ failures (≥ 2), and increased mortality risk for some surgical patients. Strategies to mitigate transfer risk are to assure oxygenation compensated, airway secure, or both before transfer; fully resuscitate from shock and establish stability with vasopressor support, or both before transfer; preferential transport for patients with fewer number of organ failures (preferably ≤ 1); shorter transfer times when possible; established transport protocols and effective communication between sending and receiving institutions; and recognition that transfers from EDs carry less risk than transfers of non-ED patients.

### The risk of osteoporotic fractures and its associating risk factors according to the FRAX model in the Iranian patients: a follow-up cohort [^89967ab8]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Fragility or osteoporotic fractures were defined as those which occur from a fall from a standing height or less, or presenting in the absence of obvious trauma. These fractures were categorized in two main groups: hip fractures or major osteoporotic fractures.

Subjects aged less than 40 or over 90 years of age at the time of the first visit to our clinic were excluded since FRAX does not allow the calculation of the adjusted risk outside this age range. Individuals not providing consent to answer the questions as well as those without a telephone to contact, who had moved or their phone number had changed or did not respond after three calls made at different times according to the protocol were excluded.

For the main objective (calculating the incidence rate of osteoporotic fracture rate in a prospective cohort using survival analysis), a sample of 1,000 individuals was needed based on the study conducted by Kanis et al.

To minimize the effect of possible losses, which may imply bias (given the mortality associated with fractures and possible address change over 10 years), the sample size was increased to 2,000. This increase also aims to minimize the losses to follow up or refusal to participate. This subgroup constituted 15% of the whole number of patients who had visited our BMD center between 2000 and 2010. In order to minimize the difference between the prevalence of various risk factors in this group compared to the whole population, the subsample was selected through stratified sampling (Each year was considered as a stratification) and the number of samples in each stratification was proportional to size (Table 1).

Table 1
The distribution of the subsample to the whole number of patients visiting the clinic in the past decade

Descriptive statistics for demographic and baseline characteristics were presented as mean and standard deviation for continuous variables or count (percent) for categorical variables. Simple comparisons of the baseline characteristics were made among the participants and non-participants of the cohort. The Chi-square test was used to evaluate the association between qualitative variables. The Student's t-test was implemented to evaluate the differences in the distribution of quantitative variables according to the categories defined by a binary exposure.

### Affective integration in experience, judgment, and decision-making [^f48a67ed]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Still, it is difficult to answer the question "what is the role of affect in judgment and decision making?" as there are many contradictory observations explained through a large array of theoretical mediators. For instance, positive affect is associated with increased risk-taking in some studies (a mood-congruent, informational effect e.g. –) and decreased risk-taking in others (a mood-incongruent effect e.g. –). Affect-as-information account may predict that positive affect increases the perceived value of winning and thus drive risk taking for a potential gain. Affect-as-motivation, on the other hand, may predict that positive affect attributed to better-than-expected progress could cause individuals to be more risk-averse to protect their mood state. The prediction of affect-as-a-spotlight view would depend on how the probability information is weighted. As a result, an intense positive affect may increase risk taking for a small probability gain but not so much for a high probability gain. Thus, whether the valence of an incidental mood increases or decreases risk-taking depends upon which mechanism dominates. However, the research paradigms used in linking affect and decision-making are often unable to arbitrate between these alternative mechanisms. One reason for this is that many studies tend to focus on connecting a feeling state to an increased or a decreased tendency for a certain response. Recent advances in psychological science underlines the shortcomings of this type of essentialist feeling-to-behavior mapping that overlooks contextual factors –. Second, affect is often operationalized as feeling states that is implicitly (due to study design and methods) or explicitly (to simplify the problem) assumed to be static and limited in time to only here and now, a typical manifestation of the snapshot approach, which do not account for the fact that mental states and behavior are temporally dependent. Third, the traditional scientific paradigm in psychological research regards context effects as nuisance or moderators of underlying processes that can be removed by study design and analysis, e.g. by randomizing trials and analyzing summary scores. Collectively, these approaches are representative of a problem that is prevalent in the vast bulk of the paradigms and data on this topic – we effectively ignore the temporal nature of mental states and its dynamic impact on judgments and decisions. We argue that by ignoring the continuous nature of affect, the field can make little progress beyond simple models, and a better and systematic understanding of the mechanism through which affect influence judgments and decisions will be hard to achieve. To reconcile this issue, we suggest that there is a need to adopt an approach that attempts to understand how affect is constructed from the ongoing information flow and how this evolving state modulates information processing feeding into judgments and decisions continuously (for a similar approach, see).

### Year-to-year changes in lung function in individuals with cystic fibrosis [^dec27ec7]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2010). Low credibility.

Background

We examined the year-to-year change in FEV(1) for individuals and the overall cystic fibrosis population to better understand how individual trends may differ from population trends.

Methods

We calculated individual yearly changes using the largest annual FEV(1) percent predicted (FEV(1)%) measurement in 20,644 patients (6-45years old) included in the Epidemiologic Study of Cystic Fibrosis. We calculated yearly population changes using age-specific medians.

Results

FEV(1)% predicted decreased 1–3 points per year for individuals, with maximal decreases in 14-15year olds. Population changes agreed with individual changes up to age 15; however after age 30, yearly population change approximated zero while individual FEV(1)% predicted decreases were 1–2 points per year.

Conclusions

Adolescents have the greatest FEV(1)% predicted decreases; however, loss of FEV(1) is a persistent risk in 6-45year old CF patients. Recognizing individual year-to-year changes may improve patient-specific care and may suggest new methods for measuring program quality.

### Digital measurement of SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk from 7 million contacts [^dd774ec9]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Empirical estimation of individuals' probability of testing positive from summary statistics

In general, each contact in our dataset had multiple exposure windows, each of which had a duration (anything up to 30 min) and a risk score. We summarized these data for each contact into metrics including the maximum risk score from any of the windows, the cumulative risk score over all windows and the cumulative duration over all windows. We binned (grouped) contacts by the value of their summary metrics and, within each bin, calculated the fraction of contacts reporting a positive test in the observation interval. Confidence intervals on this fraction were calculated through the associated binomial distribution (defined with the number of 'trials' equal to the group size and the number of 'successes' equal to the number of contacts reporting a positive test). We extrapolated our estimates to risk score 1 (that is, 2 m away from an index case with standard infectiousness for 15 min (indicated by a grey circle in Fig. 1) as a point of comparison) via a quadratic fit. In Figs. 2 and 4 the background risk estimate from the maximum-likelihood approach outlined below was subtracted from the result.

### Characterization of more than a third of a million toy-related fractures [^14fbfd9c]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Figure 4
Graph showing pediatric trends in injuries due to toy types at different ages (excluding other toy type). Here, ball-related fractures were the most common throughout the pediatric years. Next, as pediatric patients get older, the prevalence for toy weapons increased prevalence, whereas that for riding toys decreased. Prevalence for arts-related and nonriding toy vehicles remained constant at a low percentage.

In examining the number of toy-related fractures in EDs each year (Figure 5), a 94% increase (12,002–23,296 cases) was observed from 1999 to 2018. For context, during this period, the US population increased by just 17%, meaning the population-adjusted increase was 65%.

### Osteoporosis in men: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^a17ee632]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis in men — limitations of bone mineral density (BMD) T-score–only criteria are noted: criteria based only on BMD T-scores (T-score −2.5 or below in the spine or hip) are too restrictive because they identify too few men for therapy (< 10%), whereas approximately 25% of men experience a fracture after age 60, and a majority of men who fracture have T-scores that are better than −2.5; the use of FRAX identifies a larger proportion of older men in whom therapy appears to be cost-effective than use of T-scores alone, but these algorithms may not be sufficiently sensitive because they do not incorporate risk factors and because they consider only hip BMD.

### The Scottish RD survey 10 years on: the increasing incidence of retinal detachments [^92343623]. Eye (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Incidence

During 12 months of data collection, there were 875 RRDs recorded, which gives an incidence of 16.02/100,000/year in Scotland.

Age and sex distribution

The total incidence has increased from 14.75 to 20.39 (p < 0.0001) in males and 8.74 to 11.5 (p = 0.0012) compared to 2010. Table 1 summarises the baseline characteristics of the RRDs in this study period compared to the 2010 study. Figures 1, 2 show the incidence rates in each age group for males and females respectively, as compared to the 2010 study. The greatest increases were seen in males aged 50–59 (p = 0.0094) and 60–69 (p = 0.0395) and females aged 40–49 (p = 0.0312) and 50–59 (p = 0.0024). Unsurprisingly, this has resulted in a different age distribution, with a higher percentage of retinal detachments in the 50–59 age group.

Fig. 2
Age-Standardised Incidence rates for females comparing 2007–09 study to current study.

Significant increase in incidence seen in 40–49 and 50–59 age groups.

Lens status

The proportion of pseudophakic RRDs in this study is 29.4% (253/860). Compared to the 21.6% in the 2010 study, this represents a 28% increase (x 2 = 11.03, p = 0.0009).

Extent of detachment

The percentage of macula-off RRDs remains stable at 58% (495/854) when compared to the previous study. There was a reduction in the proportion of detachments limited to one quadrant, and an increase in the percentage of total detachments. These findings suggest it is unlikely that the higher incidence of RD is due to better case ascertainment or earlier diagnosis.

### The patient as a source to improve the medical record [^91b3679d]. Family Practice (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The problem list is an important tool in general practice for care as well as research purposes. As the central part of the problem-oriented medical record, it lists the main medical problems which the GP wants to have knowledge of during any patient encounter. The assessment of its quality is usually made by comparing with other sources of information on the patient's problems.

Objective

This study addresses the question of to what extent the problem list can be improved by asking the patient about their own medical problems.

Methods

During 7 weeks, all patients who visited three GPs in a health care centre in an Amsterdam suburb were interviewed. During the interview, they were confronted with the problem list made by their own GP and stimulated to make suggestions for addition or removal of problems.

Results

All in all, patients were in agreement with 88% of all listed problems. The completeness of the problem list could be increased by 28%, while 4% ultimately were removed: a net gain of 24%.

Conclusion

The patient can be used as a sourcetool for improvement of the quality of the problem list when its prime function is patient care. It becomes more complicated when the problem list also serves a research purpose. Clear inclusion rules will then have to be formulated.

Flint water contamination crisis — after officials changed Flint, Michigan's water supply without corrosion control, pediatric data showed increased lead exposure: the number of children < 5 years old with blood lead concentrations of > 5 μg/dL increased, and the percentage of Flint children with blood lead concentrations of > 5 μg/dL increased from 2.4% to 4.9%; in areas with higher water-lead content, it increased from 4% to 10.6%. The > 5 μg/dL threshold corresponds to the concentration, based on the US population, of children ages 1–5 years who are in the top 2.5% when tested for blood lead. In January 2016, both the state and federal governments declared a state of emergency and authorized aid to address the crisis and its effects on child development.

### Azacitidine (azacitidine for) [^2b88c3ef]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

2.5 Dosage Adjustment Based on Hematology Laboratory Values

For adult patients with baseline (start of treatment) WBC greater than or equal to 3 x109/L, ANC greater than or equal to 1.5 x109/L, and platelets greater than or equal to 75 x109/L, adjust the dose as follows, based on nadir counts for any given cycle:

For adult patients whose baseline counts are WBC less than 3 x 109/L, ANC less than 1.5 x 109/L, or platelets less than 75 x 109/L, base dose adjustments on nadir counts and bone marrow biopsy cellularity at the time of the nadir as noted below, unless there is clear improvement in differentiation (percentage of mature granulocytes is higher and ANC is higher than at onset of that course) at the time of the next cycle, in which case continue the current dose.

If a nadir as defined in the table above has occurred, give the next course 28 days after the start of the preceding course, provided that both the WBC and the platelet counts are greater than 25% above the nadir

and rising. If a greater than 25% increase above the nadir is not seen by day 28, reassess counts every 7 days. If a 25% increase is not seen by day 42, reduce the scheduled dose by 50%.

2.6 Dosage Adjustment Based on Serum Electrolytes and Renal Toxicity

If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to less than 20 mEq/L occur, reduce the dosage by 50% for the next course. Similarly, if unexplained elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, delay the next cycle until values return to normal or baseline and reduce the dose by 50% for the next course [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

2.7 Use in Geriatric Patients

Azacitidine and its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, select the dose carefully and monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

### Optimizing practice through research: a new perspective to solve an old problem [^781b8e9f]. Annals of Family Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Policy makers, researchers, clinicians, and the public are frustrated that research in the health sciences has not resulted in a greater improvement in patient outcomes. Our experience as clinicians and researchers suggests that this frustration could be reduced if health sciences research were directed by 5 broad principles: (1) the needs of patients and populations determine the research agenda; (2) the research agenda addresses contextual and implementation issues, including the development of delivery and accountability systems; (3) the research agenda determines the research methods rather than methods determines the research agenda; (4) researchers and clinicians collaborate to define the research agenda, allocate resources, and implement findings; and (5) the level of funding for implementation research is commensurate with and proportional to the magnitude of the task. To keep the research agenda focused on the task of improving health and to acknowledge that the effort must be seen as more comprehensive than translating or transferring research into practice (TRIP), we suggest that the task be reframed, using the term optimizing practice through research.

### Falls predict fractures independently of FRAX probability: a meta-analysis of the osteoporotic fractures in men (MrOS) study [^6da43c78]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2018). Low credibility.

Statistical methods

To compare the performance of FRAX probability with that of a history of past falls, a dichotomous variable was created such that the percentage of men who had a high fracture risk was similar to the percentage who had previously fallen (15% for HK, 16% for Sweden, and 20% for US). Thus, 15%, 16%, and 20% men, respectively, had a FRAX probability of major osteoporotic fracture, calculated with BMD, above 9.5%, 15.8%, and 10.3% and the dichotomized FRAX score was therefore classified as high or low risk. Fracture outcomes considered included: any, osteoporotic (defined according to Kanis and colleagues 21 as clinical vertebral, ribs, pelvis, humerus, clavicle, scapula, sternum, hip, other femoral fractures, tibia, fibula, distal forearm/ wrist), major osteoporotic (MOF; hip, clinical vertebral, humerus, and wrist/forearm), osteoporotic fracture without hip fracture (clinical vertebral, humerus, and wrist), clinical vertebral, and hip. An extension of Poisson regression models 22 was used to study the association between FRAX, other risk variables, and the future risk of fracture. All associations were adjusted for age and time since baseline. In contrast to logistic regression, the Poisson regression uses the length of each individual's follow‐up period, and the hazard function is assumed to be exp(β 0 + β 1 × current time from baseline + β 2 × current age + β 3 × variable of interest). The observation period of each participant was divided into intervals of 1 month. One fracture per person, and time to the first fracture, were counted, and time at risk was censored at the time of first fracture, migration, or death. Thus, we investigated the predictive value of prior falls, FRAX (including each individual constituent risk factor), and BMD as individual risk factors, and then in multivariable models to investigate the value of falls independent of FRAX or BMD, and FRAX independent of falls. In further analyses, we explored interactions with age and time since baseline, in which age and time were used as continuous variables and examples given at specific ages and times. Additionally, we stratified the analyses by femoral neck BMD T ‐score above or below –2.5. The association between predictive factors and risk of fracture are described as a hazard ratio (HR) or gradient of risk (GR = HR per 1 standard deviation change in predictor in the direction of increased risk). In addition, we explored the associations between falls and fracture by number of falls reported at baseline (1 versus multiple). Two‐sided p values were used for all analyses, and p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. Analyses were undertaken separately within each cohort and then the β‐coefficients from each cohort were weighted according to the variance and merged to determine the weighted mean of the coefficient and its standard deviation (random‐effects meta‐analysis). The risk ratios are then given by e (weighted mean coefficient). Although there are numerous caveats with the use of receiver operator curve (ROC) models in this context, 23 we additionally present area under the curve (AUC) values for the predictive models in the Supplemental Tables.

### Investigating suspected cancer clusters and responding to community concerns: guidelines from CDC and the council of state and territorial epidemiologists [^945666c0]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Cancer cluster investigation — Step 2 decision to close or proceed to Step 3 is based on multiple factors, and to interpret the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) the health agency must assess whether there are enough cases and population for statistical stability and, in general, that the population size of a typical census tract is the smallest denominator that will allow reliable results; if the numerator allows stability, agencies should consider whether the 95% CI exclude 1.0, along with environmental contaminants, population changes, and other information beyond the SIR to estimate whether cancers represent an excess and share a common etiology. A SIR of limited magnitude that is not statistically significant with lack of known contaminant association and no increasing trend justifies closing at Step 2, whereas a statistically significant SIR of great magnitude with an increasing trend and a known contaminant argues for continuing to Step 3; example thresholds indicate that an SIR of < 2.0 with CIs surrounding or overlapping 1.0 and < 10 cases might justify closing, while an SIR of > 4 with CIs not overlapping 1.0 and ≥ 10 etiologically linked cases should encourage advancing to Step 3.

### Clustering knowledge and dispersing abilities enhances collective problem solving in a network [^77613a31]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Here, however, we find quite different results: intermixing hampers systemic performance. Furthermore, there is a tradeoff in systemic performance over time, as seen in Fig. 6b. Networks with some form of intermixing perform better in the short-run. However, the network with the minimal possible intermixing performs worse in the short-run but best in the long-run. In other words, this suggests an "all or nothing" trade-off over time: the configuration with the least amount of intermixing possible (minimal) performs worse in the short-run, but better in the long-run, while any gradation of increased intermixing yields the same rank-ordering in performance as their counterpart networks in the diversity of ability simulations.

Agents in the intermixed network setups explore for solutions early on in the simulation, which is a double-edged sword. In the short-run, with more intermixing, agents quickly turn to exploitation, as they merely take solutions that are marginally better relative to other setups but are still mediocre in absolute terms. Said differently, agents in setups with at least some intermixing quickly coalesce to whatever the few agents that did explore the problem space found, which are often not the best solutions possible. So, exploring the problem space using worse solutions often leads to modest gains. However, the agents in setups with minimal intermixing are more commonly exploring, rather than exploiting, because their neighbors' initial solutions are less optimal than their counterparts in intermixed networks. This is because there is minimal exposure to diversity in these minimal setups, which inadvertently produces poor solutions in the short-run but allows for more exploration to find better solutions in the long-run. In other words, by finding better solutions through exploration, agents more often uncover pathways to better solutions earlier on. The end result is that the long-run performance of setups with minimal intermixing is best.

### Low-dose interleukin-2 induces clonal expansion of BACH2-repressed effector regulatory T cells following acute coronary syndrome [^fd540924]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2025). High credibility.

The effect of IL-2 LD on the TCR landscape

The scRNA-seq T cell analysis showed that IL-2 LD significantly increased the percentage of T reg cells in a dose-dependent manner (pretreatment, 2%; placebo, 4% (P = 0.927, t = 0.0923, d.f. = 38); 1.5 MIU d −1, 6% (P = 0.0336, t = 2.197, d.f. = 42); 2.5 MIU d −1, 9% (P = 0.0072, t = 2.824, d.f. = 42); two-tailed t -tests) (Fig. 2a). In our previous analysis, we assessed clonal expansion using the entire TCR repertoire; here we evaluate only those TCRs associated with CD4 + T cells. When assessing the clonotype size of all CD4 + T cells across the placebo and treatment groups, it was observed that IL-2 LD causes a significant decrease in the proportion of unique clonotypes (size = 1) with a corresponding increase in large clonotypes in both IL-2 LD treatment groups (P < 0.001, x ² = 4,294.07, d.f. = 59; P < 0.001, x ² = 3,429.84, d.f. = 69; multiple chi-squared tests for the 1.5 MIU d −1 and 2.5 MIU d −1 groups, respectively) (Fig. 2b). Correspondingly, IL-2 LD treatment caused a decrease in TCR diversity as measured by Shannon entropy and diversity index (D50; Fig. 2c). Furthermore, patients with acute MI treated with placebo had a limited expansion of CD4 + T cell clonotypes, while patients treated with 1.5 MIU d −1 of IL-2 had an expansion of T reg cells as well as naive and central memory T (T cm) cell clonotypes. Patients treated with 2.5 MIU d −1 of IL-2 had a marked expansion of both T reg cells and effector memory T (T em) cell clonotypes (Fig. 2d).

### Dofetilide 0.125mg [^c2f571b1]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The point estimates of the probabilities of remaining in NSR at 6 and 12 months were 71% and 66%, respectively, for dofetilide 500 mcg BID; 56% and 51%, respectively, for dofetilide 250 mcg BID; and 26% and 21%, respectively, for placebo.

In both studies, dofetilide resulted in a dose-related increase in the number of patients maintained in NSR at all time periods and delayed the time of recurrence of sustained AF. Data pooled from both studies show that there is a positive relationship between the probability of staying in NSR, dofetilide dose, and increase in QTc (see Figure 2 in CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Dose-Response and Concentration Response for Increase in QT Interval).

Analysis of pooled data for patients randomized to a dofetilide dose of 500 mcg twice daily showed that maintenance of NSR was similar in both males and females, in both patients aged < 65 years and patients ≥ 65 years of age, and in both patients with atrial flutter as a primary diagnosis and those with a primary diagnosis of atrial fibrillation.

During the period of in-hospital initiation of dosing, 23% of patients in Studies 1 and 2 had their dose adjusted downward on the basis of their calculated creatinine clearance, and 3% had their dose down-titrated due to increased QT interval or QTc. Increased QT interval or QTc led to discontinuation of therapy in 3% of patients.

Step 2 advises, "Titrate insulin every 2–3 days", using a fixed regimen to "Increase TDD by 2 units/d", or an adjustable regimen: "Elevated fasting BG Increase HS basal doses", "Elevated midday meal BG Increase breakfast prandial insulin doses", "Elevated pre-evening meal BG Increase midday prandial insulin dose", and "Elevated bedtime BG Increase dinner prandial insulin dose", with "Increase dose by 10% to 20% depending on severity of BG elevation"; for premixed insulin, "FBG/premeal BG > 180 mg/dL Increase AM or PM dose depending on times of BG elevation" and "Increase dose by 10% to 20%". Step 3 (hypoglycemia) adjusts down: "Low fasting BG Reduce HS basal dose" with "Decrease dose by 10% to 20% depending on severity of hypoglycemia", plus "Low midday meal BG Reduce breakfast prandial dose", "Low pre-evening meal BG Reduce midday prandial dose", and "Low bedtime BG Reduce evening prandial dose"; for premixed insulin, "Low BGs in AM or PM Reduce AM or PM dose" with "Reduce dose by 10% to 20% depending on severity of BG reduction". For most persons with T2D taking insulin, glycemic targets are stated as "A1C < 7% and fasting and premeal blood glucose < 110 mg/dL, in the absence of hypoglycemia".

### The three numbers you need to know about healthcare: the 60-30-10 challenge [^d6cb22ab]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Healthcare represents a paradox. While change is everywhere, performance has flatlined: 60% of care on average is in line with evidence- or consensus-based guidelines, 30% is some form of waste or of low value, and 10% is harm. The 60-30-10 Challenge has persisted for three decades.

Main Body

Current top-down or chain-logic strategies to address this problem, based essentially on linear models of change and relying on policies, hierarchies, and standardisation, have proven insufficient. Instead, we need to marry ideas drawn from complexity science and continuous improvement with proposals for creating a deep learning health system. This dynamic learning model has the potential to assemble relevant information including patients' histories, and clinical, patient, laboratory, and cost data for improved decision-making in real time, or close to real time. If we get it right, the learning health system will contribute to care being more evidence-based and less wasteful and harmful. It will need a purpose-designed digital backbone and infrastructure, apply artificial intelligence to support diagnosis and treatment options, harness genomic and other new data types, and create informed discussions of options between patients, families, and clinicians. While there will be many variants of the model, learning health systems will need to spread, and be encouraged to do so, principally through diffusion of innovation models and local adaptations.

Conclusion

Deep learning systems can enable us to better exploit expanding health datasets including traditional and newer forms of big and smaller-scale data, e.g. genomics and cost information, and incorporate patient preferences into decision-making. As we envisage it, a deep learning system will support healthcare's desire to continually improve, and make gains on the 60-30-10 dimensions. All modern health systems are awash with data, but it is only recently that we have been able to bring this together, operationalised, and turned into useful information by which to make more intelligent, timely decisions than in the past.

### Clinical cancer advances 2011: annual report on progress against cancer from the American Society of Clinical Oncology [^ab06fc33]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

A message from ASCO'S President. It has been forty years since President Richard Nixon signed the National Cancer Act of 1971, which many view as the nation's declaration of the "War on Cancer". The bill has led to major investments in cancer research and significant increases in cancer survival. Today, two-thirds of patients survive at least five years after being diagnosed with cancer compared with just half of all diagnosed patients surviving five years after diagnosis in 1975. The research advances detailed in this year's Clinical Cancer Advances demonstrate that improvements in cancer screening, treatment, and prevention save and improve lives. But although much progress has been made, cancer remains one of the world's most serious health problems. In the United States, the disease is expected to become the nation's leading cause of death in the years ahead as our population ages. I believe we can accelerate the pace of progress, provided that everyone involved in cancer care works together to achieve this goal. It is this viewpoint that has shaped the theme for my presidential term: Collaborating to Conquer Cancer. In practice, this means that physicians and researchers must learn from every patient's experience, ensure greater collaboration between members of a patient's medical team, and involve more patients in the search for cures through clinical trials. Cancer advocates, insurers, and government agencies also have important roles to play. Today, we have an incredible opportunity to improve the quality of cancer care by drawing lessons from the real-world experiences of patients. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) is taking the lead in this area, in part through innovative use of health information technology. In addition to our existing quality initiatives, ASCO is working with partners to develop a comprehensive rapid-learning system for cancer care. When complete, this system will provide physicians with personalized, real-time information that can inform the care of every patient with cancer as well as connect patients with their entire medical teams. The rapid learning system will form a continuous cycle of learning: securely capturing data from every patient at the point of care, drawing on evidence-based guidelines, and evaluating quality of care against those standards and the outcomes of other patients. Clinical trials are another area in which collaboration is critical. Increasing clinical trial participation will require commitment across the cancer community from physicians, patients, insurers, hospitals, and industry. A 2010 report by the Institute of Medicine described challenges to participation in trials by both physicians and patients and provided recommendations for revitalizing clinical trials conducted through the National Cancer Institute's Cooperative Group Program. ASCO has pledged its support for the full implementation of these recommendations. More broadly, ASCO recently outlined a bold vision for translational and clinical cancer research for the next decade and made recommendations to achieve that vision. Accelerating Progress Against Cancer: ASCO's Blueprint for Transforming Clinical and Translational Research, released in November, calls for a research system that takes full advantage of today's scientific and technologic opportunities and sets a high-level agenda for policy makers, regulators, and advocates. Cancer research has transformed cancer care in the past forty years, and this year's Clinical Cancer Advances illustrates how far we have come in the past year alone. We now have a tremendous opportunity to use today's knowledge and collaborate across all facets of cancer care to conquer this deadly disease. Michael P. Link, MD President American Society of Clinical Oncology.

### Ezetimibe added to statin therapy after acute coronary syndromes [^a38974de]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

The study IMPROVE-IT was published by Cannon CP and colleagues in 2015 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Dyslipidemia, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction and Unstable angina. In the IMPROVE-IT study, the trial question was: what is the effect of the addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy in patients who have been hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome? In the IMPROVE-IT study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the IMPROVE-IT study, the population was: 18144 patients (4416 female, 13728 male). The inclusion criteria were patients who had been hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome within the preceding 10 days and had LDL cholesterol levels of 50 to 100 mg/dL. The key exclusion criteria were planned CABG for the acute coronary syndrome event, CrCl of < 30 mL/min, active liver disease, or use of statin therapy that had LDL cholesterol-lowering potency > 40 mg of simvastatin. In the IMPROVE-IT study, the interventions were: n = 9067 simvastatin-ezetimibe (simvastatin at a dose of 40 mg plus ezetimibe at a dose of 10 mg, once daily) n = 9077 simvastatin monotherapy once daily (simvastatin at a dose of 40 mg plus placebo). In the IMPROVE-IT study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death from cardiovascular causes, major coronary event, or nonfatal stroke, Kaplan-Meier event rate at 7 years (32.7% vs. 34.7%; HR 0.936, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.99). In the IMPROVE-IT study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in median time-weighted average LDL cholesterol level (53.2 vs. 69.9; difference 16.7, 95% CI -17.49 to -16.02). In the IMPROVE-IT study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in rates of prespecified muscle, gallbladder, and hepatic adverse events and cancer. In the IMPROVE-IT study, the conclusion was: in patients who had been hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome within the preceding 10 days and had LDL cholesterol levels of 50 to 100 mg/dL, simvastatin-ezetimibe was superior to simvastatin monotherapy once daily with respect to death from cardiovascular causes, major coronary event, or nonfatal stroke, Kaplan-Meier event rate at 7 years.

### Finding an alternative diagnosis does not justify increased use of CT-pulmonary angiography [^1c9ecd28]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Results

Over the study period (2000 to 2010), there was a 27-fold increase in the total number of CTPA (Figure 1) without a corresponding increase in yield. The total number of CTPA in the three index years 2000, 2005 and 2008 were 84, 1114 and 2287 respectively. While the number of CTPA ordered increased in all departments, the ED had the largest increase. The numbers of scans performed in the ED per 100 visits were 0.14 in 2000, 1.82 in 2005 and 2.58 in 2008. The ED also had the steepest decline in the percentage of scans positive for PE (Figure 2).

Figure 2
Number of CTPA by hospital department for the index years 2000, 2005 and 2008. The largest increase occurred in the emergency department (ED) which also had the steepest decline in positive yield (% above bars).

Justification for CTPA

We assessed whether the use of CTPA is justified in those with low or intermediate pre-test probability by the finding of an alternative diagnosis that might explain the patient's symptoms. The frequency of alternate diagnoses found on CTPA was as follows: ED: 10%, Medicine: 5%, Surgery: 3%; p = 0.08. When we examine the data more closely, only 3.2% of potentially avoidable CTPA (low or intermediate pre-test probability and negative D-dimer) had an alternative diagnosis that was neither previously known nor evident on a chest radiograph performed prior to the CTPA.

Findings on prior chest X-ray

13% of the patients did not have a prior chest X-ray defined as within 48 hours of CTPA. Among those who did undergo a chest X-ray, the findings were as follows: 40% normal, 14% pleural effusion, 11% pulmonary edema, 6% atelectasis, 6% infiltrate, and 10% other.

### 2022 ASNC / AAPM / SCCT / SNMMI guideline for the use of CT in hybrid nuclear / CT cardiac imaging [^a243eff6]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Coronary artery calcium score (CACS) with SPECT and PET myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) adds diagnostic and prognostic information: CACS results also add diagnostic and prognostic value to both SPECT and PET MPI. In SPECT, adding CACS avoided rest imaging in a large percentage (64%) of patients with either a probably normal (72%), equivocal (47%), or probably abnormal (40%) study, and severe (> 400) CACS was found in 6.5% to more than 20% of patients with a normal stress MPI. In symptomatic patients, a recent study of 4,897 with suspected CAD showed that 69% of patients with a normal SPECT had an abnormal CACS > 0, and 15% had a CACS > 400; a meta-analysis of 20 studies reported a 23.6% prevalence of ischemia on SPECT in patients with a CACS > 400, ranging from 12.4% to 57.1%. For prognosis, SPECT MPI plus CACS in 1,126 patients with follow-up for up to 12 years added incremental prognostic value at every level of MPI abnormality, with event rates rising as CACS severity increased; the warranty period for a normal MPI is estimated to be 3 years, and risks for total cardiac and all-cause death increases with the severity of the CACS.

### Trends in flood losses in Europe over the past 150 years [^208f2703]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Comparison of trends in annual flood losses

Values are in % per year and equal the rate parameter in Poisson regression. The time periods all end in 2016. For uncertainty ranges, see Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6

a normalized by wealth

b normalized by GDP

c significant at α = 0.05

Normalization has a considerable effect on the observed results. The downward trend in fatalities becomes much more pronounced, reaching –4.6% per year (1950–2016). It also becomes statistically significant except for the period between 1970 and 2016; however, uncertainty regarding past exposure to floods renders the trends for this time period insignificant. Nonetheless, during the period from the 1980s to the present there have been fewer (normalized) deaths than almost any period prior. In contrast, the number of persons affected increases consistently throughout time, but the trend is less pronounced than before normalization (approximately 1% per year compared to almost 2% without adjustment). Still, the total number of flood victims peak around the year 2000. In terms of financial losses, the increase for 1870–2016 becomes smaller after normalization (1.4–1.5% per year instead of 3%), but still significant. However, when using the starting years 1900 and 1930 for the analysis, the trend in financial losses becomes statistically insignificant. The biggest shift in financial losses occurs for the period between 1950 and 2016 where the trend (−2.6% per year) is statistically significant. This is similar to the finding before normalization, however the trend is now downward rather than upward. Correcting losses by changes in both GDP and wealth indicates that losses peaked in the 1950s rather than the 2000s. In general, flood losses have been declining in the entire post-1945 period despite some noticeable cycles of higher and lower loss-generating periods.

### Does a first-case on-time-start initiative achieve its goal by starting the entire process earlier or by tightening the distribution of start times? [^afadcb75]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Background

We explored whether a previously successful initiative to improve first-case on-time starts succeeded because (i) preoperative steps started earlier (but the process did not necessarily improve) or (ii) the process was brought into better control.

Methods

We analysed 35 months of data comprising 28 882 first cases to calculate the difference of the time a patient entered the operating room (OR) vs the scheduled entry time. Median and inter-quartile range were used to evaluate changes in distribution parameters. A statistical process-control methodology was used to compare the differences in performance between the pre- and post-intervention phases.

Results

Post-intervention first cases entered the OR on average within 4 min [95% confidence interval (CI): 4–5 min] of the scheduled start time, as opposed to within 8 min (95% CI: 8–8 min) in the pre-intervention period. The median delay decreased from 5 min (95% CI: 5–5 min) to 2 min (95% CI: 2–2 min). The inter-quartile range of the difference between the scheduled start time and the first case in room time decreased from 13 min (95% CI: 13–13 min) to 10 min (95% CI: 9–10 min).

Conclusions

The reduction in inter-quartile range demonstrates that improvement in on-time starts resulted from the process being in better control. The start time of preoperative preparatory activities did not move earlier, which means that OR and preoperative staff do not need to arrive at work earlier. Improvements resulting from the process being in control were sustained.

### Complications, adverse drug events, high costs, and disparities in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children vs COVID-19 [^76ca7e67]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Did outcomes vary by the number of organ systems affected in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) in 2021?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study of 4107 MIS-C hospitalizations, as the number of organ systems affected increased from 2 to 6 or more, mortality increased from 1% to 6%, length of stay doubled from 4 to 8 days, adverse medication events increased from 5% to 18%, and the percentage of patients with MIS-C who were Black doubled from 16% to 32%. All of these increases were statistically significant.

Meaning

The findings of this study suggest that future efforts should focus on how to prevent MIS-C from progressing to multiple organ system dysfunction.

### ACMT position statement: remove the waiver requirement for prescribing buprenorphine for opioid use disorder [^b53db0e1]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2019). High credibility.

Increasing buprenorphine access — regulatory limits and projected impact: The waiver requirement serves as a major barrier to prescribing and access, with prescribers limited to treating 30 patients or fewer at a time in the first year of training, increasing in subsequent years to a maximum of 275. Today, fewer than 5% of eligible prescribers in the United States have a waiver, and nearly 30% of rural Americans live in a county without a buprenorphine prescriber; areas with decreased buprenorphine prescriber availability demonstrate increased mortality. By removing the waiver requirement for outpatient buprenorphine prescription, the number of eligible prescribers could increase by a factor as high as 20. The Emergency Department (ED) is a logical setting to begin OAT.

### The effect of a tuberculosis chest X-ray image reference set on non-expert reader performance [^0d62003d]. European Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Non-expert accuracy compared with experts

Experts showed a higher mean percentage of correct decisions at baseline than all non-experts combined. However, this difference was not significant: 67.8 (SD 8.9) vs 62.5 (SD 7.6). Specificity was equal at 49.1 (SD 11.0) and 51.7 (SD 20.3). Sensitivity of experts was higher at 84.2 (SD 5.2) vs 67.6 (SD 14.9). Using TIRS, non-expert percentage agreement and specificity did not change significantly. Sensitivity increased to 75.5 (SD 11.1) and approached expert values at 84.2 (SD 5.2). For the subgroups of DRs and COs, all results followed this same pattern.

For the smear-negative subset there were no significant differences between experts and non-experts in mean percentage of agreement with the gold standard or specificity, either at baseline or using TIRS (Fig. 3). Mean sensitivity for experts was higher than for non-experts at 80.4 (SD 6.8) vs 69.4 (SD 16.9), but not significantly different. The same was noted for both DR and CO subgroups.

Clinical officer accuracy after CRRS training

Results for readings after CRRS are presented in Table 3. The small number of CXRs in the smear-negative subset precluded meaningful subgroup analysis for these two readers. Using the standardised CRRS proforma, the average percentage agreement with the gold standard increased from 62.7 (with TIRS) to 71.2, with agreement corrected for chance increasing from κ = 0.181 to 0.367 (Table 3). Sensitivity increased from 68.8 to 75.0 and specificity from 50 to 63. Using our question regarding decision to treat, the percentage agreements and kappa increased to 67.8 and 0.256 respectively. Sensitivity increased to 79.8, while specificity decreased to 44.8%.

### Hourly step recommendations to achieve daily goals for working and older adults [^45deacdb]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Studies have shown that prompts are an effective intervention in changing step behaviour for most participants. As different demographic groups exercise at different timings (e.g. working versus older adults), personalised prompts may be more beneficial at specific times convenient for individuals. We provide the step counts that participants should achieve in the evenings to ensure they achieve the daily step goals (5000, 7500, or 10,000 steps) by the end of the day (Table 3 and Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). These recommendations could then be experimentally tested in future studies.

The results suggest that the daily step goals (5000, 7500, or 10,000 steps) influenced the steps behaviour of the participants. The number of participant days rose sharply from 1090 (2.08%) with 9500–9999 steps to 7507 (14.3%) with 10,000 to 10,499 steps (Fig. 1a). The increase in the HealthPoints earned (from 25 (7500–9999 steps) to 40 (10,000 steps and above) HealthPoints) would reduce the days required to complete the first tier from 30 to 19 days (Supplementary Table S1). By setting a 10,000 daily step goal, participants whose daily step counts were just below 10,000 could have been motivated by the incentives to put in extra effort to achieve the goal, leading to the observed spike. However, we also observed a decreasing number of participant days after each goal, which may indicate that participants lose motivation once the goal has been achieved.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of irritable bowel syndrome [^28ad97fb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) — positive diagnostic strategy versus diagnosis of exclusion: We recommend a positive diagnostic strategy as compared to a diagnostic strategy of exclusion for patients with symptoms of IBS to improve cost-effectiveness. Strong recommendation; high quality of evidence. A careful clinical history with key symptoms and their duration (> 6 months), plus examination and minimal testing, is described as sufficient to diagnose IBS. Diagnostic performance data note Rome III criteria performed modestly (69.6% sensitivity and 82.0% specificity), and adding clinical and laboratory enhancements increased to 95.9% specificity. In randomized primary care patients believed to have IBS and without alarm signs, 300 were randomized; none of the patients meeting Rome III criteria at baseline were reclassified at 1 year, and a positive diagnostic strategy was determined to be noninferior to a diagnosis of exclusion. Practice and cost observations show more than 70% of community-based providers believed IBS to be a diagnosis of exclusion, and these providers ordered nearly twice the number tests per patient and consumed $400 more per patient than those using a positive diagnostic strategy. In an employer-based claims study among patients with IBS-D, within the first 2 years after diagnosis, nearly 80% of health care costs were associated with a diagnosis of exclusion, whereas only about 20% of patient costs could be related to treatment specifically.

### Modeling and forecasting the total number of cases and deaths due to pandemic [^4243a391]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has appeared as the predominant disease of the 21st century at the end of 2019 and was a drastic start with thousands of casualties and the COVID-19 victims in 2020. Due to the drastic effect, COVID-19 scientists are trying to work on pandemic diseases and Governments are interested in the development of methodologies that will minimize the losses and speed up the process of cure by providing vaccines and treatment for such pandemics. The development of a new vaccine for any pandemic requires long in vitro and in vivo trials to use. Thus the strategies require understanding how the pandemic is spreading in terms of affected cases and casualties occurring from this disease, here we developed a forecasting model that can predict the no of cases and deaths due to pandemic and that can help the researcher, government, and other stakeholders to devise their strategies so that the damages can be minimized. This model can also be used for the judicial distribution of resources as it provides the estimates of the number of casualties and number of deaths with high accuracy, Government and policymakers on the basis of forecasted value can plan in a better way. The model efficiency is discussed on the basis of the available dataset of John Hopkins University repository in the period when the disease was first reported in the six countries till the mid of May 2020, the model was developed on the basis of this data, and then it is tested by forecasting the no of deaths and cases for next 7 days, where the proposed strategy provided excellent forecasting. The forecast models are developed for six countries including Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Iran, Italy, and China using polynomial regression of degrees 3–5. But the models are analyzed up to the 6th-degree and the suitable models are selected based on higher adjusted R-square (R 2) and lower root-mean-square error and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The values of R 2 are greater than 99% for all countries other than China whereas for China this R 2 was 97%. The high values of R 2 and Low value of MAPE statistics increase the validity of proposed models to forecast the total no cases and total no of deaths in all countries. Iran, Italy, and Afghanistan also show a mild decreasing trend but the number of cases is far higher than the decrease percentage. Although India is expected to have a consistent result, more or less it depicts some other biasing factors which should be figured out in separate research.
