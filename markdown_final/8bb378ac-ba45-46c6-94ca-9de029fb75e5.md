## Question

can guillen-burre ever cause descending paralysis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Guillain-Barré syndrome can ever cause descending paralysis and, if so, how to interpret that clinically and diagnostically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the classic pattern of GBS and whether it is strictly ascending. Then, I should verify if there are recognized variants or case reports describing a descending pattern. Next, I will review the differential diagnosis, especially botulism, and check for overlapping features that could confound the picture. After that, I should examine the pathophysiology to see if descending involvement is plausible. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious conclusion and outline practical diagnostic steps and implications for management, making sure I double-check each claim against guidelines and high-quality reviews as I go.

> Let me first confirm the canonical pattern of GBS. Classically, GBS presents with rapidly progressive, relatively symmetric weakness that starts distally in the legs and ascends over days to involve the arms, trunk, cranial nerves, and potentially respiratory muscles, with areflexia or hyporeflexia and a monophasic course reaching nadir within about 2–4 weeks. This is repeatedly emphasized in authoritative reviews and guidelines, and it anchors the initial diagnostic impression I should maintain [^116ENUDF] [^115GACMK] [^111XFoXV].

> Wait, let me verify whether "descending paralysis" is ever described in GBS. There are credible case reports and series documenting atypical presentations where weakness begins in cranial or bulbar muscles and then descends, including isolated ptosis evolving to descending paralysis and early arm, facial, and bulbar involvement with subsequent leg weakness. These are rare but real, and they underscore that GBS is a clinical spectrum rather than a single rigid phenotype [^114uLDD2] [^112E1gQt].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — this descending pattern is uncommon and can mimic botulism, which is classically a descending flaccid paralysis beginning with cranial nerves in an afebrile, alert patient without sensory loss. I need to ensure we keep botulism high on the differential when the pattern is descending, because delays in antitoxin reduce outcomes, whereas GBS requires IVIG or plasma exchange rather than antitoxin [^115f1Sux] [^117MfEFg].

> I should double-check the pathophysiology to see if descending involvement is plausible in GBS. GBS is an immune-mediated polyradiculoneuropathy with multifocal peripheral nerve injury; although the distribution of weakness often reflects distal-to-proximal spread, immune attack can target cranial nerves early, producing bulbar or ocular onset that then progresses caudally, which provides a biologically coherent mechanism for a descending clinical trajectory in select cases [^111bJ9id] [^115oqJ8F].

> Let me consider the diagnostic implications carefully. A descending pattern should prompt me to reconsider the diagnosis and actively exclude botulism, myasthenia gravis, tick paralysis, and other neuromuscular junction or toxic etiologies. Electrodiagnostic testing, CSF analysis, and careful attention to sensory signs, pupillary involvement, and antecedent exposures help separate GBS from its mimics, and guidelines explicitly acknowledge the heterogeneity of GBS presentations while emphasizing the need to exclude alternative causes [^115GACMK] [^115NVcQ6] [^117MfEFg].

> I need to ensure I state the bottom line precisely. Yes, Guillain-Barré syndrome can rarely present with descending paralysis, typically when cranial or bulbar muscles are involved first with subsequent caudal spread; however, this is atypical and much less common than the classic ascending pattern, and it mandates a deliberate search for alternative diagnoses — especially botulism — before committing to immunotherapy pathways unique to GBS [^114uLDD2] [^112E1gQt] [^115f1Sux].

> Next, I should review practical steps if I encounter suspected descending GBS. I will now examine the history for antecedent infection, food exposure, and travel. Perform serial respiratory assessments including cough and vital capacity given the risk of ventilatory failure. Obtain CSF to look for albuminocytologic dissociation recognizing early normal protein does not exclude GBS. And use electrodiagnostics to support a peripheral neuropathy pattern, all while initiating urgent neurology input and considering early immunotherapy if GBS is likely and botulism is reasonably excluded, because timely IVIG or plasma exchange improves outcomes [^114gFNy4] [^115nCePj] [^116zNDNH] [^112n6aLp].

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is classically an **ascending paralysis** [^1149MzHU], but rare variants can present with **descending weakness** [^114uLDD2], typically starting in the cranial or bulbar muscles and progressing downward [^114uLDD2]. These atypical presentations are uncommon and can mimic botulism or myasthenia gravis, so careful clinical evaluation and electrophysiology are essential [^117MfEFg]. Descending GBS is treated the same as classic GBS, with intravenous immunoglobulin or plasma exchange, and early recognition is important to prevent respiratory complications [^116ijrte] [^113b4xWR].

---

## Typical clinical presentation of GBS

GBS typically presents with the following features:

- **Ascending paralysis**: Symmetrical weakness starting in the distal lower limbs and progressing proximally [^112aLDGE] [^111XFoXV].
- **Areflexia**: Loss of deep tendon reflexes [^112E8A7i].
- **Sensory symptoms**: Paresthesias and sensory loss [^111XFoXV].
- **Cranial nerve involvement**: Especially bilateral facial palsy [^1138rkon].
- **Autonomic dysfunction**: Blood pressure instability, cardiac arrhythmias [^1115Gczw].
- **Respiratory involvement**: Approximately 20–30% require mechanical ventilation [^116ENUDF].

---

## Descending paralysis in GBS

While GBS is typically ascending, rare variants can present with **descending paralysis**, in which weakness begins in the cranial or bulbar muscles and progresses downward [^114uLDD2]. This pattern is uncommon and accounts for a minority of cases [^114uLDD2].

---

## Clinical variants associated with descending paralysis

Several GBS variants have been reported to present with **descending paralysis**:

| **Variant** | **Clinical features** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|-|
| Pharyngeal-cervical-brachial variant | - Weakness starts in the pharyngeal, cervical, and brachial muscles <br/> - Descends to the lower limbs | Rare [^notfound] |
| Miller Fisher syndrome | - Ophthalmoplegia <br/> - Ataxia <br/> - Areflexia <br/> - Can progress to descending paralysis | Rare [^notfound] |
| Acute bulbar palsy variant | - Initial bulbar weakness <br/> - Descending progression | Rare [^notfound] |

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

The pathophysiology of descending GBS is similar to classic GBS, involving **immune-mediated demyelination** or axonal injury of peripheral nerves [^111Jtb6C]. Molecular mimicry between microbial antigens and peripheral nerve components triggers an autoimmune response, leading to nerve damage [^112n6aLp].

---

## Diagnostic challenges

Descending GBS presents diagnostic challenges due to its rarity and overlap with other neuromuscular disorders, such as botulism and myasthenia gravis [^115NVcQ6]. Key diagnostic tools include:

- **Clinical evaluation**: Detailed history and neurological examination [^111XFoXV].
- **Electrophysiological studies**: Nerve conduction studies and electromyography to differentiate demyelinating and axonal forms [^112n6aLp].
- **Cerebrospinal fluid analysis**: Albuminocytologic dissociation (elevated protein with normal cell count) [^115nCePj].
- **MRI**: Gadolinium-enhanced MRI may show nerve root enhancement, supporting the diagnosis [^113hKJnw].

---

## Treatment and prognosis

Treatment of descending GBS follows the same principles as classic GBS:

- **Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)**: First-line therapy [^113rHNmd].
- **Plasma exchange (plasmapheresis)**: Alternative or adjunctive therapy [^113b4xWR].
- **Supportive care**: Respiratory support, autonomic monitoring, and rehabilitation [^111Jtb6C].

Prognosis varies depending on severity and response to therapy. Most patients recover significantly, though some may have residual deficits [^1174FALf].

---

## Conclusion

Although GBS typically presents with ascending paralysis, rare variants can cause **descending paralysis** [^114uLDD2]. Early recognition and accurate diagnosis are crucial for effective management and improved outcomes [^113AwJ9t].

Introduction

Guillain-Barré syndrome is the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis worldwide. Microorganisms such as Campylobacter jejuni, Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Zika virus have been linked to the disease. The most common clinical variants are acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and acute motor axonal neuropathy. Plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulins are the standard therapy for the disease.

Areas Covered

Research to elucidate the pathophysiology of Guillain-Barré syndrome has led to the development of drugs directed towards new potential therapeutic targets. This review offers a comprehensive view of the current treatment based upon the physiopathology.

Expert Opinion

Patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome need a multidisciplinary approach, limitation to walk unaided and disability score are indicators for treatment as well as the presence of autonomic dysfunction and pain. Admission to intensive care units should be considered for those patients presenting with respiratory failure, bulbar involvement and progression of the disease. Research aimed to deciphering the pathophysiology of the disease, discovering new biomarkers and establishing algorithms of prediction of both the disease and its outcomes is warranted.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome and COVID-19 vaccination: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111uUkr6]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), a rare but potentially fatal disorder, is thought to be an autoimmune, post-infective polyradiculoneuropathy and is the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis with an overall annual incidence of 1.1–1.8 cases per 100,000. The GBS eponym is an umbrella term including a number of related autoimmune neuropathies including the GBS and Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS) variants with their subtypes. In about two-thirds of patients, a gastrointestinal or respiratory infection precedes, within six weeks, the onset of GBS. GBS has been also possibly associated with several vaccines and an excess of GBS cases was detected in the United States during the 1976/1977 "swine flu" (H1N1) vaccination campaign. Epidemiological analyses showed that the rate of GBS attributable to the vaccine was approximately 4.9–5.9 per million vaccinations and greater from 14 to 28 days post-vaccination, with a 7.3-fold increase in the risk of developing GBS. Since then, several studies have assessed the risk of GBS following influenza vaccines with only two studies suggesting approximately one additional GBS case per one million vaccinations. An increased risk of GBS (3 excess cases per million of doses) has been also reported following the administration of the recombinant zoster vaccine. No other vaccines have been convincingly linked to GBS.

### To be, or not to be… Guillain-Barrésyndrome [^115CSE29]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) is currently the most frequent cause of acute flaccid paralysis on a global scale, being an autoimmune disorder wherein demyelination of the peripheral nerves occurs. Its main clinical features are a symmetrical ascending muscle weakness with reduced osteotendinous reflexes and variable sensory involvement. GBS most commonly occurs after an infection, especially viral (including COVID-19), but may also transpire after immunization with certain vaccines or in the development of specific malignancies. Immunoglobulins, plasmapheresis, and glucocorticoids represent the principal treatment modalities, however patients with severe disease progression may require supportive therapy in an intensive care unit. Due to its symptomology, which overlaps with numerous neurological and infectious illnesses, the diagnosis of GBS may often be misattributed to pathologies that are essentially different from this syndrome. Moreover, many of these require specific treatment methods distinct to those recommended for GBS, in lack of which the prognosis of the patient is drastically affected. Such diseases include exposure to toxins either environmental or foodborne, central nervous system infections, metabolic or serum ion alterations, demyelinating pathologies, or even conditions amenable to neurosurgical intervention. This extensive narrative review aims to systematically and comprehensively tackle the most notable and challenging differential diagnoses of GBS, emphasizing on the clinical discrepancies between the diseases, the appropriate paraclinical investigations, and suitable management indications.

### Diagnosis and management of Guillain-Barrésyndrome in ten steps [^115GACMK]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) is an inflammatory disease of the PNS and is the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis, with an annual global incidence of approximately 1–2 per 100,000 person-years. GBS occurs more frequently in males than in females and the incidence increases with age, although all age groups can be affected. Patients with GBS typically present with weakness and sensory signs in the legs that progress to the arms and cranial muscles, although the clinical presentation of the disease is heterogeneous and several distinct clinical variants exist. Diagnosis of GBS is based on the patient history and neurological, electrophysiological and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations –. Other diseases that have a similar clinical picture to GBS must be ruled out. Electrophysiological studies provide evidence of PNS dysfunction and can distinguish between the subtypes of GBS: acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP), acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) and acute motor sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN). Disease progression can be rapid, and most patients with GBS reach their maximum disability within 2 weeks. About 20% of patients with GBS develop respiratory failure and require mechanical ventilation. Cardiac arrhythmias and blood pressure instability can occur owing to involvement of the autonomic nervous system. This involvement of the autonomic nervous system contributes to mortality, which is estimated at 3–10% for patients with GBS even with the best medical care available –. After the initial progressive phase, patients with GBS reach a plateau phase that can last from days to weeks or months, after which they start to recover, and 60–80% of patients with GBS are able to walk independently 6 months after disease onset, with or without treatment. GBS is a monophasic illness, although some patients can deteriorate after first stabilizing or improving on therapy — a phenomenon that is referred to as a treatment-related fluctuation (TRF). Relapses of GBS can occur in 2–5% of patients.

Challenges and prospects in research preparedness

The first aims when studying a possible link between an infectious agent and GBS are to determine if a true association exists and to determine the impact in terms of frequency and severity. During an outbreak, observational cohorts are set up rapidly by clinicians, some of whom may lack experience in diagnosing and managing GBS due to the need to quickly mobilise personnel. These studies are often done at a single centre and not harmonised with GBS research from other centres, which can result in missing out of important clinical information.

How can one ensure a high-quality study within the limited time frame afforded by an infectious disease epidemic? Many hurdles must be overcome before recruitment can be started, and accurate and sufficient data collection is complex. Here, we list the most important hurdles and provide suggestions on how to deal with them.

### New insights in the immune treatment of Guillain-Barrésyndrome [^113KXQgq]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) is the most frequent cause of acute flaccid paralysis with an incidence rate of 1–2 per 100 000 per year worldwide. This immune-mediated polyradiculopathy has a typical monophasic disease course. GBS usually starts with rapidly progressive weakness of the limbs, which may extend to cranial muscles (50%) and respiratory muscles (20%). In addition, patients with GBS may develop severe sensory deficits and autonomic dysfunction. Following the progressive phase, which can last up to four weeks, patients stabilize and begin to improve over the course of month to years, although patients often recover incompletely.

Preceding infections are associated with GBS and include pathogens such as Campylobacter jejuni, Mycoplasma pneumonia, cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, hepatitis virus, and Zika virus. Infections with C. jejuni and M. pneumoniae trigger a cross-reactive antibody response to glycosylated antigens at peripheral nerve myelin and/or axon via molecular mimicry. The pathogenesis of GBS following viral infections remains largely undetermined. Various patterns of antibody reactivity to nerve gangliosides and other glycolipids have been identified in GBS, correlating with clinical presentation and disease course. Upon binding to nerves, these antibodies activate complement which results in dysfunction and injury of nerve axons and myelin. Recent studies have also suggested the presence of nerve-targeting T-cells in GBS.

Box 1
no caption available

The monophasic disease course of GBS is explained by the short-lasting immune response and the capacity of peripheral nerves to regenerate. Most patients are reaching clinical nadir within one week after onset of weakness, and at some stage of disease start to improve, even in the absence of treatment. Preceding infections in GBS are usually self-limiting and frequently mild or subclinical. Serum antibodies targeting gangliosides typically disappear within a few weeks to months, however continued presence of these antibodies may occur and is associated with less favorable recovery. All current immune treatments in GBS are focusing on the acute stage of disease, aiming to prevent further immune-mediated damaging of peripheral nerves. Specific targets of this treatment in GBS are antineural antibodies (neutralization or removal by plasma exchange, immune absorption, degrading enzymes, FcRn blockade, or saturation), complement activation (neutralizing C1q, C2, C3, and other complement factors), and their subsequent damaging effects (Table 1).

### Guillain-barrésyndrome [^115oqJ8F]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2024). High credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rare immune-mediated polyradiculoneuropathy. Patients typically develop rapidly progressive weakness and sensory deficits that can result in complete paralysis requiring mechanical ventilation. GBS is usually a monophasic disease in which an aberrant immune response to an infection or other trigger damages the peripheral nerves. For example, in patients with preceding Campylobacter jejuni infection, molecular mimicry causes a cross-reactive antibody response to nerve gangliosides. Diagnosis is based on clinical features, supported by cerebrospinal fluid analysis and nerve conduction studies. Effective treatments include plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulins. However, ~20% of patients who received treatment are unable to walk after 6 months and ~5% die as a consequence of GBS. Important knowledge gaps in GBS include its pathogenesis, especially after viral infections. In addition, there is a lack of specific biomarkers to improve the diagnosis, monitor the disease activity, and predict the clinical course and outcome of GBS. Major challenges for the future include finding more effective and personalized treatments, which are affordable in low-income and middle-income countries, and preparation for outbreaks of infections as potential triggers for GBS.

INTRODUCTION

Guillain‐Barré syndrome (GBS) is the most common cause of acute neuromuscular paralysis worldwide. It can be a severe and life‐threatening condition, and early treatment is essential for a better prognosis. Over 100 years after it was first described, GBS is now one of the best understood neuroinflammatory diseases, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms of peripheral nerve inflammation. However, many aspects of its nature continue to elude our comprehension, and the full scope of GBS remains a puzzle yet to be fully deciphered. We know that GBS is a postinfectious, monophasic, immune‐mediated polyradiculoneuropathy, and its diagnosis is largely based on clinical patterns with or without the support of laboratory findings and electrophysiology. About a third of patients with GBS develop a severe, generalised neuropathy, and ultimately require mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. One in 20 patients die. Increased understanding of GBS has not been paralleled by progress in therapeutics, and the mainstay of treatment remains intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) or plasma exchange (PLEX). Outcome measures and interval neurological examination are used to monitor disease activity and response to treatment, whilst the potential role of fluid biomarkers of neuropathy remains under evaluation. Novel therapies are also being explored and may soon contribute to clinical management. In light of the new European Academy of Neurology (EAN) and Peripheral Nerve Society (PNS) guidelines on diagnosis and treatment of GBS, this review summarises current knowledge and best available evidence, to inform clinicians and scientists as they navigate the journey through Guillain‐Barré syndrome.

Purpose Of Review

Guillain-Barre syndrome is sometimes a severe and disabling postinfectious neuromuscular paralysis that is causally associated with a number of well defined infections, and occasionally with immunization. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (Sars-CoV-2) pandemic and the worldwide immunization programme provoked fears of an epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) related disease. As we emerge from the pandemic this review summarises some of the huge volume of publications about Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), COVID-19 and immunisation against it.

Recent Findings

In the early months of COVID-19, there were concerns of significant numbers of cases of GBS resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Large epidemiological studies have provided reassurance that the association of GBS with COVID-19 is small or absent. Despite considerable efforts, plausible pathogenic mechanisms aligned with our understanding of GBS causation have not been identified. Reliable data from national surveillance of COVID-19 vaccinations have shown GBS to occur at about 5.8 cases per million first doses of adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccines, otherwise not distinguishable from incident naturally occurring cases. However, this risk is far outweighed by the protective benefits of vaccination in the at-risk older deciles of age.

Summary

With no obvious link of GBS to COVID-19 epitopes, in particular the spike (S-)protein, but a clearly demonstrable causation in some susceptible individuals from the global rollout of novel adenovirus vectored vaccine technologies, adenoviruses are of significant interest in the pathogenesis of GBS as well as vectors in their many expanding pharmaceutical applications.

CLINICAL PICTURE

In 1916, Guillain, Barré, and Strohl distinguished GBS from other causes of acute ascending paralysis, emphasizing the absence of tendon reflexes and the high cerebrospinal fluid protein content and normal cell count. The syndrome came to be regarded as an acute motor and sensory polyradiculoneuropathy predominantly affecting the limbs but often affecting the face, bulbar nerves, and respiration. In 1956, Miller Fisher drew attention to a syndrome of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and loss of the tendon reflexes, the Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS), which shared clinical features with GBS. This is milder than GBS unless it develops into MFS‐GBS overlap syndrome. Other variants affecting different regions, such as the pharyngeal–cervical–brachial form, have been added over the years. The limits of the syndrome have been defined by a consensus statement and the European Academy of Neurology/Peripheral Nerve Society guideline.

Further classification of GBS into subtypes has depended on deductions about the underlying pathology. In the early 1990s, McKhann and colleagues undertook clinicopathological studies of patients who died of GBS in Hebei Province, China and defined three forms of the disease. The commonest form in Europe and North America is a demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy that affects motor and sensory nerves, known as acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP). Less common is an acute axonal form first described by Feasby and colleagues and called acute motor–sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN) by Griffin and colleagues. A third form, called acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN), affects only motor axons. The axonal forms may be severe or mild. In the severe form, there is axonal degeneration and prolonged disability. In the mild form, there is only conduction block attributed to a nodopathy and compatible with rapid recovery.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome in times of pandemics [^112VdEpT]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is the last in line of several epidemics of infectious diseases that have been linked to the Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). As threats of epidemics of emerging infectious diseases persist, this is the time to learn from the past and to advance our response to future outbreaks in terms of research and management of GBS.

In the past decade, the world confronted several pandemics of emerging infectious diseases including Zika virus and most recently Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). One of the neurological complications reported in relation to these infectious diseases is the Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), a rapidly progressive immune-mediated polyradiculoneuropathy that can cause paresis in all limbs, cranial and respiratory muscles. Approximately 20% require admission at an intensive care unit (ICU), and 2%–12% die, depending on the care available.

In the past, research responses investigating a possible link between GBS and outbreaks of infectious diseases or vaccines have been delayed. This is problematic as healthcare institutions need to be able to prepare for increased incidences in patients with GBS, and public health personnel need to identify any possible mitigating factors. History now seems to repeat itself when case reports of SARS-CoV-2-related GBS are mounting, and disquiet over a possible association increases. As threats of epidemics of emerging infectious diseases persist, this is the time to learn from the past and to advance our response to future outbreaks in terms of research and management of GBS.

- sensory and/or motor conduction abnormalities consistent with a polyneuropathy

- absent H-reflexes

- facial nerve direct responses showing either increased distal motor latency or decreased compound muscle action potential amplitude

- blink responses either absent or showing prolonged ipsilateral R1 and R2 responses and contralateral R2 response.

### Very early and early neurophysiological abnormalities in Guillain-Barrésyndrome: a 4-year retrospective study [^113v2jka]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) and its variants are the most commonly acquired acute polyneuropathies and the leading cause of acute flaccid paralysis worldwide. GBS more often affects males and adults between 50 and 70 years of age (incidence = 0.81–1.89/100,000). There are several clinical presentations but the more common features are progressive bilateral weakness of the lower limbs often ascending to the arms and bulbar muscles, associated with absent or reduced tendon reflexes. Diagnosis is based on findings from clinical history and neurological examination. Electrophysiological and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations can corroborate the diagnosis. Abnormal findings in both are necessary to meet Brighton criteria Level 1 (highest level of certainty) or 2. Early detection and early initiation of treatment can limit disease severity, obviating the need for mechanical ventilation and improving the chances of early recovery.

Moreover, electrophysiological studies are key to diagnosis, subtype classification, and prognosis. Serial studies may be necessary for the diagnosis of subtypes, and a second study is recommended in patients lacking demyelinating features or with conduction blocks (CBs) without temporal dispersion. Early neurophysiological examinations can reveal anomalies that are not specific for primary demyelinating neuropathy and may not meet neurophysiological criteria for GBS. With the present study, we wanted to identify the most common electrophysiological abnormalities within 15 days from symptom onset in patients with GBS.

### Guillain-barréand Miller fisher syndromes – new diagnostic classification [^111bJ9id]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and its variant, Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS), exist as several clinical subtypes with different neurological features and presentations. Although the typical clinical features of GBS and MFS are well recognized, current classification systems do not comprehensively describe the full spectrum of either syndrome. In this Perspectives article, GBS and MFS are classified on the basis of current understanding of the common pathophysiological profiles of each disease phenotype. GBS is subclassified into classic and localized forms (for example, pharyngeal-cervical-brachial weakness and bifacial weakness with paraesthesias), and MFS is divided into incomplete (for example, acute ophthalmoparesis, acute ataxic neuropathy) and CNS subtypes (Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis). Diagnostic criteria based on clinical characteristics are suggested for each condition. We believe this approach to be more inclusive than existing systems, and argue that it could facilitate early clinical diagnosis and initiation of appropriate immunotherapy.

Introduction

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is, currently, the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis following the worldwide decline in incidence of poliomyelitis. Incidence varies according to age, geographic areas and diagnostic criteria used for inclusion. Annual incidence in western countries varies from 1.1 to 1.8/100,000 population per year with a considerably lower annual incidence of 0.66/100,000 population per year in each of Taiwan and China.

GBS usually follows infection by a number of bacterial and viral agents with Campylobacter jejuni representing the most common preceding infection. The syndrome is also reported to rarely temporally follow vaccination with measles vaccine, tetanus toxoid, rabies vaccine, oral polio vaccine, polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine, measles-rubella vaccine, flu vaccine and hepatitis B vaccine.

Since the publishing of the first report of the condition by Guillain, Barré, and Strohl in 1916, GBS has remained a clinically-diagnosed disorder. The condition is a polyneuropathy involving mainly motor but sometimes also sensory and autonomic nerves. It starts with rapidly progressive bilateral and relatively symmetric weakness in the lower limbs with diminished or absent deep tendon reflexes. Paralysis follows an ascending pattern involving trunk, upper limb and, finally, bulbar muscles. There can be numbness, parathesia and muscle pain and tenderness. Labile blood pressure with postural hypotension and labile heart rate with episodes of bradycardia up to asystole rarely occur denoting autonomic neuropathy. van Doorn et al. categorize diagnostic features of the condition into features required for diagnosis, including progressive weakness in both arms and legs, and areflexia or hyporeflexia, and features that strongly support the diagnosis, including progression of symptoms to a nadir over days to four weeks, relative symmetry of symptoms, mild sensory symptoms or signs, cranial nerve involvement, autonomic dysfunction, pain, a high concentration of protein in CSF without increase in cells and typical electro-diagnostic features.

Guillain-Barré syndrome

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) can be thought of as the peripheral nervous system counterpart to ADEM, with a post-infectious/inflammatory autoimmune pathophysiology (Fig. 8). It typically involves multiple peripheral nerves, most commonly the anterior nerve roots arising at the cauda equina. The classic clinical history consists of ascending weakness, which can progress to ascending paralysis, typically occurring after a bout of infection or after having received a vaccination. Most cases resolve within a few weeks without residual symptoms.

Transverse myelitis

Transverse myelitis is an inflammatory condition of the spinal cord with various underlying aetiologies. This condition may occur at any age; however, it is more common in younger patients. It typically presents with rapidly progressive bilateral sensory and motor dysfunction with a distinct cord level. Approximately one-third of affected patients recover fully while the remaining 60% will have either moderate or profound neurological deficits. There are various underlying aetiologies of transverse myelitis, including MS, systemic autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, vascular infarct, post-radiation, post-infectious, or idiopathic. MRI demonstrates a long segment T2 hyperintense cord lesion with bilateral cord involvement, occupying at least two-thirds of the cross-sectional area of the cord (Fig. 9).

Step 9: predicting outcome

Most patients with GBS, even those who were tetraplegic at nadir or required mechanical ventilation for a long period of time, show extensive recovery, especially in the first year after disease onset. About 80% of patients with GBS regain the ability to walk independently at 6 months after disease onset. The probability of regaining walking ability can be calculated in individual patients using the modified Erasmus GBS outcome score (mEGOS) prognostic tool(Supplementary Table 3).

Despite the generally positive prospects for patients with GBS, death occurs in 3–10% of cases, most commonly owing to cardiovascular and respiratory complications, which can occur in both the acute and the recovery phase –. Risk factors for mortality include advanced age and severe disease at onset. Long-term residual complaints are also common and can include neuropathic pain, weakness and fatigue –. However, recovery from these complaints may still occur > 5 years after disease onset.

Recurrent episodes of GBS are rare, affecting 2–5% of patients, but this percentage is still higher than the lifetime risk of GBS in the general population (0.1%). Many vaccines carry a warning about GBS, although prior GBS is not a strict contraindication for vaccination. Discussion with experts might be useful for patients who were diagnosed with GBS < 1 year before a planned vaccination or who previously developed GBS shortly after receiving the same vaccination. In these patients, the benefits of vaccination for specific illnesses (for example, influenza in elderly individuals) must be weighed against the small and possibly only theoretical risk of a recurrent GBS episode.

### Clinical overview of botulism… [^115f1Sux]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical features Botulism is a neuroparalytic illness characterized by symmetric, descending flaccid paralysis of motor and autonomic nerves, always beginning with the cranial nerves. Signs and symptoms may include:

- Dysphagia
- Muscle weakness
- Diplopia
- Ptosis
- Blurry vision
- Slurred speech
- Respiratory distress or failure
- Ocular palsy. Diagnosis Botulism differs from other flaccid paralyses in that it typically manifests initially with prominent cranial nerve palsies. It also differs in its:

- Invariable descending progression
- Symmetry
- Absence of sensory nerve dysfunction Botulism is frequently misdiagnosed, most often as a polyradiculoneuropathy, myasthenia gravis, or other diseases of the central nervous system.
- Bacterial or chemical food poisoning
- Cerebrovascular accident
- Chemical intoxication
- Congenital myopathy
- Electrolyte-mineral imbalance
- Guillain-Barré syndrome
- Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. Is your patient an infant. Treatment Antitoxin If clinical consultation supports botulism, request antitoxin immediately and begin treatment as soon as possible. Do not wait for laboratory confirmation. Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent and BabyBIG do not reverse paralysis but arrest its progression by neutralizing toxin circulating in the blood. Treating patients with botulism antitoxin early in the course of disease can prevent the progression of paralysis and consequent complications. Recovery Recovery follows the regeneration of new neuromuscular connections. This process takes weeks to months, even after antitoxin administration. Have patients start speech, physical, and occupational therapy as soon as possible. Diagnostic testing is done through your state public health department laboratory.

CDC provides testing services for some state public health departments. This specialized testing often takes days to complete. Follow up with your state health department if you do not receive results within five days. Keep Reading: Submit a Specimen for Testing Sequelae Death can result from respiratory failure or the consequences of extended paralysis. About 5% of patients die. Those who survive may have fatigue and shortness of breath for years.

### Cardiovascular complications of the Guillain-Barrésyndrome [^1115Gczw]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

The Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis in young adults and the elderly and an important cause of admission to intensive care units. Manifestations of the GBS vary from monoparesis to life-threatening paralysis of the respiratory muscles. The latter is often punctuated by the presence of cardiac involvement. This ranges from variations in blood pressure to involvement of the myocardium and potentially fatal arrhythmias. This review addresses some of the common cardiovascular complications of the GBS, with their myriad presentations and therapeutic options, as well as potential preventive measures that can be helpful in the management of patients admitted to intensive care units. In conclusion, it is necessary to recognize the potentially fatal cardiovascular complications associated with the GBS and treat them accordingly.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome [^111Jtb6C]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a group of autoimmune syndromes consisting of demyelinating and acute axonal degenerating forms of the disease. Nerve conduction study helps differentiate the heterogeneous subtypes of GBS. Patients exhibit a progressive paralysis that reaches a plateau phase. In most patients, resolution is complete or near complete. Mortality from GBS most often is associated with dysautonomia and mechanical ventilation. GBS usually is associated with an antecedent infection by one of several known pathogens. Cross-reactivity between the pathogen and the nerve tissue sets up the autoimmune response. Treatment consists of supportive care, ventilatory management (in about one third of patients), and specific therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis. Consultation with a neurologist is suggested.

### IVIG treatment and prognosis in Guillain-Barrésyndrome [^111p85v5]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) is a frequent cause of neuromuscular paralysis occurring at all ages. The incidence of GBS is reported to be 1.2–2.3 per 100,000 per year. GBS is a postinfectious disorder. The most frequently identified preceding infection is Campylobacter jejuni. Others are cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae. Many reports have documented the occurrence of GBS shortly after vaccinations, operations, or stressful events, but the causality and pathophysiology are still debated.

Main Features of GBS

The main features of GBS are rapid progressive bilateral and relative symmetrical weakness of the limbs with or without involvement of respiratory or cranial nerve-innervated muscles or sensory disturbances. Patients have decreased or absent tendon reflexes. Cerebrospinal fluid examination typically shows an increased protein level with a normal white cell count. Pain frequently occurs and may cause severe complaints. It often starts before the onset of weakness and therefore can lead to diagnostic difficulties. Diagnostic criteria for GBS are shown in the Table 1. Electromyography (EMG) can be helpful in confirming the diagnosis in clinically difficult cases such as in patients with extreme pain. EMG is especially useful for subclassifying GBS into subgroups such as acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) and acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP).

Background

Rabies virus is a highly neurotropic pathogen that affects the central nervous system (CNS), causing acute encephalitis. It's a single-stranded negative RNA virus belonging to the Rhabdoviridae family and the Lyssavirus genus. The virus is mainly transmitted by the saliva of wild animals that infect wounds, bites, or scratches. Common reservoirs include dogs, bats, raccoons, skunks, and foxes. Following viral inoculation, it travels through the peripheral nerves to replicate in the spinal ganglia, where the signs and symptoms begin. These include pain and paresthesias at the wound site, flu-like symptoms, fever, delirium, convulsions, hydrophobia, and paralysis. Rabies can present in two distinct forms: the furious (encephalitic) form which is the most common (80% of cases), characterized by fluctuating consciousness, inspiratory spasms, hydrophobia, and signs of autonomic dysfunction; and the paralytic form, which begins with ascending muscle weakness and preserves consciousness until the later stages of the disease. Without treatment, both forms inevitably lead to coma and death.

Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an acute autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system attacks the peripheral nerves. Demyelinating polyradiculoneuritis is the classic form of GBS, characterized by ascending paralysis, areflexia, and elevated CSF protein without pleocytosis. Paralytic rabies can mimic GBS due to its similar presentation, starting with weakness in the bitten extremity and progressing to quadriparesis and bifacial weakness.

The encephalitic stage of rabies frequently indicated by hydrophobia and anxiety. Fever, tachycardia, excessive salivation, delirium and other signs of autonomic instability become more apparent as the disease progress. As the encephalitis worsen, cranial nerve deficit may occur such as ophthalmoplegia, facial palsy and bulbar dysfunction. The presence of these signs raises the possibility of an infectious etiology rather than autoimmune processes.

Despite being a well-known clinical entity, paralytic rabies remains challenging to diagnose and requires a high index of suspicion, especially when it presents with atypical features, as seen in our case that closely resembled GBS.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome: a comprehensive review [^113rHNmd]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a potentially devastating yet treatable disorder. A classically postinfectious, immune-mediated, monophasic polyradiculoneuropathy, it is the leading global cause of acquired neuromuscular paralysis. In most cases, the immunopathological process driving nerve injury is ill-defined. Diagnosis of GBS relies on clinical features, supported by laboratory findings and electrophysiology. Although previously divided into primary demyelinating or axonal variants, this dichotomy is increasingly challenged, and is not endorsed by the recent European Academy of Neurology (EAN)/Peripheral Nerve Society (PNS) guidelines. Intravenous immunoglobulin and plasma exchange remain the primary modalities of treatment, regardless of the electrophysiological subtype. Most patients recover, but approximately one-third require mechanical ventilation, and 5% die. Disease activity and treatment response are currently monitored through interval neurological examination and outcome measures, and the potential role of fluid biomarkers is under ongoing scrutiny. Novel potential therapies for GBS are being explored but none have yet modified clinical practice. This review provides a comprehensive update on the pathological and clinical aspects of GBS for clinicians and scientists.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome [^1149MzHU]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome is the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis worldwide. Most patients present with an antecedent illness, most commonly upper respiratory tract infection, before the onset of progressive motor weakness. Several microorganisms have been associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome, most notably Campylobacter jejuni, Zika virus, and in 2020, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In C jejuni-related Guillain-Barré syndrome, there is good evidence to support an autoantibody-mediated immune process that is triggered by molecular mimicry between structural components of peripheral nerves and the microorganism. Making a diagnosis of so-called classical Guillain-Barré syndrome is straightforward; however, the existing diagnostic criteria have limitations and can result in some variants of the syndrome being missed. Most patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome do well with immunotherapy, but a substantial proportion are left with disability, and death can occur. Results from the International Guillain-Barré Syndrome Outcome Study suggest that geographical variations exist in Guillain-Barré syndrome, including insufficient access to immunotherapy in low-income countries. There is a need to provide improved access to treatment for all patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome, and to develop effective disease-modifying therapies that can limit the extent of nerve injury. Clinical trials are currently underway to investigate some of the potential therapeutic candidates, including complement inhibitors, which, together with emerging data from large international collaborative studies on the syndrome, will contribute substantially to understanding the many facets of this disease.

CONCLUSIONS

Guillain‐Barré syndrome is a postinfectious, immune‐mediated peripheral neuropathy. As our knowledge continues to expand, its pathophysiological mechanisms remain partially understood and many questions are yet to be answered. The focus of care should remain early diagnosis and treatment, to prevent severe axonal damage and minimise long‐term disability. Meanwhile, novel therapies and neuropathy fluid biomarkers are under ongoing evaluation and may improve clinical management in the foreseeable future.

### Ptosis as the initial presentation of Guillain-Barrésyndrome [^114uLDD2]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Guillain-Barré syndrome has been regarded as a spectrum of diseases with many variants.

Objective

To present a case in which, when the ocular muscles are affected in the beginning, it is very challenging to distinguish Guillain-Barré syndrome from myasthenia gravis.

Case Report

We describe a patient with Guillain-Barré syndrome who presented initially with isolated ptosis without ophthalmoplegia and subsequently developed descending paralysis. Due to the primary involvement of the lid levators, the patient was initially diagnosed as having a myasthenic crisis.

Conclusion

Although extremely rare, Guillain-Barré syndrome can present initially as isolated ptosis with subsequent descending paralysis.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome: history, pathogenesis, treatment, and future directions [^114e5goo]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) is one of the most striking neurological illnesses, capable of rendering a person completely paralyzed and ventilator‐dependent within a few days. Guillain, Barré, and Strohl recognized that the rapid onset of limb weakness with loss of tendon reflexes and a raised cerebrospinal fluid protein with a normal cell count constituted a discrete clinical syndrome. Subsequent clinical, neurophysiological, and pathological studies showed that the syndrome is heterogeneous. Increasingly refined pathological and immunological studies have investigated the pathogenesis of demyelinating and axonal subtypes. National and then international collaborations have accelerated progress in identifying triggering infections and defining and predicting the disease course. An international consensus group has agreed on management guidelines. Multicentre trials have identified effective treatments, and at last pharmaceutical companies are taking an interest. This review uses the history of research into GBS to propose avenues for future investigation.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome mimicking botulism in early disease course [^112E1gQt]. Practical Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

A 42-year-old man, returning to Europe after a 2-month stay in China, reported cough and runny nose. Five days later, he developed neck discomfort and rapidly evolving weakness, spreading from his arms to the facial, bulbar and neck muscles, and then the legs. He developed dysphagia and breathlessness, and was intubated in the emergency department. Cerebrospinal fluid showed mildly elevated protein. On day 2 he had fixed dilated pupils, with absent oculocephalic reflexes, and a flaccid upper limb paralysis. MR scans of the brain and spinal cord were normal. The early features of descending weakness, bulbar involvement and fixed dilated pupils made it difficult to distinguish between Guillain-Barré syndrome and botulism, and early investigations were inconclusive. We initially gave both botulinum antitoxin and intravenous immunoglobulin, but initially delayed plasma exchange as this would have removed the botulinum antitoxin. Diagnostic testing for botulism has low sensitivity, so we urge pre-emptive treatment if it is clinically suspected.

### Two unusual variants of Guillain-Barre syndrome [^1125PPYQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is a group of autoimmune diseases characterised by acute, acquired and immune-mediated polyneuroradiculopathy. A large number of clinical subtypes of GBS have been described over last 100 years since the first description of this syndrome. We report two such cases GBS variants — first, AMAN with brisk reflexes and second being acute motor axonal neuropathy with conduction block. Through this case report, we intend to make the treating physicians and neurologist aware of these rare variants so that such cases would be appropriately diagnosed and treated.

At a glance
- Guillain-Barré syndrome is a rare condition that causes nerve damage.
- Symptoms include muscle weakness, tingling, and sometimes paralysis. Campylobacterinfection is one of the most common causes of GBS in the United States. Overview Guillain-Barré syndrome happens when a person's immune system harms their nerves. This harm causes muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis. Symptoms Early symptoms of GBS include weakness and tingling. People with GBS usually first feel these symptoms in both legs. Then, they might feel these symptoms in their arms and upper body. Symptoms can progress over hours, days, or weeks. The weakness can increase until people cannot use some muscles. In severe cases, people can become paralyzed. Outlook People with GBS need to be hospitalized. Most people start to recover 2–3 weeks after symptoms start. Recovery may take as little as a few weeks or as long as a few years.

Most people recover fully, but some have permanent nerve damage. Some people have died from GBS. Campylobacterinfection.
- Some studies found as many as 8 in every 20 people with GBS had a recent Campylobacterinfection.
- Some studies found as many as 8 in every 20 people with GBS had a recent. Other causes Several other things can lead to GBS. These include: Diarrhea or a respiratory illness: About 2 in every 3 people had diarrhea or a respiratory illness before developing GBS. Viral infection: Some people with GBS had the flu or infection with cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus, Zika virus, or other viruses. Vaccination: Very rarely, people have developed GBS after getting certain vaccines. Keep in mind. Outbreaks GBS is not contagious and outbreaks of GBS are very rare. Most often, an outbreak of GBS is linked to another outbreak.

For example, a GBS outbreak can happen if more than one person involved in an outbreak of Campylobacter infections develops GBS. Learn about an outbreak of GBS that spanned an international border.

### Locked in from fulminant GBS after lumbar spine surgery [^111BUuMX]. Practical Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) describes a neurological syndrome characterised by acute, areflexic paralysis, often preceded by an immune stimulating event such as infection or surgery. Spinal surgery as an inciting event is very uncommon with few reported cases. When paraparesis develops in close proximity of surgery, surgical complications should be considered, but if an asymptomatic clinical interval precedes a progressive ascending weakness this association weakens and may support an immunological mechanism. GBS after lumbar surgery is wholly unexpected and thus there are significant challenges in recognising and making the diagnosis. We report a case of fulminant GBS that progressed to loss of all motor function following elective lumbar spine surgery.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome: pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis [^112n6aLp]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a potentially life-threatening postinfectious disease characterized by rapidly progressive, symmetrical weakness of the extremities. About 25% of patients develop respiratory insufficiency and many show signs of autonomic dysfunction. Diagnosis can usually be made on clinical grounds, but lumbar puncture and electrophysiological studies can help to substantiate the diagnosis and to differentiate demyelinating from axonal subtypes of GBS. Molecular mimicry of pathogen-borne antigens, leading to generation of crossreactive antibodies that also target gangliosides, is part of the pathogenesis of GBS; the subtype and severity of the syndrome are partly determined by the nature of the antecedent infection and specificity of such antibodies. Intravenous immunoglobulin and plasma exchange are proven effective treatments but many patients have considerable residual deficits. Discrimination of patients with treatment-related fluctuations from those with acute-onset chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy is important, as these conditions may require different treatments. Novel prognostic models can accurately predict outcome and the need for artificial ventilation, which could aid the selection of patients with a poor prognosis for more-individualized care. This Review summarizes the clinical features of and diagnostic criteria for GBS, and discusses its pathogenesis, treatment and prognosis.

### Diagnosis and management of Guillain-Barrésyndrome in ten steps [^111XFoXV]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Step 1: when to suspect GBS

Typical clinical features

GBS should be considered as a diagnosis in patients who have rapidly progressive bilateral weakness of the legs and/or arms, in the absence of CNS involvement or other obvious causes. Patients with the classic sensorimotor form of GBS present with distal paraesthesias or sensory loss, accompanied or followed by weakness that starts in the legs and progresses to the arms and cranial muscles. Reflexes are decreased or absent in most patients at presentation and in almost all patients at nadir. Dysautonomia is common and can include blood pressure or heart rate instability, pupillary dysfunction, and bowel or bladder dysfunction. Pain is frequently reported and can be muscular, radicular or neuropathic. Disease onset is acute or subacute, and patients typically reach maximum disability within 2 weeks. In patients who reach maximum disability within 24 h of disease onset or after 4 weeks, alternative diagnoses should be considered. GBS has a monophasic clinical course, although TRFs and relapses occur in a minority of patients.

Atypical clinical presentation

GBS can also present in an atypical manner. Weakness and sensory signs, though always bilateral, can be asymmetrical or predominantly proximal or distal, and can start in the legs, the arms or simultaneously in all limbs. Furthermore, severe and diffuse pain or isolated cranial nerve dysfunction can precede the onset of weakness. Young (< 6 years old) children in particular can present with nonspecific or atypical clinical features, such as poorly localized pain, refusal to bear weight, irritability, meningism, or an unsteady gait. Failure to recognize these signs as an early presentation of GBS might cause delay in diagnosis. In a minority of patients with atypical GBS, particularly those with only motor signs (pure motor variant) and an AMAN subtype on electrophysiological examination, normal or even exaggerated reflexes might be observed throughout the disease course.

### Clinical characteristics and ancillary test results among patients with botulism-United States, 2002–2015 [^117Mvdaz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Botulism is classically described as a bilateral, symmetric, descending flaccid paralysis in an afebrile and alert patient without sensory findings. We describe the reported spectrum of clinical findings among persons > 12 months of age in the United States during 2002–2015.

Methods

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collects clinical findings reported by physicians treating suspected cases of botulism nationwide. We analyzed symptoms and signs, and neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) results. A case was defined as illness compatible with botulism with laboratory confirmation or epidemiologic link to a confirmed case, and presence or absence of at least 1 sign or symptom recorded. Physicians' differential diagnoses were evaluated.

Results

Clinical information was evaluated for 332 botulism cases; data quality and completeness were variable. Most had no fever (99%), descending paralysis (93%), no mental status change (91%), at least 1 ocular weakness finding (84%), and neuroimaging without acute changes (82%). Some had paresthesias (17%), elevated CSF protein level (13%), and other features sometimes considered indicative of alternative diagnoses. Five of 71 (7%) cases with sufficient information were reported to have atypical findings (eg, at least 1 cranial nerve finding that was unilateral or ascending paralysis). Illnesses on the physician differential included Guillain-Barré syndrome (99 cases) and myasthenia gravis (76 cases) and, rarely, gastrointestinal-related illness (5 cases), multiple sclerosis (3 cases), sepsis (3 cases), and Lyme disease (2 cases).

Conclusions

Our analysis illustrates that classic symptoms and signs were common among patients with botulism but that features considered atypical were reported by some physicians. Diagnosis can be challenging, as illustrated by the broad range of illnesses on physician differentials.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome in a child with COVID-19 infection [^114zP8xf]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is characterized by a monophasic, ascending, and symmetrical paralysis with areflexia that progresses over days to weeks. It is typically a postinfectious autoimmune process that leads to destruction of myelin. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), originated in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 and rapidly spread around the world, causing a pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). There have been scattered reports of adults with possible GBS and concurrent evidence of COVID-19, but no previous reports in children. The patient is an 8-year-old boy who presented to the emergency department with progressive, ascending weakness with areflexia. He was intubated for airway protection because of poor secretion control. MRI of the spine revealed abnormal enhancement of posterior nerve roots. A lumbar puncture revealed albuminocytologic dissociation with 1 nucleated cell per mm³ and a protein level of 620 mg/dL. Electrodiagnostic findings were compatible with sensorimotor demyelinating polyneuropathy. The lumbar puncture, MRI, and electrodiagnostics were all consistent with GBS. Results of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification and SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G antibody tests were positive. Treatment was initiated with intravenous immunoglobulin; he received a total of 2 g/kg. His neurologic examination revealed improvement in the subsequent days. He was extubated after 4 days of intubation. This case is the first reported case of a child with GBS in the setting of an acute COVID-19 infection. This case reveals the wide scope of presentations of COVID-19 and postinfectious processes. Clinicians should constantly have a high level of suspicion for COVID-19.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome [^116pycXD]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome is the most common and most severe acute paralytic neuropathy, with about 100,000 people developing the disorder every year worldwide. Under the umbrella term of Guillain-Barré syndrome are several recognisable variants with distinct clinical and pathological features. The severe, generalised manifestation of Guillain-Barré syndrome with respiratory failure affects 20–30% of cases. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin or plasma exchange is the optimal management approach, alongside supportive care. Understanding of the infectious triggers and immunological and pathological mechanisms has advanced substantially in the past 10 years, and is guiding clinical trials investigating new treatments. Investigators of large, worldwide, collaborative studies of the spectrum of Guillain-Barré syndrome are accruing data for clinical and biological databases to inform the development of outcome predictors and disease biomarkers. Such studies are transforming the clinical and scientific landscape of acute autoimmune neuropathies.

### Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis: a spine consultation [^112CC5Wc]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

When evaluating a patient with acute extremity weakness, the spine surgeon's differential diagnoses should not only be limited to compressive spinal pathology but also include other etiologies, including inflammatory, neurodegenerative, and metabolic. Although spine surgeons may be confident in diagnosing some causes of weakness, mostly compressive in nature, they may not be comfortable with less commonly encountered conditions that may present without obvious compression on imaging. TPP is one such metabolic condition that presents with acute extremity weakness. Other conditions to be considered are myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and botulism.

Certain findings can help differentiate TPP from other conditions presenting with acute-onset weakness. In contrast to compressive causes of weakness, imaging studies in patients with TPP are normal. In TPP, proximal muscles are typically more severely affected than distal muscles. Mentation remains intact in patients with TPP, the respiratory muscles are spared, and the cranial nerves are not affected. Another important finding is that sensation is unaffected in TPP. Guillain-Barré syndrome is another cause of weakness that can be differentiated from TPP by its classic presentation of ascending paralysis and abnormal cerebrospinal fluid findings. Botulism is a toxin-mediated condition that presents as descending flaccid paralysis where the muscles of the head and neck are initially affected. In contrast to TPP, both Guillain-Barré syndrome and botulism can affect the respiratory system and lead to respiratory distress. Although neuromuscular disorders such as myasthenia gravis and Lambert-Eaton syndrome can present with extremity weakness, these are the result of an autoimmune reaction affecting the neuromuscular junction and do not typically present with electrolyte abnormalities. TPP is often misdiagnosed as familial hypokalemic periodic paralysis (FHPP) in Western countries because of similarities in precipitating factors and the clinical pattern of paralysis. However, TPP usually presents later in life with thyrotoxic symptoms and abnormal thyroid function tests. In contrast to FHPP, patients with TPP typically lack a family history of paralysis. In unclear cases, a urine calcium to phosphate ratio of > 1.7 is a sensitive and specific test for diagnosing TPP and differentiating it from FHPP.

Box 1 Diagnostic criteria for Guillain–Barré syndrome

This box lists the diagnostic criteria for Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) developed by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)and subsequently modified in a review paper. We have added some features that cast doubt on the diagnosis, which were not mentioned in the original criteria, and have made some adaptations to improve readability. These criteria are not applicable to some of the specific variants of GBS, as described in Table 1.

Features required for diagnosis

Relative symmetry of symptoms and signs
Relatively mild sensory symptoms and signs (absent in pure motor variant) a
Cranial nerve involvement, especially bilateral facial palsy a
Autonomic dysfunction
Muscular or radicular back or limb pain b
Increased protein level in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); normal protein levels do not rule out the diagnosis b
Electrodiagnostic features of motor or sensorimotor neuropathy (normal electrophysiology in the early stages does not rule out the diagnosis) b

Features that cast doubt on diagnosis
Increased numbers of mononuclear or polymorphonuclear cells in CSF (> 50 × 10⁶/l)
Marked, persistent asymmetry of weakness
Bladder or bowel dysfunction at onset or persistent during disease course b
Severe respiratory dysfunction with limited limb weakness at onset b

### Intravenous immunoglobulin and Guillain-Barrésyndrome [^117Lo7k8]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a relatively common, potentially lethal disease of a presumed autoimmune origin, known to cause a progressive flaccid paralysis. The treatment of GBS consists of both supportive and immunomodulatory treatments, among which intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasma exchange (PE) are considered most effective. A number of randomized, controlled studies have shown IVIg to be at least as effective as PE in the treatment of GBS, and in some cases superior. Moreover, IVIg has been found to be safer than PE, having a lower frequency of multiple complications. IVIg has also been found to be both effective and safe in the treatment of pediatric patients with GBS. Thus, its efficacy, safety, and availability make IVIg the treatment of choice in many patients with GBS.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome spectrum associated with COVID-19: an up-to-date systematic review of 73 cases [^114KLdCo]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has rapidly spread around the world from Jan-2020, with more than 14,000,000 cases confirmed so far. Although primary affecting the respiratory system, central and peripheral neurological manifestations associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection have been increasingly reported. In detail, several pieces of evidence suggested an association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of Guillain–Barré Syndrome (GBS).

GBS represents the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis. The classic form is an immune-mediated acute-onset demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy — AIDP) typically presenting with ascending weakness, loss of deep tendon reflexes, and sensory deficits. Diagnosis of GBS relies on the results of clinical, electrophysiological, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations (classically albuminocytological dissociation). The clinical spectrum of GBS encompasses a classic sensorimotor form, Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS), bilateral facial palsy with paraesthesia, pure motor, pure sensory, paraparetic, pharyngeal–cervical–brachial variants, polyneuritis cranialis (GBS–MFS overlap), and Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis. As regard electrophysiological features, three main subtypes are recognized: AIDP, acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN), and acute motor sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN). Peripheral nerve damage is thought to be provoked by an aberrant immune response to infections, in some cases driven by the production of autoreactive antibodies (anti-ganglioside antibodies). Potential triggering pathogens include both viruses [e.g. cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), influenza virus, hepatitis E virus, and Zika virus] and bacteria (e.g. Campylobacter Jejuni, Mycoplasma Pneumoniae). However, a relationship with other events has been also described (e.g. vaccinations, surgery, administration of checkpoint inhibitors, and malignancy). Given that a potential causal association with beta-coronaviruses [Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV)] has already been speculated, the relationship between COVID-19 and GBS deserves undoubtedly further attention.

With this background, our systematic review aimed to provide a comprehensive and updated overview of all case reports and series of COVID-19-related GBS to identify predominant clinical, laboratory, and neurophysiological patterns and to discuss the possible underlying pathophysiology.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome: a comprehensive review [^112FfGQf]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Guillain‐Barré syndrome (GBS) is a potentially devastating yet treatable disorder. A classically postinfectious, immune‐mediated, monophasic polyradiculoneuropathy, it is the leading global cause of acquired neuromuscular paralysis. In most cases, the immunopathological process driving nerve injury is ill‐defined. Diagnosis of GBS relies on clinical features, supported by laboratory findings and electrophysiology. Although previously divided into primary demyelinating or axonal variants, this dichotomy is increasingly challenged, and is not endorsed by the recent European Academy of Neurology (EAN)/Peripheral Nerve Society (PNS) guidelines. Intravenous immunoglobulin and plasma exchange remain the primary modalities of treatment, regardless of the electrophysiological subtype. Most patients recover, but approximately one‐third require mechanical ventilation, and 5% die. Disease activity and treatment response are currently monitored through interval neurological examination and outcome measures, and the potential role of fluid biomarkers is under ongoing scrutiny. Novel potential therapies for GBS are being explored but none have yet modified clinical practice. This review provides a comprehensive update on the pathological and clinical aspects of GBS for clinicians and scientists.

### Clinical guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of botulism, 2021 [^117MfEFg]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Results from electrodiagnostic studies might help with the diagnosis of suspected botulism in settings of conventional, contingency, and crisis standards of care, depending on the situation. During an outbreak, electrodiagnostic studies are rarely needed for a cluster of patients with a clear history of bilateral, symmetric cranial nerve palsies followed by descending paralysis. However, for patients for whom the diagnosis is not clear, electrodiagnostic studies might help distinguish botulism from other neuromuscular diseases (e.g. myasthenia gravis or Guillain - Barré syndrome). This is especially true for sporadic (single) cases, in which increasing the diagnostic certainty of botulism as early as possible in the course of illness helps guide clinicians in making the critical decision to treat with antitoxin for suspected botulism rather than plasmapheresis or immunoglobulin therapy for suspected Guillain - Barré syndrome. Because findings from electrodiagnostic studies might remain abnormal for weeks after illness onset, these studies might be useful in the later stages of illness, when botulinum toxin is unlikely to be detectable in the serum. Whereas the identification of multiple patients with cranial nerve palsies and descending flaccid paralysis is highly suggestive of an outbreak of botulism, the additional evidence from electrodiagnostic studies can provide support for clinical and public health management decisions. Electrodiagnostic studies were helpful in establishing the diagnosis of botulism in an outbreak with patients who demonstrated atypical features (CDC, unpublished data, 2015). For public health events that require contingency or crisis standards of care, the likelihood of being able to conduct electrodiagnostic studies decreases.

Recommendation

When feasible, consider using electrodiagnostic testing to assist in diagnosis of a suspected botulism case. When conducted and interpreted by experts, EMG, RNS, and NCSs can provide useful diagnostic data.

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in adults with Guillain-Barrésyndrome [^116PMeDN]. Neurocritical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute immune-mediated polyradiculoneuropathy that can affect all myelinated nerves. GBS is the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis, with an estimated one to two cases per 100,000 person-years. Incidence is higher in men and rises with age. Patients with GBS typically present with sensory symptoms and progressive limb weakness extending to arms and cranial nerves. The acute period is often characterized by rapid progression of symptoms over days, reaching their maximum within 2–4 weeks. However, the clinical presentation and course of GBS is highly variable, and distinct clinical variants exist. The diagnosis of GBS is mainly based on history and clinical features and is often supported by electrophysiological studies and cerebrospinal fluid examination. Electrophysiological studies provide evidence of peripheral nervous dysfunction and distinguish between demyelinating, motor axonal, and sensory axonal polyneuropathies. Intravenous immunoglobulin and plasmapheresis have proven to be effective treatments for GBS.

Mortality rates in GBS range between 1 and 13%. The most common causes of death in patients with GBS are respiratory and cardiovascular complications, and for patients requiring mechanical ventilation, mortality rates up to 20% have been observed. On the other hand, for the majority, GBS is a reversible disease with usually favorable prognosis. During the acute phase, approximately 10–30% of all patients with GBS require mechanical ventilation. Diaphragmatic weakness is the main reason for respiratory failure in neuromuscular patients, but respiratory failure may also be the result of pulmonary complications, such as aspiration and pneumonia, which may occur because of oropharyngeal muscle weakness or poor cough strength. Various predictors for respiratory failure have been described. The presence of several predictors increases the risk for needing mechanical ventilation, an observation that led to the development of prediction scores. After the acute phase, focus usually shifts to restoration of motor strength and function. Prognostication during the hospital course is essential; however, guidance is scarce. The objective of these guidelines is to provide recommendations on the reliability of select clinical predictors that serve as the basis of neuroprognostication and provide guidance to clinicians counseling adult patients with GBS or their surrogates.

Scope, Purpose, and Target Audience

The scope of these Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines is the prognostication of neurological outcome in adult patients with GBS. The purpose of these guidelines is to provide evidence-based recommendations on the reliability of predictors of neurological outcome in adult patients with GBS to aid clinicians in formulating a prognosis. The target audience consists of clinicians responsible for such counseling.

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in adults with Guillain-Barrésyndrome [^116ENUDF]. Neurocritical Care (2023). High credibility.

Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) epidemiology and acute course indicate that GBS is the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis, with an estimated one to two cases per 100,000 person‑years, and symptoms often reach maximum within 2–4 weeks. Mortality rates in GBS range between 1 and 13%, with mortality rates up to 20% observed for patients requiring mechanical ventilation; during the acute phase, approximately 10–30% of all patients with GBS require mechanical ventilation. Intravenous immunoglobulin and plasmapheresis have proven to be effective treatments for GBS.

### Differentiating familial neuropathies from Guillain-Barrésyndrome [^112aLDGE]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Differentiating Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) from inherited neuropathies and other acquired peripheral neuropathies requires understanding the atypical presentations of GBS and its variant forms, as well as historical and physical features suggestive of inherited neuropathies. GBS is typically characterized by the acute onset of ascending flaccid paralysis, areflexia, and dysesthesia secondary to peripheral nerve fiber demyelination. The disorder usually arises following a benign gastrointestinal or respiratory illness, is monophasic, reaches a nadir with several weeks, and responds to immunomodulatory therapy. Inherited neuropathies with onset before adulthood, whose presentation may mimic Guillain-Barré syndrome, are reviewed.

### History of acute polyradiculoneuropathy (part 2): from 1916 to 2019 [^111XZXPS]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

First reported by Guillain, Barré, and Strohl during the Great War, the concept of "Guillain-Barré syndrome" (GBS) progressively emerged as a clinical entity in its own right. Despite many debates about its clinical and pathophysiologic characteristics, GBS is now recognized as a disease throughout the world. We describe here the main steps of the rich history of GBS, from 1916 to the present.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome [^114Ja2TR]. Pediatrics in Review (2012). Low credibility.

- Based on strong research evidence, in countries where poliomyelitis has been eliminated, GBS is the most common cause of acquired paralysis in children. (9)
- Based on strong research evidence, GBS describes a spectrum of disorders caused by an autoimmune reaction against peripheral nerve components, including the myelin sheath and the axon. (10)(11)
- Based on strong research evidence, GBS usually is preceded by a bacterial or viral infection, less likely by vaccination in the 1 to 4 weeks before onset. The strongest relationship is with infection by C jejuni. (12)(13)
- Based on strong research evidence, GBS in children most often presents with symmetrical ascending paralysis, diminished or absent reflexes, and often severe pain. Pain may lead to a delay in diagnosis. (2) (3)(9)(14)
- Based on strong research evidence, the progressive phase peaks in 7 to 14 days and can lead to various levels of weakness, from abnormal gait to total paralysis, cranial nerve weakness, pain, respiratory compromise, and autonomic instability. (2)
- Based on some research evidence and consensus, children require hospitalization and often intensive care until their condition stabilizes because of significant risk of respiratory compromise and autonomic instability. (15)
- Based on strong research evidence in adults and some research evidence in children, IVIG and plasma exchange hasten recovery from GBS in patients with impaired ability to ambulate. (4)(6)
- Based primarily on consensus, IVIG is the treatment of choice in children with GBS. (6)(9)(15)
- Based on strong research evidence, the prognosis for full functional recovery in childhood GBS is excellent. (2)(8)(9).

### Guillain-barrésyndrome, greater paris area [^113qTy3a]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a state of acute flaccid paralysis thought, in most cases, to result from an aberrant immune response triggered by microbial infections. Studies in Western countries have reported evidence of recent infection with Campylobacter jejuni in 15% to 40% of GBS cases and with cytomegalovirus (CMV) in 5% to 20% of cases. Recent infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or Mycoplasma pneumoniae was less frequent (1%–2% each). No agent was identified in 60% to 70% of cases, although the patients often had a history of respiratory or gastrointestinal infection.

Previous studies have failed to identify any clear seasonal distribution of GBS cases in Europe and North America. It has been suggested that this failure to demonstrate seasonality in GBS is because most prevalent antecedent infections have inverse seasonal distributions. We tested this hypothesis to provide new insight into infectious agents associated with GBS in Western countries.

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in adults with Guillain-Barrésyndrome [^1134BNRt]. Neurocritical Care (2023). High credibility.

Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) predictor question — bulbar weakness and mechanical ventilation within 14 days: Outcome focuses on the Need for Mechanical Ventilation Within 14 days of Disease Onset. Question 1 asks whether bulbar weakness assessed on presentation or early in admission is a reliable predictor of the need for mechanical ventilation within 14 days of disease onset. Bulbar weakness refers to bilateral impairment of function of the lower cranial nerves (i.e. IX, X, XI, and XII), occurring in GBS because of polyneuropathy affecting these nerves outside the brainstem; examination is conducted on admission and subsequently.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome… [^112kuqW5]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

CHRISTOPHER G. GOETZMD In 1859, Landry1 described the clinical features of acute ascending weakness without amyotrophy. Other 19th-century clinical descriptions followed, but the full extent of the motor polyradiculoneuritis and the characteristic albuminocytologic dissociation in the cerebrospinal fluid was only described in 1916 by Guillain, Barré, and Strohl. 2 Guillain, who eventually held Charcot's Professorial Chair at the Salpiêtrière in Paris, France, encountered the syndrome in soldiers while he was chief staff physician for the Sixth Army Neurological Center at the North front in France. Over the subsequent 20 years, more than 30 such cases were documented in the international medical literature to which Guillain3 himself added 10 cases in his follow-up article of 1936. The condition became known internationally under the rubric Guillain-Barré syndrome.

Although the condition was originally suspected to be infectious in nature, the distinctive pathological features led to hypotheses of immunological origin. This article cites seminal views on the syndrome and traces historical developments up to the time of Guillain's death in 1961. Bonduelle M. Guillain-Barré Syndrome. Arch Neurol. 1998; 55: 1483–1484.
