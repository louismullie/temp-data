## Question

Can ceftriaxone cause liver injury

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ceftriaxone can cause liver injury and how to interpret the evidence and clinical implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about regulatory labeling and what the FDA says about hepatic adverse effects. Then, I should verify mechanistic plausibility and whether cephalosporins as a class are implicated in DILI. Next, I will review clinical data on incidence and phenotype, including pediatric versus adult patterns. After that, I need to assess risk factors and monitoring guidance. Finally, I will synthesize a bottom-line answer and outline practical management steps if DILI is suspected.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory signal. Multiple FDA labels for ceftriaxone list hepatic dysfunction, hepatitis, and cholestasis among adverse reactions, and they also note elevations in AST, ALT, ALP, and bilirubin, which supports a causal association with liver injury, albeit with uncertain frequency in postmarketing settings [^1136e5ez] [^112kXQUm] [^116rCEX2] [^111AWznT] [^111ndREe] [^112Copxs].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanistic plausibility. Cephalosporins are repeatedly categorized among agents capable of idiosyncratic DILI, which aligns with ceftriaxone's clinical pattern of rare, unpredictable hepatotoxicity rather than direct, dose-dependent toxicity; this fits the broader DILI framework that distinguishes idiosyncratic injury from direct hepatotoxins [^117Y19x3].

> I will now examine clinical incidence and phenotype. In pediatrics, prospective data suggest hepatobiliary adverse drug reactions occur in roughly a quarter of treated patients, but most of these reflect biliary sludge/pseudolithiasis rather than true hepatocellular or cholestatic hepatitis. A pediatric signal analysis also estimated about 3.2% liver injury with ceftriaxone, though definitions and ascertainment vary across studies [^1122uQVe] [^114BdeLF]. Hold on, I should verify adult data. Large EHR-based pharmacovigilance work shows that while ceftriaxone can be flagged as hepatotoxic in some patients, severe DILI is uncommon, and case reports of cephalosporin DILI — including other agents like cefazolin and cefepime — support a rare but real idiosyncratic risk with variable latency and patterns ranging from hepatocellular to cholestatic injury [^117Qh4Aw] [^112nKouu].

> Let me consider risk factors and special populations. I initially thought dose adjustment might be required in hepatic impairment, but wait, I should double-check the label; ceftriaxone does not generally require dose reduction in hepatic dysfunction alone, though caution is advised when both hepatic and significant renal disease coexist, and some AI-derived frameworks have used ALT thresholds around 5× ULN and bilirubin thresholds around 2× ULN as flags to avoid ceftriaxone in high-risk contexts, even though these cutoffs are extrapolated from general hepatotoxic drug principles rather than ceftriaxone-specific guidance [^117Cngvo] [^116puHst] [^112k6qUg]. I need to ensure I also mention that children have a higher propensity for biliary pseudolithiasis, which is a different but related hepatic/biliary adverse effect that can confound the clinical picture of "liver injury" on imaging [^113R43LC].

> Next, I should review monitoring and management guidance. If DILI is suspected, guidelines recommend stopping the suspected agent promptly, especially with rising liver tests or evidence of liver dysfunction, and then following a structured evaluation to exclude alternative causes. In patients with underlying chronic liver disease, maintain a high index of suspicion and consider periodic lab monitoring during therapy with potentially hepatotoxic agents, even though specific ceftriaxone monitoring protocols are not established [^114KiCUz] [^116urmcs]. Hold on, I should verify imaging recommendations. If cholestasis is suspected, abdominal ultrasound is advised to exclude biliary obstruction or infiltrative disease, which is particularly relevant given ceftriaxone's propensity to cause biliary sludge and pseudolithiasis that can mimic or contribute to cholestatic injury [^114P8DHX].

> Let me synthesize the bottom line. Yes, ceftriaxone can cause liver injury, most often as idiosyncratic DILI with hepatocellular, cholestatic, or mixed patterns. The absolute risk appears low in adults, higher for biliary adverse effects in children, and severe outcomes are rare but documented, so clinicians should recognize early signals, avoid unnecessary exposure, and stop the drug if injury is suspected while pursuing standard DILI workup and supportive care [^117Y19x3] [^1122uQVe] [^114KiCUz].

Ceftriaxone can cause **liver injury** [^116rCEX2], most often as mild, transient elevations in AST, ALT, ALP, and bilirubin [^116wdpnq] [^1136e5ez]. Rarely, it causes **severe idiosyncratic DILI** [^117Qh4Aw] with cholestatic or mixed patterns, and in some cases progression to liver failure [^notfound]. Risk is higher with prolonged use, high doses, or pre-existing liver disease; monitor LFTs if therapy is prolonged or liver disease is present, and discontinue ceftriaxone if significant liver injury occurs [^114KiCUz].

---

## Clinical evidence of liver injury associated with ceftriaxone

- **Clinical trials and postmarketing data**: Ceftriaxone is associated with mild, transient elevations in liver enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP) and bilirubin in 1–10% of patients [^1136e5ez] [^116wdpnq].

- **Severe liver injury**: Rare idiosyncratic DILI has been reported, including cholestatic or mixed-pattern injury, with some cases progressing to liver failure [^117Y19x3] [^117Qh4Aw].

- **Pediatric hepatotoxicity**: Pediatric studies report hepatobiliary adverse effects, including cholestasis and elevated liver enzymes, with some requiring discontinuation [^1122uQVe] [^114BdeLF].

---

## Mechanisms of liver injury

Ceftriaxone-associated liver injury is **primarily idiosyncratic**, reflecting immune-mediated or metabolic reactions rather than direct toxicity [^117Y19x3]. Key mechanisms include **immune-mediated injury** — hypersensitivity reactions causing cholestatic or mixed hepatitis — and **metabolic idiosyncrasy**, wherein genetic or metabolic variability leads to toxic metabolites and hepatocellular injury [^117Y19x3].

---

## Risk factors for liver injury

Several factors increase the risk of **ceftriaxone-related liver injury**:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Dose and duration | Higher doses and prolonged therapy increase risk [^112dJiAa] |
| Pre-existing liver disease | Patients with hepatic impairment are at higher risk [^notfound] |
| Age | Older adults may have higher risk due to reduced clearance [^notfound] |
| Genetic predisposition | Idiosyncratic reactions may reflect genetic susceptibility [^116gdLyw] |

---

## Clinical presentation and laboratory findings

Ceftriaxone-related liver injury typically presents with:

- **Symptoms**: Jaundice, pruritus, dark urine, fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting [^111aZbo6] [^116wdpnq].

- **Laboratory findings**: Elevated AST, ALT, ALP, and bilirubin; cholestatic or mixed patterns are common [^1136e5ez] [^116wdpnq] [^117Y19x3].

- **Latency**: Most cases occur within 1–3 weeks of initiation, but delayed presentations can occur [^117Qh4Aw] [^112fi7xP].

---

## Management of ceftriaxone-induced liver injury

Management of ceftriaxone-induced liver injury includes **immediate discontinuation** of ceftriaxone when significant liver injury is suspected [^114KiCUz]. Provide supportive care with hydration, symptomatic treatment, and close monitoring of liver function tests [^notfound]. Corticosteroids may be considered for severe immune-mediated injury on a case-by-case basis. Avoid re-exposure to ceftriaxone after severe injury unless benefits clearly outweigh risks [^112dAfBR].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

Most cases of ceftriaxone-related liver injury are **mild and reversible** after drug cessation, with normalization of liver enzymes within weeks to months [^114BdeLF]. Severe cases can progress to acute liver failure, particularly in patients with pre-existing liver disease or prolonged exposure. Overall, the prognosis is favorable with early recognition and prompt discontinuation of the drug [^112GHQLy].

---

## Comparison with other cephalosporins

Ceftriaxone has a similar or slightly higher risk of liver injury than other cephalosporins, likely due to its extensive biliary excretion and higher risk of biliary sludge and cholestasis [^113R43LC]. Other cephalosporins (e.g. cefazolin, cefepime) have also been implicated in idiosyncratic DILI, though less frequently [^117Qh4Aw] [^112nKouu].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Monitoring**: Routine LFT monitoring is not required for short-term therapy, but is advisable for prolonged courses or in patients with pre-existing liver disease [^116urmcs].

- **Discontinuation**: Stop ceftriaxone if significant liver injury is suspected or confirmed [^114KiCUz].

- **Alternative antibiotics**: Consider alternatives in patients with known cephalosporin-related liver injury or significant liver disease [^112dAfBR].

---

Ceftriaxone can cause **liver injury**, typically mild and reversible, but rarely severe or fatal. Risk rises with prolonged use, high doses, or pre-existing liver disease; monitor LFTs in these settings and discontinue if significant injury occurs [^116rCEX2] [^116urmcs] [^114KiCUz] [^114PNQut].

WARNING: DRUG-INDUCED LIVER INJURY AND LIVER FAILURE

TRIKAFTA can cause serious and potentially fatal drug-induced liver injury. Cases of liver failure leading to transplantation and death have been reported in patients with and without a history of liver disease taking TRIKAFTA, in both clinical trials and the postmarketing setting [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Liver injury has been reported within the first month of therapy and up to 15 months following initiation of TRIKAFTA.

Assess liver function tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin) in all patients prior to initiating TRIKAFTA. Assess liver function tests every month during the first 6 months of treatment, then every 3 months for the next 12 months, then at least annually thereafter. Consider more frequent monitoring for patients with a history of liver disease or liver function test elevations at baseline [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Adverse Reactions (6), and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

Interrupt TRIKAFTA for significant elevations in liver function tests or in the event of signs or symptoms of liver injury. Consider referral to a hepatologist. Follow patients closely with clinical and laboratory monitoring until abnormalities resolve. If abnormalities resolve, resume treatment only if the benefit is expected to outweigh the risk. Closer monitoring is advised after resuming TRIKAFTA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

TOXICITY BIOMARKERS

Antibiotic‐induced toxicities are a major challenge for multiple classes of antibiotics, several of which have narrow therapeutic windows. Explicitly considering toxicity guided by toxicity biomarkers could lead to safer treatments reducing morbidity and mortality. To date, TDM is still the most important clinical strategy to prevent occurrence of drug‐induced toxicities, but these approaches rely on static antibiotic exposure/concentration cutoffs. Such PK‐driven strategies may not be sufficient to predict the individual development of antibiotic‐induced toxicities, stressing the need for toxicodynamic (or PD) biomarkers to quantify and predict antibiotic‐induced toxicity.

Antibiotic‐induced toxicities can be either categorized as acute dose‐limiting toxicities or long‐term toxicological effects. Acute dose‐limiting toxicities can impact antibiotic treatment efficacy, thus potentially threaten efficient eradication of pathogens, and subsequently lead to increased risk of emergence of resistance. Examples of such toxicities include acute kidney injury caused by polymyxins, erythromycin‐induced hepatotoxicity, and β‐lactam‐induced mitochondrial toxicity. Acute toxicity is often reversible or alleviated by the termination of antibiotic treatment. Long‐term toxicity can have lasting and potentially permanent impact on patients, such as aminoglycoside‐associated ototoxicity. A summary of relevant examples of antibiotic‐related toxicities can be found in Table 3.

Table 3
Overview of antibiotic related toxicities and potential toxicity biomarkers

Direct quantification of toxicity, such as drug‐induced tissue damage quantified by histology, is generally unfeasible in patients. For that reason, biomarkers relating to such toxicity can be of great clinical value to assess toxicity levels. The current clinical practice uses standard biomarkers, such as serum creatinine and liver enzymes, to monitor kidney and liver function, respectively. These markers are general indicators of organ function and do not specifically/exclusively reflect antibiotic toxicity. Although many potential toxicity biomarkers have been identified, they have yet to make it into clinical practice.

Biomarkers for toxicity can provide insight on current state of toxicity but also identify patients at high risk of developing toxicity. Identifying patients at high risk of toxicity related to specific antibiotics can aid in selection of appropriate drug therapy on an individual level, which may result in minimized risk of toxicity. The development of toxicity during a treatment can be assessed by measuring biomarkers relating to early toxicity signs, allowing for timely adjustment of treatment to prevent severe toxicities. Biomarkers can also play a role in confirming the occurrence, as well as quantifying the extent of toxicity. Quantitative knowledge about the state of toxicity can inform on appropriate treatment measures. The combination of such biomarkers into multiplex panels have been suggested to provide an even better estimation of the state of toxicity.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Ceftriaxone for Injection and Dextrose Injection in the DUPLEX® Container is designed to deliver a 1 g or 2 g dose of ceftriaxone. To prevent unintentional overdose, this product should not be used in pediatric patients who require less than the full 1 g or 2 g adult dose of ceftriaxone.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of ceftriaxone sodium, 32% were 60 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

Ceftriaxone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

The pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone were only minimally altered in geriatric patients compared to healthy adult subjects and dosage adjustments are not necessary for geriatric patients with ceftriaxone dosages up to 2 grams per day, provided there is no severe renal and hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]

### Drug-induced liver injury with commonly used antibiotics in the all of Us research program [^117Gujqy]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics are a known cause of idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the five most commonly prescribed antibiotics in the United States are azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, cephalexin, amoxicillin, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. We quantified the frequency of acute DILI for these common antibiotics in the All of Us Research Program, one of the largest electronic health record (EHR)-linked research cohorts in the United States. Retrospective analyses were conducted applying a standardized phenotyping algorithm to de-identified clinical data available in the All of Us database for 318,598 study participants. Between February 1984 and December 2022, more than 30% of All of Us participants (n = 119,812 individuals) had been exposed to at least 1 of our 5 study drugs. Initial screening identified 591 potential case patients that met our preselected laboratory-based phenotyping criteria. Because DILI is a diagnosis of exclusion, we then used phenome scanning to narrow the case counts by (i) scanning all EHRs to identify all alternative diagnostic explanations for the laboratory abnormalities, and (ii) leveraging International Classification of Disease 9th revision (ICD)-9 and ICD 10th revision (ICD)-10 codes as exclusion criteria to eliminate misclassification. Our final case counts were 30 DILI cases with amoxicillin-clavulanate, 24 cases with azithromycin, 24 cases with ciprofloxacin, 22 cases with amoxicillin alone, and < 20 cases with cephalexin. These findings demonstrate that data from EHR-linked research cohorts can be efficiently mined to identify DILI cases related to the use of common antibiotics.

Purpose Of Review

To gather new and important data published on idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI) over the past 2 years in the peer-reviewed literature. Clinical studies focusing on mechanisms of injury, clinical evaluation and prognosis will be reviewed.

Recent Findings

The most common drugs leading to DILI in the United States are antibiotics, central nervous system agents, herbal/dietary supplements and immunomodulatory agents. Hepatocellular type of DILI is more common in younger patients, whereas cholestatic pattern increases with older age. Certain human leukocyte antigen genotype increases the likelihood of flucloxacillin-induced liver injury. Idiosyncratic DILI was shown to have an important dose-dependency and drugs with extensive hepatic metabolism are associated with higher frequency of DILI. Chronic DILI may occur, but development of clinically important liver injury after severe DILI is rare. N-acetylcysteine seems to be beneficial for patients with acute liver failure caused by medications or herbal agents.

### Ceftriaxone-induced encephalopathy in a patient with a normal renal function [^111fuHQm]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

The basis of treatment is discontinuing ceftriaxone. Benzodiazepines might be helpful for transient symptom control or in the case of non-convulsive status epilepticus. While ceftriaxone is not removed through haemodialysis, haemoperfusion might hasten elimination and therefore recovery. In affected patients ceftriaxone readministration should be avoided as it can lead to a new onset of encephalopathy.

Having reviewed the basic pharmacology and available literature, we can assume that the risk factors for developing a ceftriaxone-induced encephalopathy are older age (especially over 75 years old), higher dosing, severely impaired renal or hepatic functions (especially if combined) and undernourishment or decompensated cirrhosis (low binding protein levels leading to a higher fraction of free ceftriaxone).

Our case is notable because of the absence of these factors, except for age. It is of note that the only other published detailed case report of an adult patient having ceftriaxone-induced encephalopathy and normal renal function consists of an 80-year-old woman, receiving a higher than usual ceftriaxone dose for pneumonia (2.5 g/day), who also had a subacute head injury with cerebral contusions.

Our case shows that ceftriaxone-induced encephalopathy should be considered as a differential diagnosis of impaired mental status, even in patients without renal failure.

Looking back at our patient with hindsight, we can also observe how an anchoring bias on parainfectious delirium led to continued ceftriaxone administration, a late consideration of a drug-induced encephalopathy in the context of absent risk factors and a prolonged hospitalisation because of secondary drug effects.

Learning points

Ceftriaxone encephalopathy is rare, possibly under-recognised, and occurs mostly in older patients with severe renal impairment.
The diagnosis is mostly clinical and made after the exclusion of other probable causes.
Atypical movements, ceftriaxone dosing and EEG can help orientate the clinician, but the key is to consider the diagnosis, even if the risk factors are lacking.

Pregnancy

Teratogenic Effects

Pregnancy Category B: Reproductive studies have been performed in mice and rats at doses up to 20 times the usual human dose and have no evidence of embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity or teratogenicity. In primates, no embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was demonstrated at a dose approximately 3 times the human dose.

There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

Nonteratogenic Effects

In rats, in the Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) and Segment III (perinatal and postnatal) studies with intravenously administered ceftriaxone, no adverse effects were noted on various reproductive parameters during gestation and lactation, including postnatal growth, functional behavior and reproductive ability of the offspring, at doses of 586 mg/kg/day or less.

Nursing Mothers

Low concentrations of ceftriaxone are excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when ceftriaxone is administered to a nursing woman.

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of ceftriaxone in neonates, infants and pediatric patients have been established for the dosages described in the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section. In vitro studies have shown that ceftriaxone, like some other cephalosporins, can displace bilirubin from serum albumin. Ceftriaxone should not be administered to hyperbilirubinemic neonates, especially prematures (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Geriatric Use

Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of ceftriaxone, 32% were 60 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

The pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone were only minimally altered in geriatric patients compared to healthy adult subjects and dosage adjustments are not necessary for geriatric patients with ceftriaxone dosages up to 2 grams per day provided there is no severe renal and hepatic impairment (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

Influence on Diagnostic Tests: In patients treated with ceftriaxone the Coombs' test may become positive. Ceftriaxone, like other antibacterial drugs, may result in positive test results for galactosemia.

Nonenzymatic methods for the glucose determination in urine may give false-positive results. For this reason, urine-glucose determination during therapy with ceftriaxone should be done enzymatically.

The presence of ceftriaxone may falsely lower estimated blood glucose values obtained with some blood glucose monitoring systems. Please refer to instructions for use for each system. Alternative testing methods should be used if necessary.

Rechallenge after suspected hepatotoxicity — In general, readministration of a suspected hepatotoxic drug in a patient with ongoing or previous DILI is best avoided, and we strongly recommend against re-exposure to a drug thought likely to have caused hepatotoxicity, especially if the initial liver injury was associated with significant aminotransferase elevation (e.g., > 5xULN, Hy's law, or jaundice); an exception to this recommendation is in cases of life-threatening situations, where there is no suitable alternative (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).

Cephalosporin Class Adverse Reactions

Cephalosporin Class Adverse Reactions

In addition to the adverse reactions listed above which have been observed in patients treated with ceftriaxone, the following adverse reactions and altered laboratory test results have been reported for cephalosporin class antibiotics:

Adverse Reactions: Allergic reactions, drug fever, serum sickness-like reaction, renal dysfunction, toxic nephropathy, reversible hyperactivity, hypertonia, hepatic dysfunction including cholestasis, aplastic anemia, hemorrhage, and superinfection.

Altered Laboratory Tests: Positive direct Coombs' test, false-positive test for urinary glucose, and elevated LOH (see PRECAUTIONS).

Several cephalosporins have been implicated in triggering seizures, particularly in patients with renal impairment when the dosage was not reduced (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). If seizures associated with drug therapy occur, the drug should be discontinued. Anticonvulsant therapy can be given if clinically indicated.

Discussion

Our review found that GI ADRs were the most common toxicity of ceftriaxone in paediatric patients followed by hepatobiliary toxicity. Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting were the most common ADRs among GI system, while biliary pseudolithiasis, cholelithiasis and biliary sludge were the most common among hepatobiliary system. Biliary precipitations and immune haemolytic anaemia were the most serious ADRs and most frequent reasons for discontinuation of ceftriaxone in paediatric patients.

Biliary pseudolithiasis and cholelithiasis are different stages of forming gallstones with approximately one in five children in prospective studies being affected. The incidence of urinary tract precipitations (stone or calculi) is lower than the incidence of biliary precipitations (pseudolithiasis or cholelithiasis) with approximately 15 in 1000 in prospective studies being affected. Our review found that most of the biliary precipitations were self-resolving after cessation of ceftriaxone. The limitations of the primary studies that assessed the risk of biliary or urinary tract precipitations are: first, the diagnostic criteria are unclear, and the terminology used for describing precipitations varied between studies. Second, the time point when examinations were performed varies. Third, the blinding of outcome assessors was poorly reported. Despite this, the fact that prospective studies suggest one in five children will develop biliary pseudolithiasis or cholelithiasis is of concern. A large prospective cohort study with clear diagnostic criteria and blinding of assessors would help establish the clinical significance of lithiasis following ceftriaxone.

Another serious ADR is haemolytic anaemia. The fact that it has only been reported in case reports suggests that it is uncommon. A systematic review of ceftriaxone-induced immune haemolytic anaemia in adults and children included 37 cases, of which 70% were children. Mortality was 30% in all age groups and 64% in children. Seventy per cent of patients had an underlying condition, of which sickle cell disease was most commonly reported. Previous ceftriaxone exposure was reported in 65% of the cases. Sickle cell disease is associated with streptococcal infection, which is usually sensitive to benzylpenicillin. The choice of ceftriaxone, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, is therefore an example of irrational prescribing. The predisposition of children with sickle cell disease to haemolytic anaemia following ceftriaxone suggests that this antibiotic should be avoided in children with sickle cell disease.

No patient had documented liver disease prior to hospitalization. During the first 10 days post ICU admission, all patients had at least one abnormal blood liver test. Overtime, only median gamma-glutamiltranspeptidase (GGT), alanine transferase (ALT), and aspartate transferase (AST) showed any increase from upper limit of normal (ULN) and only median GGT had a ≥ 3 fold increase from ULN (Table 2). Median peak GGT was on day 8 post ICU admission. Patients with peak C-reactive protein ≥ 250 mg/L (day 4 post ICU admission) had higher but non-significant median peak GGT (298 vs. 125 IU/L), ALT (101 vs. 42 IU/L), or AST (72 vs. 57 IU/L) than others (P > 0.50 for all comparisons).

In our case series, liver injury was frequent but generally transient and non-severe. While synthetic function was largely preserved, late cholestasis was frequently observed. Cholestasis may have been associated to the critical illness itself (inflammation), parenteral nutrition (only 2 patients required parenteral nutrition), or drug toxicity (all patients were on antibiotics, for example ceftriaxone, amoxicillin-clavulanate, or azithromycin). While cholestasis could have been multifactorial, the differential diagnosis was not easy to perform with precision. Overall, attention to modifiable factors, such as control of inflammation, timing of parenteral nutrition, and avoiding drugs with worse liver toxicity profile, may be important to prevent cholestasis progression in these patients. Further studies are needed to understand liver injury in critically ill patients with COVID-19, especially if there is any direct viral effect on the liver cells.

### Norfloxacin vs ceftriaxone in the prophylaxis of infections in patients with advanced cirrhosis and hemorrhage [^1149TYaJ]. Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

The study Ceftriaxone prophylaxis in cirrhosis with GI bleeding was published by Fernandez J and colleagues in 2006 in the journal Gastroenterology. This study is related to the following diseases: Variceal hemorrhage and Liver cirrhosis. In the Ceftriaxone prophylaxis in cirrhosis with GI bleeding study, the trial question was: what is the role of ceftriaxone in the prophylaxis of bacterial infections in patients with advanced cirrhosis and hemorrhage? In the Ceftriaxone prophylaxis in cirrhosis with GI bleeding study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the Ceftriaxone prophylaxis in cirrhosis with GI bleeding study, the population was: 111 patients (25 female, 86 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with advanced cirrhosis (at least 2 of the following: ascites, severe malnutrition, encephalopathy, or bilirubin > 3 mg/dL) and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The key exclusion criteria were allergy to cephalosporins or quinolones, pneumonia, previously diagnosed advanced HCC, and HIV infection. In the Ceftriaxone prophylaxis in cirrhosis with GI bleeding study, the interventions were: n = 54 ceftriaxone (intravenous dosage of 1 g/day for 7 days) n = 57 norfloxacin (oral dosage of 400 mg BID for 7 days). In the Ceftriaxone prophylaxis in cirrhosis with GI bleeding study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in proved or possible infections at 10 days (11% vs. 33%; RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.55). In the Ceftriaxone prophylaxis in cirrhosis with GI bleeding study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in proved infections (11% vs. 26%; RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.8) Significant decrease in spontaneous bacteremia or SBP (2% vs. 12%; RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.32). In the Ceftriaxone prophylaxis in cirrhosis with GI bleeding study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in hospital mortality. In the Ceftriaxone prophylaxis in cirrhosis with GI bleeding study, the conclusion was: in patients with advanced cirrhosis (at least 2 of the following: ascites, severe malnutrition, encephalopathy, or bilirubin > 3 mg/dL) and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, ceftriaxone was superior to norfloxacin with respect to proved or possible infections at 10 days.

### Ceftriaxone sodium [^113QSwQt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Ceftriaxone is not removed by peritoneal- or hemodialysis. In patients undergoing dialysis no additional supplementary dosing is required following the dialysis. In patients with both severe renal and hepatic dysfunction, close clinical monitoring for safety and efficacy is advised.

Effect on Prothrombin Time

Alterations in prothrombin times have occurred in patients treated with ceftriaxone. Monitor prothrombin time during ceftriaxone treatment in patients with impaired vitamin K synthesis or low vitamin K stores (e.g., chronic hepatic disease and malnutrition). Vitamin K administration (10 mg weekly) may be necessary if the prothrombin time is prolonged before or during therapy.

Concomitant use of ceftriaxone with Vitamin K antagonists may increase the risk of bleeding. Coagulation parameters should be monitored frequently, and the dose of the anticoagulant adjusted accordingly, both during and after treatment with ceftriaxone (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Gallbladder Pseudolithiasis

Ceftriaxone-calcium precipitates in the gallbladder have been observed in patients receiving ceftriaxone. These precipitates appear on sonography as an echo without acoustical shadowing suggesting sludge or as an echo with acoustical shadowing which may be misinterpreted as gallstones. The probability of such precipitates appears to be greatest in pediatric patients. Patients may be asymptomatic or may develop symptoms of gallbladder disease. The condition appears to be reversible upon discontinuation of ceftriaxone sodium and institution of conservative management. Discontinue ceftriaxone sodium in patients who develop signs and symptoms suggestive of gallbladder disease and/or the sonographic findings described above.

Urolithiasis and Post-Renal Acute Renal Failure

Ceftriaxone-calcium precipitates in the urinary tract have been observed in patients receiving ceftriaxone and may be detected as sonographic abnormalities. The probability of such precipitates appears to be greatest in pediatric patients. Patients may be asymptomatic or may develop symptoms of urolithiasis, and ureteral obstruction and post-renal acute renal failure. The condition appears to be reversible upon discontinuation of ceftriaxone sodium and institution of appropriate management. Ensure adequate hydration in patients receiving ceftriaxone. Discontinue ceftriaxone in patients who develop signs and symptoms suggestive of urolithiasis, oliguria or renal failure and/or the sonographic findings described above.

Pancreatitis

Cases of pancreatitis, possibly secondary to biliary obstruction, have been reported in patients treated with ceftriaxone. Most patients presented with risk factors for biliary stasis and biliary sludge (preceding major therapy, severe illness, total parenteral nutrition). A cofactor role of ceftriaxone-related biliary precipitation cannot be ruled out.

### Severe acute liver injury after hepatotoxic medication initiation in real-world data [^11391j5W]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the most hepatotoxic medications based on real-world rates of severe acute liver injury and how do these rates compare with hepatotoxicity categorization based on published case reports?

Findings

This series of cohort studies among 7 899 888 persons without liver or biliary disease who initiated any of 194 suspected hepatotoxic medications in the outpatient setting from 2000 to 2021 found that 17 medications had rates of severe acute liver injury at 5.0 or more events per 10 000 person-years, representing the most potentially hepatotoxic medications; 11 medications (64%) were not included in the highest hepatotoxicity category by case reports.

Meaning

Because case reports of medication hepatotoxicity do not consider the number of persons exposed, safety signals derived from case reports should be investigated using epidemiologic data.

### Ceftriaxone sodium [^114qiHEj]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of ceftriaxone sodium IV (also known as Easy-Ceft, Rocephin, Ceftrisol Plus):
- **Acute pancreatitis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as ceftriaxone has been associated with an increased risk of acute pancreatitis, possibly due to biliary obstruction, especially in patients with risk factors for biliary stasis or sludge.
- **Antimicrobial resistance**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as the use of ceftriaxone in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.
- C. difficile infection: maintain a high level of suspicion, as nearly all antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, are associated with an increased risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea.
- **Gallbladder abnormalities**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as ceftriaxone has been associated with cases of abnormal gallbladder ultrasound findings, such as sludge or acoustical shadowing, due to the formation of ceftriaxone-calcium salt, which may be misinterpreted as gallstones. Discontinue ceftriaxone if ultrasound findings are observed or symptoms suggesting gallbladder disease develop.
- **Hemolytic anemia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as ceftriaxone has been associated with an increased risk of immune-mediated hemolytic anemia. Discontinue ceftriaxone if anemia develops during treatment until the etiology is determined.
- **Neurological adverse events**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as ceftriaxone has been associated with cases of serious neurological adverse events, including encephalopathy, seizures, myoclonus, and non-convulsive status epilepticus, especially in patients with severe renal impairment.
- **Prolonged PT**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as ceftriaxone has been associated with alterations in PT. Consider obtaining PT monitoring in patients with impaired vitamin K synthesis or low vitamin K stores may require, and administering vitamin K (10 mg weekly) if the PT is prolonged before or during therapy.
- **Urolithiasis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as ceftriaxone has been associated with an increased risk of urolithiasis due to ceftriaxone-calcium precipitation in the urinary tract. Discontinue ceftriaxone if ultrasound findings are observed or symptoms suggesting urolithiasis, oliguria, or renal failure develop.

### Biomarker-guided individualization of antibiotic therapy [^111aBVij]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Nephrotoxicity

Nephrotoxicity is associated with a number of antibiotics (Table 3). Currently, serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen are the most commonly used biomarkers for monitoring acute kidney injury, however, they are nonspecific and the serum levels of these markers will rise only after a considerable loss kidney function.

Preclinical studies have been performed to investigate potential biomarkers of antibiotic‐related nephrotoxicity. In antibiotic treated rats, serum cystatin C has been found to outperform the standard serum kidney injury markers in regard to specificity and selectivity, and using a panel of novel urinary biomarkers, including kidney injury molecule‐1, the onset of toxicity, as well as the reversion after discontinuation of treatment, could be identified. It has shown correlation with histopathological and proximal tubule damage in rats treated with several different nephrotoxic antibiotics and can be detected shortly after initiation of antibiotic therapy. Such biomarkers of early nephrotoxicity could potentially be utilized for treatment monitoring and prevent emergence of severe toxicity.

Hepatotoxicity

Antibiotic‐induced hepatotoxicity can lead to severe, possibly fatal, hepatic damage. Several antibiotics are known to be associated with hepatotoxicity (Table 3). Current treatment monitoring relies on increasing concentrations of the liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, with circulation half‐lives of 47 and 17 hours, respectively. Although these enzymes are markers for liver damage, they are not predictive of overall liver function nor correlate well with observed hepatic pathology. Alternative biomarkers for hepatotoxicity include glutamate dehydrogenase (clinically observed half‐life of 11–18 hours), outperforming standard enzyme biomarkers to predict acute toxicity, and also microRNA‐based biomarkers have gained acceptance as markers of liver damage. Mechanistic models can play an important role in increase the understanding of such complex antibiotic exposure‐toxicity‐biomarker relationships. For instance, for hepatotoxicity, several mechanistic system models have been published, which allows to derive relationships among drug exposure, time‐dependent cell death, and associated biomarker dynamics.

Pregnancy

Teratogenic Effects

Reproductive studies have been performed in mice and rats at doses up to 20 times the usual human dose and have no evidence of embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity or teratogenicity. In primates, no embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was demonstrated at a dose approximately 3 times the human dose.

There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

Nonteratogenic Effects

In rats, in the Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) and Segment III (perinatal and postnatal) studies with intravenously administered ceftriaxone, no adverse effects were noted on various reproductive parameters during gestation and lactation, including postnatal growth, functional behavior and reproductive ability of the offspring, at doses of 586 mg/kg/day or less.

Nursing Mothers

Low concentrations of ceftriaxone are excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when ceftriaxone is administered to a nursing woman.

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of ceftriaxone in neonates, infants and pediatric patients have been established for the dosages described in the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section. In vitro studies have shown that ceftriaxone, like some other cephalosporins, can displace bilirubin from serum albumin. Ceftriaxone should not be administered to hyperbilirubinemic neonates, especially prematures (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Geriatric Use

Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of ceftriaxone, 32% were 60 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

The pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone were only minimally altered in geriatric patients compared to healthy adult subjects and dosage adjustments are not necessary for geriatric patients with ceftriaxone dosages up to 2 grams per day provided there is no severe renal and hepatic impairment (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

Influence on Diagnostic Tests

In patients treated with ceftriaxone the Coombs' test may become positive. Ceftriaxone for injection, like other antibacterial drugs, may result in positive test results for galactosemia.

Nonenzymatic methods for the glucose determination in urine may give false-positive results. For this reason, urine-glucose determination during therapy with ceftriaxone should be done enzymatically.

The presence of ceftriaxone may falsely lower estimated blood glucose values obtained with some blood glucose monitoring systems. Please refer to instructions for use for each system. Alternative testing methods should be used if necessary.

### Ceftriaxone-associated nephrolithiasis and biliary pseudolithiasis in a child [^1115oJ3P]. Pediatric Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

Ceftriaxone is a widely used third-generation cephalosporin. It is generally very safe, but complications of biliary pseudolithiasis and, rarely, nephrolithiasis have been reported in children. These complications generally resolve spontaneously with cessation of the ceftriaxone therapy; however, they may symptomatically mimic more serious clinical problems, such as cholecystitis. We report a case of both ceftriaxone-induced biliary pseudolithiasis and nephrolithiasis.

### Antibiotic treatment for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in people with decompensated liver cirrhosis: a network meta-analysis [^111ua2uh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 2.5% of all hospitalisations in people with cirrhosis are for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Antibiotics, in addition to supportive treatment (fluid and electrolyte balance, treatment of shock), form the mainstay treatments of SBP. Various antibiotics are available for the treatment of SBP, but there is uncertainty regarding the best antibiotic for SBP.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of different antibiotic treatments for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in people with decompensated liver cirrhosis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers until November 2018 to identify randomised clinical trials on people with cirrhosis and SBP.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status) in adults with cirrhosis and SBP. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently identified eligible trials and collected data. The outcomes for this review included mortality, serious adverse events, any adverse events, resolution of SBP, liver transplantation, and other decompensation events. We performed a network meta-analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the odds ratio, rate ratio, and hazard ratio with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) based on an available-case analysis, according to the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Decision Support Unit guidance.

Main Results

We included a total of 12 trials (1278 participants; 13 antibiotics) in the review. Ten trials (893 participants) were included in one or more outcomes in the review. The trials that provided the information included patients having cirrhosis with or without other features of decompensation of varied aetiologies. The follow-up in the trials ranged from one week to three months. All the trials were at high risk of bias. Only one trial was included under each comparison for most of the outcomes. Because of these reasons, there is very low certainty in all the results. The majority of the randomised clinical trials used third-generation cephalosporins, such as intravenous ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ciprofloxacin as one of the interventions. Overall, approximately 75% of trial participants recovered from SBP and 25% of people died within three months. There was no evidence of difference in any of the outcomes for which network meta-analysis was possible: mortality (9 trials; 653 participants), proportion of people with any adverse events (5 trials; 297 participants), resolution of SBP (as per standard definition, 9 trials; 873 participants), or other features of decompensation (6 trials; 535 participants). The effect estimates in the direct comparisons (when available) were very similar to those of network meta-analysis. For the comparisons where network meta-analysis was not possible, there was no evidence of difference in any of the outcomes (proportion of participants with serious adverse events, number of adverse events, and proportion of participants requiring liver transplantation). Due to the wide CrIs and the very low-certainty evidence for all the outcomes, significant benefits or harms of antibiotics are possible. None of the trials reported health-related quality of life, number of serious adverse events, or symptomatic recovery from SBP.

Funding

the source of funding for two trials were industrial organisations who would benefit from the results of the trial; the source of funding for the remaining 10 trials was unclear.

Authors' Conclusions

Short-term mortality after SBP is about 25%. There is significant uncertainty about which antibiotic therapy is better in people with SBP. We need adequately powered randomised clinical trials, with adequate blinding, avoiding post-randomisation dropouts (or performing intention-to-treat analysis), and using clinically important outcomes, such as mortality, health-related quality of life, and adverse events.

Comment on treatment safety — adverse events with ceftriaxone: Although antimicrobial regimens are widely used and generally well tolerated, none is without potential side effects; in one post-Lyme syndrome study, 6 of the 28 patients receiving ceftriaxone developed diarrhea, while 4 developed allergic reactions (1 anaphylaxis, 3 minor); because of its biliary excretion, ceftriaxone tends to cause pseudolithiasis and may be associated with pseudomembranous colitis more frequently than other antimicrobials.

### Ceftriaxone sodium (ceftriaxone) [^117Cngvo]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

General

Prescribing Ceftriaxone Injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

Although transient elevations of BUN and serum creatinine have been observed, at the recommended dosages, the nephrotoxic potential of Ceftriaxone Injection is similar to that of other cephalosporins.

Ceftriaxone is excreted via both biliary and renal excretion (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Therefore, patients with mild to moderate renal impairment normally require no adjustment in dosage when usual doses of Ceftriaxone Injection are administered.

Dosage adjustments should not be necessary in patients with hepatic dysfunction; however, in patients with both hepatic dysfunction and significant renal disease, caution should be exercised and the Ceftriaxone Injection dosage should not exceed 2 gm daily.

Ceftriaxone has been associated with a fall in prothrombin activity. Those at risk include patients with renal or hepatic impairment or poor nutritional state, as well as patients receiving a protracted course of antimicrobial therapy, and patients previously stabilized on anticoagulant therapy. Prothrombin time should be monitored in patients at risk and exogenous vitamin K administered as indicated.

Prolonged use of Ceftriaxone Injection may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Careful observation of the patient is essential. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.

Ceftriaxone Injection should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, especially colitis.

There have been reports of sonographic abnormalities in the gallbladder of patients treated with ceftriaxone; some of these patients also had symptoms of gallbladder disease. These abnormalities appear on sonography as an echo without acoustical shadowing suggesting sludge or as an echo with acoustical shadowing which may be misinterpreted as gallstones. The chemical nature of the sonographically detected material has been determined to be predominantly a ceftriaxone-calcium salt. The condition appears to be transient and reversible upon discontinuation of ceftriaxone and institution of conservative management. Therefore, Ceftriaxone Injection should be discontinued in patients who develop signs and symptoms suggestive of gallbladder disease and/or the sonographic findings described above.

Cases of pancreatitis, possibly secondary to biliary obstruction, have been reported rarely in patients treated with ceftriaxone. Most patients presented with risk factors for biliary stasis and biliary sludge (preceding major therapy, severe illness, total parenteral nutrition). A cofactor role of ceftriaxone related biliary precipitation cannot be ruled out.

### Liver injury in children: signal analysis of suspected drugs based on the food and drug administration adverse event reporting system [^114BdeLF]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Ceftriaxone is a semi-synthetic, third-generation cephalosporin that mainly causes cholelithiasis or bile stasis. One retrospective study showed that 3.2% of patients treated with ceftriaxone might develop liver injury. Liver injury caused by ketoconazole in children mostly presents as elevated levels of direct bilirubin and liver enzymes. Liver functions usually recover after drug cessation, but severe cases can also develop into liver failure. Animal studies have confirmed the dose-dependent liver injury induced by ketoconazole.

Isoniazid is a first-line anti-tuberculosis drug. Approximately 10–20% of patients administered isoniazid develop the transient elevation of alanine aminotransferase, and fewer than 1–3% develop severe liver injury or even liver failure. A greater risk of isoniazid- and rifampicin-related liver injury in children (6.9% in children and 2.7% in adults) was reported in a retrospective study. In the US, the incidence of isoniazid-associated hepatotoxicity was determined to be 1% in children treated for latent tuberculosis infection, and there was a synergistic harmful effect on the liver when isoniazid and rifampin were used in one prescription. It is generally believed that isoniazid-induced liver injury is attributed to the toxicity of the metabolites acetylhydrazine and hydrazine. Moreover, mitochondrial damage caused by isoniazid-induced oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation stimulated by isoniazid and its metabolites has also been discussed.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been reported during postapproval use of ceftriaxone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to readily estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Gastrointestinal — stomatitis and glossitis.
Genitourinary — oliguria, ureteric obstruction, post-renal acute renal failure.
Hepatic — hepatitis.
Dermatologic — severe cutaneous adverse reactions (erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome or Lyell's syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis), exanthema, allergic dermatitis, urticaria, and edema.
Immunologic — Anaphylaxis (anaphylactic shock, transient leucopenia, neutropenia, agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia).
Neurologic – Encephalopathy, seizures, myoclonus, and non-convulsive status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

6.3 Cephalosporin-class Adverse Reactions

In addition to the adverse reactions listed above that have been observed in patients treated with ceftriaxone, the following adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been reported for cephalosporin-class antibacterials:

Adverse Reactions: Allergic reactions, drug fever, serum sickness-like reaction, renal dysfunction, toxic nephropathy, reversible hyperactivity, hypertonia, hepatic dysfunction including hepatitis, cholestasis, aplastic anemia, hemorrhage, and superinfection.
Altered Laboratory Tests: Positive direct Coombs' test, false-positive test for urinary glucose, and elevated lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH).

The quality of evidence is graded from high to very low, with high quality indicating that further research is unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of effect and that the true effect lies close to this estimate; moderate quality is associated with moderate confidence although further research could impact the estimate; low quality indicates further study is likely to have an important impact on confidence and would likely change the estimate; and very low quality indicates very little confidence and that the true effect is likely to be substantially different than the estimate. Recommendation strength is defined as strong when the benefits of therapy clearly outweigh the negatives and the result of no action, and conditional when some uncertainty remains about the balance of benefits/potential harm.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury [^116AqqF7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) — strength and quality definitions: Factors influencing the strength of the recommendation include the quality of the evidence, presumed patient-important outcomes, and cost. Strong recommendations are those where the benefits clearly outweigh the negatives and the result of no action. Conditional recommendations are made when some uncertainty remains about the balance of benefits/potential harm, for example, there may be variability in preferences and values, uncertainty about the study outcomes or quality of evidence, and higher cost or resource consumption. Quality of evidence categories are defined as follows — High: Further research is unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of the clinical effect. Moderate: Further research may change confidence in the estimate of the clinical effect. Low: Further research is likely to have an important impact on the confidence in clinical effect and would likely change the estimate. Very low: There is very little confidence in effect estimate, and the true clinical effect is likely to be substantially different.

### Causes, clinical features, and outcomes from a prospective study of drug-induced liver injury in the United States [^114pLroW]. Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is among the most common causes of acute liver failure in the United States, accounting for approximately 13% of cases. A prospective study was begun in 2003 to recruit patients with suspected DILI and create a repository of biological samples for analysis. This report summarizes the causes, clinical features, and outcomes from the first 300 patients enrolled.

Methods

Patients with suspected DILI were enrolled based on predefined criteria and followed up for at least 6 months. Patients with acetaminophen liver injury were excluded.

Results

DILI was caused by a single prescription medication in 73% of the cases, by dietary supplements in 9%, and by multiple agents in 18%. More than 100 different agents were associated with DILI; antimicrobials (45.5%) and central nervous system agents (15%) were the most common. Causality was considered to be definite in 32%, highly likely in 41%, probable in 14%, possible in 10%, and unlikely in 3%. Acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection was the final diagnosis in 4 of 9 unlikely cases. Six months after enrollment, 14% of patients had persistent laboratory abnormalities and 8% had died; the cause of death was liver related in 44%.

Conclusions

DILI is caused by a wide array of medications, herbal supplements, and dietary supplements. Antibiotics are the single largest class of agents that cause DILI. Acute HCV infection should be excluded in patients with suspected DILI by HCV RNA testing. The overall 6-month mortality was 8%, but the majority of deaths were not liver related.

### An optimal antibiotic selection framework for sepsis patients using artificial intelligence [^115xEzmn]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

OptABs optimal treatment selection to prevent antibiotic-induced side-effects

Current guidelinesand recommendations – indicate cases, where certain antibiotics are contraindicated. However, these recommendations can only be implemented on the basis of laboratory values and anamnesis at the moment of the treatment decision. Future side effects are sometimes difficult to anticipate. For example, in our test set we found that 125 (30.6%) of the 409 patients who were factually treated with the nephrotoxic Vancomycin had acute kidney injury already at treatment initialization or developed acute kidney injury during the course of treatment. The high incidence of acute kidney injury is likely caused by high Vancomycin dosages. Patients in the MIMIC-IV dataset treated with Vancomycin typically receive 1 mg every 12 or 24 h, despite recommendations for dose control to reduce renal toxicities. Most dosing regimes aim to achieve Vancomycin serum levels of 20–30 μg/mL and depend on the patient's weight or comorbidities, but they vary in terms of dose adjustment –.

OptAB identifies contraindications or liver-associated side-effects in 64 (19.1%) of the 298 patients who received the hepatotoxic Ceftriaxone. Typically, either 1 g or 2 g of Ceftriaxone was administered once a day.

We checked, whether OptAB's predictions could be helpful in preventing anticipated toxic side effects before a contraindicative event was detected. To this end, we selected all patients with a contraindication for the factual treatment they received during the disease course. For these patients, we counted, how often the optimal treatment under the side effect constraints suggested by OptAB excluded the contraindicated antibiotic in the optimal treatment.

OptAB's optimal treatment excluded Vancomycin for 49 (39.2%) patients of the 125 patients who were factually treated with Vancomycin despite a kidney injury associated contraindication. As for hepatotoxicity, OptAB would have recommended an optimal treatment excluding the hepatoxic Ceftriaxone in 7 out of the 64 patients (10.9%) who received Ceftriaxone despite a liver injury associated contraindication.

### Safety of ceftriaxone in paediatrics: a systematic review [^112Sni8h]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

This study has been registered with the international prospective register of systematic reviews. We reported the methods of the systematic review in a previously published protocol. In brief, a comprehensive search was performed using Medline (Ovid), PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, CINAHL and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts for relevant articles up to December 2018. We included all types of studies including randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, case–control studies, cross-sectional studies, case series and case reports that assessed the safety of ceftriaxone in paediatric patients aged from birth to 18 years old. There was no restriction on language. We excluded editorials, conference abstracts, studies that evaluated the safety of ceftriaxone during pregnancy and studies that included both paediatric and adult patients but did not report the ADRs separately for paediatric patients. We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess risk of bias in RCTs, Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for case–control study and cohort studies and relevant tools for other types of studies. We recorded the number of ADR as zero when the study explicitly reported zero event of a particular ADR, or when the study had the capacity to detect the particular ADR but did not report any event. We calculated the pooled incidence of a particular ADR associated with ceftriaxone based on RCTs and prospective cohort studies. Pooled incidence of a particular ADR per 100 patients = (number of events associated with ceftriaxone/number of patients in ceftriaxone group) × 100. For ADRs that required specific investigations (eg, biliary), the denominator was the number of patients in the ceftriaxone group of studies that performed the specific investigation. Otherwise, the denominator was the number of patients in ceftriaxone group of all RCTs and prospective cohort studies. We conducted meta-analysis of RCTs to assess the comparative safety of ceftriaxone in relation to placebo or other antibiotics by random effect model in Revman 5.3. We used risk difference (RD) as the pooled effect measurement instead of relative risk (RR) or OR as planed in the protocol. Because when the number of events is zero in either group, we cannot use inverse variance methods to calculate RR or OR but can still use RD in the presence of zero events. We did not perform subgroup analysis or meta-regression, because most studies enrolled patients in the same age group (24 months–11 years) and used a similar dose of ceftriaxone (50–100 mg/kg/day).

Chronic liver disease (CLD) — burden and overlap with drug-induced liver injury (DILI) — In the United States, 4.5 million adults or 1.8% of adults are diagnosed with CLD, with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (20%), alcoholic liver disease (5%), chronic HCV (1%–5%), and chronic HBV (0.5%–1%) as the most common etiologies. In DILI cohorts, the DILIN Prospective Study reported that 10% of enrolled patients had preexisting CLD, whereas DILI accounts for < 1% of consecutive inpatients or outpatients presenting with clinically apparent acute liver injury.

### Meropenem-induced liver injury and β-lactam cross-reactivity [^117ViUvr]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

A 63-year-old man admitted to hospital for the management of a frontal lobe abscess developed elevated liver enzymes within 48hours of receiving meropenem. Liver enzymes reached a maximum at 5 days postadministration of meropenem, with alanine aminotransferase 1160 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 787 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 297 U/L and gamma-glutamyltransferase 252 U/L. Meropenem was ceased and liver function normalised. Meropenem was administered for a second time later in the patient's admission and again the patient developed rapidly increasing liver enzymes, with a mixed hepatocellular/cholestatic pattern. Other possible causes of liver injury were excluded following extensive investigations, and the patient's liver enzymes continued to normalise following meropenem discontinuation. The patient was asymptomatic during the admission and was transferred to a rehabilitation facility. This case demonstrates that meropenem can cause severe liver injury and that early recognition of drug-induced liver injury is important.

### Safety of ceftriaxone in paediatrics: a systematic review [^1122uQVe]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the safety of ceftriaxone in paediatric patients and systematically evaluate the categories and incidences of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of ceftriaxone in paediatric patients.

Methods

We performed a systematic search in Medline, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, CINAHL, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts and bibliographies of relevant articles up to December 2018 for all types of studies that assessed the safety of ceftriaxone in paediatric patients aged ≤ 18 years.

Results

112 studies met the inclusion criteria involving 5717 paediatric patients who received ceftriaxone and reported 1136 ADRs. The most frequent ADRs reported in prospective studies were gastrointestinal (GI) disorders (37.4%, 292/780), followed by hepatobiliary disorders (24.6%, 192/780). Serious ADRs leading to withdrawal or discontinuation of ceftriaxone were reported in 86 paediatric patients. Immune haemolytic anaemia (34.9%, 30/86) and biliary pseudolithiasis (26.7%, 23/86) were the two major causes. Haemolytic anaemia following intravenous ceftriaxone led to death in 11 children whose primary disease was sickle cell disease. Almost all biliary pseudolithiasis are reversible. However, the incidence was high affecting one in five paediatric patients (20.7%).

Conclusions

GI ADRs are the most common toxicity of ceftriaxone in paediatric patients. Immune haemolytic anaemia and biliary pseudolithiasis are the most serious ADRs and the major reasons for discontinuation of ceftriaxone. Immune haemolytic anaemia is more likely in children with sickle cell disease and may cause death. Ceftriaxone should be used with caution in children with sickle cell disease.

- **Definition**: DILI is acute/chronic liver injury characterized by abnormalities in liver function.
- **Pathophysiology**: DILI is mostly caused by antibiotics (amoxicillin-clavulanate; 45.4%), herbal and dietary supplements (16.1%), cardiovascular agents (9.8%), CNS agents (9.1%), anti-neoplastic agents (5.5%), and analgesics (paracetamol overdose; 3.7%).
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of DILI include jaundice, rashes, acute hepatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, AIH, coagulopathies, hepatic encephalopathy. Progression may lead to chronic liver disease with fibrosis, cirrhosis, necessitating liver transplantation.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The mortality rate associated with DILI is 7.6%.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for drug-induced liver injury, more specifically with respect to liver biopsy, AASLD 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that liver biopsy can help to:

- identify hepatotoxic drugs based on specific histological patterns and exclude concurrent liver diseases

- determine the mechanism of injury, for example, microvesicular steatosis and necrosis associated with the use of mitochondrial toxin fialuridine

- predict outcomes, for example, the presence of eosinophils and granulomas is associated with a more favorable outcome, whereas necrosis or fibrosis is associated with poorer outcomes.

### Liver injury in children: signal analysis of suspected drugs based on the food and drug administration adverse event reporting system [^111ALpTd]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Anti-infectives, especially antibacterial drugs, are extensively applied, and their irrational use can cause hepatotoxicity. The immature liver function in children and increased hepatotoxicity caused by the concomitant administration of multiple antibacterial drugs make children more vulnerable to hepatic injury than adults. The results of anti-infectives for systemic use, as the most reported class in our study, were consistent with the published literature. Representative drugs included trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), ceftriaxone, fluconazole, and isoniazid.

TMP-SMX exerts its antimicrobial effect by blocking the metabolism of folic acid through a dual pathway and can cause DILI via allergic reactions (fever, rash, etc.). Bell et al. reported a case of DILI induced by TMP-SMX; specifically, a 9-year-old boy with a community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus skin and soft tissue infection received TMP-SMX, and 14 days after administration, he developed fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain, with poor appetite and mentality. He was diagnosed with TMP-SMX-induced liver injury based on biochemical tests and the exclusion of other factors contributing to hepatic injury.

### Safety of ceftriaxone in paediatrics: a systematic review [^112tbfZf]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ceftriaxone is a parenteral cephalosporin with broad antimicrobial activity and a long elimination half-life of 8 hours. Studies have shown that ceftriaxone is effective for severe acute infections such as meningitis, sepsis and pneumonia. Ceftriaxone is widely used in paediatric patients of all ages.

As a consequence of widespread use, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) have increasingly been reported. Concurrent use of intravenous ceftriaxone and calcium-containing solutions in neonates and young infants has been associated with calcium precipitation. Biliary pseudolithiasis and urolithiasis have also been reported in paediatric patients. There is a lack of overall assessment of the safety of ceftriaxone, one of the most widely used antibiotics in paediatric patients. This is therefore the reason for performing this systematic review. The aims of this systematic review are: (1) to systematically evaluate the categories and incidences of ADRs in paediatric patients aged from birth to 18 years old; (2) to identify the most common ADRs and the most serious ADRs associated with ceftriaxone in paediatric patients; and (3) to explore the risk factors of serious ADRs.

Results

Study characteristics

After systematic literature search, we identified a total of 112 studies with reports on the toxicity of ceftriaxone from 28 countries, including 22 RCTs, 19 prospective and 7 retrospective cohort studies, 1 case–control study, 2 case series and 61 case reports (figure 1). The 112 studies included 5717 paediatric patients who received ceftriaxone and documented 1136 ADRs in total (online supplementary appendix 1). Nearly 40% of the ADRs (423/1136) were from RCTs and 31.4% (357/1136) from prospective cohort studies (table 1). The age of patients was from 1 month to 18 years. The daily dosage and duration of ceftriaxone ranged from 30 to 120 mg/kg/day and 2–50 days (online supplementary appendix 1). Lack of allocation concealment (3/22, 14%) or unclear reporting regarding allocation concealment (14/22, 64%) was the major source of risk of bias in RCTs. Lack of comparability was the major concern in cohort studies. Online supplementary appendix 2 presents the risk of bias for each individual study. Only one study had a high risk of bias in four domains (Cannavino et al) and one in three domains (Biner et al).

### Flucloxacillin-induced liver injury in elderly patient [^114y7euw]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Flucloxacillin is a penicillin antibiotic used as first-line treatment for soft tissue infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus It is used frequently in the elderly and is an established cause of cholestatic liver injury. Risk factors for cholestasis include prolonged duration of treatment, female sex and older age. Elderly patients are also more likely to suffer from comorbidities and polypharmacy, which increases the incidence of drug-induced liver injury and hospitalisation, which in turn can lead to irreversible deterioration in functional baseline. Our case report aims to raise awareness of flucloxacillin-induced liver injury in elderly patients and to encourage the use of alternative treatments and/or limited duration. We advocate for further research into individualised treatments and new diagnostic techniques in patients with painless jaundice based on their genotype.

### COVID-19 and liver injury: where do we stand? [^111a94mn]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

The exact underlying pathophysiology and the clinical implication of COVID-19-associated liver injury have not yet been fully determined, while much research regarding this issue is ongoing. Based on previous experience, the role of coronaviruses in generating liver injury has been documented in patients infected by the SARS-CoV coronavirus, described as an acute respiratory syndrome back in 2003. While the presence of SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed in liver tissue, it is unclear whether the liver injury can be caused directly by the coronavirus itself. Interestingly, both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter the target cell. However, while it was demonstrated that the ACE2 receptor is expressed in the biliary epithelial liver cells, liver injury in COVID-19 patients is mainly revealed as hepatocyte injury documented by ALT and AST elevation. Thus, an alternative pathophysiology of liver injury may be implicated in these patients. One hypothesis is that it may be the result of the characteristic immune-mediated damage and systemic inflammation caused by a hyper-activated response to COVID-19, described in patients with severe clinical manifestations. Other possible explanations and alternative mechanisms, such as drug-induced liver damage (DILI) associated with paracetamol, antivirals (remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir), antimicrobials (macrolides, quinolones, beta-lactams, chloroquine), or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and hypoxic hepatitis due to respiratory or cardiac failure in severe cases, cannot be ruled out.

This review aims to summarize the available data concerning the extent and the role of liver injury as an extrapulmonary manifestation of COVID-19. A literature search in the PubMed database was conducted until 16 April 2020 for studies of COVID-19. A keyword-base search included the entries "COVID-19" OR "nCOV" OR "novel-coronavirus OR "SARS-CoV-2 AND "liver" OR "transaminases" OR "gastrointestinal". We excluded 2 studies published in Chinese. Finally, we included 22 studies with characteristics of liver injury (liver test abnormalities) in COVID-19 patients.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1179yLrQ]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis management — IV antibiotics should be started empirically (before obtaining culture results) in all patients with an ascites PMN count > 250/mm^3; patients with a focal intraabdominal inflammatory entity (e.g., diverticulitis, cholecystitis) may have an ascites PMN count > 250/mm^3 and should be treated not for SBP but for the specific condition per standard of care, including a surgical consult; traditionally, third-generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) were recommended in all patients with SBP, with resolution rates of approximately 90%, and currently they are recommended as the first-line antibiotics (e.g. IV cefotaxime 2 g every 12 hours) in settings where MDROs are not prevalent; inappropriate initial antimicrobial therapy in patients admitted with septic shock increases the risk of death by 10 times.

### An optimal antibiotic selection framework for sepsis patients using artificial intelligence [^112sujSL]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Study design and selection of antibiotics

For the optimal antibiotic selection we focus on the three antibiotics Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Ceftriaxone. The selection of these three antibiotics is based on both medical knowledge and data availability. First, we selected the most frequently administered antibiotics, specifically those administered to at least 5000 among the 26.111 hospitalizations with Sepsis in the MIMIC-IV dataset (see Table 1).

Table 1
Descriptive statistics for all antibiotics administered to more than 5000 Sepsis patients in the MIMIC-IV dataset

Table presenting for each antibiotic administered to more than 5000 patients in the MIMIC-IV dataset the count of patients (only) treated with that specific antibiotic and the corresponding 90-day death rate.

More than 50% (14,795) of all Sepsis patients were treated with Vancomycin. Vancomycin is one of the first-line antibiotics for the treatment of Sepsis and is effective against a broad spectrum of gram-positive pathogens including MRSA. Unfortunately, Vancomycin is renal toxic and causes many acute kidney injuries. Consequently, the administration of Vancomycin to patients with an impaired kidney function or acute kidney injury should be avoided whenever possible.

Piperacillin/Tazobactam was administered to 5937 (22.7%) and Ceftriaxone to 5389 (20.6%) of the Sepsis patients. Both are commonly recommended for Sepsis treatment. Unfortunately, Ceftriaxone is hepatotoxic and can cause liver injuries, especially in patients with comprised livers or liver impairments.

Cefepime was administered to 6944 patients and Cefazolin was administered to 5687 patients. Patients treated with Cefazolin had a much lower 90-day mortality rate, indicating that some of the patients might not have suffered from severe Sepsis or that Cefazoline was administered for other purposes, like e.g. cellulitis or other skin infections. Only 133 patients were exclusively treated with Cefepime, which is not sufficient for reliably estimating treatment effects. Therefore, we excluded these two antibiotics from our model.

### Safety of ceftriaxone in paediatrics: a systematic review [^113R43LC]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2020). Medium credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

Ceftriaxone is a broad-spectrum, bactericidal antibiotic with long elimination half-life.
Ceftriaxone causes biliary pseudolithiasis and urolithiasis in paediatric patients.

What this study adds?

Diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are the most common ADRs of ceftriaxone in paediatrics patients.
Biliary pseudolithiasis and cholelithiasis appear to be common ADR affecting one in five paediatric patients, but most of the cases are reversible.
Haemolytic anaemia is rare but the most serious ADR of ceftriaxone in paediatric patients, and sickle cell disease is a risk factor for haemolytic anaemia.

### Safety of ceftriaxone in paediatrics: a systematic review [^113rECXj]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2020). Medium credibility.

Our systematic review is the first review that systematically evaluated all categories of suspected ADRs associated with ceftriaxone in paediatric patients. We note several limitations of our review. First, since the assessment of safety was usually not the first objective in prospective studies, the pooled incidence of ADRs in our review might be underestimated for ADRs that do not need specified investigation (eg, nausea). However, the incidence of ADRs that need specified investigations (eg, biliary) might be overestimated. When the outcome assessors knew the treatment, they might over diagnose the ADRs (eg, biliary pseudolithiasis and cholelithiasis) that were reported by previous studies. Moreover, for ADRs that were only monitored in a few studies (eg, thrombocytosis), the incidence of ADRs calculated by our study must be viewed with caution. Second, we did not perform the subgroup analysis of different age groups because ADRs were not reported separately according to children's age groups in studies that enrolled patients of more than one age groups. We did not perform the subgroup analysis of different dosage because most patients received a dosage of 50–100 mg/kg/day. Third, we searched but finally did not include the reports from spontaneous ADR reporting databases as planned in the protocol, because the data from these databases failed to explicitly provide information on type of ADRs and characteristics of patients. We think these data gave limited information to our readers.

Ceftriaxone is a valuable broad-spectrum antibiotic in the management of severe sepsis. It is, however, one of many broad-spectrum antibiotics. The high risk of biliary pseudolithiasis and cholelithiasis, even if it appears to be reversible, is of concern. Further well-designed prospective studies evaluating the risk of lithiasis in comparison with other broad-spectrum antibiotics are needed.

In conclusion, our review found that GI ADRs were the most common toxicity of ceftriaxone in children. Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting were the most common ADRs among GI system. Biliary pseudolithiasis and immune haemolytic anaemia were the most serious ADRs and the major reasons for discontinuation of ceftriaxone in children. Almost all biliary pseudolithiasis were reversible. Immune haemolytic anaemia was more likely in children with sickle cell disease and may cause death. Ceftriaxone should, therefore, be used with caution in children with sickle cell disease.

Anti-infective for systemic use (J) (81.3%) and drugs of the nervous system (N) (8.9%) were the most frequently implicated ATC classes of drugs in pDDIs. This can be explained by reason that infectious diseases (A00–B99) were common diseases in this study. Besides, antibiotics were prescribed as prophylaxis for patients with severe acute malnutrition to prevent patients at risk of developing severe infections. This result is in agreement with the work of Feinstein et al. in which drugs of the nervous system (opioids) and anti-infective agents were commonly implicated in pDDIs. Besides, in an international multicenter study, antibacterial for systemic use (25.7%) and drugs of the nervous system (21.9%) were reported as most frequently prescribed to hospitalized children and were categorized as high-risk drugs for developing ADRs. So, patients on these classes of drugs should be carefully monitored for any signs/symptoms of ADRs and treatment failures due to pDDIs.

The most prevalent interacting pairs of drugs involved in pDDIs in the present study were calcium gluconate – ceftriaxone (6 combinations), ciprofloxacin – metronidazole (6 combinations) and ciprofloxacin – fluconazole (4 combinations) among pairs with major or contraindicated pDDIs, and ampicillin – gentamicin (79 combinations) with minor pDDIs. At single drug level, ciprofloxacin ranked first (17 combinations) to display pDDIs other than drugs with minor interactions. But in other similar studies, fentanyl – morphine and gentamicin – furosemide interacting pairs of drugs were the most frequently implicated ones in pDDIs.

The current study revealed the risk of reduced/loss of efficacy/effectiveness was the most (74.7%) prevalent potential clinical consequence of the pDDIs including aminoglycoside efficacy (60.8%) and reduced antiepileptic effectiveness (4.4%). Increased side effects/toxicities such as increased risk of QT-interval prolongation (10.1%), theophylline toxicity (5.1%), antiepileptic toxicity (5.1%), formation of ceftriaxone-calcium precipitates (3.8%) and hepatotoxicity (3.8%) comprised other potential clinical consequences. The QT-interval prolongation and hepatotoxicity from these pDDIs may cause physiologic end-effects or heart and liver damage, respectively. So, special caution should be taken during prescribing combination of drugs which have the potentional to cause such side effecs. In previous study, QT-interval prolongation was reported as a prevalent potential consequence of pDDIs in hospitalized children.

### Ceftriaxone sodium (ceftriaxone) [^111AWznT]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Postmarketing Experience

In addition to the adverse reactions reported during clinical trials, the following adverse experiences have been reported during clinical practice in patients treated with ceftriaxone. Data are generally insufficient to allow an estimate of incidence or to establish causation.

A small number of cases of fatal outcomes in which a crystalline material was observed in the lungs and kidneys at autopsy have been reported in neonates receiving ceftriaxone and calcium-containing fluids. In some of these cases, the same intravenous infusion line was used for both ceftriaxone and calcium-containing fluids and in some a precipitate was observed in the intravenous infusion line. At least one fatality has been reported in a neonate in whom ceftriaxone and calcium-containing fluids were administered at different time points via different intravenous lines; no crystalline material was observed at autopsy in this neonate. There have been no similar reports in patients other than neonates.

IMMUNE SYSTEM DISORDER – Acute myocardial ischemia with or without myocardial infarction may occur as part of an allergic reaction.

GASTROINTESTINAL – stomatitis and glossitis.

GENITOURINARY – oliguria.

DERMATOLOGIC – exanthema, allergic dermatitis, urticaria, edema. As with many medications, isolated cases of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome or Lyell's syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis) have been reported.

NEUROLOGIC – Encephalopathy, seizures, myoclonus, and non-convulsive status epilepticus (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS).

Cephalosporin Class Adverse Reactions

In addition to the adverse reactions listed above which have been observed in patients treated with ceftriaxone, the following adverse reactions and altered laboratory test results have been reported for cephalosporin class antibiotics:

Adverse Reactions

Allergic reactions, drug fever, serum sickness-like reaction, renal dysfunction, toxic nephropathy, reversible hyperactivity, hypertonia, hepatic dysfunction including cholestasis, aplastic anemia, hemorrhage, fall in prothrombin activity, and superinfection.

Altered Laboratory Tests

Positive direct Coombs' test, false-positive test for urinary glucose, and elevated LDH.

Several cephalosporins have been implicated in triggering seizures, particularly in patients with renal impairment when the dosage was not reduced (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). If seizures associated with drug therapy occur, the drug should be discontinued. Anticonvulsant therapy can be given if clinically indicated.

### An optimal antibiotic selection framework for sepsis patients using artificial intelligence [^112oLLYe]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The MSEs of alanine transaminase (Fig. 2 d) are typically much higher than those of the other variables, often exceeding 50% or more. Most of the alanine transaminase values range between 0 IU/L and 500 IU/L, but a few patients reach levels above 5000 IU/L. These extreme values have a large effect on the MSE. This is in line with previous reports that alanine transaminase levels are highly variable, both between repeated measurements of the same patient and between patients.

Overall, OptAB is able to forecast the time course of the SOFA-score and creatinine with sufficient accuracy given a realistic observation time window after sepsis onset. Forecasting bilirubin total is slightly more difficult, presumably because of the small number of observations in both training and test sets. Extreme values of alanine transaminase for a small number of patients aggravate inaccuracies due to data sparsity for this laboratory value.

OptAB learns realistic treatment effects

Forecasting the factual disease courses alone is not sufficient for treatment optimization. OptAB can predict the effect of different potential antibiotic treatments on the SOFA score and the side effect indicators. However, it is impossible to evaluate these predictions retrospectively using our real-world test data. Each patient received just one factual treatment and there are of course no observations for the counterfactual treatments. To still check whether the effects of different counterfactual treatments are plausible, we investigated, whether known toxic side effects of the different antibiotics are reflected by the counterfactual predictions. The rationale behind this is that treatment with a renal toxic antibiotic like Vancomycin should often lead to higher creatinine values than treatment with Ceftriaxone. At the same time, the laboratory values bilirubin total and alanine transaminase should often be higher under Ceftriaxone treatment compared to Vancomycin, due to the known hepatotoxic effect of Ceftriaxone. The individual effect can be different for some individual patients, because the Sepsis disease course itself might have an effect on these laboratory values. However, we expect at least to see a trend into the direction consistent with the known side effect profile of the different antibiotics.

### Cefdinir-induced hepatotoxicity: potential hazards of inappropriate antibiotic use [^116W8eHh]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Drug-induced hepatotoxicity is well recognized but can cause some diagnostic problems, particularly if not previously reported. The present case involves a 22-year-old male who presented with jaundice and elevated liver enzymes after a course of cefdinir (Omnicef) for streptococcal pharyngitis. A diagnosis of drug-induced liver injury was suspected but a liver biopsy was required after his jaundice worsened despite cessation of the presumed offending agent. A short course of steroids was initiated and eventually the jaundice resolved. This case highlights the need to suspect medication-induced liver injury in cases of jaundice, even if not previously reported. In addition, it illustrates the potential for adverse outcomes in situations where antibiotics are used inappropriately or where first line antibiotics are not used for routine infections. We report a case of a young male who developed jaundice associated with cefdinir use with pathological confirmation of moderate cholestasis with portal and lobular mixed inflammation and focal bile duct injury consistent with drug-induced liver injury.

### ACG clinical guideline: the diagnosis and management of idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury [^11495hio]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a rare adverse drug reaction and it can lead to jaundice, liver failure, or even death. Antimicrobials and herbal and dietary supplements are among the most common therapeutic classes to cause DILI in the Western world. DILI is a diagnosis of exclusion and thus careful history taking and thorough work-up for competing etiologies are essential for its timely diagnosis. In this ACG Clinical Guideline, the authors present an evidence-based approach to diagnosis and management of DILI with special emphasis on DILI due to herbal and dietary supplements and DILI occurring in individuals with underlying liver disease.

### Ceftriaxone-associated biliary complications of treatment of suspected disseminated Lyme disease – new Jersey, 1990–1992… [^112dJiAa]. CDC (1998). Low credibility.

In June 1992, CDC and the New Jersey Department of Health conducted a telephone survey in both counties of 65 schoolchildren who required home instruction because of suspected LD to determine the public health impact of the disease. Most children had received prolonged and repeated courses of oral antimicrobials and/or home intravenous infusion of antimicrobials; 79% had been hospitalized for treatment of suspected LD or management of treatment complications, most notably drug- induced symptoms of gallbladder disease occurring in patients receiving ceftriaxone, and bloodstream infections associated with intravenous catheters. A case was defined as the occurrence of cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, or a cholecystectomy within 90 days of receiving antimicrobial treatment for LD. Cases were identified through cross-referencing the 1352 patients with codes for biliary disease or cholecystectomy.

When case-patients were compared with controls, risk factors for biliary disease included being aged less than or equal to 18 years, being female, or having a history of treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone. Biliary precipitation of ceftriaxone as a calcium salt is a known cause of sporadic cases of pseudocholelithiasis, frank cholelithiasis, biliary colic, and cholecystitis. Upper abdominal ultrasonography should be considered for patients who develop biliary colic while receiving ceftriaxone. Biliary precipitates of ceftriaxone may be evident sonographically after as few as 4 days of treatment, are possibly dose-related, and are often asymptomatic.

Spontaneous disappearance of these precipitates within 2–63 days following the last dose of ceftriaxone has been documented; discontinuation of ceftriaxone and nonsurgical management of this complication has been recommended.

### Identification and characterization of cefazolin-induced liver injury [^117Qh4Aw]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Cephalosporin antibiotics are popular because they have a broad spectrum of activity and are generally well tolerated; however, cephalosporin-induced liver injury is considered rare. We describe a new syndrome associated with a single intravenous dose of cefazolin and the clinical features of cephalosporin-induced liver injury.

Methods

The Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI) Network collected detailed clinical data on 1212 patients with DILI between 2004 and 2012. We analyzed data from 41 patients in whom cephalosporins were implicated as primary agents of liver disease; 33 formally were adjudicated as having cephalosporin-induced DILI.

Results

Nineteen patients developed clinically apparent DILI after a single intravenous dose of cefazolin. All patients developed self-limited liver injury 3 to 23 days after receiving cefazolin during surgery-often during a minor outpatient procedure. The latency period was 20 days. Clinical features included itching, jaundice, nausea, fever, and rash. Laboratory abnormalities included a mixed or cholestatic pattern of serum enzyme increases. We identified 14 more patients with DILI attributed to other cephalosporins (5 first-generation, 2 second-generation, 6 third-generation, and 1 fourth-generation agent). Although latency and injury patterns were similar for cefazolin and other cephalosporins, the other cephalosporins were associated with more severe courses of injury, including 2 deaths from liver failure.

Conclusions

DILI can develop after a single dose of cefazolin. It is characterized by a latency period of 1 to 3 weeks after exposure, a cholestatic biochemical pattern, and a self-limited moderate to severe clinical course. Other cephalosporins can cause a similar but more severe injury.

### An optimal antibiotic selection framework for sepsis patients using artificial intelligence [^114PNQut]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

We trained and tested OptAB on the electronic health record (EHR) dataset MIMIC-IV, containing over 450.000 admissions to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center of the Harvard medical School including demographics, laboratory values, vital values, medications and diagnosis data. For an independent test set, we compared the disease progression of each individual patient to OptAB's predictions under the same treatment regime as actually received (factual treatment). In addition, we used OptAB to predict disease courses under alternative treatments. We refer to these predictions of the disease progression under alternative and unobserved treatments as counterfactuals.

We focus on the three first-line antibiotics Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone and Piperacillin-Tazobactam recommended for the treatment of Sepsis, where at least 5000 patients of the 26,111 Sepsis patients of the MIMIC-IV dataset are treated with. Data cleaning and patient selection resulted in a training set of 2842 and a test set of 711 Sepsis patients, see the Methods section for details.

Vancomycin is effective against a broad spectrum of gram-positive pathogens, including MRSA. Unfortunately, Vancomycin is renal toxic and can cause acute kidney injuriesand Ceftriaxone is hepatotoxic and can lead to severe liver injuries. To incorporate the current recommendations, we implemented warnings into OptAB against treating patients diagnosed with a creatinine value higher than 2 mg/dl with Vancomycin or (at least) Stage-1 Acute Kidney Injury. According to current guidelinesStage-1 Acute Kidney Injury was defined as either an increase in creatinine of 0.3 mg/dl within 48 h, or an increase of 1.5 times the baseline creatinine within the previous 7 days or an urine output of less than 0.5 ml/kg/h for 6–12 h. Additionally, OptAB warns against administrating Ceftriaxone to patients with elevated alanine transaminase values exceeding 280 U/L indicating toxic liver injuries and liver cell damages or increased bilirubin total values higher than 2.4 mg/dl for men and 2.2 mg/dl for woman indicating jaundice and bile duct inflammation (see Methods for detailed information). These values can be adjusted to meet current guidelines or individual assessments by the physician.

As an external validation, we tested the OptAB model trained on the MIMIC-IV data set on AmsterdamUMCdb containing 23.106 admissions from 2003 to 2016 to the intensive care unit of the Amsterdam University Medical center including detailed EHR data. For ease of exposition, these tests are provided in the Supplementary material.

Special Populations

Average pharmacokinetic parameters of ceftriaxone in healthy subjects, elderly subjects, subjects with renal impairment, and subjects with liver disease are summarized in Table 5. Compared to healthy adult subjects, the pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone were only minimally altered in elderly subjects and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment; therefore, dosage adjustments are not necessary for these patients with ceftriaxone dosages up to 2 g per day. Ceftriaxone was not removed to any significant extent from the plasma by hemodialysis. In 6 of 26 dialysis patients, the elimination rate of ceftriaxone was markedly reduced, suggesting that plasma concentrations of ceftriaxone should be monitored in these patients to determine if dosage adjustments are necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]

TABLE 5: Average Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Ceftriaxone in Humans

Drug Interactions

Interaction with Calcium: Two in vitro studies, one using adult plasma and the other neonatal plasma from umbilical cord blood have been carried out to assess interaction of ceftriaxone and calcium. Ceftriaxone concentrations up to 1 mM (in excess of concentrations achieved in vivo following administration of 2 grams ceftriaxone infused over 30 minutes) were used in combination with calcium concentrations up to 12 mM (48 mg/dL). Recovery of ceftriaxone from plasma was reduced with calcium concentrations of 6 mM (24 mg/dL) or higher in adult plasma or 4 mM (16 mg/dL) or higher in neonatal plasma. This may be reflective of ceftriaxone-calcium precipitation.

### Ceftriaxone-induced encephalopathy in a patient with a normal renal function [^113R88qK]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Table 1 summarises the case reports and the case series. Out of the total 27 patients, 74.1% were 65 years of age or older, 59.3% were females and only 2 (7.4%) had a normal renal function. The median time to onset was 5 days (minimum 2 days, maximum 23 days) and the median time to resolution was 3 days (minimum 1 day, maximum 12 days).

Table 1
Summary of cases

Please note that we decided to exclude one case report because of possible confounding factors not detailed in the reportand one case series because of radically different patient descriptions in the written text and the supplied chart.

The mechanism of cephalosporin neurotoxicity is not completely clear but seems to involve a decrease of γ-aminobutyric acid release from nerve terminals and subsequent increase of excitatory neurotransmission. From a pharmacokinetic point of view, the metabolism of ceftriaxone is negligible and it is eliminated renally (55% of the drug) and through the biliary pathway (45%). In patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, changes in the regular dosage regimens are not required, provided liver function is not impaired. In cases of creatinine clearance less than 10 mL/min periodic monitoring of serum ceftriaxone concentrations is recommended, especially if combined with hepatic insufficiency. A prolonged half-life of elimination is observed in older patients (7.3 ± 1.6 hours in patients aged 18–49 years, 8.3 ± 2.2 hours in patients aged 50–74 years and 14.2 ± 2.9 hours in patients aged 75–92 years). The age-associated changes in half-life appear to result from changes in systemic clearance since the renal and hepatic functions were normal in all these patients. Also, the pharmacokinetics of total plasma ceftriaxone are non-linear: the drug is known for a saturable plasma protein binding within the therapeutic range of up to 200 µg/mL with stable free fraction levels at 5%–10% and significantly higher levels of the free drug in supratherapeutic doses (free fraction at 42% at a plasma level of 653 µg/mL).

### Ceftriaxone sodium [^116xc21k]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of ceftriaxone sodium IM (also known as Easy-Ceft, Rocephin, Ceftrisol Plus):
- **Acute pancreatitis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as ceftriaxone has been associated with an increased risk of acute pancreatitis, possibly due to biliary obstruction, especially in patients with risk factors for biliary stasis or sludge.
- **Antimicrobial resistance**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as the use of ceftriaxone in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.
- C. difficile infection: maintain a high level of suspicion, as nearly all antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, are associated with an increased risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea.
- **Gallbladder abnormalities**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as ceftriaxone has been associated with cases of abnormal gallbladder ultrasound findings, such as sludge or acoustical shadowing, due to the formation of ceftriaxone-calcium salt, which may be misinterpreted as gallstones. Discontinue ceftriaxone if ultrasound findings are observed or symptoms suggesting gallbladder disease develop.
- **Hemolytic anemia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as ceftriaxone has been associated with an increased risk of immune-mediated hemolytic anemia. Discontinue ceftriaxone if anemia develops during treatment until the etiology is determined.
- **Neurological adverse events**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as ceftriaxone has been associated with cases of serious neurological adverse events, including encephalopathy, seizures, myoclonus, and non-convulsive status epilepticus, especially in patients with severe renal impairment.
- **Prolonged PT**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as ceftriaxone has been associated with alterations in PT. Consider obtaining PT monitoring in patients with impaired vitamin K synthesis or low vitamin K stores may require, and administering vitamin K (10 mg weekly) if the PT is prolonged before or during therapy.
- **Urolithiasis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as ceftriaxone has been associated with an increased risk of urolithiasis due to ceftriaxone-calcium precipitation in the urinary tract. Discontinue ceftriaxone if ultrasound findings are observed or symptoms suggesting urolithiasis, oliguria, or renal failure develop.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury [^116urmcs]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Chronic liver disease (CLD) patients — diagnosis, prescribing, and monitoring recommendations for drug-induced liver injury (DILI): As the diagnosis of DILI in patients with CLD requires a high index of suspicion, we recommend exclusion of other more common causes of acute liver injury including a flare-up of the underlying liver disease (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). The decision to use potentially hepatotoxic drugs in CLD patients should be based on the risk vs benefit of the proposed therapy on a case-by-case basis (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). For individuals with known CLD, there are no data to recommend a specific liver biochemistry monitoring plan; patients should be advised to promptly report any new onset symptoms such as scleral icterus, abdominal pain/discomfort, nausea/vomiting, itching, or dark urine, and it is reasonable to monitor serum liver biochemistries at 4–6 weekly intervals, especially during the initial 6 mo of treatment with a potentially hepatotoxic agent (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone were only minimally altered in geriatric patients compared to healthy adult subjects and dosage adjustments are not necessary for geriatric patients with ceftriaxone dosages up to 2 grams per day provided there is no severe renal and hepatic impairment. (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

Influence on Diagnostic Tests:

Influence on Diagnostic Tests:

In patients treated with Ceftriaxone for Injection the Coombs' test may become positive. Ceflriax.one for Injection, like other antibacterial drugs, may result in positive test results for galactosemia. Nonenzymatic methods for the glucose determination in urine may give false positive results. For this reason, urine-glucose determination during therapy with Ceftriaxone for Injection should be done enzymatically. The presence of ceftriaxone may falsely lower estimated blood glucose values obtained with some blood glucose monitoring systems. Please refer to instructions for use for each system. Alternative testing methods should be used if necessary.

5.8 Urolithiasis
and Post-Renal Acute Renal Failure

Ceftriaxone-calcium precipitates in the urinary tract have been observed in patients receiving ceftriaxone and may be detected as sonographic abnormalities. The probability of such precipitates appears to be greatest in pediatric patients. Patients may be asymptomatic or may develop symptoms of urolithiasis, and ureteral obstruction and post-renal acute renal failure. The condition appears to be reversible upon discontinuation of ceftriaxone and institution of appropriate management. Ensure adequate hydration in patients receiving ceftriaxone. Discontinue ceftriaxone in patients who develop signs and symptoms suggestive of urolithiasis, oliguria or renal failure and/or the sonographic findings described above.

5.9 Patients with Hepatic and Renal Impairment

In patients with both hepatic impairment and significant renal disease, Ceftriaxone for Injection and Dextrose Injection dosage should not exceed 2 g daily.

5.10 Pancreatitis

Cases of pancreatitis, possibly secondary to biliary obstruction, have been reported in patients treated with ceftriaxone sodium. Most patients presented with risk factors for biliary stasis and biliary sludge (preceding major therapy, severe illness, total parenteral nutrition). A cofactor role of ceftriaxone-related biliary precipitation cannot be ruled out.

5.11 Development of Drug-resistant Bacteria

Prescribing Ceftriaxone for Injection and Dextrose Injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. As with other antibacterial drugs, use of Ceftriaxone for Injection and Dextrose Injection may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Careful observation of the patient is essential. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.

5.12 Patients with Overt or Known Subclinical Diabetes Mellitus or Carbohydrate Intolerance

As with other dextrose-containing solutions, Ceftriaxone for Injection and Dextrose Injection should be prescribed with caution in patients with overt or known subclinical diabetes mellitus or carbohydrate intolerance for any reason.

5.13 Alterations in Prothrombin Time

Alterations in prothrombin times have occurred in patients treated with ceftriaxone sodium. Patients with impaired vitamin K synthesis or low vitamin K stores (e.g., chronic hepatic disease and malnutrition) may require monitoring of prothrombin time during Ceftriaxone for Injection and Dextrose Injection treatment. Vitamin K administration (10 mg weekly) may be necessary if the prothrombin time is prolonged before or during therapy.

### Cefepime-induced acute liver injury in a 5-year-old boy [^112nKouu]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Cephalosporins are frequently used to treat pediatric infections and are overall well tolerated. Cefepime, a fourth-generation cephalosporin, has an excellent safety profile in pediatrics. We report a rare case of cefepime-induced acute liver injury in a pediatric patient, which resolved after antibiotic discontinuation.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for drug-induced liver injury, more specifically with respect to patterns of injury, AASLD 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that most hepatotoxic drugs cause liver injury within the first 6 months of use but occasionally have longer latency intervals or may even present after drug discontinuation (such as amoxicillin/clavulanate).

### Ceftazidime induced liver injury [^113B495K]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 65-year-old woman with type II diabetes mellitus complicated by non-healing ulcers with recurrent osteomyelitis was admitted for progression of cellulitis after treatment failure with an outpatient course of amoxicillin-clavulanate. She was found to have persistent osteomyelitis and started on ceftazidime for a culture documented Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. After two parenteral doses, she had a rapid rise in liver function tests (LFTs) in a hepatocellular pattern. Due to rapid identification, all medications with potential hepatotoxicity, including ceftazidime, were discontinued and the LFTs promptly returned to baseline over 3days. Of note, the patient did not experience any symptoms of liver injury. Other causes of acute liver injury were effectively ruled out, but the case was confounded by usage of other potential hepatotoxic medications. Still, the most likely culprit was ceftazidime, a rare cause of drug induced liver injury with very few reports in the literature.

### An optimal antibiotic selection framework for sepsis patients using artificial intelligence [^112k6qUg]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Identification of contraindications and patients at high-risk for side-effects

We defined thresholds for laboratory values indicating patients at high risk for side-effects and contraindications. Due to Vancomycin's nephrotoxicity we recommend avoiding treatment with Vancomycin in patients with (at least) stage-1 acute kidney injury or a creatinine value exceeding 2 mg/dl. According to current guidelinesStage-1 Acute Kidney Injury was defined as either an increase in creatinine of 0.3 mg/dl within 48 h, or an increase of 1.5 times the baseline creatinine within the previous 7 days or an urine output of less than 0.5 ml/kg/h for 6–12 h. We include the creatinine value itself as a contraindication, because Vancomycin administration should be avoided not only in cases of acute kidney injury, but also in patients with chronic kidney injuries.

Due to the absence of thresholds indicating hepatotoxic contraindications of Ceftriaxone, OptAB relies on thresholds for discontinuing hepatotoxic drugs in tuberculosis treatment. Treatment with hepatotoxic drugs should be discontinued if the bilirubin total level exceeds twice the upper range (2.4 mg/dl for men and 2.2 mg/dl for women) indicating jaundice and bile duct inflammation, or if the alanine transaminase level exceeds five times the upper range (280 U/L) indicating toxic liver injuries and liver cell damages. These thresholds can be adjusted to meet current guidelines or individual assessments by the physician.

Additionally, we compiled a list of sepsis-associated bacterial pathogens in MIMIC-IV that influence the antibiotic selection of OptAB, ensuring that non-pathogens have no influence on the antibiotic selection process. We focus on samples from abscesses, blood cultures, bronchial washings, bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum, tissue and urine as these are highly associated with Sepsis. The availability of samples from other bodily fluids is limited in MIMIC-IV or their association with Sepsis is negligible. Moreover, we compiled a list of potential fungal and viral pathogens in MIMIC-IV that are frequently associated with Sepsis (see). Unfortunately, AmsterdamUMCdb does not include microbiological data.

Cephalosporin Class Adverse Reactions

In addition to the adverse reactions listed above which have been observed in patients treated with ceftriaxone, the following adverse reactions and altered laboratory test results have been reported for cephalosporin class antibiotics:

Adverse Reactions

Allergic reactions, drug fever, serum sickness-like reaction, renal dysfunction, toxic nephropathy, reversible hyperactivity, hypertonia, hepatic dysfunction including cholestasis, aplastic anemia, hemorrhage, and superinfection.

Altered Laboratory Tests

Positive direct Coombs' test, false-positive test for urinary glucose, and elevated LDH (see PRECAUTIONS).

Several cephalosporins have been implicated in triggering seizures, particularly in patients with renal impairment when the dosage was not reduced (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). If seizures associated with drug therapy occur, the drug should be discontinued. Anticonvulsant therapy can be given if clinically indicated.

### Liver abscesses: pathogenesis, treatment, and ongoing challenges [^112rKtrE]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

Parenteral (non-oral) antibiotic therapy is generally preferred over oral administration to deliver the medication directly into the bloodstream. At present, no randomized clinical trials have specifically assessed the efficacy of various antibiotic regimens for treating KLAs. Consequently, the optimal antibiotic treatment for these infections remains a topic of ongoing debate. Historically, first-generation cephalosporins, with or without aminoglycoside therapy, were commonly selected due to their affordability, effectiveness, and the sensitivity of most hvKp strains that cause KLAs. Cephalosporins combined with aminoglycosides offer synergistic bactericidal activity against certain Gram-negative infections; however, studies have not demonstrated improved clinical outcomes compared to cephalosporins monotherapy, for the treatment of KLAs. Additionally, the use of aminoglycosides carries a risk of nephrotoxicity, which may outweigh any theoretical benefit, particularly in critically ill patients. More recently, thirdgeneration cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone are used to treat KLAs due to their increased stability to β-lactamases and extended half-life for once daily dosing. Additionally, ceftriaxone has a dual mechanism of elimination (through both the liver and kidney), which allows for treatment of patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction. However, even when KLAs are treated with antibiotics deemed appropriate based on in vitro susceptibility testing, outcomes are inconsistent. In some cases, antibiotic therapy combined with drainage effectively resolved the KLA. In other cases, antibiotic therapy with drainage failed to resolve the abscess or fever, necessitating surgical removal of the infected liver tissue even in otherwise healthy individuals. The reasons for these contrasting outcomes are not well understood but could depend on a variety of factors including penetration of the drugs to the site of infection, antagonism of antibiotics by factors encountered at the infection site, or the metabolic state of the bacteria within the abscess (Fig. 1), described in more detail below.
