## Question

Do you perform an MRI without contrast for the right musculoskeletal region?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether an MRI without contrast should be performed for a right‑sided musculoskeletal issue, essentially asking if a non‑contrast MSK MRI is appropriate when the clinical problem is on the right side. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether laterality affects MRI protocol or if the indication drives the need for contrast. Then, I should verify what high‑credibility guidelines say about contrast use in common MSK scenarios. Next, I will examine evidence on the safety and diagnostic yield of starting with non‑contrast MRI. After that, I need to identify the specific situations where contrast changes management. Finally, I will apply this to a concise, clinically actionable answer while checking for edge cases and patient‑specific factors.

> Let me first confirm the core principle: side does not determine protocol; the clinical question does. Wait, let me verify whether major guidelines tie contrast use to indication rather than laterality — yes, ACR Appropriateness Criteria consistently frame MRI selection as "with or without IV contrast" based on the suspected pathology and red flags rather than the side of symptoms, which supports focusing on the indication rather than right vs. left [^113sgg8c] [^114BHk1j].

> I need to ensure I am aligning with the overarching contrast principle. The ESMRMB Gadolinium Research and Education Committee emphasizes that gadolinium should be used only when it is likely to influence clinical decision‑making, with optimization to the lowest reasonable dose, meaning contrast should be justified by an expected change in management rather than used by default; hold on, I should verify that this applies across MSK contexts — it does, and it dovetails with ACR indication‑based recommendations rather than blanket contrast use [^116yk9jo] [^113sgg8c].

> Next, I should review whether starting with non‑contrast MRI leads to missed diagnoses or recalls. I recall a 0.5% recall rate in a large automatic protocolling series, but wait, let me verify that number; looking back, the recall rate was actually about 0.25% and did not increase after implementing automatic protocolling for non‑contrast joint MRIs, suggesting non‑contrast is safe and efficient for most joint indications, with minimal need to come back for contrast; similarly, a decade‑long recall audit showed recalls were rare and often due to technical or protocol errors rather than missed need for contrast, which reassures me that an initial non‑contrast strategy is sound for most routine MSK referrals [^114BHk1j] [^1142juBK].

> Now, I will identify the scenarios where contrast adds value and could alter management. Hold on, I should verify each: for suspected musculoskeletal or spinal infection, ACR supports MRI with or without IV contrast, but contrast helps define abscesses and phlegmon when suspected or when unenhanced images are equivocal; I initially thought ACR always mandates contrast here — wait, that's not accurate, as "with or without" is the initial recommendation, with contrast tailored to question and findings; for soft‑tissue masses suspicious for neoplasm, contrast is typically valuable for characterization and staging; for inflammatory arthritides, especially when synovitis assessment matters, post‑contrast fat‑suppressed T1 can increase sensitivity; in certain postoperative assessments, contrast can help distinguish scar from recurrent disease, particularly in the spine and sometimes around tendons or post‑repair tissue, so I need to keep these as exceptions where contrast is often justified [^117C5gj9] [^1178KmLm] [^112oFc84] [^113yrQnw].

> Conversely, I should double‑check that for common degenerative or traumatic internal derangements — meniscal tears, rotator cuff tendinopathy, ligament sprains, typical labral pathology without high suspicion for tumor or infection — non‑contrast MRI is usually sufficient, and this is consistent with ACR guidance for spine and general MSK scenarios where "MRI with or without contrast" is appropriate and contrast is not routinely required; let me reconsider if there is any situation here where I'd up‑front choose contrast — generally no, unless history or prior imaging raises infection, neoplasm, or inflammatory synovitis as the primary question [^113sgg8c] [^113oyNgG].

> But wait, what if the question is specifically labral tears in the hip or shoulder — do I need arthrography instead of routine MRI? I need to check: direct MR arthrography can increase sensitivity for labral pathology compared with conventional MRI, though high‑resolution non‑contrast MRI at 1.5–3T can still achieve reasonable sensitivity in many centers; choice depends on pretest probability, institutional protocols, and whether the added sensitivity would change management, so I should tailor this if labral pathology is strongly suspected or prior non‑contrast MRI is equivocal [^116QQSwX].

> I should confirm patient‑specific safety and context. In reduced renal function, pregnancy, or when patients wish to avoid gadolinium, it is prudent to favor non‑contrast protocols when the indication permits; the ESMRMB GREC also highlights appropriateness, community access, and environmental considerations when deciding on GBCA use, reinforcing that non‑contrast should be the default unless diagnostic gain is expected to change care; hold on, let me verify that these are considered moderate‑level recommendations — they are, but they align with widely adopted best practices [^116yk9jo].

> Let me also think operationally. Many tertiary centers have adopted default non‑contrast joint protocols with auto‑protocolling to improve efficiency without increasing missed diagnoses, and decision‑support or machine‑learning tools can help triage tumor‑suspected cases to contrast protocols accurately; I should emphasize that local protocols and radiologist oversight remain essential, but the evidence supports a non‑contrast‑first approach for most routine MSK requests [^114BHk1j] [^113Pcwrd].

> Putting this together, I should state the answer clearly while reflecting the nuance. Yes, for most right‑sided musculoskeletal complaints, an MRI without contrast is the appropriate first‑line examination; reserve IV contrast for specific indications where it adds clinically actionable information — suspected infection, neoplasm, clinically important synovitis in inflammatory arthritis, or selected postoperative scenarios — and otherwise proceed non‑contrast as the default since laterality does not change the protocol and guidelines support indication‑based contrast use [^113sgg8c] [^117C5gj9] [^113oyNgG] [^116yk9jo] [^114BHk1j].

Yes, **MRI without contrast is standard for most musculoskeletal (MSK) imaging** [^114BHk1j], including routine evaluation of internal derangement, tendons, ligaments [^11436asj], cartilage, and bone marrow edema [^113hvAKm]. Contrast is reserved for suspected or known **tumor, infection, or specific inflammatory conditions** [^1178KmLm] [^117C5gj9] [^112fYq9b], and is not needed for routine joint [^11436asj], spine [^113sgg8c], or soft-tissue injury assessment [^114BHk1j]. Non-contrast MRI is accurate for most MSK pathology [^112MGvnG], with contrast added only when it will change management [^112JTZrX] [^116yk9jo].

---

## Indications for non-contrast MRI in musculoskeletal imaging

Non-contrast MRI is appropriate for **most routine MSK indications** [^114BHk1j] [^115gfjP5], such as:

- **Internal derangement**: Meniscal [^113hywvg], ligamentous, and cartilage injuries [^11436asj].
- **Tendon and ligament pathology**: Tendinopathy [^112MGvnG], partial/full-thickness tears, and ligament injuries [^113hvAKm].
- **Bone marrow edema and stress fractures**: Detection of marrow edema [^113hvAKm] and occult fractures.
- **Degenerative joint disease**: Osteoarthritis [^113hywvg] and degenerative changes.
- **Soft tissue masses**: Initial characterization of benign-appearing lesions [^1178KmLm].
- **Spine imaging**: Routine evaluation of disc herniation [^113sgg8c], spinal stenosis [^113oyNgG], and degenerative changes [^114BHk1j].

---

## Clinical scenarios where contrast is not required

Contrast is generally **not required** in the following scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Routine joint imaging | - Knee [^11436asj] <br/> - Shoulder <br/> - Hip <br/> - Ankle <br/> - Wrist [^114BHk1j] |
| Tendon and ligament injuries | - Rotator cuff tears [^112MGvnG] <br/> - ACL injuries <br/> - Achilles tendon ruptures [^113hvAKm] |
| Degenerative joint disease | - Osteoarthritis [^113hywvg] <br/> - Degenerative disc disease |

## Clinical scenarios where contrast may be beneficial

Contrast-enhanced MRI is **beneficial** in specific clinical scenarios, including:

- **Suspected or known tumors**: Differentiation of benign vs malignant lesions, assessment of tumor extent, and evaluation of recurrence [^1178KmLm] [^114BHk1j].
- **Infection**: Osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, and soft tissue abscesses [^117C5gj9] [^116xjzM6].
- **Inflammatory conditions**: Rheumatoid arthritis, synovitis, and other inflammatory arthropathies [^112JTZrX] [^112oFc84].
- **Postoperative evaluation**: Differentiation of scar tissue from recurrent disease or infection [^113yrQnw] [^114BHk1j].

---

## Diagnostic accuracy of non-contrast MRI

Non-contrast MRI provides **high diagnostic accuracy** for most MSK conditions:

- **Internal derangement**: High sensitivity and specificity for meniscal, ligamentous, and cartilage injuries [^113hywvg] [^11436asj].
- **Tendon and ligament pathology**: Accurate detection of partial and full-thickness tears [^112MGvnG].
- **Bone marrow edema and stress fractures**: Highly sensitive for marrow edema and occult fractures [^113hvAKm].
- **Degenerative joint disease**: Accurate assessment of osteoarthritis and degenerative changes [^113hywvg].

---

## Limitations of non-contrast MRI

Non-contrast MRI has **limitations** in certain scenarios, including a reduced ability to differentiate benign from malignant lesions during tumor characterization [^1178KmLm]; difficulty distinguishing infection from inflammation or postoperative changes [^116xjzM6]; and limited sensitivity for detecting subtle synovitis or other inflammatory changes [^112JTZrX]. These limitations can reduce diagnostic confidence in these settings.

---

## Safety considerations

Non-contrast MRI is generally **safe**, but clinicians should anticipate potential artifacts and safety issues with certain metal implants [^116VnKXF], claustrophobia that may necessitate sedation or alternative imaging [^112sfNAc], and motion artifacts from patient movement that can degrade image quality. These factors may affect image quality and patient tolerance and should be accounted for during planning and positioning.

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **routine use of non-contrast MRI** for most MSK imaging scenarios [^114BHk1j]. They recommend selective use of contrast, reserved for specific clinical indications such as tumors, infections, and inflammatory conditions [^116yk9jo], with a patient-specific approach in which clinical history and examination guide imaging decisions [^112JTZrX].

### Automatic protocolling of non-contrast musculoskeletal MRIs does not result in increase in patient recall rates for contrast-enhanced studies [^114BHk1j]. Academic Radiology (2024). High credibility.

Physicians spend large amounts of time protocolling imaging studies, which limits their ability to focus on other essential clinical tasks. Most musculoskeletal (MSK) MRI studies are conducted for the evaluation of joint pain and internal derangements and typically do not require intravenous contrast. In contrast, contrast-enhanced MRI studies are used for evaluating infections, suspected or established tumors, and rheumatological conditions. Protocolling all MSK MRI studies detracts from other critical tasks during the workday. Routine joint MRI scans follow an established set of sequences and can be scheduled and performed without specific protocols by radiologists. At our large tertiary care center equipped with multiple MRI magnets, we implemented a process of automated protocoling and scheduling for non-contrast joint MRI scans ordered by referring physicians. This project's purpose was to evaluate the impact of this newly introduced process of 'automatic protocoling and scheduling' of MSK MRI scans on the rate of overlooked MRI exams that might have required contrast examinations, as well as on the patient recall rate for follow-up post-contrast sequences needed for further diagnostic characterization.

All MSK MRI reports from the last two months of the years preceding and following the implementation of automatic protocolling (intervention) were reviewed for indications related to neoplasms, infections, and rheumatological conditions. For each of these three disease categories, we identified the number of MRIs conducted with and without contrast.

The patient summary emphasizes that MRI contrast agents generally have an excellent safety profile. However, in some clinical contexts, the intravenous injection of a contrast agent does not add any information and could be avoided. The use of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) must be justified in terms of benefit/risk ratio and optimized to the lowest dose achievable without losing diagnostic information. Next-generation contrast agents show promise in obtaining comparable diagnostic efficacy and safety with lower doses.

### High-resolution 3D turbo spin-echo wrist MRI at 7T accelerated by compressed sensing [^113hvAKm]. NMR in Biomedicine (2025). High credibility.

MRI has proven to be a very effective imaging modality to visualize the small and complex structures within the musculoskeletal (MSK) system, employing various contrasts to detect and monitor pathologies. For the assessment of fluid accumulation and disease-related edematous alterations in ligaments, tendons, articular cartilage, and fibrocartilage, fat-suppressed (FS) proton density (PD)-weighted turbo spin-echo (TSE) sequences are predominantly employed.

On the other hand, nonfat-suppressed (NFS) PD-weighted TSE sequences play a crucial role in enhancing the assessment of FS images. They are particularly helpful for anatomical interpretation, as the natural fat planes between structures such as tendons, ligaments, and the joint capsule remain visible, facilitating the differentiation of adjacent tissues.

NFS TSE sequences also offer improved visualization of bone and bone marrow infiltration. Because spin-echo sequences are less prone to susceptibility-related trabecular broadening, which becomes more severe with increasing field strength, NFS TSE imaging is of particular value in the assessment of trabecular bone structures. In this context, 3D isotropic high-resolution imaging proves advantageous, facilitating multiplanar reconstruction that allows radiologists to optimally visualize the intricate anatomy of the wrist.

### ESR essentials: gadolinium-wise MRI-practice recommendations by the European Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine and Biology [^112fYq9b]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

For safety procedures regarding the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs), refer to ESUR-CMSC guidelines. Thinking beyond single-patient safety, the choice of intravenous injection of GBCA in radiology should also incorporate MRI cost-effectiveness, MRI access to the patient community, and impact on the environment. Multi-society joint statements and cooperative actions are recommended to increase awareness of the consequences of inefficient use of GBCA.

Use of GBCAs is justified only when appropriate or when it can potentially influence clinical decisions, based on the patient's history and pre-MRI clinical assessment. The evidence level is moderate — several recommendations exist, but further research is necessary to increase confidence.

GBCA standard dose is 0.1 mmol/kg body weight for most applications of gadobutrol, gadoterate meglumine, and gadoteridol; 0.05 mmol/kg body weight for liver imaging using gadobenate dimeglumine, and 0.025 mmol/kg body weight for liver imaging using gadoxetate disodium. Dose optimization is recommended, as administering a lower-than-standard dose can still provide equally effective diagnostic information. Virtual contrast-enhancement with zero-dose is unlikely to reflect pharmacokinetic events. The evidence level for this is moderate — further research is necessary, and lowering the dose can still affect diagnostic yield under specific circumstances.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® suspected spine infection [^117C5gj9]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for vertebral osteomyelitis, the ACR 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining spinal MRI with or without IV contrast as the initial imaging in patients with suspected spinal infection (including discitis and osteomyelitis) in the following situations:

- **New or worsening back or neck pain**: With or without fever, likely having any red flags such as diabetes mellitus, IV drug use, cancer, HIV, or dialysis, or abnormal laboratory findings.
- **History of recent intervention**: Such as surgery with or without hardware, pain injection, or stimulator implantation.
- **New neurologic deficit or cauda equina syndrome**.

- **Decubitus ulcer or wound overlying spine**.

- **Abnormal radiography or CT findings**: Usually appropriate.

### The osteoarthritis initiative: Report on the design rationale for the magnetic resonance imaging protocol for the knee [^115gpe4t]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2008). Low credibility.

To report on the process and criteria for selecting acquisition protocols to include in the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study protocol for the knee, candidate knee MR acquisition protocols identified from the literature were first optimized at 3 Tesla (T). Twelve knees from ten subjects were scanned one time with each of 16 acquisitions considered most likely to achieve the study goals and having the best optimization results. The resultant images and multi-planar reformats were evaluated for artifacts and structural discrimination of articular cartilage at the cartilage-fluid, cartilage-fat, cartilage-capsule, cartilage-meniscus, and cartilage-cartilage interfaces.

The five acquisitions comprising the final OAI MRI protocol were assembled based on the study goals for the imaging protocol, the image evaluation results, and the need to image both knees within a 75-minute time slot, including positioning. For quantitative cartilage morphometry, fat-suppressed, 3D dual-echo in steady state (DESS) acquisitions appear to provide the best universal cartilage discrimination.

The OAI knee MRI protocol provides imaging data on multiple articular structures and features relevant to knee osteoarthritis (OA) that will support a broad range of existing and anticipated measurement methods while balancing requirements for high image quality and consistency against the practical considerations of a large multi-center cohort study. Strengths of the final knee MRI protocol include cartilage quantification capabilities in three planes.

### Imaging of the knee in juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^114LCPGs]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging: Within the last decade, the use of MRI and advances in MRI techniques have substantially improved the evaluation of joint pathologies in children with JIA. MRI is the preferred imaging modality for the assessment of inflammatory and destructive changes in JIA compared to conventional radiography, ultrasonography, and physical examination. Furthermore, MRI is the only imaging modality useful in visualizing bone marrow changes, a potential predictor of erosive joint damage in JIA as previously demonstrated in adults. Therefore, despite practical limitations, MRI holds the potential to become an important outcome measure for assessing the knee joint in clinical trials of children with JIA.
- **Main MRI features and imaging protocol**: In children with JIA and knee involvement, the main imaging features include synovial thickening, joint effusion, and bone marrow oedema. Moreover, cartilage loss and bone erosions — although relatively rare in pediatric patients — can be observed. Tendinopathy, enthesopathy, inhomogeneity of the infra-patellar fat pad, and bone cysts can also be seen, although these abnormalities are relatively uncommon in the knee joint. Moreover, the reliability of scoring these secondary features is unsatisfactory.

- **Knee MRI protocol**:

*mDixon best option if available*

FS fat-suppressed, Gd gadolinium, PD proton density, STIR short tau inversion recovery, T1 T1-weighted spin echo, T2 T2-weighted.

Synovial inflammation leading to synovial thickening is the primary feature observed in MRI evaluations of the knee in JIA patients.

### Soft tissue tumor imaging in adults: European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology-Guidelines 2023-overview, and primary local imaging: how and where [^1178KmLm]. European Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Our consensus has several limitations. The panelists were exclusively from European countries, yet access to MRI is limited in many other parts of the world. In these areas, US and — if accessible — CT must replace MRI. Additionally, MRI contrast agents may be prohibitively expensive. Our guidelines account for these factors only to a certain extent. Tumor reference centers may be too distant, and teleradiologic consultation may not be available. In less-developed countries, only certain parts of this consensus are currently applicable. However, it is anticipated that these guidelines will provide added impetus to healthcare professionals in these regions to canvass and optimize resources for better patient outcomes.

The Delphi method itself has limitations. Firstly, it depends on the expertise of the panelists. This was largely mitigated by including only ESSR-approved tumor specialists. Secondly, open discussion potential is limited, though this allows for the distribution of critical remarks anonymously, reducing bias from dominant participants. Thirdly, the process was time-consuming, a disadvantage that has been noted for guidelines containing multiple statements, such as our consensus. As the Delphi process requires commitment to participate in several rounds of questionnaires, we aimed to provide sufficient time for participants to respond.

Finally, it is important to emphasize that these guidelines reflect current knowledge and will require further updates in the future.

### Dynamic MRI for articulating joint evaluation on 1.5 T and 3.0 T scanners: setup, protocols, and real-time sequences [^1153wVPK]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive method that can be used to increase the understanding of the pathomechanics of joints. Various types of real-time gradient echo sequences used for dynamic MRI acquisition of joints include balanced steady-state free precession sequence, radiofrequency-spoiled sequence, and ultra-fast gradient echo sequence. Due to their short repetition time and echo time, these sequences provide high temporal resolution, a good signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution, and soft tissue contrast. The prerequisites of the evaluation of joints with dynamic MRI include suitable patient installation and optimal positioning of the joint in the coil to allow joint movement, sometimes with dedicated coil support. There are currently few recommendations in the literature regarding appropriate protocol, sequence standardizations, and diagnostic criteria for the use of real-time dynamic MRI to evaluate joints. This article summarizes the technical parameters of these sequences from various manufacturers on 1.5T and 3.0T MRI scanners. We have reviewed pertinent details of the patient and coil positioning for dynamic MRI of various joints. The indications and limitations of dynamic MRI of joints are discussed.

### Contrast-enhanced CT techniques and MRI perform equally well in arthritis imaging of the hand: A prospective diagnostic accuracy study [^116wRKiV]. European Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Early detection of synovitis and tenosynovitis is of major interest in the field of arthritis imaging, as early treatment is needed to prevent irreversible bone and joint destruction. This early intervention contributes to the preservation of joint functionality and improves patients' quality of life. It requires standardized and readily available imaging methods that enable reliable exclusion of differential diagnoses, justifying the expensive anti-inflammatory therapy.

The standard for arthritis diagnosis includes sensitive imaging methods such as musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), each with known advantages and disadvantages. Due to its relatively low specificity, MRI is no longer the modality of first choice. Its use is now mostly restricted to the quantification of inflammatory changes in clinical trials. MSUS, being more readily available, can be utilized by clinicians during office hours and provides higher spatial resolution than MRI. For these reasons, it has become the method of first choice for diagnosing early arthritis.

Conventional computed tomography (CT) has historically played a subordinate role in the diagnosis of arthritis. However, dual-energy CT (DECT) has emerged as a valuable tool for diagnosing gouty arthritis. Both techniques, however, are limited in assessing active inflammation. Recent developments, such as CT subtraction (CT-S) and the generation of iodine maps (iMap) from DECT, can detect contrast agent uptake in active soft tissue inflammation in joints with sufficient diagnostic accuracy.

### Moderate value of non-contrast magnetic resonance imaging after non-dislocating shoulder trauma [^113NPmEc]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2016). Low credibility.

The purpose of the present study was to determine the value of shoulder magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) obtained in the community setting and interpreted by musculoskeletal radiologists in patients with shoulder pain initiated by a single non-dislocating shoulder trauma.

In 56 of 61 consecutive patients who underwent shoulder arthroscopy due to pain following a single non-dislocating shoulder trauma, the data sets of non-contrast MRI were complete. These were retrospectively interpreted by three radiologists specialized in musculoskeletal MRI who were blinded to patients' history and did not have access to the reports of arthroscopy. Standard evaluation forms were used to assess the MRIs for superior labrum anterior and posterior (SLAP) lesions, anterior or posterior labrum lesions, lesions of the long head of biceps tendon (LHB), and for partial tears of the supraspinatus tendon and the upper quarter of the subscapularis tendon. Quality of the MRI was assessed by each radiologist on a four-point scale.

The pooled sensitivity for the three radiologists for the detection of SLAP lesions was 45.0%, for anterior or posterior labrum tears 77.8% and 66.7%, for lesions of the LHB 63.2%, and for partial tears of the supraspinatus or subscapularis tendon tears 84.8% and 33.3%. Corresponding inter-rater reliabilities ranged from poor (SLAP lesions) to substantial (anterior labrum tears). Quality of MRI only influenced the accuracy for the detection of posterior labrum tears.

A non-contrast shoulder MRI obtained in the community setting after non-dislocating shoulder trauma provides moderate diagnostic value, with varying sensitivity and inter-rater reliability depending on the specific type of lesion being assessed. However, the quality of the MRI affects its accuracy in certain cases.

### Pediatric musculoskeletal MRI: Basic principles to optimize success [^112sfNAc]. Pediatric Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

This general review aims to suggest practical strategies for optimizing musculoskeletal MR imaging in children. Changes related to ossification and marrow transformation affect the MRI appearance during development. The review summarizes the normal appearance of the growing skeleton on various pulse sequences and discusses ways to optimize imaging parameters. Appropriate patient positioning, choice of field of view, and imaging coils are essential. Various tools, including intravenous contrast agent administration, fat suppression, and parallel imaging, can enhance the depiction of abnormalities, increase imaging speed, and improve the overall quality of the study. Finally, special considerations for imaging at 3 T are also reviewed.

### MRI techniques: a review and update for the orthopaedic surgeon [^112MGvnG]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2012). Low credibility.

MRI plays a critical role in all orthopaedic practices. A basic working knowledge of the most commonly used pulse sequences in musculoskeletal imaging and the appearance of normal tissues on those sequences is essential for confident MRI interpretation. The orthopaedic surgeon should be familiar with the appropriate use of intravenous and intra-articular contrast, as well as its limitations. Key concepts in MRI interpretation include image contrast and resolution, signal, noise, and pulse sequence. Recent advances in anatomic and functional imaging underscore the robust potential of MRI for musculoskeletal evaluation. As MRI technology evolves, the orthopaedic surgeon must stay informed on these technological advancements to utilize this tool to its fullest potential.

### Bilateral magnetic resonance imaging findings in individuals with unilateral shoulder pain [^115ociuN]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly used to diagnose structural abnormalities in the shoulder. However, subsequent findings may not be the source of symptoms. The aim of this study was to determine comparative MRI findings across both shoulders of individuals with unilateral shoulder symptoms.
- **Materials and methods**: We prospectively evaluated 123 individuals from the community who had self-reported unilateral shoulder pain with no signs of adhesive capsulitis, no substantial range-of-motion deficit, no history of upper-limb fractures, no repeated shoulder dislocations, and no neck-related pain. Images in the coronal, sagittal, and axial planes with T1, T2, and proton density sequences were generated and independently and randomly interpreted by two examiners: a board-certified, fellowship-trained orthopedic shoulder surgeon and a musculoskeletal radiologist. Absolute and relative frequencies for each MRI finding were calculated and compared between symptomatic and asymptomatic shoulders. Agreement between the shoulder surgeon and the radiologist was also determined.
- **Results**: Abnormal MRI findings were highly prevalent in both shoulders. Only the frequencies of full-thickness tears in the supraspinatus tendon and glenohumeral osteoarthritis were higher (approximately 10%) in the symptomatic shoulder according to the surgeon's findings. Agreement between the musculoskeletal radiologist and shoulder surgeon ranged from slight to moderate (0.00–0.51).
- **Conclusion**: Most abnormal MRI findings were not different in frequency between symptomatic and asymptomatic shoulders.

### Double inversion recovery MRI versus contrast-enhanced MRI for evaluation of knee synovitis in juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^111UtkqU]. Insights into Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

Based on the consensus statement by a multidisciplinary expert group, the included children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) were subdivided into two subgroups: 'presence of knee arthritis' and 'absence of knee arthritis'. The panel consisted of pediatric rheumatologists, a pediatric rheumatology nurse, and radiologists.

During bimonthly multidisciplinary team sessions, the expert group discussed the clinical data — age, sex, medical history, JIA subtype, disease course, treatment effect, physical examination findings, and laboratory results — and imaging results, including ultrasound, conventional radiography, and pre- and post-contrast MRI, of each child and subsequently determined whether knee arthritis was present or not. Double inversion recovery (DIR) images were not available during the meetings. Participant categorization preceded study image analysis.

Images were obtained using a 3.0-T Ingenia MRI scanner (Philips Medical Systems) equipped with a dedicated knee coil. Participants were situated in a supine position with the knee placed centrally in the magnetic field. The standard knee MRI scanning protocol included three-dimensional fat-saturated T1- and T2-weighted scans before contrast administration, and three-dimensional post-contrast fat-saturated T1-weighted scans. The post-contrast fat-saturated T1-weighted scans, obtained less than five minutes after intravenous gadolinium injection (0.1 mg/kg body weight; gadobutrol; Schering AG), were used for image analysis.

### Can gadolinium contrast agents be replaced with saline for direct MR arthrography of the hip? A pilot study with arthroscopic comparison [^113rRPP5]. European Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

Direct magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) of the hip is widely considered the diagnostic gold standard for the detection of intra-articular lesions in patients with hip deformities such as hip dysplasia or femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). The desired effect of joint distension is usually achieved with an intra-articular injection of highly diluted gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA). This procedure is reportedly safe, being associated with minimal postprocedural pain secondary to an inflammatory response to the contrast agent and rarely leading to allergic reactions.

There has been mounting evidence that GBCA administration at systemic dose levels leads to gadolinium deposition in the body. Yet, at the time of writing, GBCA deposition on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has not been reported in the two studies where MRI subsequent to intra-articular injection of highly diluted GBCA was performed. There has been controversy surrounding potentially chondrotoxic effects related to the intra-articular injection of GBCA. Coupled with the costs of GBCA, patient concerns exist, which can lead to prolonged preprocedural informed consent consultations.

Reducing costs and patient concerns along with improving patient safety would yield medical and economic benefits alike. Previously, the suitability of alternative agents for direct MRA, mostly using physiologic saline solutions, has been evaluated for the shoulder and the elbow. Comparable diagnostic accuracy in detecting rotator cuff and glenoid labrum lesions was reported for saline and GBCA-MRA of the shoulder and elbow.

### CT of the musculoskeletal system: What is left in the days of MRI [^1169tmMW]. European Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a central role in the modern imaging of musculoskeletal disorders due to its ability to produce multiplanar images and accurately characterize soft tissues. However, computed tomography (CT) still has an important role to play, not merely as an alternative to MRI, but as the preferred imaging investigation in some situations.

This article briefly reviews the history of CT technology, the technical factors involved, and a number of applications, as well as future areas where CT may be employed. The advent of ever-increasing numbers of rows of detectors has opened up more possible uses for CT technology. However, diagnostic images may be obtained from CT systems with four rows of detectors or more, and their ability to produce near-isotropic voxels and therefore multiplanar reformats.

Fluid-sensitive sequences can vary considerably, and the choice of weighting must be adjusted according to the scanner and local preference of the reporting radiologist. In acute knee trauma, an MRI should always be accompanied by a radiograph or computed tomography of the knee to avoid missing small bony avulsions. If bone marrow pathology is detected first on MRI, radiographs or CT may be performed to supplement the MRI if the diagnosis is uncertain. This should not be misinterpreted as "radiographs are unnecessary" or that MRI of the knee should be the first modality regardless of clinical indication. The level of evidence of recommendation is 4/Low.
- **Clinical indications for knee MRI**: The optimal use of MRI is best decided in conjunction with key local stakeholders, but there are some overarching principles. MRI of the knee is indicated in acute knee trauma with suspected internal derangement and during posttraumatic assessment. It is also indicated in clinically unexplained chronic knee pain when prior radiographs are non-diagnostic. Some imaging centres vary their knee MRI protocols according to the clinical query. However, although clinical history improves MRI diagnostics, important incidental or concomitant findings may be missed if all structures are not routinely evaluated.
- **Basic image assessment**: The assessment should include evaluation of the menisci (including roots), ligamentous structures and tendons, cartilage, bone and bone marrow, soft tissues, bursae, and femorotibial and patellar alignment, as well as any incidental findings.

### Contrast-enhanced MRI findings of the knee in healthy children; establishing normal values [^115kKd1f]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

In this study, we defined normative standards for the knee of healthy children using contrast-enhanced MRI. We showed that the normal synovial membrane is maximally 1.8 mm thick and that some joint fluid and bone marrow changes suggestive of bone marrow oedema in the apex patellae can be seen in healthy children without arthritis.

Within the past decade, the use of MRI and advances in MRI techniques have substantially improved the evaluation of joint abnormalities in JIA patients. Currently, MRI is considered to be the state-of-the-art imaging technique in this respect. Although MRI has previously been shown to be more sensitive than physical examination in the detection of joint inflammation, the correct and accurate interpretation of the images is hampered by a lack of normative data for the knee. The lack of normal values complicates the distinction between the normal appearance of joints in children and the pathology present in JIA, as recently also reported for the wrists of healthy children.

### Soft tissue tumor imaging in adults: European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology-guidelines 2023-overview, and primary local imaging: how and where [^113ehcYm]. European Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Primary diagnosis and local imaging are crucial for the effective management of suspected soft tissue tumors. A standardized checklist, primarily filled out by the patient and discussed with the radiologist, is advisable. Both the patient and the referring clinician should be prepared to provide previous imaging if available.

Comprehensive information about the patient's clinical symptoms and examination findings should be readily accessible to the radiologist. It is essential for both the clinician and the radiologist to consider the patient's medical history, including recent trauma, anticoagulation, previous surgery, or radiation therapy. Notably, patients might attribute recent trauma to tumor development, which could be misleading. Ensuring that the diagnostic process is not delayed while obtaining this information is crucial.

The patient or referring clinician should be inquired about if, where, and when previous imaging was performed. Prior imaging studies and their respective radiological reports should be made available to the assessing radiologist if they exist.

- **Ultrasound (US) triage**: US is considered the appropriate initial triage imaging modality for a suspected soft tissue tumor, especially if the tumor is accessible by US and small (< 5 cm). When a US diagnosis is not definitive, it is recommended to refer the patient for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or further diagnostic procedures.

### Quantitative MRI for evaluation of musculoskeletal disease: Cartilage and muscle composition, joint inflammation, and biomechanics in osteoarthritis [^116Sodn9]. Investigative Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a valuable tool for evaluating musculoskeletal disease as it offers a range of image contrasts sensitive to underlying tissue biochemical composition and microstructure. Although MRI can provide high-resolution, information-rich images suitable for musculoskeletal applications, most MRI utilization remains in qualitative evaluation. Quantitative MRI (qMRI) provides additional value beyond qualitative assessment via objective metrics that support disease characterization, disease progression monitoring, or therapy response.

In this review, musculoskeletal qMRI techniques are summarized with a focus on those developed for osteoarthritis evaluation. Cartilage compositional MRI methods are described, with a detailed discussion on relaxometric mapping (T2, T2✱, T1ρ) without contrast agents.
- **Methods to assess inflammation**: Perfusion imaging, volume and signal changes, contrast-enhanced T1 mapping, and semiquantitative scoring systems are described.

- **Quantitative characterization of structure and function**: Bone shape modeling and joint kinematics are addressed.
- **Muscle evaluation by qMRI**: Includes size (area, volume), relaxometric mapping (T1, T2, T1ρ), fat fraction quantification, diffusion imaging, and metabolic assessment by 31P-MR and creatine chemical exchange saturation transfer.

Other notable technologies to support qMRI in musculoskeletal evaluation are described, including magnetic resonance fingerprinting, ultrashort echo time imaging, and ultrahigh-field MRI.

### 7 tesla and beyond: Advanced methods and clinical applications in magnetic resonance imaging [^115LZRYc]. Investigative Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Besides recent approval for clinical applications in neuroradiology, 7 T scanners have been approved for selected musculoskeletal (MSK) applications in both the United States and the European Union. High-resolution spin echo and GRE-based pulse sequences have been applied at 7 T to assess trabecular bone microarchitecture with improved visualization of anatomical substructures and quantitative measures of both bone volume fraction and marrow volume fraction. High spatial resolution is mandatory to visualize trabecular bone morphology because the average diameter of the individual trabeculae is on the order of 100 to 150 μm.

Magnetic resonance images of the distal tibia acquired in vivo with FIESTA-C at 7 T and 3 T are depicted. The enhanced visualization of trabecular bone structure at 7 T is well demonstrated by these images. Please note that, although the same sequence is used, chemical shift and susceptibility artifacts are enhanced at 7 T, shown by thicker appearing trabeculae and at the muscle/fat interface. Also, the image contrast and signal of muscle and fat are different at 7 T and 3 T.

For ankle MRI, Juras et al. showed that both SNR (3D GRE) and CNR (2D turbo spin echo [TSE] and 2D GRE) significantly increase from 3 T to 7 T and therefore inferred a substantial diagnostic benefit using UHF. The diagnostic performance of 7 T versus 3 T in the detection of joint pathologies has been assessed by Springer et al. in 40 patients with knee pain.

### Efficiency improvement in a busy radiology practice: Determination of musculoskeletal magnetic resonance imaging protocol using deep-learning convolutional neural networks [^113Pcwrd]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

The purposes of this study are to evaluate the feasibility of protocol determination with a convolutional neural networks (CNN) classifier based on short-text classification and to evaluate the agreements by comparing protocols determined by CNN with those determined by musculoskeletal radiologists. Following institutional review board approval, the database of a hospital information system (HIS) was queried for lists of MRI examinations, referring department, patient age, and patient gender. These were exported to a local workstation for analyses: 5,258 and 1,018 consecutive musculoskeletal MRI examinations were used for the training and test datasets, respectively.

The subjects for pre-processing were routine or tumor protocols, and the contents were word combinations of the referring department, region, contrast media (or not), gender, and age. The CNN embedded vector classifier was used with Word2Vec Google news vectors. The test set was tested with each classification model and results were output as routine or tumor protocols. The CNN determinations were evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and the accuracies were evaluated by a radiologist-confirmed protocol as the reference protocols.

The optimal cut-off values for protocol determination between routine protocols and tumor protocols was 0.5067 with a sensitivity of 92.10%, a specificity of 95.76%, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.977. The overall accuracy was 94.2% for the ConvNet model. All MRI protocols were correct in the pelvic bone, upper arm, wrist, and lower leg MRIs.

### Magnetic resonance imaging protocols for pediatric acute hematogenous osteomyelitis [^115uVviC]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

Pediatric musculoskeletal infection can present a diagnostic challenge. MRI protocols should be appropriately tailored to diagnose and localize sites of infection, determine alternative pathologies that could explain the child's presentation, and identify complications that could alter treatment or lead to devastating consequences in growing bones. This review discusses MRI protocols specifically designed for suspected acute appendicular musculoskeletal infection in children. These protocols are based on patient age to generally reflect the developmental stage of the child, the relevant anatomy and physiology, and the skeletal maturity-dependent physiopathology of musculoskeletal infections.

### Three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging in the musculoskeletal system: Clinical applications and opportunities to improve imaging speed and resolution [^114JuyS6]. Investigative Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Although conventional two-dimensional magnetic resonance (MR) sequences have traditionally comprised the foundational imaging strategy for the visualization of musculoskeletal anatomy and pathology, the emergence of isotropic volumetric three-dimensional sequences offers to advance musculoskeletal evaluation with comparatively similar image quality and diagnostic performance, shorter acquisition times, and the added advantages of improved spatial resolution and multiplanar reformation capability. The purpose of this review article is to summarize the available three-dimensional MR sequences and their role in the management of patients with musculoskeletal disorders, including sports imaging, rheumatologic conditions, peripheral nerve imaging, bone and soft tissue tumor imaging, and whole-body MR imaging.

### MRI-based semiquantitative scoring of joint pathology in osteoarthritis [^111XZu7V]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Use of MRI techniques to investigate tissue pathology has become increasingly widespread in osteoarthritis (OA) research. Semiquantitative assessment of the joints by expert interpreters of MRI data is a powerful tool that can increase our understanding of the natural history of this complex disease. Several reliable and validated semiquantitative scoring systems now exist and have been applied to large-scale, multicentre, cross-sectional, and longitudinal observational epidemiological studies. Such approaches have advanced our understanding of the associations of different tissue pathologies with pain and improved the definition of joint alterations that lead to disease progression. Semiquantitative MRI outcome measures have also been applied in several clinical trials in OA.

Indeed, interest in MRI-based semiquantitative scoring systems has led to the development of several novel scoring systems that can be applied to different joints: a knee synovitis scoring system based on contrast-enhanced MRI, the MRI Osteoarthritis Knee Score (MOAKS), the Hip Osteoarthritis MRI Score (HOAMS), and the Oslo Hand Osteoarthritis MRI score (OHOA-MRI). Although these new scoring systems offer theoretical advantages over pre-existing systems, whether they offer actual superiority with regard to reliability, responsiveness, and validity remains to be seen.

### Dynamic MRI for articulating joint evaluation on 1.5 T and 3.0 T scanners: Setup, protocols, and real-time sequences [^114Rito5]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Being non-invasive, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely used in the clinical decision-making process. Static morphological MRI is useful for the diagnosis of musculoskeletal disorders but does not represent the dynamic physiology of joints. Dynamic in vivo imaging may provide valuable functional information (qualitative and quantitative) in addition to static imaging; thus, it may help in the selection of an optimal treatment strategy. In vivo imaging of joint motion can be performed using ultrasonography, single or biplanar fluoroscopy, computed tomography (CT), and MRI. The role of ultrasonography is limited to the evaluation of the soft tissue around the joint. Fluoroscopy and CT scan modalities are limited to the quantification of bone kinematics and expose individuals to ionizing radiation. MRI provides anatomical details of bones and soft tissues in static and dynamic acquisitions without exposure to ionizing radiation.

Dynamic MRI sequences were developed as early as 1984 for cardiac imaging and were subsequently applied to the musculoskeletal system to quantify bone motion and joint kinematics. Dynamic MRI-based musculoskeletal system evaluations could be significantly different from those performed using static MRI. For example, Muhle et al. showed that dynamic MRI was significantly better than static imaging for the demonstration of the patellar tilt angle, particularly at the critical range of patellar instability between 30° and 0° of knee flexion. The existing literature shows no consensus regarding the technical parameters and the use of dynamic MRI.

### Artifacts affecting musculoskeletal magnetic resonance imaging: Their origins and solutions [^116VnKXF]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Among articles within the radiology literature, few present the manifestations of magnetic resonance imaging artifacts in a clinically oriented manner. Recognizing such artifacts is imperative given the increasing clinical use of magnetic resonance imaging and the emphasis by the American Board of Radiology on practical physics applications. The purpose of this article is to present magnetic resonance physics principles visually and conceptually in the context of common musculoskeletal radiology artifacts and their solutions, described using nonmathematical explanations.

### Reflexions about imaging technique and examination protocol 2. MR-examination protocol [^111hqvFp]. European Journal of Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Adequate imaging protocol is crucial for any imaging technique. As MR is a time-consuming examination, the physician serves the patient best when he/she makes the best choice of sequences, which answer the question of the clinician and provide a definite diagnosis. Although any patient requires an individual protocol, some general rules should be known.

### MRI before radiography for patients with new shoulder conditions [^117Gc3HP]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to assess the patterns of appropriate criteria application among orthopedic specialists and other fields of medicine concerning the use of MRI and radiography, along with the subsequent necessity for surgical intervention.

- **Methods**: The hospital electronic medical record was used to identify all shoulder MRI studies at a single large urban teaching hospital between January 2, 2011, and June 30, 2011. For each study, variables collected included ordering department, patient age, patient gender, patient's self-reported race/ethnicity, whether the patient obtained surgery for an issue related to the MRI diagnosis, the type of MRI ordered, the date of pain onset, the date of x-ray (if any), and the date of the MRI.

- **Results**: A total of 475 patients who underwent shoulder MRI were included in our study. We found significant associations between a patient having had a prior x-ray and ordering department (P < .0001), male gender (P = 0.0005), and subjects who had subsequent surgery (P = 0.0006). Neither age nor race and ethnicity influenced x-ray before MRI. Orthopedic specialists ordering MRIs had the highest percentage of patients undergo subsequent surgery (33.3%) compared with the second-most, primary care (18.4%), and all other ordering departments (P = 0.0009).

- **Conclusions**: Detailed analysis suggests that providers who do not have specific training in shoulder pathology should consider consultation with an orthopedic surgeon before ordering shoulder MRI for patients who may need additional imaging after radiography.

### A systematic approach to magnetic resonance imaging interpretation of sports medicine injuries of the shoulder [^1118xQY4]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging has developed as a useful imaging modality in the evaluation of athletes with shoulder pain. The multiplanar capabilities of magnetic resonance imaging make it ideal for detecting the anatomical variations of the osseous outlet that may contribute to the clinical syndrome of impingement. Its superb soft tissue contrast and spatial resolution allow for accurate differentiation between tendinopathy, partial-thickness tear, and full-thickness tear of the rotator cuff. Additionally, it allows for the detection of subtle lesions of the capsule and labrum that are associated with shoulder instability.

To accurately interpret the numerous images and pulse sequences obtained in a standard magnetic resonance examination of the shoulder, it is helpful to have a systematic approach to ensure that each of the pertinent anatomical structures is evaluated. This article provides a systematic approach to the interpretation of a magnetic resonance examination of the shoulder.

- **Normal imaging appearance**: The normal imaging appearance of each anatomical structure is described.
- **Useful pulse sequences and imaging planes**: The most useful pulse sequences and imaging planes for the evaluation of each structure are discussed.
- **Signs of injury**: The signs of injury are described and illustrated.

### Assessment of the available evidence for the use of 7-tesla (T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in neurological and musculoskeletal disorders, with comparison to 3-T and 1.5-T MRI: A systematic scoping review [^116FDUcV]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Appropriate indications for the use of 7-T MRI need to be clearly defined and supported by evidence. Recent advances have been made; in epilepsy imaging, 7-T MRI shows promise in increasing the detection rate of structural lesions, enabling more patients to qualify for therapeutic surgery. In neuro-oncology, 7-T MRI offers potential benefits in the molecular characterization for tumor grading. For diagnosing multiple sclerosis (MS), it can increase the detection of lesions, especially cortical lesions, which may help secure a diagnosis in ambiguous cases at symptom onset. Additionally, the enhancement of the vessel wall through contrast agents can be observed in arteriosclerosis and unruptured intracranial aneurysms, although the clinical benefits are yet to be determined.

The comparative evidence for the superiority of ultra-high-field MRI is heterogeneous and varies significantly across different indications, with the most substantial evidence available in epilepsy imaging. Evidence-based medicine is crucial for both individual clinical decisions and global healthcare policies. Our study's findings have implications for the research and clinical application of 7-T MRI. Generating specific comparative evidence is essential for broadly defining the indications for 7-T MRI with a focus on clinically relevant patient outcomes. Future studies should consider endpoints that are significant to patients or socioeconomic factors, alongside traditional radiological outcomes.

### Contrast-enhanced 3T MR perfusion of musculoskeletal tumours: T1 value heterogeneity assessment and evaluation of the influence of T1 estimation methods on quantitative parameters [^112BpaXD]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to evaluate intra-tumour and striated muscle T1 value heterogeneity and the influence of different methods of T1 estimation on the variability of quantitative perfusion parameters.

- **Material and methods**: Eighty-two patients with histologically confirmed musculoskeletal tumours were prospectively included in this study and, with ethics committee approval, underwent contrast-enhanced MR perfusion and T1 mapping. T1 value variations in viable tumour areas and in normal-appearing striated muscle were assessed. In 20 cases, normal muscle perfusion parameters were calculated using three different methods: signal-based and gadolinium concentration-based on fixed and variable T1 values.

- **Results**: Tumour and normal muscle T1 values were significantly different (p = 0.0008). T1 value heterogeneity was higher in tumours than in normal muscle, with a variation of 19.8% versus 13%. The T1 estimation method had a considerable influence on the variability of perfusion parameters. Fixed T1 values yielded higher coefficients of variation than variable T1 values, with means of 109.6 ± 41.8% and 58.3 ± 14.1%, respectively. The area under the curve was the least variable parameter (36%).

- **Conclusion**: T1 values in musculoskeletal tumours are significantly different and more heterogeneous than in normal muscle. Patient-specific T1 estimation is needed for direct inter-patient comparison of perfusion parameters.

- **Key points**
- T1 value variation in musculoskeletal tumours is considerable.
- T1 values in muscle and tumours are significantly different.
- Patient-specific T1 estimation is needed for comparative analysis.

### Causes and diagnostic utility of musculoskeletal MRI recall examinations [^1142juBK]. Clinical Radiology (2023). High credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine the causes and diagnostic utility of musculoskeletal (MSK) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) recall examinations.

An institutional review board-approved retrospective review was conducted of all MSK MRI examinations performed at a single academic institution over 10 years where radiologists requested the patient return for additional imaging. The reason for the recall was documented. Recalls were reviewed in consensus by two MSK radiologists to determine whether additional sequences resulted in a change in the final report. Recall causes were divided into four categories:

- **Radiologist-related**: Incorrect field of view (FOV) or incorrect protocol.
- **Technologist-related**: Incorrect FOV, incorrect/incomplete protocol performed, or technically poor-quality images.
- **Patient-related**: Motion artifact.
- **Unexpected lesion discovered**.

Fisher's exact test was used to assess for statistical significance.

The recall rate was 0.25% (156 out of 62,930). Of the total 129 recalls returning for imaging, 42 (33%) were radiologist-related, 45 (35%) were technologist-related, six (5%) were patient-related, and 36 (28%) had an unexpected lesion requiring additional sequences. For clinical utility, 42% resulted in a change from the initial report. Recalls due to radiologist error, incorrect FOV, or unexpected lesion caused a significant change in the final report; however, recalls due to technologist error, patient motion artifact, or incorrect protocol did not.

In conclusion, MRI MSK recalls are uncommon, and the most common reasons are radiologist and technologist-related errors, with a significant portion involving unexpected lesions.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of the shoulder: Interpretation of common orthopaedic injuries [^116z7qvQ]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2024). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is frequently obtained to assess for pathology in the setting of shoulder pain and dysfunction. MRI of the shoulder provides diagnostic information that helps optimize patient management and surgical planning. Both general and subspecialized orthopaedic surgeons routinely order and review shoulder MRIs in practice. Therefore, familiarity with the MRI appearance of common shoulder pathologies is important. This document reviews the most common shoulder pathologies using a standardized MRI interpretative approach. Instructional videos demonstrating a musculoskeletal radiologist interpreting normal and abnormal shoulder MRIs are also provided.

### Imaging in rheumatology: reconciling radiology and rheumatology [^112oFc84]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

MRI is a highly sensitive examination for detecting inflammation, whether it is in soft tissue or bone. It is crucial to have an understanding of which areas need to be investigated. Whole-body MRI is not ideally suited for assessing rheumatoid arthritis because the small joints, in particular, are not well visualized. In early disease, the use of contrast medium enhancement can increase the sensitivity for detecting mild tenosynovitis, joint synovitis, and bone marrow signal changes (see Figure 3). When contrast medium administration is conducted as a dynamic examination, the enhancement curve can be analyzed for its pattern, further increasing the sensitivity and specificity of the examination.

In a dynamic contrast-enhanced examination, the area of interest is repeatedly imaged. Image acquisition typically begins before or immediately after the contrast-medium injection, prior to its circulation to the examined area. This technique allows for the subtraction of anatomical image information, thereby displaying the inflow of contrast medium into the area of interest. This observation facilitates the analysis of the speed and intensity of contrast medium enhancement, allowing conclusions to be drawn about the target tissues and potentially aiding in the assessment of disease activity. However, in most cases, the rheumatologist primarily seeks to determine if inflammation is present and, if so, where it is located; a dynamic examination is often unnecessary.

### Do existing magnetic resonance imaging definitions of knee osteoarthritis identify knees that will develop clinically significant disease over up to 11 years of follow-up [^1145gFeK]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

Identifying knees likely to develop clinically significant disease is crucial for initiating early intervention before substantial structural changes occur. The Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) has launched an initiative to establish classification criteria for early-stage knee osteoarthritis (OA) to identify such individuals. Imaging, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is among the seven domains to consider for accurately identifying those with a high probability of early-stage knee OA.

To our knowledge, the implications of having MRI-defined knee OA and potential association with an increased risk of subsequent, incident radiographic and symptomatic disease have not been examined. In individuals without tibiofemoral (TF) radiographic knee OA, we aimed to:

- **Determine prevalence**: Assess the prevalence of MRI-defined knee OA using Definition A and Definition B.
- **Examine baseline association**: For each definition, examine whether the baseline presence of MRI-defined knee OA was associated with subsequent incident TF radiographic and symptomatic disease during up to 11 years of follow-up.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® thoracic back pain [^113oyNgG]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). High credibility.

In specific circumstances for low back pain, particularly concerning patients with upper back pain, the ACR 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining an MRI without contrast as the initial imaging in adult patients with thoracic back pain with myelopathy or radiculopathy. It is also advised to consider obtaining a thoracic spine X-ray, contrast-enhanced MRI of the thoracic spine, CT of the thoracic spine, or CT myelography of the thoracic spine in selected cases.

### ESR essentials: MRI of the knee-practice recommendations by ESSR [^112ZYzcE]. European Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

MRI of the knee is a common examination performed both in outpatient clinics and for hospitalised patients. The indications vary extensively. In the knee, MRI is especially useful in the assessment of soft tissues following acute sports-related injuries. In cases of chronic knee issues, the range widens to encompass chronic overuse and inflammation. Neoplasms and osteomyelitis are also indications in knee imaging, although these are not specific to the knee itself. Often, the indication given is non-specific and a radiology department needs a primary standard MRI protocol for the knee. A well-adjusted protocol can detect most knee pathologies, and the few that require further examinations can be referred for additional sequences. The European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology (ESSR) sport imaging protocol might be used as a baseline.

The recommendations presented here are meant to aid general radiologists in planning studies for and assessing acute and chronic findings in the knee. The assessments of bone tumours, generalised bone marrow abnormalities, and osteomyelitis are not knee-specific entities and are thus not included in this paper. The following recommendations are considered good practice recommendations. They are intended as a "base camp" knee MRI. These recommendations should not prevent the implementation of technical improvements or more refined radiological evaluations. Although we do not recommend a structured report for knee MRI, the reporting of certain pathologies requires standardised assessments.

### Assessment of the available evidence for the use of 7-tesla (T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in neurological and musculoskeletal disorders, with comparison to 3-T and 1.5-T MRI: A systematic scoping review [^11736ztH]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). High credibility.

In the musculoskeletal field, of the nine studies, seven focused on various aspects of knee joint imaging and one on general bone health and osteoporosis. Indications for imaging of the knee joint encompassed osteoarthritis, pain, cartilage lesions, and meniscal damage. One study reported on the assessment of perforating arteries for the planning of orofacial reconstructive surgery. Seven studies were cross-sectional, and two were longitudinal. The comparator was 3-T MRI in all but one study, which used CT angiography. Two studies used a combined comparator of 3-T MRI with CT or arthroscopy (study on meniscal damage).

The risk of bias and quality assessment of the included publications was performed using items from the QUADAS-2 tool. The quality of studies varied greatly. No randomized controlled trials and a relatively low number of prospective studies were identified. The reporting of study design was lacking general information in many cases, being either not reported in 34 studies (41%) or unclear in two studies (2.4%). A detailed description of patient recruitment was lacking in a large number of studies (24, 29%). Time between the acquisition of 7-T MRI and the comparator diagnostic examination was often not reported, or was unclear or unknown (total 43, 52%). Reports on drug treatments or changes in treatment between the examinations were often not included. Blinding of readers was not reported in 20 studies (24%) and was unclear in 12 studies (14.5%). No blinding was reported in 14 studies (17%). We encountered major difficulties in assessing the study blinding.

### ESR essentials: MRI of the knee-practice recommendations by ESSR [^115gfjP5]. European radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Many studies and systematic reviews have been published about MRI of the knee and its structures, discussing detailed anatomy, imaging findings, and correlations between imaging and clinical findings. This paper includes evidence-based recommendations for a general radiologist regarding the choice of imaging sequences and reporting basic MRI examinations of the knee. We recommend using clinicians' terminology when it is applicable to the imaging findings, for example, when reporting meniscal, ligament and tendon, or cartilage pathology. The intent is to standardize reporting language and to make reports less equivocal. The aim of the paper is to improve the usefulness of the MRI report by understanding the strengths and limitations of the MRI exam with regard to clinical correlation. We hope the implementation of these recommendations into radiological practice will increase diagnostic accuracy and consistency by avoiding pitfalls and reducing overcalling of pathology on MRI of the knee.

- **Clinical relevance statement**: The recommendations presented here are meant to aid general radiologists in planning and assessing studies to evaluate acute and chronic knee findings by advocating the use of unequivocal terminology and discussing the strengths and limitations of MRI examination of the knee.

- **Key points**
- On MRI, the knee should be examined and assessed in three orthogonal imaging planes.
- The basic general protocol must yield T2-weighted fluid-sensitive and T1-weighted images.
- The radiological assessment should include evaluation of ligamentous structures, cartilage, and associated findings.

### What imaging-detected pathologies are associated with shoulder symptoms and their persistence? A systematic literature review [^113hdSsN]. Arthritis Care & Research (2018). Low credibility.

Summary of the methodologic qualities of the studies included - supplementary Table 2, available on the Arthritis Care & Research website, shows the results of the methodologic quality assessment of the included studies. The mean (range) score was 48% [28–67] for cohort studies, 41% [7–71] for cross-sectional studies, and 50% [47–59] for case–control studies. A total of 31 studies were high quality, and 25 were low quality. Six studies did not explain the statistical test used [33, 42, 46, 52, 58, 71]. Nine studies did not define pathology. The GRADE quality of evidence for the relationship for all imaging features/symptoms outcomes was very low due to study limitations (risk of bias and observational study design), quality, inconsistency, and indirectness.

### MRI characteristics of cysts and "cyst-like" lesions in and around the knee: What the radiologist needs to know [^114UtYEJ]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Benign cystic and "cyst-like" lesions are a common finding inside and around the knee joint. MRI is an excellent method for demonstrating and differentiating these lesions. A radiologist should be able to identify typical MRI patterns that contribute to establishing the correct diagnosis, thus guiding specific therapy and avoiding unwarranted interventional procedures such as biopsy or arthroscopy.

### Assessment of the available evidence for the use of 7-tesla (T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in neurological and musculoskeletal disorders, with comparison to 3-T and 1.5-T MRI: A systematic scoping review [^117UHX8E]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Results**: We identified 3415 studies during the search. After duplicate removal and initial screening steps, 422 studies were included in the full-text screening, and 102 studies remained for data extraction. During the data extraction process, a further 19 studies were excluded (missing comparator, no inclusion of patients, no original data). Reasons for exclusion were selected based on the pre-specified categories in the software tools and can be summarized in four categories:

- **Inappropriate population studied**: Mainly due to the inclusion of healthy individuals without the inclusion of patients or study of a disease.
- **Inappropriate study design**: Mainly studies examining 7-T MRI only, without comparison to other imaging techniques, modalities, or magnetic resonance field strengths.
- **Inappropriate publication type**: Mainly preclinical studies with phantom measurement or animal trials.
- **Background article type**: No original data reported by the article.

Finally, 83 studies remained for analysis.

Of the 83 studies, 73 were journal articles, with the remaining studies comprising congress abstracts and presentations. No randomized controlled trials were identified. The most frequent study design was cross-sectional (73 studies). In addition, we identified five longitudinal studies, four case series, and one case–control study. The comparators were 3-T MRI in 47 studies (57%) and 1.5-T MRI in eight studies (10%). Nine studies (11%) used multiple comparators, including 3-T MRI in conjunction.

### Exertional compartment syndrome and the role of magnetic resonance imaging [^116w9nrX]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

A 47-year-old woman presented with a one-year history of progressive bilateral anterior lower leg pain and swelling with walking, which resolved 10 minutes after activity. Post-exercise (forced dorsiflexion), magnetic resonance imaging revealed increased T2 signal intensity in the entire anterior muscle compartment, and anterior compartment pressures were elevated at rest and post-exercise. Chronic exertional compartment syndrome can occur in some patients after even minimal physical activities, and magnetic resonance imaging without the use of radioisotopes was a useful adjunct for diagnosis.

### MRI for the preoperative evaluation of femoroacetabular impingement [^116QQSwX]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Variable accuracy has been reported for non-contrast MRI for the detection of labral tears, depending on the magnetic field strength, slice thickness, and field of view. Three studies using high-resolution MRI at 1.5T and a small field of view demonstrated a sensitivity of 77–97% for the detection of labral tears compared with a surgical reference standard.

Direct MR arthrography involves intra-articular injection of diluted gadolinium contrast into the hip joint and has the benefit of joint distention and an improved contrast-to-noise ratio. A recent review of 19 studies evaluating MR arthrography demonstrated sensitivity of 69–100% for the detection of labral tears with a surgical reference standard, with 12 of these studies showing sensitivity greater than 90%.

A meta-analysis found that MR arthrography had higher sensitivity but lower specificity than conventional MRI for the detection of labral tears. For the evaluation of chondral lesions, MRI has shown higher diagnostic accuracy, with another meta-analysis demonstrating pooled sensitivity and specificity of 59% and 94% for MRI, compared to 62% and 86% for MR arthrography. MR arthrography has the disadvantage of being more time-consuming and invasive, with some patients experiencing post-procedural pain. The choice between conventional MRI and MRA will vary by institution and will depend on the ability to optimize the MRI scanning protocol with each technique.

At the authors' institution, MRI of the hip is performed using a cardiac or small body coil on a 1.5T or 3.0T scanner.

### ESR essentials: gadolinium-wise MRI-practice recommendations by the European Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine and Biology [^114rgUnV]. European Radiology (2025).

Despite recommendations being available for most common diseases, the level of scientific evidence remains moderate, and it is common practice to prescribe an MRI scan with contrast rather than without contrast, as it increases confidence and reduces the risk of false negatives in radiological reports.

Further research is necessary to increase appropriateness in the use of GBCA in different clinical contexts to understand the real improvement in patient care by adding contrast-enhanced imaging. Since 2014, the ESR has been working with the American College of Radiology (ACR) to develop referral guidelines for Europe, based on the ACR Appropriateness Criteria. The ESMRMB-GREC working group continues to seek collaboration with other ESR subspecialty societies to develop educational resources for radiologists in this regard.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of articular cartilage [^111ytTE8]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2001). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the optimal modality for assessing articular cartilage due to its superior soft tissue contrast, direct visualization of articular cartilage, and multiplanar capability. Despite these advantages, there has been disagreement regarding the efficacy of MRI for articular cartilage. This controversy is multifactorial, partly due to the lack of optimized pulse sequences for articular cartilage.

The authors review the state of the art of MRI of articular cartilage and cartilage repair procedures. They discuss future directions in imaging strategies and methods being developed to measure cartilage thickness and volume measurements. Additionally, they propose an MRI protocol to evaluate cartilage that is achievable on most MRI scanners, vendor independent, practical (time and cost-efficient), and accepted and used by a majority of musculoskeletal radiologists.

### Contrast-enhanced MR imaging of the spine: When, why and how? How to optimize contrast protocols in MR imaging of the spine [^113yrQnw]. Neuroradiology (2006). Low credibility.

The optimal protocols and the role of contrast agents in spinal MR imaging are controversial. Although the diagnosis of many common spinal diseases can be reliably achieved by means of unenhanced images, contrast use is often necessary to improve lesion detection and differential diagnosis. The heterogeneity of the different spinal compartments and the wide variety of spinal pathology require tailored imaging strategies.

Thus, the rules to achieve optimization of contrast protocols for MR imaging of the spine are frequently very different from those for brain imaging and depend on the location and site of origin of the lesions in a specific spinal compartment, on the findings of unenhanced imaging, and on the concomitant use of fat-suppression techniques. Furthermore, in most cases, the small size of the examined structures requires a meticulous technique, and the administration of a contrast agent with high relaxivity, such as MultiHance, is advisable to enable the detection of tiny areas of contrast enhancement.

The applications and clinical utility of post-contrast MR imaging are discussed with regard to different spinal diseases.

### ESR essentials: gadolinium-wise MRI-practice recommendations by the European Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine and Biology [^116yk9jo]. European Radiology (2025). High credibility.

The Gadolinium Research and Education Committee (GREC) is a working group of the European Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine and Biology (ESMRMB), established in 2016. The aim of the committee is to monitor scientific evidence for continuous quality and safety improvement of enhanced MRI using gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs), and also assess potential alternatives. The scope of this article is to describe the level of evidence concerning safety beyond the single patient, such as access to the community and environmental impact; justification and optimization of the use of GBCAs beyond dosage, including appropriateness and influence on clinical decision-making; dose reduction with the use of AI, addressing benefits and pitfalls; and the advent of next-generation GBCAs based on currently available data.

- **Clinical relevance**: GBCAs are extensively used in MRI and influence clinical decision-making. Their use to enhance the contrast-to-noise ratio is guided by recommendations from subspecialty societies. These guidelines advocate for GBCA use as an additional tool when necessary, ensuring they are administered at the lowest reasonable dose.

- **Key points**
- **The choice of GBCAs**: The choice should be based on MRI cost-effectiveness, MRI access to the patient community, and impact on the environment (evidence level: low).
- **GBCA optimization**: This includes reducing the GBCA volume burden and increasing appropriateness by including post-contrast enhancement in MRI protocols, depending on clinical indications (evidence level: moderate).
- **Next-generation GBCAs**: These show higher kinetic stability.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® low back pain: 2021 update [^113sgg8c]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for low back pain, particularly concerning diagnostic imaging, the ACR 2021 guidelines recommend considering lumbar spine X-ray and MRI with or without IV contrast as the initial imaging for patients with low back pain (with or without radiculopathy) who present with one or more of the following:

- **Elderly**: Patients who are elderly may require imaging to rule out underlying conditions.
- **Low-velocity trauma**: Imaging is advised in cases involving low-velocity trauma to assess for possible injury.
- **Osteoporosis**: Patients with osteoporosis may need imaging to evaluate for fractures or other complications.
- **Chronic corticosteroid use**: Chronic use of corticosteroids can increase the risk of fractures, necessitating imaging in these patients.

### MR imaging of skeletal muscle signal alterations: Systematic approach to evaluation [^113L4bSo]. European Journal of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Muscle edema or edema-like signal alterations are commonly encountered findings in musculoskeletal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Although such signal alterations are very sensitive for detecting underlying muscle pathology, they are often non-specific. By encompassing knowledge of their typical clinical presentations, characteristic appearances, and patterns, and by following a systematic approach towards their assessment, a reader can effectively narrow down the differential diagnosis. This article outlines the role of conventional imaging and advanced anatomic and functional musculoskeletal MR imaging techniques in the evaluation of various muscle disorders and presents a systematic approach toward their diagnosis and management.

### 7 t musculoskeletal MRI: Fundamentals and clinical implementation [^112yYTSH]. Investigative Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

The spatial resolution of clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the musculoskeletal system has substantially increased over the last three decades, driven by the advent of 3 T magnets with higher signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and the widespread availability of dedicated high-end extremity coils. For many clinical questions in musculoskeletal medicine, MRI at 1.5 T and 3 T field strength can provide adequate answers, which has led to significant improvements in patient care. Now, with the advent of clinical 7 T scanners, new possibilities for musculoskeletal imaging arise.

### Susceptibility weighted imaging for evaluation of musculoskeletal lesions [^111Xr1mY]. European Journal of Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

The presence of blood or calcium in the musculoskeletal (MSK) system may be linked to specific pathological conditions. The ability of MRI for calcium detection is usually limited compared with other techniques, such as CT. Similarly, the accuracy of MRI for detection and evaluation of hemorrhage in soft tissues is closely linked to the degree of degradation of blood products. Blood and calcium are substances that cause local inhomogeneity of the magnetic field, resulting in susceptibility artifacts.

To evaluate these substances, specific MRI sequences that are highly sensitive to local magnetic field inhomogeneities, such as susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI), have been developed and successfully applied in the central nervous system. However, they are scarcely used in MSK. SWI may increase the overall sensitivity of MRI to detect blood and calcium in several clinical scenarios, such as degenerative joint disease or bone and soft tissue lesion assessment, and discriminate between both compounds — something not always possible with conventional MRI approaches. This paper details the physical basis and technical adjustments for SWI acquisition in MSK, reviewing the potential application of SWI in different MSK clinical scenarios.

### Non-contrast MRI diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder [^115X6w6Q]. Clinical Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

To investigate non-contrast MRI findings of clinical adhesive capsulitis, a study evaluated 31 non-contrast, non-arthrographic shoulder MRIs. The evaluations focused on the coracohumeral ligament thickness, rotator interval infiltration, and axillary recess thickening/edema.
- **Results**: In the detection of adhesive capsulitis, the sensitivity was 76.7% and the specificity was 53.3% for coracohumeral ligament thickening. For coracohumeral ligament thickening and rotator interval infiltration, the sensitivity was 66.7% and specificity was 55.2%. When considering coracohumeral ligament thickening, rotator interval infiltration, and axillary recess thickening/edema, the sensitivity was 23.3% and specificity was 86.7%.
- **Conclusions**: Adhesive capsulitis can be accurately diagnosed on non-contrast MRI shoulder examinations with appropriate clinical criteria, without the need for direct MR arthrography.

### Lower extremity MRI: Are their requests always appropriate in France [^116U6LHU]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) today enables diagnostic evaluation for many clinical indications, including lesion detection, characterization, functional assessment, and response to treatment. The main advantages of MRI are that it is non-irradiating and non-invasive. However, access to MRI can take a long time in France: a study commissioned by the National Union of the Medical Technology Industry (Syndicat National de l'Industrie des Technologies Médicales) showed that in 2018, the estimated waiting time for an MRI scan in oncology was 32.3 days.

According to international guidelines, lower extremity MRI is not a first-line imaging procedure; its request should be discussed after X-rays have been performed. As lower extremity MRI mainly concerns the knee, according to clinicians' feedback in France, the National Authority for Health (Haute Autorité de Santé [HAS]) and the National Professional Council for Radiology and Medical Imaging (G4) published two guidelines in 2022 on the relevant imaging in cases of non-traumatic knee pain or after knee trauma in adults.
- **Main recommendations for non-traumatic knee pain**: Carry out a thorough history and clinical examination before any knee imaging. Knee X-rays are the first-line imaging procedure. MRI should not be performed as a first-line imaging procedure. Imaging should not be repeated in the event of a new episode of knee pain in a patient with a known pathology (e.g. osteoarthritis) and usual symptomatology.

A review of the practice showed a steady increase in the use of lower extremity MRI in France.

### Exploring contrast-enhanced MRI findings of the clinically non-inflamed symptomatic pediatric wrist [^113H6X36]. Pediatric Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Important strides have been made in developing a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) atlas of the healthy pediatric wrist. Research demonstrates that bony depressions and joint fluid can occur in the wrists of a significant proportion of healthy children. In cases of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, contrast-enhanced MRI is the preferred imaging technique for evaluating synovial inflammation, a hallmark indicator of the disease's activity. Despite advances in understanding the imaging features of healthy juvenile wrists, reference standards for the non-inflamed appearance of the enhancing synovium remain limited. This limitation impedes the use of contrast-enhanced MRI in diagnosing juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

The contrast-enhanced synovial membrane in children who are clinically unaffected by inflammatory pathology has only been assessed in the knee joint. Ejbjerg et al. have summarized several studies that evaluated the enhancing synovial membrane of the wrist joint in healthy adults. However, the normal values used in adult populations are not necessarily applicable to children, as similar MRI findings might represent different physiological processes. For example, signal changes suggestive of bone marrow edema — associated with rheumatoid arthritis activity in adults — have been detected in the wrists and knees of healthy children and may relate to the physiological process of maturation.

Efforts are ongoing to establish reference standards to evaluate the wrist joint in children suspected of having juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
