## Question

Causes for positive ascus HPV
 negative

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of a positive HPV test with an ASC-US cytology result, and what that means clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the definitions of ASC-US and HPV positivity. Then, I should verify the prevalence and risk implications of HPV-positive ASC-US. Next, I will examine the biological and technical reasons why HPV and ASC-US can coexist. After that, I should review guideline-based management and how risk varies with prior screening history. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable explanation and counseling points, making sure I double-check any numeric claims against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't misstate the scenario. ASC-US stands for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, a cytologic interpretation that is neither normal nor clearly abnormal, and it is the most common abnormal Pap finding, while HPV-positive means detection of high-risk HPV types that are causally linked to cervical precancer and cancer, such as 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68 [^658235ca] [^b7f0b8e5].

> Wait, let me verify the prevalence and baseline risk so I don't overgeneralize. In large cohorts, HPV positivity accompanies roughly 40–50% of ASC-US cytology results, and women with HPV-positive ASC-US carry a materially higher 5-year CIN3+ risk than those with HPV-negative ASC-US, typically around 6–7% versus less than 1%, which is why guidelines treat HPV-positive ASC-US as a higher-risk category warranting colposcopy rather than simple repeat testing [^cdad1fd5] [^1f5f8d0d] [^7b6cb3c6].

> I will now examine the biological reasons for HPV-positive ASC-US. The most straightforward explanation is that HPV infection causes cytologic atypia: productive HPV replication in squamous cells can produce nuclear enlargement, hyperchromasia, and perinuclear halos that cytologists interpret as ASC-US, so HPV-positive ASC-US often reflects real viral cytopathic change even when no high-grade lesion is immediately visible on colposcopy [^658235ca] [^dbf8ee37].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about what HPV-positive ASC-US implies histologically. I should confirm the risk gradient. Compared with HPV-negative ASC-US, HPV-positive ASC-US has about a 10-fold higher 5-year CIN3+ risk, and its risk is comparable to LSIL, which is why guidelines align management of HPV-positive ASC-US with LSIL and recommend colposcopy rather than surveillance in the absence of mitigating history [^1f5f8d0d] [^7b6cb3c6] [^24f50746].

> Next, I should review why HPV and ASC-US can coexist even when no CIN2+ is found on biopsy. Let me consider technical and biological explanations. Sampling error can miss a focal high-grade lesion, transient HPV infections can produce cytologic atypia without established dysplasia, and some HPV-positive ASC-US reflects low-grade CIN1 or simply acute HPV cytopathic change that regresses, which explains why a subset of HPV-positive ASC-US cases have negative or CIN1 biopsies yet still warrant follow-up given nonnegligible risk [^d37dfa07] [^6efcd7c1] [^b7f0b8e5].

> I need to ensure I incorporate how prior screening history modifies risk. If the current HPV-positive ASC-US follows a documented negative HPV-based screen within about 5 years, the immediate CIN3+ risk is lower, and guidelines allow deferred management with repeat HPV-based testing in 1 year rather than immediate colposcopy, underscoring that a new HPV infection after a negative screen carries different implications than an incident abnormality without protective history [^7b3a4615] [^9bcef28a] [^b3fc1f43].

> Let me think about guideline-based management so I don't overstate or omit steps. In patients aged 25 and older with HPV-positive ASC-US and no recent negative HPV screen, immediate colposcopy is recommended because the immediate CIN3+ risk exceeds the 4% clinical action threshold. If colposcopy is negative or shows less than CIN2, surveillance with HPV-based testing in 1 year is advised, with escalation if abnormalities persist, whereas after a documented negative HPV screen, repeat HPV-based testing in 1 year is acceptable given lower risk [^24f50746] [^28b17a11] [^7b3a4615].

> But wait, what if the patient is younger than 25. I should double-check that nuance. For patients younger than 25, HPV testing is generally not recommended for ASC-US because HPV prevalence is high and most infections clear; management emphasizes repeat cytology at 1 and 2 years with colposcopy only if high-grade cytology appears or low-grade abnormalities persist, reflecting the low cancer risk and high regression rates in this age group [^2dab1470] [^6ec52323].

> I should confirm special contexts that can shift interpretation. In postmenopausal women, atrophy-related cellular changes can mimic ASC-US, so HPV testing helps triage; if HPV is negative, the risk is low and repeat testing is reasonable, whereas HPV positivity still warrants colposcopy. In immunocompromised patients, including those with HIV, HPV-positive ASC-US carries higher risk and generally merits colposcopy rather than deferred follow-up [^c8636ce3] [^e0263b20].

> Let me reconsider the core question and synthesize. Positive HPV with ASC-US reflects that high-risk HPV is present and has produced cytologic atypia, which elevates the risk of underlying CIN2+ compared with HPV-negative ASC-US. The combination signals active HPV infection with cellular changes that may represent transient cytopathy, low-grade CIN1, or occasionally a missed high-grade lesion, which is why guidelines recommend colposcopy in average-risk adults unless recent HPV-negative screening modifies risk downward [^1f5f8d0d] [^24f50746] [^7b3a4615].

> Finally, I should ensure the counseling message is clear and reference-aligned. I need to emphasize that HPV-positive ASC-US is not a cancer diagnosis, that most HPV infections clear and many ASC-US cytology results normalize, but that the elevated precancer risk justifies closer evaluation. Shared decision-making is appropriate, especially when balancing treatment implications for future pregnancy, and patients should be reassured that management is individualized based on current results and prior screening history [^b7f0b8e5] [^e6373783] [^08721803].

A positive HPV test with ASC-US cytology reflects **transient HPV infection** [^6efcd7c1] or **low-grade cervical changes** (CIN1) [^b7f0b8e5] in most cases, not cancer. It is most often due to **recent sexual exposure** [^08721803] or **reactivation of a latent HPV infection** [^08721803], especially in younger women or those with new partners. Persistent HPV, particularly types 16/18, increases the risk of CIN2+ [^b7f0b8e5], so management is risk-based: colposcopy if HPV-positive ASC-US is new or persistent, or repeat HPV-based testing in 1 year if recent HPV-negative results exist [^7b3a4615] [^9bcef28a]. Most infections clear spontaneously, and only a small subset progress to high-grade disease [^6efcd7c1].

---

## Biological explanations for positive HPV with ASC-US

Several **biological mechanisms** can explain a positive HPV test with ASC-US cytology:

- **Transient HPV infection**: Most HPV infections are transient and clear spontaneously within 1–2 years [^notfound]. ASC-US cytology often reflects transient HPV-induced cellular changes that are not associated with significant precancerous lesions [^notfound].

- **Low-grade cervical lesions (CIN1)**: HPV infection can cause low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN1), which is typically benign and often resolves without intervention [^e6373783].

- **Persistent HPV infection**: Persistent infection with high-risk HPV types (especially HPV 16 and 18) increases the risk of progression to high-grade lesions (CIN2/3) and cervical cancer [^b7f0b8e5].

---

## Clinical significance and risk assessment

The clinical significance of a positive HPV test with ASC-US cytology depends on the **HPV genotype**, persistence of infection, and patient-specific factors:

| **Risk factor** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|
| HPV 16/18 positivity | - High risk of CIN2+ <br/> - Requires colposcopy [^29431eb1] |
| Persistent HPV infection | Increased risk of progression to CIN2+ [^notfound] |
| Younger age (< 25 years) | - High prevalence of transient HPV <br/> - Conservative management recommended [^2dab1470] |
| Immunocompromised status | - Higher risk of persistent HPV <br/> - More aggressive management [^e0263b20] |

---

## Management guidelines

Current guidelines recommend **risk-based management** for patients with positive HPV and ASC-US cytology:

- **Initial management**: Colposcopy is recommended for HPV-positive ASC-US, especially if HPV 16/18 is detected [^24f50746] [^29431eb1].

- **Surveillance**: If colposcopy reveals no significant lesions (< CIN2), repeat HPV-based testing in 1 year is recommended [^28b17a11].

- **Special populations**: For patients younger than 25 years, conservative management with repeat cytology is recommended due to the high prevalence of transient HPV infections [^2dab1470].

---

## Factors influencing HPV positivity with ASC-US

Several factors influence the likelihood of **HPV positivity** with ASC-US cytology:

- **Age**: Younger women have higher HPV prevalence and are more likely to have transient infections [^95b2de7e].

- **Sexual activity**: New sexual partners or multiple partners increase the risk of HPV acquisition [^6efcd7c1].

- **Immune status**: Immunocompromised individuals have higher HPV prevalence and persistence [^e0263b20].

- **Smoking**: Smoking increases the risk of persistent HPV infection and cervical lesions [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

The prognosis for patients with positive HPV and ASC-US cytology is **generally favorable**. Most HPV infections clear spontaneously, and only a small subset progresses to high-grade lesions or cervical cancer [^6efcd7c1]. Persistent HPV infection, particularly with high-risk types, necessitates closer surveillance and possible intervention [^7b3a4615].

---

A positive HPV test with ASC-US cytology most often reflects **transient infection** or low-grade changes and is usually not cancer. Management is risk-based, with colposcopy for new or persistent HPV-positive ASC-US and repeat testing for those with recent HPV-negative results [^7b3a4615] [^9bcef28a].

### Role of screening history in clinical meaning and optimal management of positive cervical screening results [^b3fc1f43]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cervical cancer is caused by persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. US consensus management guidelines for a positive cervical screening result typically focus on the current screening result only. A negative testing history may alter risk of the following positive screening results, caused by a new HPV infection, and therefore its optimal management.

Methods

Women ages 30years and older were screened with triennial HPV and cytology co-testing at Kaiser Permanente Northern California from 2003 to 2014. We estimated the subsequent 5-year risks of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or more severe diagnoses (CIN3+) in a cohort of 1 156 387 women following abnormal (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASC-US] or worse) cytology and/or positive HPV testing, when the test result followed 0 (n = 990 013), 1 (n = 543 986), 2 (n = 245 974), or 3 (n = 79 946) consecutive negative co-test(s). All statistical tests were two-sided.

Results

Following 0–3 successive negative co-tests, 5-year CIN3+ risks following a positive HPV test decreased progressively from 7.2% (95% CI = 7.0% to 7.4%) to 1.5% (95% CI = 0.7% to 3.4%) (Ptrend < .001). Similarly, risks following an abnormal (ASC-US or worse) cytology result decreased from 6.6% (95% CI = 6.4% to 6.9%) to 1.1% (95% CI = 0.5% to 2.3%) (Ptrend < .001). Risks following low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, the risk threshold for referral to colposcopy in the United States, decreased from 5.2% (95% CI = 4.7% to 5.7%) to 0.9% (95% CI = 0.2% to 4.3%). Risks following high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or more severe, a specific marker for the presence of precancerous lesions, decreased from 50.0% (95% CI = 47.5% to 52.5%) to 10.0% (95% CI = 2.6% to 34.4%).

Conclusions

Following one or more sequential antecedent, documented negative co-tests or HPV tests, women with HPV-positive ASC-US or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion might have sufficiently low CIN3+ risk that they do not need colposcopy referral and might instead undergo 6-12-month surveillance for evidence of higher risk before being referred to colposcopy.

HPV-positive ASC-US management after colposcopy with less than CIN 2 — The corrected Figure 2 legend states that a patient with this minimally abnormal screening result "would be managed based on risk estimates". "The initial screening result would lead to colposcopy (immediate risk 4.5%)". If colposcopy shows "less than CIN 2, the 5-year risk is 2.9% (1-year return)", and at the 1-year return a second HPV-positive ASC-US "has an immediate risk of 3.1% (1-year return)". For the second postcolposcopy surveillance test, "if the HPV-based test performed for the second postcolposcopy surveillance test is negative, return in 3 years is recommended". If results are "either a positive HPV test with any cytology result or a negative HPV test result with a cytology result of ASC-H or higher, colposcopy is recommended", and "Return in 1 year is recommended for HPV-negative ASC-US or LSIL results". Similar management "would be recommended if the initial abnormality preceding colposcopy were any minimally abnormal test result (i.e., less severe than ASC-H)".

Prevalence-incidence models require knowledge of each patient's history of test results to determine at which visits they had < CIN 3, CIN 3+, or an unknown < CIN 3/CIN 3+ status. We define prevalent CIN 3+ as CIN 3+ detected after colposcopic referral because of the baseline (current) test results. We define a patient as having < CIN 3 at a visit if the diagnosis was either (1) directly confirmed through histopathology or, in the absence of histopathologic outcomes, (2) if neither HPV nor cytology tests were positive (i.e. HPV negative/NILM or HPV negative/ASC-US). Condition (2) is useful to shorten intervals during which CIN 3+ onset could have plausibly occurred (thus increasing statistical efficiency of model estimates) and cause negligible bias because of the very high probability of an HPV negative with NILM or ASC-US cytologic result indicating concurrently histology < CIN 3. In contrast, patients with positive test results (HPV-positive or ≥ LSIL cytology results), but without histopathologic outcomes or a future < CIN 3 to rule out CIN 3+, are considered to have unknown (in statistical terms, "latent") histologic status at that screen.

These considerations allow us to define the shortest time intervals in which onset of detected CIN 3+ is likely to have occurred: (1) prevalent (left-censored at the current test), (2) incident (interval-censored between the last result < CIN 3 and the time of CIN 3+ detection), or (3) unknown prevalent or incident (CIN 3+ detected in follow-up but cannot rule out disease prevalence). Patients who never had CIN 3+ detected were considered right censored at the time of the last < CIN 3 visit. Individuals who were never defined as < CIN 3 or CIN 3+ at any time points did not contribute to risk estimation. Some illustrative examples of how patients' visit histories are used to define intervals are shown in the Appendix, Part C.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^7b3a4615]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

HPV-based prior results and high-quality colposcopy modify near-term management — after a documented negative HPV test or cotest within the past 5 years, a new abnormal screening result has substantially reduced estimated risk of CIN 3+, often leading to surveillance rather than immediate colposcopy; in contrast, a previous negative cytology result alone does not similarly reduce risk. A colposcopic examination confirming low-grade or normal histology reduces estimated risk in the next 2 years and allows patients with HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL at their 1-year follow-up to return for repeat HPV or cotesting in 1 more year rather than immediately return to colposcopy.

### Cervical cancer screening: a review [^b7f0b8e5]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Each year in the US, approximately 100 000 people are treated for cervical precancer, 14 000 people are diagnosed with cervical cancer, and 4000 die of cervical cancer.

Observations

Essentially all cervical cancers worldwide are caused by persistent infections with one of 13 carcinogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes: 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68. HPV vaccination at ages 9 through 12 years will likely prevent more than 90% of cervical precancers and cancers. In people with a cervix aged 21 through 65 years, cervical cancer is prevented by screening for and treating cervical precancer, defined as high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions of the cervix. High-grade lesions can progress to cervical cancer if not treated. Cervicovaginal HPV testing is 90% sensitive for detecting precancer. In the general population, the risk of precancer is less than 0.15% over 5 years following a negative HPV test result. Among people with a positive HPV test result, a combination of HPV genotyping and cervical cytology (Papanicolaou testing) can identify the risk of precancer. For people with current precancer risks of less than 4%, repeat HPV testing is recommended in 1, 3, or 5 years depending on 5-year precancer risk. For people with current precancer risks of 4% through 24%, such as those with low-grade cytology test results (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASC-US] or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [LSIL]) and a positive HPV test of unknown duration, colposcopy is recommended. For patients with precancer risks of less than 25% (eg, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 [CIN1] or histologic LSIL), treatment-related adverse effects, including possible association with preterm labor, can be reduced by repeating colposcopy to monitor for precancer and avoiding excisional treatment. For patients with current precancer risks of 25% through 59% (eg, high-grade cytology results of ASC cannot exclude high-grade lesion [ASC-H] or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [HSIL] with positive HPV test results), management consists of colposcopy with biopsy or excisional treatment. For those with current precancer risks of 60% or more, such as patients with HPV-16-positive HSIL, proceeding directly to excisional treatment is preferred, but performing a colposcopy first to confirm the need for excisional treatment is acceptable. Clinical decision support tools can facilitate correct management.

Conclusions and Relevance

Approximately 100 000 people are treated for cervical precancer each year in the US to prevent cervical cancer. People with a cervix should be screened with HPV testing, and if HPV-positive, genotyping and cytology testing should be performed to assess the risk of cervical precancer and determine the need for colposcopy or treatment. HPV vaccination in adolescence will likely prevent more than 90% of cervical precancers and cancers.

### An introduction to the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^b39476cb]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Deciding on the clinical action thresholds for each management option (treatment preferred, treatment or colposcopic biopsy, colposcopic biopsy, surveillance retesting at 1 year, surveillance retesting at 3 years, return at regular screening interval of 5 years) required an 18-month collective effort involving the volunteering cervical health professionals and patient advocates and including a period for public input. These societal decisions were acknowledged to be part of the larger subjective question of "How safe is safe enough? What risk levels in our society warrant escalating to the next, more aggressive clinical actions?"

The clinical action thresholds adopted by consensus voting in October 2019 after substantial study and discussion are intended to endure, providing stability to the US cervical screening effort, even as screening test methods and strategies evolve. When a new test is approved by the Food and Drug Administration that test can be considered for inclusion in the consensus guidelines as soon as sufficient data are available to know what risk of precancer is predicted by a positive result versus a negative result. Adequate prospective data will be necessary before a test can be recommended as the basis for surveillance at 1- or 3-year intervals or return to routine screening at 5-year intervals. Cross-sectional data will be needed to supply the immediate risk estimates that support recommendations for treatment or referral to colposcopy. To give an example, the new consensus is that the clinical action threshold for referral to colposcopy and biopsies (and possibly treatment) is a 4.0% immediate risk of CIN 3+. Patients with an underlying immediate risk of CIN 3+ of 4.0% or more are recommended to have colposcopy whether that risk is due to HPV-positive ASC-US, HPV-positive low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or greater, HPV 16–positive NILM, a posttreatment positive HPV test, or any other set of results predicting equally high risk. If a positive result from a new triage test for HPV-positive patients is convincingly shown to convey a CIN 3+ risk greater than or equal to 4.0% upon immediate referral to colposcopy, there would be no need for a new consensus conference to determine how to use that test in clinical practice: the management of a positive result would be to refer to colposcopy (with optional or even preferred, expedited treatment if risk is sufficiently high). By the guiding principle of "Equal Management of Equal Risk", the guideline would be evident and easily settled.

### Risk estimates supporting the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^31cf0ea8]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Data Presentation: Current Results and History

Two central questions underlie risk estimations: (a) What are the current results? (b) What past results affect the risk estimate for the current results? The "current results" are those for which the clinician is seeking guidance, either an HPV test or cotest result (see Tables 1A – 2C 4A – 5B) or a colposcopy/biopsy result (see Table 3). The past results that impact risk estimates are noted under "history". Table 1A refers to patients without a recent documented HPV test or cotest result, so the history is simply "unknown". In Table 1B, "history" refers to recent documented negative HPV test (management after a prior negative cotest is so similar that we do not show them, interested readers can consult the full tables online). However, documented negative cytology provides relatively less reduction in risk compared with a negative HPV or cotest as history. Therefore, patients with a negative cytology history will still be managed by Table 1A. In Tables 2A B C, "history" refers to the abnormal screening test result preceding the current result: HPV-negative ASC-US (Table 2A), HPV-negative LSIL (Table 2B), and HPV-positive NILM (Table 2C). In Table 3, "history" refers to the precolposcopy test results. In Table 4A, "history" refers to both the colposcopy result (< CIN 2) and a low-grade test result preceding colposcopy. In Table 4B, "history" again refers to both the colposcopy result (< CIN 2) and preceding test result but addresses when a high-grade test result preceded the colposcopy.

In Tables 5A and 5B, "history" refers to treatment for CIN 2 or CIN 3, and "current results" are HPV test results or cotest results after treatment. For Tables 5A and 5B, the risk estimation in this scenario (i.e. posttreatment) derives specifically from treated CIN 3 and the test result at the follow-up visit after treatment. The risk remains higher for treated CIN 3 compared with CIN 2 scenarios. However, to maximize safety after treatment of precancer, management is recommended based on the risks of patients treated for CIN 3. Thus, the management recommendations apply to both treated CIN 2 and CIN 3.

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical screening tests [^14848ff0]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Medium credibility.

Cytology-negative, HPV-positive women 30 years and older — risk and follow-up: Women negative by both tests have a "less than 1 in 1,000 risk of having CIN 2+" and "should not be rescreened before 3 years". In screened populations, the prevalence data showed "6.5%, and 58% of the HPV-positive women had a concurrent negative cytology", and the risk of undetected CIN 2+ in cytology-negative, HPV-positive women ranged "from 2.4% to 5.1%". For comparison, "CIN 2+ was detected at enrollment colposcopy in 10.2% of women of unknown HPV status with ASC-US in ALTS". Natural history data indicate "60% of HPV-positive women became HPV negative after a median follow-up of 6 months". Accordingly, "repeat cytology and HPV testing at 12 months seems to be the best management approach", with persistently HPV-positive women on repeat testing who "should undergo colposcopy, even if cytology negative", while those negative on both tests "can be rescreened in 3 years".

### Response to letter to the editor regarding: 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^28181bb2]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

ASCCP 2019 risk-based management — revised Figure 2 legend for human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) outlines risk-based actions. The initial screening result would lead to colposcopy (immediate risk = 4.45%). If colposcopy shows less than cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2, the 5-year risk is 2.9% (1-year return). At the 1-year return visit, a second HPV-positive ASC-US result has an immediate risk of 3.1% (1-year return). If the HPV test or cotest performed for the second postcolposcopy surveillance test is negative, return in 3 years is recommended. If the second postcolposcopy surveillance test results are either a positive HPV test with any cytology result or a negative HPV test result with a cytology result of atypical squamous cells–cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or higher, colposcopy is recommended. Return in 1 year is recommended for HPV-negative ASC-US or HPV-negative low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion results. Note similar management would be recommended for any minimally abnormal test result less severe than atypical squamous cells–cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. NA indicates not applicable because stable risk estimates are not available.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^34d51296]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Guideline: When patients have an estimated 5-year CIN 3+ risk of 0.15% or greater but less than 0.55% based on history and current test results, repeat testing in 3 years with HPV-based testing is recommended (AII).

Rationale: Using the principle of equal management for equal risk, the 3-year return Clinical Action Threshold corresponds to the 5-year CIN 3+ risk after negative cervical cytology in the general population, for whom national guidelines recommend a 3-year return. Estimated 5-year CIN 3+ risks after a negative cytology result without HPV testing ranged from 0.33% in the KPNC population to 0.52% in the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry, to an estimated 0.45% in the screened population of the CDC's National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program. Thus, 0.55% was considered an appropriate value for the Clinical Action Threshold. Three-year surveillance is recommended for patients whose risk falls between the 3- and 5-year follow-up thresholds. Consistent with the 2012 guidelines, patients with a low-grade cotest result (e.g. HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL) followed by a colposcopy with results of less than CIN 2, followed in turn by a negative follow-up HPV test or cotest reach the 3-year return threshold (see Figure 2). Also consistent with previous guidelines, patients with an HPV-negative ASC-US screening result in the setting of an unknown history can return at 3 years (estimated 5 year CIN 3+ risk 0.40%).

FIGURE 2
This figure demonstrates how a patient with a common low-grade screening abnormality (HPV-positive ASC-US) would be managed based on risk estimates. The initial screening result would lead to colposcopy (immediate risk 4.2%). Colposcopy of less than CIN 2 has a 5-year risk of 3.2% (1-year return). At the 1-year return visit, a second HPV-positive ASC-US result has an immediate risk of 3.1% (1-year return). If the patient has a repeat abnormal screen at the next follow-up, colposcopy is recommended. If the HPV-based test is negative, return in 3 years is recommended. NA, not applicable because stable risk estimates are not available.

ASCCP risk-based management example (HPV-positive ASC-US) — initial screening shows Immediate CIN3+ Risk = 4.5% with management of Colposcopy; if colposcopic biopsy result is < CIN2, the 5-year CIN3+ risk is 2.9% and management is 1-year follow-up; at first follow-up surveillance with HPV-positive ASC-US, Immediate CIN3+ Risk = 3.1% and management is 1-year follow-up; at second follow-up surveillance, HPV-negative NILM leads to 5-year CIN3+ Risk = NA with management of 3-year follow-up, whereas HPV-positive ASC-US yields Risk = NA with management of Colposcopy; NA indicates not applicable because stable risk estimates are not available.

### Five-year risks of CIN 3 + and cervical cancer among women who test pap-negative but are HPV-positive [^84b5aabd]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Current US guidelines for cotesting recommend that the large numbers of women who test Pap-negative, but human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive, return in 1 year, and those who remain HPV-positive or have low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) or worse Pap results be referred for colposcopy. However, the performance of these guidelines in routine clinical practice has not been evaluated.

Methods

We estimated cumulative 5-year risks of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse (CIN 3+) among 32,374 women aged 30 to 64 years with HPV-positive/Pap-negative cotest results at Kaiser Permanente Northern California during 2003 to 2010.

Results

The 5-year CIN 3+ risk after an HPV-positive/Pap-negative cotest result, which was found in 3.6% of women, was 4.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.2%-4.8%). The 5-year cancer risk was 0.34% (95% CI = 0.26%-0.45%), and half of the cases were adenocarcinoma. Overall, 48% of the women remained HPV-positive on return (median = 418 days after baseline), a percentage that varied little over ages 30 to 64 years. At the return after a baseline HPV-positive/Pap-negative result, almost every repeat cotest result predicted greater subsequent 5-year CIN 3+ risk than the same cotest result had at baseline (HPV-positive/LSIL, 9.2% vs 6.1%, p = .01; HPV-positive/atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASC-US], 7.9% vs 6.8%, p = .2; HPV-positive/Pap-negative, 7.4% vs 4.5%, p < .0001; HPV-negative/LSIL,1.7% vs 2.0%, p = .8; HPV-negative/ASC-US, 2.9% vs 0.43%, p = .0005; HPV-negative/Pap-negative, 0.93% vs 0.08%, p < .0001).

Conclusions

Using the principle of "equal management of equal risks", women testing HPV-positive/Pap-negative had a subsequent CIN 3+ risk consistent with risk thresholds for a 1-year return. However, on returning in approximately 1 year, about one-half of women will be referred for colposcopy because of continued HPV positivity or Pap abnormality. Clinicians should keep in mind that cotest results at the return after a baseline HPV-positive/Pap-negative finding are riskier than the same baseline cotest results in the general population, supporting intensified clinical management at return testing.

### Risk estimates supporting the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^9bcef28a]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

Risk-based management scenarios and eligibility after a prior HPV-negative screen are outlined as follows: Scenario 1 describes initial management of abnormal screening results; Table 1A addresses patients without a documented recent HPV test result, and to qualify for Table 1B, a patient's current abnormal screening test result must be preceded by a negative HPV test documented in the medical record within the past approximately 5 years (e.g., a normal screening interval); Scenario 2 describes surveillance after abnormal results not requiring immediate colposcopy referral, including management of current cotest results after a previous result of HPV-negative ASC-US, HPV-negative LSIL, and HPV-positive NILM; Scenario 3 describes management upon receipt of colposcopy/biopsy results; Scenario 4 describes management after a colposcopy at which CIN 2+ was not found, with Table 4a for low-grade index tests and Table 4b for high-grade index tests; Scenario 5 addresses management after treatment for CIN 2 or CIN 3; and notably, HPV-positive ASC-US and LSIL preceded by a negative HPV test are now recommended to be followed-up in 1 year rather than immediately referred to colposcopy.

### Five-year risks of CIN 3 + and cervical cancer among women with HPV testing of ASC-US pap results [^1f5f8d0d]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

New screening guidelines recommend that human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative/atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) results be considered as equivalent to HPV-negative/Pap-negative results, leading to rescreening in 5 years. However, despite ample data, the routine clinical performance of HPV testing of women with ASC-US has not been adequately documented.

Methods

We estimated 5-year risks of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3+ and of cancer among 2 groups of women between 2003 and 2010 at Kaiser Permanente Northern California: 27,050 aged 30 to 64 years who underwent HPV and Pap cotesting and had an ASC-US Pap result and 12,209 aged 25 to 29 years who underwent HPV triage of ASC-US.

Results

Five-year risks of CIN 3+ and of cancer among women aged 30 to 64 years testing HPV-negative/ASC-US and among 923,152 women testing Pap-negative alone were similar although statistically distinguishable (CIN 3+, 0.43% vs 0.26%, p = .001; cancer, 0.050% vs 0.025%, p = .1). The increased risk of cancer after HPV-negative/ASC-US versus Pap-negative alone was confined to women aged 60 to 64 years (0.26% vs 0.035%, p = .3). Five-year risks of CIN 3+ and cancer among women with HPV-negative/ASC-US results were substantially higher than those among women testing HPV-negative/Pap-negative (CIN 3+, 0.43% vs 0.08%, p < .0001; cancer, 0.050% vs 0.011%, p = .003). For women aged 30 to 64 years testing HPV-positive/ASC-US, 5-year risks of CIN 3+ and cancer were slightly higher than those among 9,374 women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) (CIN 3+, 6.8% vs 5.2%, p = .0007; cancer, 0.41% vs 0.16%, p = .04). Similar patterns were seen for women aged 25 to 29 years.

Conclusions

Women with HPV-negative/ASC-US had a similar risk as women testing Pap-negative alone but had a higher risk than women testing HPV-negative/Pap-negative. Based upon the principle of "equal management of equal risks", our findings support the equal management of women with HPV-negative/ASC-US and those with Pap-negative alone, except for exiting women from screening because cancer risks at ages 60 to 64 years may be higher for women testing HPV-negative/ASC-US. Our findings also support managing HPV-positive/ASC-US and LSIL similarly.

The HPV–negative ASC-US is also a reassuring history result (see Table 2A). A negative cotest after HPV-negative ASC-US warrants return to screening at 5-year intervals (5-year CIN 3+ risk is 0.14%, which is less than the 0.15% 5-year surveillance threshold). Minor abnormalities (e.g. HPV-positive ASC-US and HPV-positive LSIL) after HPV-negative ASC-US are recommended to be followed in 1 year, rather than proceed immediately to colposcopy (see Table 2A). Though higher risk than HPV-negative ASC-US, HPV-negative LSIL is less risky than previously thought, allowing minor abnormalities after HPV-negative LSIL (i.e. HPV-negative ASC-US, HPV-negative LSIL, and HPV-positive NILM) to be followed in 1 year, rather than proceed immediately to colposcopy (see Table 2B). In addition, HPV-negative ASC-US and HPV-negative LSIL after HPV-positive NILM are recommended to have a deferred management of 1-year surveillance (see Table 2C).

Colposcopy performed for low-grade abnormalities, which confirms the absence of CIN 2+ reduces risk. After a colposcopic examination performed for low-grade abnormalities (e.g.; HPV-positive NILM × 2, HPV-positive ASC-US, or HPV-positive LSIL) at which CIN 1 or less was confirmed via biopsy, minor abnormalities (e.g. HPV-positive ASC-US and HPV-positive LSIL) found on the first follow-up test are recommended to be followed in 1 year, rather than proceed immediately to colposcopy (see Table 4A). Because all repeat abnormalities were referred back to colposcopy at KPNC, we cannot estimate risks for additional rounds of follow-up. Therefore, the 2019 guidelines recommend referral for colposcopy for abnormal results occurring on subsequent rounds of follow-up testing.

Precolposcopy screening — analysis population and prior-result strata are defined: Analyses were restricted to 1,546,426 patients with no known history of CIN 2+ or hysterectomy who were not missing HPV or cytology results at the initial screen, with insufficient and noncancer histology results excluded. Risks were estimated for a given testing round, and beginning with the second round risks informed precolposcopy management after immediately prior results of HPV negative, HPV positive/NILM, cotest negative, HPV negative/ASC-US, or HPV negative/LSIL; risk estimates were not provided for other prior abnormal results such as HPV positive/ASC-US or HPV positive/LSIL.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors: erratum [^112ce832]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

2019 ASCCP risk-based management erratum — Figure 2 legend for minimally abnormal HPV-positive ASC-US specifies corrected risk estimates and recommendations. This figure demonstrates how a patient with a common minimally abnormal screening test result (HPV-positive ASC-US) would be managed based on risk estimates. The initial screening result would lead to colposcopy (immediate risk 4.45%). If colposcopy shows less than CIN 2, the 5-year risk is 2.9% (1-year return). At the 1-year return visit, a second HPV-positive ASC-US result has an immediate risk of 3.1% (1-year return). If the HPV-based test performed for the second post-colposcopy surveillance test is negative, return in 3 years is recommended. If the second post-colposcopy surveillance test results are either a positive HPV test with any cytology result or a negative HPV test result with a cytology result of ASC-H or higher, colposcopy is recommended. Return in 1 year is recommended for HPV-negative ASCUS or LSIL results. Note similar management would be recommended if the initial abnormality preceding colposcopy were any minimally abnormal test result (i.e., less severe than ASC-H). The erratum clarifies that the prior legend instead reported immediate risk 4.2% and a 5-year risk of 3.2% (1-year return).

### Risk estimates supporting the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^24f50746]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

ASCCP 2019 risk-based management — immediate and 5-year risks of CIN 3+ for abnormal screening results when there are no known prior HPV test results are presented with recommended actions. For Unknown HPV-positive HSIL+, CIN 3+ immediate risk is 49 and CIN 3+ 5-year risk is 53 with Colposcopy/treatment. For Unknown HPV-positive ASC-H, risks are 26 immediate and 35 at 5 years with Colposcopy. For Unknown HPV-positive LSIL, risks are 4.3 immediate and 6.9 at 5 years with Colposcopy. For Unknown HPV-positive ASC-US, risks are 4.8 immediate and 7.3 at 5 years with Colposcopy. For Unknown HPV-positive NILM, risks are 2.1 immediate and 4.8 at 5 years with 1-y follow-up. For Unknown HPV-negative NILM, risks are 0.04 immediate and 0.12 at 5 years with 5-y follow-up. Notes specify that HPV-negative ASC-H and AGC are referred to colposcopy although they do not exceed the 4% immediate colposcopy threshold, and that HPV-negative HSIL+ is seen in only 0.01% of the population with an immediate risk of 25%; HPV-positive "ALL" are excluded from the table to avoid duplication.

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical screening tests [^cdad1fd5]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Medium credibility.

Atypical squamous cells (ASC) — subcategories, prevalence, and HPV positivity: ASC are subcategorized into atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H); the median reporting rate of ASC-US in US laboratories is 4.7%, and the median rate of ASC-H is 0.4%, the prevalence of invasive cancer is low in women with ASC (approximately 0.1%–0.2%), the prevalence of CIN 2,3 among women with ASC is 7% to 12% versus 26% to 68% among women with ASC-H, and high-risk HPV DNA positivity is 40% to 51% among women with ASC-US but 74% to 88% among women with ASC-H; consequently, ASC-H should be considered to represent equivocal HSIL and a productive HPV infection.

3) Update to interval for repeating unsatisfactory cytology: The recommendation statement has been updated to reflect evidence that waiting 2 months before repeating the cytology test is not necessary.

Guideline: For patients with an unsatisfactory cytology result and no, unknown, or a negative HPV test result, repeat age-based screening (cytology, cotest, or primary HPV test) as soon as convenient and no later than 4 months is recommended (BIII).

Rationale: The 2- to 4-month waiting period was initially proposed due to early studies indicating differences in cytology results repeated over a short time interval. The recommendation was carried forward through several guideline iterations, but rereview of evidence supports revision of the 2-month waiting period. A seminal article in 2005 specifically addressed this question and found the concern of reduced cellularity with short interval repeat not to hold true. In this study, the cytology interval ranged from 8 to 30 days in 763 women, 31 to 60 days in 2,317 women, 61 to 90 days in 1,090 women, 91 to 120 days in 491 women, and 121 to 184 days in 394 women. They found that repeat cytologic interpretations of unsatisfactory findings, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) did not vary among the Pap interval groups. Most importantly, the approximate cellularity of the samples was slightly better in the interval group of 8 to 30 days (P trend = 0.04). In addition, higher rates of unsatisfactory results have been documented in patients with cancer compared with those with CIN3 or lower grade results. Waiting to repeat an unsatisfactory cytology in the presence of cancer could lead to harm, specifically if other recommended workup for symptomatic patients is not performed. For this reason, the 2019 recommendations were updated.

Cervical cancer screening — key messages state that those at average risk should start getting cytology tests at age 21 years, the cytology test can find abnormal cervical cells and an HPV test detects HPV infection of the cervix, the HPV test can be used alone or as cotesting for those aged ≥ 30 years to 65 years, and the HPV test is also used after ASC-US among persons aged > 25 years; positive cytology and HPV tests are markers of cervical precancerous lesions requiring appropriate follow-up, and HPV is common and often controlled without medical intervention so a positive HPV test does not mean cancer.

### Benchmarking CIN 3 + risk as the basis for incorporating HPV and pap cotesting into cervical screening and management guidelines [^7b6cb3c6]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

In 2012, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and a consensus of 25 organizations endorsed concurrent cytology and human papillomavirus (HPV) testing ("cotesting") for cervical cancer screening. Past screening and management guidelines were implicitly based on risks defined by Pap-alone, without consideration of HPV test results. To promote management that is consistent with accepted practice, new guidelines incorporating cotesting should aim to achieve equal management of women at equal risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 and cancer (CIN 3+).

Methods

We estimated cumulative 5-year risks of CIN 3+ for 965,360 women aged 30 to 64 years undergoing cotesting at Kaiser Permanente Northern California over 2003 to 2010. We calculated the implicit risk thresholds for Pap-alone and applied them for new management guidance on HPV and Pap cotesting, citing 2 examples: HPV-positive/atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and HPV-negative/Pap-negative. We call this guidance process "benchmarking".

Results

A low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion result, for which immediate colposcopy is prescribed, carries a 5-year CIN 3+ risk of 5.2%, suggesting that test results with similar risks should be managed with colposcopy. Similarly, ASC-US (2.6% risk) is managed with a 6- to 12-month follow-up visit and Pap-negative (0.26% risk) is managed with a 3-year follow-up visit. The 5-year CIN 3+ risk for women with HPV-positive/ASC-US was 6.8% (95% confidence interval = 6.2%-7.6%). This is greater than the 5.2% risk implicitly leading to referral to colposcopy, consistent with current management recommendations that HPV-positive/ASC-US should be referred for immediate colposcopy. The 5-year CIN 3+ risk for women with HPV-negative/Pap-negative was 0.08% (95% confidence interval = 0.07%-0.09%), far below the 0.26% implicitly required for a 3-year return and justifying a longer (e.g., 5-year) return.

Conclusions

Using the principle of "equal management of equal risks", benchmarking to implicit risk thresholds based on Pap-alone can be used to achieve safe and consistent incorporation of cotesting.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^1503ac56]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

§ Negative HPV test or cotest (HPV plus Pap test) results only reduce risk sufficiently to defer colposcopy if performed for screening purposes within the last 5 years. Colposcopy is still warranted if negative HPV test or cotest results occurred in the context of surveillance for a previous abnormal result.

¶ Expedited treatment is preferred for nonpregnant patients aged ≥ 25 years. Colposcopy with biopsy is an acceptable option if desired by patient after shared decision-making.

The following are highlights of the new management guidelines:

Colposcopy can be deferred for patients at low risk. º If a patient has a minimally abnormal test result (i.e. negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy HPV positive, ASC-US HPV positive, LSIL, or HPV positive) that was preceded by a negative screening HPV test or cotest within the past 5 years, follow-up in 1 year instead of colposcopy is recommended (a negative HPV test or cotest performed during follow-up of abnormal results would not similarly reduce risk). º Referral to colposcopy is recommended if cytology test results are abnormal or the HPV test is positive at the 1-year follow-up visit.
Treatment can be expedited for high-risk patients. º If a patient has a high-grade cytology (Pap test) result (i.e. HSIL) and an HPV test that is positive for HPV type 16, then treatment with a loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) is preferred. A colposcopy with biopsy is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis first. º If a patient who has not been screened in more than 5 years (i.e. rarely screened) has an HSIL cytology result and a positive HPV test (regardless of type), then treatment with LEEP is preferred. A colposcopy with biopsy is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis first. º When considering treatment without confirmatory biopsy, shared decision-making with the patient is important. Considerations include age, concern about cancer, ability to follow up, financial concerns, and concerns about the potential effect of treatment on a future pregnancy.
When primary HPV testing is used for screening, cytology testing should be performed for all positive HPV test results to help determine the next steps in management. º Ideally, cytology testing should be performed by the laboratory as a reflex test from the same specimen so the patient does not need to return to the clinic. Colposcopy is recommended if HPV genotyping is positive for types 16 or 18, and it can be considered if it is infeasible for the patient to return for cytology alone. º HPV 16 is the highest-risk HPV type. Expedited treatment should be considered for HSIL cytology results, and colposcopy is recommended in all other cases, even if the cytology test is normal. º HPV 18 has a relatively high association with cancer, and colposcopy is recommended in all cases, even if the cytology test is normal. Because of the association of HPV 18 with adenocarcinoma, endocervical sampling is acceptable at the time of colposcopy. º If the HPV type is not HPV 16 or 18, and the cytology test is normal, return in 1 year is recommended in most cases.
HPV testing or cotesting is preferred to cytology testing alone for follow-up after an abnormal test result. º Negative HPV testing or cotesting is less likely to miss disease than normal cytology testing alone. Therefore, cytology testing is recommended more often than HPV testing or cotesting for follow-up of abnormal results. Specifically, cytology testing is recommended annually when HPV testing or cotesting is recommended at 3-year intervals, and cytology testing is recommended at 6-month intervals when HPV testing or cotesting is recommended annually.
After treatment for a high-grade precancer (moderate or severe dysplasia), surveillance should continue for at least 25 years. º Initial testing includes an HPV test or cotest at 6, 18, and 30 months. If cytology alone is used, testing should occur at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 months. º After completing initial testing, long-term surveillance includes testing at 3-year intervals if using HPV testing or cotesting, or annual testing if using cytology testing alone. º Surveillance should continue for at least 25 years after the initial treatment, even if this extends beyond age 65 years. If a woman undergoes hysterectomy during the surveillance period, vaginal screening should continue.

ASCCP risk-based management — risk-stratified actions for cervical screening abnormalities are outlined as follows: at the highest risk, expedited treatment can be performed without need for colposcopic biopsy; at somewhat lower but still high risk, colposcopy is recommended to find or rule out precancer requiring treatment; at lower but nonnegligible risk, colposcopy is not needed and surveillance at shortened intervals is prudent with 1 and 3 years maintained as 2 levels of concern/attention; and women at very low risk provided by a negative human papillomavirus (HPV) test (or HPV and cytology cotest) are recommended to continue screening at the 5-year interval.

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical screening tests [^c5772f3c]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Medium credibility.

Atypical squamous cells — cannot exclude high-grade (ASC-H) management — The recommended management of women with ASC-H is referral for colposcopic evaluation (AII). In women in whom cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or 3 (CIN 2,3) is not identified, follow-up with human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing at 12 months or cytological testing at 6 months and 12 months is acceptable (CIII). Referral to colposcopy is recommended for women who subsequently test positive for HPV DNA or who are found to have ASC-US or greater on their repeat cytological tests (BII). If the HPV DNA test is negative or if 2 consecutive repeat cytological tests are "negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy", return to routine cytological screening is recommended (AI). If CIN 2,3 is identified, manage per ASCCP Guideline.

### Hr-HPV testing in the follow-up of women with cytological abnormalities and negative colposcopy [^78521973]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

This is one of the first practical studies to explore the extent to which hr-HPV testing could resolve clinical follow-up management of women with abnormal Pap test and negative assessment for high-grade disease by colposcopy and biopsy.

The status of hr-HPV infections at the index Pap test was known for ASC-US (triage hr-HPV), but not for the other cytologies, because in LSIL or more severe lesions the HPV positivity is very high, so far routine hr-HPV testing for all colposcopy referrals is discouraged. Instead the hr-HPV test could be useful after negative colposcopy.

The proportion of hr-HPV-positive test within 1 year from the negative colposcopy for index Pap test results was very low AGC (28.6%), intermediate for ASC-US/hr-HPV+, ASC-H and LSIL (mean 63.9%) and high for HSIL (84.8%). These values are very similar to those reported in the literature, however, the small number of AGC (only 28) does not allow to generalise the conclusion.

We found 19% of CIN2+ lesions in ASC-US diagnosed women with persistent hr-HPV positivity and similar data were published in previous studies.

Given the high sensitivity for CIN2+ lesions and the high reproducibility of hr-HPV testing, its role in surveillance seems pivotal for a standardised follow-up protocol in which Pap test, whose low reproducibility rates among centres are well known, should be progressively substituted. As any other test, hr-HPV testing may be affected by some false-negative results and, even if only a few of those results have potential clinical significance, most of them are due to a sporadic human error in performing the test. However, it is expected that the introduction of complete automation of the procedure may reduce at least in part the occurrence of such false-negative test results.

### An introduction to the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^bb550923]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

ASCCP 2019 risk-based management — colposcopy referral threshold and equal-risk principle specify that the clinical action threshold for referral to colposcopy is a 4.0% immediate risk of CIN 3+. Patients with an underlying immediate risk of CIN 3+ of 4.0% or more are recommended to have colposcopy when this risk follows HPV-positive ASC-US, HPV-positive low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or greater, HPV 16-positive NILM, a posttreatment positive HPV test, or other equally high-risk results. If a new triage test for HPV-positive patients is shown to convey a CIN 3+ risk greater than or equal to 4.0% upon immediate referral, the management of a positive result would be upgraded to referral to colposcopy, with optional or even preferred, expedited treatment if risk is sufficiently high, consistent with the guiding principle of "Equal Management of Equal Risk".

### Human papillomavirus reporting: minimizing patient and laboratory risk [^31b38261]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Risk management efforts in the cytology laboratory must address the gap between what can be achieved with medical history's most effective cancer screening test, the Papanicolaou (Pap) test, and even higher entrenched public expectations. Data from the Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance (ASCUS)/Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion Triage Study (ALTS) now provide level I clinical evidence from a large, randomized, controlled, multicenter clinical trial that reflex human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing of ASCUS cases is generally the preferred method for initial assessment of the most prevalent category of abnormal Pap interpretation. The proposed combination of HPV DNA testing with cytologic Pap testing, the DNA Pap test, further shows the potential to nearly eliminate false-negative screening results, based on sensitivity and negative predictive values reported in available studies. Human papillomavirus DNA testing also appears to represent a significant enhancement for detection of endocervical adenocarcinomas, which are difficult to detect and prevent. Human papillomavirus DNA testing, when used in conjunction with cervical cytology, can significantly reduce risk to both the patient and the laboratory.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^d34eca65]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

ASCCP risk-based management — one-year surveillance thresholds and indications are as follows: When the estimated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse (CIN 3+) risk is below the threshold for immediate colposcopy (4.0% immediate risk) and above the 3-year follow-up threshold (≥ 0.55% at 5 years), repeat testing in 1 year with human papillomavirus (HPV)-based testing is recommended (AII). Follow-up at 1 year is recommended after screening tests showing minimal abnormalities — HPV-positive/negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM) or HPV-negative/low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) with unknown previous screening history (immediate risks 2.1% and 1.9% respectively) — and after colposcopy with biopsies of histologic LSIL (CIN 1) or less preceded by a low-grade cotest result (defined as HPV-positive LSIL, HPV-positive atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASC-US], or repeated HPV-positive NILM). Because risk is substantially reduced after a documented negative HPV primary screening test or cotest or normal colposcopic examination with biopsy confirmation of less than CIN 2, 1-year surveillance, not colposcopy, is recommended for most patients with new HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL results after a documented negative HPV test or cotest within approximately 5 years or colposcopic examination less than CIN 2 within the past year. Three-year surveillance is recommended for patients whose risk falls between the 3- and 5-year follow-up thresholds; patients with an HPV-negative ASC-US screening result in the setting of an unknown history can return at 3 years (estimated 5 year CIN 3+ risk of 0.40%), and patients with a low-grade cotest result followed by colposcopy less than CIN 2 and a negative follow-up HPV test or cotest reach the 3-year return threshold. A previous negative cytology result alone does not reduce subsequent risk like a negative HPV-based screen; therefore, cytology alone is not used to modify subsequent management recommendations.

### Cervical cancer screening (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^6efcd7c1]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Human papillomavirus is an oncogenic virus and the etiologic agent of cervical cancer and related premalignant disease. HPV is transmitted by sexual contact. Sexually inactive women rarely develop cervical cancer, while sexual activity at an early age with multiple sexual partners is a strong risk factor. Nearly all women with invasive cervical cancer have evidence of HPV infection. Most women with HPV infection, however, never develop cervical cancer; thus, this infection is necessary but not sufficient for the development of cancer. The HPV triage strategy was as sensitive as immediate colposcopy to detection CIN 2+, while referring only about half of the women for the procedure. Repeat cytology with referral to colposcopy at the threshold of HSIL was less sensitive for CIN 3+ compared with HPV triage; however, using a cytologic threshold of ASCUS for referral increased sensitivity but resulted in 72% of women with ASCUS undergoing colposcopy.

HPV testing is not recommended for adolescent women with ASCUS because most of these women are HPV positive. HPV DNA testing is generally not appropriate or clinically useful after cytology results of LSIL, which is more severe than ASCUS, and most of these women are carcinogenic HPV DNA positive. One exception may be to clarify the risk for postmenopausal women with cytologic LSIL, which is an interpretation that can be falsely positive, presumably due to atrophic changes. 13] A second study of more than 43, 000 women aged 29 to 61 years, one-half of whom underwent three rounds of HPV DNA and cervical cytology cotesting every 5 years, found that the cumulative incidence of CIN 3+ in women with negative results for both tests at baseline was 0. 01% at 9 years and
0. 07% after 14 years of follow-up. [.

Of note, many more women in the HPV DNA arm than in the cytology-alone arm were referred to colposcopy for abnormal findings, prompting the authors to conclude that if the HPV DNA test is used as a primary screening strategy, women with positive test results should be triaged by cytology before referral.

American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) 2019 management of common cervical screening abnormalities — Key actions include: For HPV-negative atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), repeat HPV test with or without concurrent Pap test in 3 yrs; for HPV-negative low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), repeat HPV test with or without concurrent Pap test in 1 yr. For HPV-positive cytology negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM), colposcopy is recommended. If genotyping is positive for HPV 16, HPV 18, or both with ASC-US or LSIL, colposcopy is recommended. For HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL with negative screening results within the previous 5 yrs, repeat HPV test with or without concurrent Pap test in 1 yr. For high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) cytology that is HPV 16 positive, expedited treatment is recommended; if HPV is untyped, positive for a genotype other than HPV 16, or negative with HSIL, colposcopy or expedited treatment is acceptable. Footnotes specify that negative HPV test or cotest results only defer colposcopy if from screening within the last 5 years and that expedited treatment is preferred for nonpregnant patients aged ≥ 25 years.

ASC-US in special populations — prevalence and risk markers: In adolescents and young women, the prevalence of HPV DNA positivity in ALTS was much higher in women 18 to 22 years old (71%) versus those older than 29 years (31%), and another study reported adolescents 19 years old and older with ASC-US had 77% versus 58% in women older than 25 years. In postmenopausal women, ALTS found only 20% of women 40 years and older with ASC-US were HPV DNA positive. Among HIV-infected women, two recent follow-up studies reported that 60% to 78% of HIV-infected women have ASC-US during 4 to 5 years of follow-up. In pregnancy, the risk of cancer is relatively low among pregnant women with ASC-US, and antenatal cytologic evaluation does not identify more disease compared with postpartum follow-up.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines: methods for risk estimation, recommended management, and validation [^e3116af8]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

The new risk-based management consensus guidelines will use risk and clinical action thresholds to determine the appropriate course of management of cervical screening abnormalities. These risk-based management guidelines represent an evolution of the 2012 guidelines, which incorporated human papillomavirus (HPV) test results into an existing cytology-based management framework by benchmarking 5-year risks of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3 or higher (CIN 3+) after HPV-cytology cotest results to that of cytology-only results. Since 2013, screening has continued to evolve with HPV vaccination, the introduction of new screening technology, and new knowledge of how history of negative HPV testing changes the clinical meaning of test results. To address these changes while ensuring that future revisions to management guidelines are equitable and simple to apply, the 2019 guidelines will move from result-based management (e.g. "colposcopic referral for HPV-positive ASC-US cytology") to risk-based management (e.g. "colposcopic referral when immediate risk of having CIN 3+ is 4% or greater").

In this article, we described the additional data sources and improved risk estimation methods used to estimate risks that support the 2019 guidelines. For each management scenario and past/current test result combination, we produced a risk profile of CIN grade 2 or higher (CIN 2+), CIN 3+, and cancer risks from the time of the current test until 5 years after the current test. We formalized how risk is used to determine the recommended risk-based management through the use of clinical action thresholds. Finally, we validated risk estimates by examining portability of risk-based management to diverse settings, including underinsured and underserved patients, using risks estimated from 3 independent, previously unpublished cohorts/trials and one published comparison.

### Five-year risks of CIN 2 + and CIN 3 + among women with HPV-positive and HPV-negative LSIL pap results [^f6e19e2d]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) Pap results do not typically lead to human papillomavirus (HPV) testing. HPV triage is not cost-effective because most cases are HPV-positive. However, under new national guidelines recommending cotesting for women aged 30 to 64 years, clinicians will increasingly receive the HPV test result with LSIL Pap results. Some authors have suggested that HPV triage might be effective at older ages, when the percentage of HPV positivity among women with LSIL declines.

Methods

We estimated 5-year risks of CIN 2+ and CIN 3+ among 9,033 women aged 30 to 64 years who had both an HPV test and an LSIL Pap result.

Results

HPV positivity among women with LSIL decreased only slightly with age (30 to 34 vs 60 to 64 years, 88% vs 72%, p < .0001). The 5-year risks of CIN 2+ and CIN 3+ of women aged 30 to 64 years testing HPV-positive/LSIL were larger than those among women testing HPV-negative/LSIL (CIN 2+, 19% vs 5.1%, p < .0001; CIN 3+, 6.1% vs 2.0%, p < .0001). The 5-year risk of CIN 3+ in HPV-negative/LSIL women was similar to that for women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) Pap test result without knowledge of HPV test results (2.0% vs 2.6%, p = .4).

Conclusions

HPV-negative/LSIL posed lower risk than other Pap results that guidelines currently recommend for referral to immediate colposcopy. By the principle of "equal management of equal risks", women with HPV-negative/LSIL might reasonably be managed similarly to those with ASC-US Pap results without knowledge of HPV testing, that is, retesting at 6 to 12 months, rather than immediate colposcopy. Although the HPV test result for LSIL Pap results provides actionable information to clinicians who screen with cotesting, the high HPV positivity of LSIL at even the oldest ages suggests the lack of cost-effectiveness of HPV triage of LSIL for clinicians who do not use routine cotesting.

### Five-year risk of CIN 3 + to guide the management of women aged 21 to 24 years [^b5b312c2]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Current US national guidelines recommend beginning screening at age 21 using Pap tests only, with cotesting starting at age 30. To inform the management of Pap test abnormalities among women aged 21 to 24 years, who have extremely low cancer risks, we compared risks of CIN 3+ among women aged 21 to 24 versus 25 to 29 years or 30 to 64 years.

Methods

We estimated 5-year risks of CIN 3+ given different Pap test results, with human papillomavirus (HPV) triage of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), among 133,947 women aged 21 to 24 years, compared with 135,382 women aged 25 to 29 years and 965,360 women aged 30 to 64 years, between 2003 and 2010 at Kaiser Permanente Northern California.

Results

There were 3 cancers diagnosed during follow-up in women aged 21 to 24 years. After high-grade Pap results (0.6% of Pap results), the 5-year CIN 3+ risks among women aged 21 to 24 years were comparable to those aged 25 to 29 and 30 to 64 years (atypical glandular cells, 6.9% vs 14% vs 8.5%, p = .8; atypical squamous cells cannot rule out high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, 16% vs 24% vs 18%, p = .8; high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, 28% vs 28% vs 47%, p = .4). After low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, the 5-year CIN 3+ risk was lower among women aged 21 to 24 years (3.0%) than that among women aged 25 to 29 years (5.0%, p = .01) or aged 30 to 64 years (5.2%, p = .0002). Although the 5-year CIN 3+ risk after HPV-negative/ASC-US was similar across all 3 groups (0.57% vs 0.59% vs 0.43%, p = 1), risk after HPV-positive/ASC-US was lower among women aged 21 to 24 years (4.4%) than that among women aged 25 to 29 years (7.1%, p < .0001) or 30 to 64 years (6.8%, p < .0001).

Conclusions

Women aged 21 to 24 years had almost zero cancer risk, and positive Pap test results predicted low CIN 3+ risk except for the 0.6% of women with high-grade Pap results. The generally low risk supports conservative management of women aged 21 to 24 years.

### Hr-HPV testing in the follow-up of women with cytological abnormalities and negative colposcopy [^7b48c41c]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

The success of any cervical cancer prevention programme relies on the interplay between the underlying risk factors and the type of screening programme: an organised programme is more effective than an opportunistic programme. Furthermore, the existence and quality of the field and laboratory facilities for screening and diagnostic follow-up, as well as the facilities available for treating diagnosed lesions, are key elements of any screening programme. Monitoring the patient path or 'chain of action' for each patient with an abnormal screening result is of crucial importance. In Italy, despite the availability of well-functioning screening programmes spreading all over the country, the follow-up protocol after abnormal Pap test and negative colposcopy is not clearly defined.

While existing uniformity of indications in case of cytological abnormalities and diagnosis of Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia grade 2 or more severe (CIN2+) (excisional therapy), there is no uniformity of indications for the abnormal cytology. The European guidelines suggest the hr-HPV test in the follow-up after negative colposcopy only for some cytological results: Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance (ASC-US), Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (LSIL) and Atypical Squamous Cells cannot exclude a High-Grade Lesion (ASC-H). However, these indications are not universally applied in the Italian cervical cancer screening programmes and in majority of the programmes the follow-up of abnormal Pap test and negative colposcopy is usually managed according to the gynaecologist judgment.

4.4 Atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude HSIL

ASC-H is a heterogeneous diagnostic category with cytological changes suggestive of HSIL, accounting for 5–10% of atypical squamous cells in TBS for reporting cervical cytology. Kaiser Permanente Northern California Medical Care Plan data indicated that ASC-H confers a higher risk of CIN3+ over time than ASC-US or LSIL, and the high rate of HPV detection in women with ASC-H makes reflex HPV testing unsuitable. Both the 2012 and 2019 ASCCP guidelines recommended that for women with ASC-H cytology, colposcopy should be performed regardless of HPV result. They also noted that reflex HPV testing is not recommended in this setting. Many studies have demonstrated that HPV-positive rates in women with ASC-H Pap test results were 50–60% and women with ASC-H Pap with negative HPV tests would have a very low risk of high-grade cervical lesions. – In the USA, many laboratories provide reflex HPV testing for ASC-H Pap.HPV testing results can provide useful risk stratification information in women with ASC-H Pap tests.

### Detection of cervical neoplasia by human papillomavirus testing in an atypical squamous cells-undetermined significance population: results of the becton dickinson onclarity trial [^dd6fff9f]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Atypical squamous cells-undetermined significance (ASC-US) is the most common cervical cytologic abnormality. The College of American Pathologists lists the median reporting rate of ASC-US among laboratories in the United States as 5.0% in the 2017 Cytopathology Checklist. Fortunately, only a small minority of women with ASC-US have a high-grade cervical cancer precursor (ie, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions [HSIL] and adenocarcinoma in situ) as well as invasive cervical cancers. Two recent large US cervical cancer screening trials reported an overall prevalence of high-grade cervical cancer precursors in women with ASC-US of 5.1% (n = 1,578)to 9.7% (n = 939); no invasive cervical cancers in women with ASC-US were identified in either study. Because most high-grade cervical cancer precursors and invasive cervical cancers are caused by 13 high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes, HPV testing has become the predominant approach to managing women with ASC-US, both in North America and Europe.HPV-positive women with ASC-US are referred for colposcopy, whereas HPV-negative women with ASC-US are followed-up with repeat testing in 12 months. This approach is recommended by US clinical management guidelines.

ASC-US general management — women older than 20 years: A program that includes testing for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV), repeat cervical cytological testing, or colposcopy are all acceptable methods for managing women older than 20 years with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) (AI). When liquid-based cytology is used, or when co-collection for HPV DNA testing can be done, reflex HPV DNA testing is the preferred approach (AI). Women with ASC-US who are HPV DNA negative can be followed up with repeat cytological testing at 12 months (BII). Women who have HPV DNA positive should be managed in the same fashion as women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and be referred for colposcopic evaluation (AII). Endocervical sampling is preferred for women in whom no lesions are identified (BII) and those with an unsatisfactory colposcopy (AII) but is acceptable for women with a satisfactory colposcopy and a lesion identified in the transformation zone (CII). Acceptable postcolposcopy management options when CIN is not identified are HPV DNA testing at 12 months and repeat cytological testing at 6 and 12 months (BII), and it is recommended that HPV DNA testing not be performed at intervals less than 12 months (EIII).

### Hr-HPV testing in the follow-up of women with cytological abnormalities and negative colposcopy [^2b77ce60]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

In the organised screening programme of the District of Florence, Italy, hr-HPV testing has been introduced in post-colposcopy follow-up of women with abnormal cytology and first assessment by colposcopy negative for CIN2+ lesions since 2006. According to the natural history of cervical cancer, only women with persistent hr-HPV infection are at major risk to develop a CIN. This knowledge prompted us to perform hr-HPV testing after 1 year from the initial assessment for cytological abnormalities.

The present study evaluated the efficacy of hr-HPV test in the surveillance of women with abnormal Pap test (ASC-US/hr-HPV positive, LSIL, ASC-H, High-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (HSIL), Atypical Glandular Cells (AGC)) and negative colposcopy in current clinical practice.

Verification of Disease Status.

This study combined individual data from five studies to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity for the detection of histological CIN2+ and CIN3+. In most studies, cytology and biopsy slides were read at CICAMS. International pathology experts reviewed 14.8% of cytology and 35.0% of biopsy results and independently assessed them for quality control.

To pool the data, we unified the criteria to verify disease status. The gold standard was histologically confirmed biopsy results. In our study population, the 7449 (56%) of 13 140 women who had no biopsy results, negative Physician-HPV tests, and negative or ASC-US results from LBC were considered to be disease free. This standard was based on findings from the SPOCCS I project that only one women with CIN2+ (1 [0.07%] of 1511 women, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.003% to 0.4%) and no women with CIN3+ (0 [0.0%] of 1511 women, 95% CI = 0.0% to 0.2%) were diagnosed among the group of women who had negative Physician-HPV tests and negative or ASC-US results from LBC and had received colposcopy and biopsy. One woman who had no biopsy, negative cytology, a positive Physician-HPV test, and negative colposcopy was also categorized as disease negative. Women without biopsy results were considered to have incomplete results if they had the following test results and were therefore excluded from analysis: 1) 17 (0.1%) of 13 140 women with positive Pap tests that indicated presence of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or more severe cytology; 2) seven (0.05%) of 13 140 women with ASC-US Pap tests and positive Physician-HPV tests, and 3) 27 (0.2%) of 13 140 women with positive Physician-HPV tests and negative cytology and missing or positive colposcopy.

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical screening tests [^79b03ea0]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Medium credibility.

Management of women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) — initial follow-up, HPV triage, and post-colposcopy care are specified with graded recommendations. Cytological testing should be performed at 6-month intervals until 2 consecutive "negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy" results are obtained (AII), and colposcopy is recommended for women with ASC-US or greater cytological abnormality on a repeat test (AII); after 2 repeat negatives, women can return to routine cytological screening (AII). HPV DNA testing is presented as "Preferred if liquid-based cytology or co-collection available", with "HPV Positive* (managed in same manner as women with LSIL)". When colposcopy is used, "Endocervical sampling [is] preferred in women with no lesions, and those with unsatisfactory colposcopy", and if CIN is not identified, repeat cytology at 12 months is recommended (BIII); the algorithm lists "Cytology @ 6 to 12 mos OR HPV DNA Testing @ 12 mos", proceeding to "Repeat Colposcopy" for " ≥ ASC or HPV (+)" and to "Routine Screening" if "Negative", while cases with "CIN" are to "Manage per ASCCP Guideline". Because of overtreatment concerns, "the routine use of diagnostic excisional procedures such as the loop electrosurgical excision is unacceptable for women with an initial ASC-US in the absence of histologically diagnosed CIN 2,3.

Referral to colposcopy is recommended for women who subsequently test positive for high-risk (oncogenic) HPV DNA or who are found to have atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or greater on repeat cytology; if both tests are negative, women can return to routine cytological testing (BII).

### Negative colposcopic biopsy after positive human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA testing: false-positive HPV results or false-negative histologic findings? [^d37dfa07]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

We studied histologic examination-related factors contributing to false-negative colposcopic biopsy results. Patients positive for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA with negative cervical histologic findings were identified between January 2002 and December 2003. Three additional H&E-stained levels were obtained when the original diagnosis was confirmed on review. Patients with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC) Papanicolaou test results, positive HPV DNA results, and negative cervical histologic findings accounted for 4.5% of all ASC smears submitted for HPV DNA testing. Slides and tissue blocks were available for 95 cases; 4% had focal HPV infection or mild dysplasia. When deeper levels were examined, 31% had clinically significant lesions: HPV infection or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1, 19%; CIN 2/3, 8%; and dysplasia, not otherwise specified, 3%. Of the remaining patients, follow-up revealed squamous abnormalities in 25%. About 5% of patients with positive HPV DNA results had a negative follow-up biopsy result. "False-negative" biopsies accounted for one third of cases. Additional levels should be obtained for discrepant results. Close follow-up is crucial when the initial biopsy result is negative because a small number of patients will have squamous abnormalities in subsequent studies.

### "Equivocal" high-risk HPV DNA tests performed on thinPrep specimens after ASC-US diagnoses are associated with an increased incidence of CIN3: a cytologic / histologic review of 315 cases [^f373982e]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The Hybrid Capture II high-risk HPV test (HC II hrHPVT) improves early detection of cervical neoplasia in Pap tests. However, weakly positive HC II results may be reported as indeterminate or "equivocal", for which there is little clinical guidance. This study is designed to evaluate the clinical outcome of equivocal HC II hrHPVTs and concurrent atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) on ThinPrep Pap specimens through correlation with 2-year follow-up cervical biopsies.

Materials and Methods

Over a 5-year period, ThinPrep Pap tests diagnosed as ASC-US were grouped according to their hrHPVT results (i.e., positive, negative, or equivocal) and correlated with histologic follow-up. All equivocal and representative positive and negative hrHPVTs were included. Biopsies showing high-grade dysplasia were reviewed by two pathologists.

Results

Of 9,012 ASCUS Pap tests, 945 had corresponding hrHPVTs and follow-up cervical biopsies. High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL-cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2/3, CIN2/3) was identified in 20.3% (14/69) of biopsies after equivocal hrHPVTs (CIN2-5.8%, CIN3-14.5% (p = .0261); 16.7% (25/150) after positive hrHPVT (CIN2-12%, CIN3-4.7%); and 5.4% (5/93) of biopsies after negative hrHPVT (CIN2-4.3%, CIN3-1.1%).

Conclusion

ASC-US in association with equivocal and positive HC II results respectively shows similar incidences of CIN2/3 on 2-year follow-up cervical biopsy. Additionally, a significant proportion of CIN3 biopsies are in the equivocal HC II cohort. As clinical decision making would be impacted by this finding, laboratories should consider evaluating the clinical performance of their HC II assay via correlation with subsequent cervical biopsies.

cytological methods.

The occurrence of false-negative and unsatisfactory Pap smears has prompted the development of LBC and automated screening devices. The quality of the evaluation of the performance of these technologies often was poor and rarely on the basis of histologically defined outcomes using randomised study designs. In general, the proportion of unsatisfactory samples is lower in LBC compared with conventional cytology, and the interpretation of LBC requires less time. The cost of an individual LBC test is considerably higher, but ancillary molecular testing, such as high-risk HPV testing in the case of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), can be carried out on the same sample. The economic advantage of LBC due to the reduction of recalls for a new sample depends on the existing rates of inadequate Pap smears, which are highly variable throughout Europe.
An Italian population-based randomised study recently confirmed that the sensitivities of LBC and conventional cytology are similar.
Computer-assisted screening using LBC is currently being evaluated, but insufficient evidence is available for guidelines.

Supporting evidence includes a study in which the cytology interval ranged from 8 to 30 days in 763 women, 31 to 60 days in 2,317 women, 61 to 90 days in 1,090 women, 91 to 120 days in 491 women, and 121 to 184 days in 394 women, with approximate cellularity slightly better at 8 to 30 days (P = 0.04). Higher rates of unsatisfactory results have been documented in patients with cancer compared with those with CIN3 or lower grade results, and waiting to repeat an unsatisfactory cytology result could lead to harm; for this reason, the 2019 recommendations were updated.

Approaches to managing women with ASC-US: Clinical data from ALTS and other studies have demonstrated that 2 repeat cytological examinations performed at 6-month intervals, testing for HPV, and a single colposcopic examination are all safe and effective approaches, and the 2001 Consensus Guidelines recognized that all 3 approaches were acceptable; a meta-analysis performed in 2004 reported that the pooled estimate of the sensitivity of HPV testing for detecting women with CIN 2,3 is considerably higher than that of a single repeat cytology, and in ALTS repeating cytology twice at 6-month intervals detected 95% of CIN 3 lesions using an ASC-US threshold for colposcopy and referred 67% of the women to colposcopy, while for comparison a single HPV test identified 92% of CIN 3 lesions.

ASCUSListen to pronunciationA finding of abnormal cells in the tissue that lines the outer part of the cervix. ASCUS is the most common abnormal finding in a Pap test. It may be a sign of infection with certain types of human papillomavirus or other types of infection, such as a yeast infection. It may also be a sign of inflammation, low hormone levels, or a benign growth, such as a cyst or polyp. More testing, such as an HPV test or another Pap test, may be needed.

ASCCP 2019 risk-based management — reflex triage for positive HPV tests and HPV16/18 actions: All positive HPV screening tests, regardless of genotype, should have additional reflex triage testing performed from the same laboratory specimen, HPV 16 or 18 infections have the highest risk for CIN 3 and occult cancer so additional evaluation is necessary even when cytology results are negative, and if HPV 16 or 18 testing is positive and additional laboratory testing of the same sample is not feasible, the patient should proceed directly to colposcopy.

HPV-based testing: this term is used in this document to describe the use of either cotesting or primary HPV screening for surveillance after abnormalities. It does not apply to reflex HPV testing for triage of ASC-US cytology in this document. The HPV testing and positive HPV results discussed throughout this document refer to high-risk HPV types only.

Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology (LAST): this term refers to 2-tiered pathology criteria for evaluating histologic specimens obtained via colposcopic biopsy

Primary HPV testing: testing with HPV testing alone as a screening or surveillance test.

Reflex testing: this means that laboratories should perform a specific additional triage test in the setting of a positive screening test to inform the next steps in management. For example, an ASC-US cytology should trigger a reflex HPV test. New for these guidelines, a positive a positive primary HPV screening test should trigger both a reflex genotyping test (to determine the presence/absence of HPV 16/18 if that information is not included in the initial primary test result) and also a reflex cytology test to determine whether the patient would be a candidate for expedited management.

4) Patient Scenarios Not Initially Addressed in the 2019 Guidelines:

Additional guidance was developed to address scenarios for which the 2019 Guidelines did not initially provide management recommendations. This guidance was voted on in July 2021 and previously published. To summarize, this guidance (1) outlined management guidelines for cytology results without HPV testing among individuals aged 25 years and older and (2) clarified management when previous guidelines had not been followed:

(a) Guideline for individuals aged 25 and older screened with cytology alone: For individuals aged 25 years or older screened with cytology alone, the 2012 guidelines should be followed. In the 2012 guidelines, colposcopy is recommended for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) or a more severe cytologic interpretation.
(b) Guideline for cases in which colposcopy was previously recommended but not completed: In cases in which a colposcopy was previously recommended but not completed, the recommendation is for colposcopy if the previous result was high-grade cytology [atypical squamous cells cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H), atypical glandular cells (AGC), HSIL, or a more severe cytologic interpretation]. If the previous cytology result was not high grade, and the patient undergoes repeat testing with HPV testing or cotesting instead of colposcopy: colposcopy is recommended if the result on repeat testing indicates a second consecutive HPV-positive result and/or persistent cytologic abnormality (ASC-US or a more severe cytologic interpretation); repeat HPV testing or cotesting in 1 year is acceptable if the result on repeat testing is HPV negative or cotest negative.

ASC-US triage approach — reflex HPV testing preference and postcolposcopy follow-up performance: Although all 3 management approaches are considered acceptable for managing women with ASC-US, "reflex" HPV testing is preferred, with reflex testing defined as testing either the original liquid-based cytology residual specimen or a separate sample co-collected at the initial screening visit; this approach spares 40% to 60% of women from undergoing colposcopy and cost-effectiveness analyses have shown that reflex HPV testing is less expensive and more effective at detecting CIN 2,3 than other strategies. Because a single colposcopic examination can miss significant lesions, ALTS found that HPV testing performed 12 months after the initial colposcopy detected 27% of women with CIN 2,3 and resulted in 55% undergoing a second colposcopy, whereas two repeat cytology examinations at 6-month intervals detected 88% of missed cases and required that 64% undergo a second colposcopy; combining cytology with HPV testing did not increase sensitivity and reduced specificity.

### 2001 consensus guidelines for the management of women with cervical cytological abnormalities [^ab8d4aae]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To provide evidence-based consensus guidelines for the management of women with cervical cytological abnormalities and cervical cancer precursors.

Participants

A panel of 121 experts in the diagnosis and management of cervical cancer precursors, including representatives from 29 professional organizations, federal agencies, and national and international health organizations, were invited to participate in a consensus conference sponsored by the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP).

Evidence and Consensus Process

Guidelines for the management of women with cervical cytological abnormalities were developed through a multistep process. Starting 6 months before the conference, working groups developed draft management guidelines based on formal literature reviews of English-language articles published in 1988–2001, as well as input from the professional community at large, obtained using interactive Internet-based bulletin boards. On September 6–8, 2001, the ASCCP Consensus Conference was held in Bethesda, Md. Guidelines with supporting evidence were presented and underwent discussion, revision, and voting.

Conclusions

Management of women with atypical squamous cells (ASC) depends on whether the Papanicolaou test is subcategorized as of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or as cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) (ASC-H). Women with ASC-US should be managed using a program of 2 repeat cytology tests, immediate colposcopy, or DNA testing for high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV). Testing for HPV DNA is the preferred approach when liquid-based cytology is used for screening. In most instances, women with ASC-H, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, HSIL, and atypical glandular cells should be referred for immediate colposcopic evaluation.

Women with HIV infection aged < 30 years — management of abnormal Pap test results — specifies that for an ASC-US Pap test, if reflex HPV testing is positive, referral to colposcopy is recommended; if HPV testing is not available or not done, repeat cytology in 6 to 12 months is recommended (AII), and for any result equal to or greater than ASC-US on repeat cytology, referral to colposcopy is recommended (AII). For LSIL or worse (including ASC-H, AGC, and HSIL), referral to colposcopy is recommended regardless of reflex HPV result, if done.

RESULTS

Cytology and HPV

In total, 13 865 liquid cytology specimens were received in the laboratory. Of these, 13 842 were completed for both tests, CYTO and HPV. Overall, 9.6% of women (1334 out of 13 842) were positive for one or both tests (CYTO or HPV), 8.2% of women (1143 out of 13 842) were positive for HPV and 6.1% (841 out of 13 842) were positive for HPV alone (HPV+CYTO−). In all, 96.4% (13345 out of 13 842) of women were 30 years old or more, with a percentage of HPV infection of 7.9%. This percentage rose to 17.4% in the 495 women younger than 30 years. For two women, the age was not available. Mean age of the 13 840 women was 44.4 years (range 17–93). The higher frequency of HPV positivity in younger women is portrayed in Figure 1, where a progressive decline of HPV positivity is observed as age increases. All further results are unrelated to age. In total, 3.6% (493 out of 13 842) of women were positive for CYTO and 1.4% (191 out of 13 842) were positive for CYTO alone (HPV−CYTO+). Among the CYTO results, there were 243 ASC-US (1.8%), 14 atypical squamous cells: cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H) (0.1%), 201 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) (1.5%), 30 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) (0.2%) and five atypical glandular cells (AGC) (0.04%).

Data Presentation: Clinical Scenarios

Risk-based management tables are organized under the 5 clinical scenarios. It is important to emphasize that for a given patient over time, a clinician is likely to consult various tables as the management scenarios are encountered, from initial abnormality to resolution. Scenario 1 describes initial management of abnormal screening results. Table 1A addresses patients without a documented recent HPV test result. To qualify for Table 1B, a patient's current abnormal screening test result must be preceded by a negative HPV test documented in the medical record within the past approximately 5 years (e.g. a normal screening interval).

TABLE 1A
Immediate and 5-Year Risks of CIN 3+ for Abnormal Screening Results, When There Are No Known Prior HPV Test Results

TABLE 1B
Immediate and 5-Year Risks of CIN 3+ After a Prior HPV-Negative Screen Documented in the Medical Record

Scenario 2 describes surveillance after abnormal results not requiring immediate colposcopic referral. Management of current cotest results is described after a previous result of HPV-negative ASC-US (see Table 2A), HPV-negative LSIL (Table 2B), and HPV-positive NILM (Table 2C).

TABLE 2A
Immediate and 5-Year Risks of CIN 3+ for Results Obtained in Follow-up of HPV-Negative ASC-US

TABLE 2B
Immediate and 5-Year Risks of CIN 3+ for Results Obtained in Follow-up of HPV-Negative LSIL

Table 2C
Immediate and 5-year risks of CIN 3+ for results obtained in follow-up of HPV-positive NILM

Scenario 3, management upon receipt of colposcopy/biopsy results, describes subsequent management based on the colposcopy/biopsy diagnosis (see Table 3). Scenario 4 describes management after a colposcopy at which CIN 2+ was not found (i.e. colposcopy/biopsy results were CIN 1 or normal). Table 4A describes CIN 3+ risks when the index cotest was low grade (i.e. LSIL, ASC-US, or HPV-positive NILM). Table 4B describes CIN 3+ risks when the index cotest was high grade (i.e. ASC-H, AGC, HSIL+). Scenario 5 addresses management after treatment for CIN 2 or CIN 3, either short term (see Table 5A) or longer term (see Table 5B).

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical screening tests [^cde97745]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Medium credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing for screening — use with cytology in women 30 years and older is described as follows: In 2003, FDA approved the use of HPV testing as an adjunct to cervical cytology screening in women aged 30 years and older. HPV testing should not be used for routine screening in women before the age of 30 years. A review reported that the pooled sensitivity and specificity of HPV testing for detecting CIN2+ in women 35 years and older is 95% and 93%, respectively, whereas pooled sensitivity and specificity of cytology at a threshold of ASC-US are 60% and 97%, respectively. Sensitivity using a combination of HPV testing and cytology is significantly higher with negative predictive values of 99% to 100%. The American Cancer Society stated it is "reasonable to consider" HPV DNA testing with cytology for primary screening in women 30 years and older, and it was concluded that the frequency of combined cytology and HPV testing should not be more than every 3 years provided that both tests are negative. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has recommended based on "level B" evidence that combined testing is "appropriate" for women 30 years and older, and cytology alone continues to be an acceptable screening method in women 30 years and older.

### Risk estimates supporting the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^8facb93a]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

ASCCP 2019 HPV-negative low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) follow-up — immediate and 5-year cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse (CIN 3+) risks with management are tabulated for current HPV and cytology results obtained during surveillance. Patients who are under surveillance after a prior HPV-negative LSIL test result can be managed by Table 28b. For HPV-negative NILM, CIN 3+ 5-y risk is 0.40 with recommended 3-y follow-up and recommendation confidence score 57. For HPV-negative ASC-US and LSIL, CIN 3+ 5-y risks are 4.0 and 4.4 with recommended 1-y follow-up and recommendation confidence scores 100 and 96. For HPV-positive NILM, CIN 3+ immediate and 5-y risks are 4.0 and 8.6 with recommended 1-y follow-up. For HPV-positive ASC-US and LSIL, CIN 3+ immediate and 5-y risks are 5.3 and 6.9, and 5.0 and 7.9, respectively, with recommended Colposcopy. Special situations include HPV-positive ASC-H with CIN 3+ immediate and 5-y risks of 50 and 50 managed with Colposcopy and HPV-positive HSIL+ with risks 33 and 33 managed with Colposcopy/treatment. After Cotest negative ×2, CIN 3+ 5-y risk is 0.27 with recommended 3-y follow-up. In the 2012 guidelines, repeat cotesting at 3 years was recommended for HPV-negative NILM after HPV-negative LSIL and this recommendation does not change; however, HPV-negative ASC-US, HPV-negative LSIL, and HPV-positive NILM after HPV-negative LSIL lead to 1-year surveillance rather than immediate colposcopy. Evaluation of return intervals indicates that 2 negative cotests after HPV-negative LSIL do not provide enough reassurance to return to 5-year regular screening.

Precolposcopy Scenario

We restricted analyses in the precolposcopy scenario to 1,546,462 patients with no known history of CIN 2+ or hysterectomy who were not missing HPV or cytology results at the initial screen (insufficient and noncervical cytology results were also excluded). Risks were estimated for 4 testing rounds. Risk estimated from the initial HPV-based screen was used to inform precolposcopic management for patients whose histories of HPV status were unknown. Beginning with the second testing round, patients in a precolposcopy scenario had an important biomarker for risk stratification — their HPV-based test result from the previous round of testing. We estimated risks using the second round to inform precolposcopic management after immediately prior test results of HPV negative, HPV positive/NILM, cotest negative, HPV negative/ASC-US, or HPV negative/LSIL. We did not provide risk estimates for other prior abnormal test results (e.g. HPV positive/ASC-US, HPV positive/LSIL) that typically lead to colposcopy referral. The third and fourth testing rounds were primarily used to determine whether patients with multiple negative HPV or cotest results after an HPV-positive/NILM, HPV-negative/ASC-US, or HPV-negative/LSIL test result had sufficiently low subsequent risks to permit extension of their testing intervals. Management after more complicated screening histories were not included in these guidelines as we could not precisely estimate risks for some combinations of past/current test results because of the smaller sample sizes.

ASCCP postcolposcopy scenario — patients identified as high risk in the precolposcopy scenario are recommended to colposcopy or expedited treatment; if colposcopy does not detect CIN 2+, these patients enter a postcolposcopy scenario restricted to those with no known history of CIN 2+ or hysterectomy, referred for the first time in the KPNC, and with normal/CIN 1 results. Prior risk was dichotomized by referral after lower-grade abnormalities (HPV positive/NILM, ASC-US, or LSIL) versus high-grade cytology (ASC-H, AGC, or HSIL+). Risk estimates were used to determine management immediately after the < CIN 2 colposcopy and at the first postcolposcopy follow-up, and second and third surveillance visits determined when multiple negative HPV or cotests results could safely extend testing intervals.

### Comparison of HPV genotyping and methylated ZNF582 as triage for women with equivocal liquid-based cytology results [^e806c9cd]. Clinical Epigenetics (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion and evaluation

Establishment of routine Pap screening has resulted in a significant decrease in cervical cancer deaths. In China, ASC, including ASC-US and ASC-H, were reported in approximately 10% of papanicolaou smear (Pap smears). The large number of ASC patients referred for colposcopic examination and follow-up could be an extra burden. In conjunction with the currently available tests, molecular diagnostic tests that can assist in the diagnosis of cancer and that have both a high sensitivity and high specificity would be useful because they would be more accurate than Pap tests alone. Recent guidelines in the USA recommend that adult women with an ASC-US Pap result either have the Pap test repeated at 6 and 12 months, or have an HPV-HR DNA test. In China, repeated follow-up is impractical and time-consuming because many areas do not have sufficient medical resources to perform additional examinations. Another option is to send ASC patients for colposcopy, but colposcopy may not be available in the areas where patients reside thus prohibiting or delaying the diagnosis. Moreover, colposcopy is more invasive and causes anxiety to many women.

Because of the high sensitivity, triage of ASC-US with HPV-HR has been suggested in the cervical screening guidelines. This strategy provides the advantage of missing fewer cases of the severe disease state. However, the low specificity still leads to approximately 50% of women with ASC-US being referred for colposcopy. A similar trend was observed in the present study. The sensitivity and specificity of HPV-HR for detecting CIN3+ were 99.33% and 38.76%, respectively. Seventy-three percent (177/242) of the women with an ASC-US or ASC-H result were positive for HPV-HR, but 61.3% of them had a histological result of CIN2, CIN1, or normal, which is not indicative of a referral for a colposcopic examination. Thus, the HPV-HR test is limited by its low specificity.

### Follow-up testing after colposcopy: five-year risk of CIN 2 + after a colposcopic diagnosis of CIN 1 or less [^2452da1c]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Most women referred for colposcopy are not diagnosed with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN 2+) but, nonetheless, are typically asked to return much sooner than their next routine screening interval in 3 to 5 years. An important question is how many subsequent negative Pap results, or negative Pap and human papillomavirus (HPV) cotest results, are needed before returning to an extended retesting interval.

Methods

We estimated 5-year risks of CIN 2+ for 3 follow-up management strategies after colposcopy (Pap-alone, HPV-alone, and cotesting) for 20,319 women aged 25 years and older screened from 2003 to 2010 at Kaiser Permanente Northern California who were referred for colposcopy but for whom CIN 2+ was not initially diagnosed (i.e., "women with CIN 1/negative colposcopy").

Results

Screening results immediately antecedent to CIN 1/negative colposcopy influenced subsequent 5-year CIN 2+ risk: women with an antecedent HPV-positive/atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) Pap had a lower risk (10%) than those with antecedent atypical squamous cells cannot rule out HSIL (ASC-H; 16%, p < .0001) or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or worse (HSIL+; 24%, p < .0001). For women with an antecedent HPV-positive/ASC-US or LSIL, a single negative cotest approximately 1 year after colposcopy predicted lower subsequent 5-year risk of CIN 2+ (1.1%) than 2 sequential negative HPV tests (1.8%, p = .3) or 2 sequential negative Pap results (4.0%, p < .0001). For those with an antecedent ASC-H or HSIL+ Pap, 1 negative cotest 1 year after colposcopy predicted lower subsequent 5-year risk of CIN 2+ (2.2%) than 1 negative HPV test (4.4%, p = .4) or 1 negative Pap (7.0%, p = .06); insufficient data existed to calculate the risk after sequential negative cotests for women with high-grade antecedent cytology.

Conclusions

Women with a CIN 1/negative colposcopy followed by negative postcolposcopy tests did not achieve sufficiently low CIN 2+ risk to return to 5-year routine screening. For women with antecedent HPV-positive/ASC-US or LSIL, a single negative postcolposcopy cotest reduced their risk to a level consistent with a 3-year return. For women with antecedent ASC-H or HSIL+, no single negative test result sufficed to reduce their risk to a level consistent with a 3-year return.

ASCCP 2019 risk-based management — patients younger than 25 years, initial management after an abnormal screening test result: In patients younger than 25 years with low-grade cytology screening results, repeat cytology alone at 1 and 2 years after the initial abnormal result is recommended (BII). Colposcopy is recommended if high-grade cytology is found at any point (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [HSIL], atypical squamous cells — cannot exclude HSIL [ASC-H], atypical glandular cells [AGC], adenocarcinoma in situ [AIS]) or if low-grade cytology persists at the 2-year follow-up visit (BII). If reflex human papillomavirus (HPV) testing for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) is performed and the results are negative, repeat cytology in 3 years is recommended (BII). After 2 consecutive negative cytology results, return to routine age-based screening is recommended (BII). If colposcopy is performed and the results are less than CIN 2 (i.e., histologic low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [LSIL; CIN 1] or less), repeat cytology in 1 year (BII), and manage as above (e.g., repeat cytology for ASC-US/LSIL, colposcopy for ASC-H or higher).

The expedited treatment preferred threshold "approximates the risk for a patient after an HPV 16– positive HSIL cytology" and "It is preferred that patients with risk at or above this threshold receive expedited treatment unless they are pregnant, younger than 25 years, or have concerns about the effect of treatment on future pregnancy outcomes".

Objective

To estimate the 5-year age group-specific test positives for Pap tests and human papillomavirus (HPV) testing in a large, general screening population of women 30 and older.

Methods

Using data from Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large health maintenance organization that introduced cotesting in 2003, we evaluated the cotesting results overall and by 5-year age groups. Women (n = 580,289) who opted for and underwent cotesting (n cotests = 812,598) between January 2003 and April 2008 were included in the analysis. Pap tests interpreted as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or more severe were considered to be positive. Women were tested for carcinogenic HPV using an assay approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Binomial exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.

Results

Overall, 6.27% (95% CI 6.21–6.32%) of cotests were carcinogenic HPV positive, and only 3.99% (95% CI 3.94–4.03%) cotests had normal cytology and were carcinogenic HPV positive. By comparison, 5.18% (95% CI 5.13–5.23%) of cotests had ASC-US or more severe cytology, and 2.87% (95% CI 2.84–2.91%) of cotests had ASC-US or more severe cytology and were carcinogenic HPV negative.

Conclusion

In a general screening population, concerns about excessive HPV test positives among women aged 30 years and older are not borne out.

### Hr-HPV testing in the follow-up of women with cytological abnormalities and negative colposcopy [^c691b2f1]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

All data (cytology, hr-HPV test, colposcopy, histology and treatment) are recorded in ISPO's archives.

In the present study, we selected all women aged 25–64 years with the first abnormal Pap test of screening (index Pap test) performed during the years 2006–2010 within the Florence Cervical Screening Program. Among women compliant to colposcopy, we selected all women with a negative colposcopy assessment for CIN2+ (Figure 1). We defined a woman compliant to colposcopy if it was performed within 6 months either from the abnormal, ASC-US+, index Pap Test or the positive hr-HPV triage test for ASC-US. The ISPO follow-up protocol had been tailored to the referral cytologic results. In accordance with the European guidelines, an hr-HPV test at 12 months is recommended in case of ASC-US, ASC-H and LSIL colposcopy-negative women. Having, the European guidelines, no suggestions in the management of AGC and HSIL colposcopy-negative women, we recommended an hr-HPV test at 6 months for both these categories. Independently of initial cytologic results, if the hr-HPV test turned positive, a new colposcopy was suggested.

Key Messages About Cervical Cancer Screening

When counseling persons about cervical cancer screening, the provider should discuss the following:

Cervical cancer can be prevented with regular screening tests, like the Pap test (cytology) and HPV tests. Those at average risk should start getting cytology tests at age 21 years.
The cytology test can find abnormal cervical cells, which could lead to cervical cancer over time, and an HPV test detects HPV infection of the cervix. The HPV test can be used alone for cervical cancer screening or at the same time as the cytology test (known as cotesting) for those aged ≥ 30 years to 65 years. The HPV test is also used after a cytology test result of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) among persons aged > 25 years (known as reflex HPV testing).
Positive cytology and HPV tests are markers of cervical precancerous lesions, which often do not cause symptoms until they become invasive. Appropriate follow-up is essential to ensure that cervical cancer does not develop.
HPV is a common infection and is often controlled by the body without any medical interventions. A positive HPV test does not mean that a person has cancer.
Providers should emphasize that HPV infections often are shared between partners, and it is often not possible to know the origin of an HPV infection; HPV tests might become positive many years after initial exposure due to reactivation of latent infections in both male and female partners.

Management of Sex Partners

The benefit of disclosing a positive HPV test to current and future sex partners is unclear. The following counseling messages can be communicated to sex partners:

Sex partners do not need to be tested for HPV.
Sex partners tend to share HPV. Sex partners of persons with HPV infection also are likely have an HPV infection.
Female sex partners of men who disclose they had a previous female partner with HPV should be screened at the same intervals as women with average risk. No data are available to suggest that more frequent screening is of benefit.
When used correctly and consistently, condoms might lower the risk for HPV infection and might decrease the time to clear in those with HPV infection. However, HPV can infect areas not covered by the condom, and condoms might not fully protect against HPV.

Additional messages for partners include the messages for persons with HPV (see Cervical Cancer Screening; Counseling Messages).

Screening strategies

We compared 27 different screening strategies as summarized in Table 1. Strategies differed by the age at which to begin screening (either age 18 or age 25) and whether the most widely recommended strategy for cervical cancer screening in Canada was conducted prior to age 25. This baseline recommended strategy for Canada (screening every year from age 18 until 21 and then every three years afterwards until age 70 with conventional Pap tests) is hereinafter designated the 'Miller' strategy. The choice of age 25 was based on the fact that HPV testing prior to that age suffers from an unacceptably low specificity (to detect high grade cervical lesions) as a consequence of the high HPV prevalence following the first few years after the onset of sexual activity. This age may be an appropriate age to implement HPV DNA testing because HPV infections among such women are more likely to reflect underlying lesions. In addition to single test (HPV or Pap) strategies, we examined a combined test strategy (HPV and Pap), in which women who were HPV positive or who had smears with findings of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or more severe (≥ ASC-US) abnormalities were referred to colposcopy. We also examined two triage strategies: 1) HPV followed by Pap testing for HPV positive women and 2) Pap followed by HPV testing for women with ≥ ASC-US Pap test results. Adherence to screening recommendations by age was varied based on province-specific estimates provided by the 1998 Surveillance Report on Cervical Cancer Screening in Canada. All women who received an initial screening test were also assumed to receive the triage test if a triage test was included as part of the strategy. Women with histologically confirmed CIN of grade 1 (CIN 1) were assumed to be followed with repeat Pap tests and to be treated if they had another abnormal test result (≥ ASC-US). Women with biopsy-confirmed CIN of grades 2 or 3 (CIN 2+) were assumed to receive loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP). Adherence to follow-up and treatment was assumed to be 100%. Women with cancer were assumed to receive stage-specific treatment. Selected parameters used in the model are presented in Table 2.

### An introduction to the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^fa7b6a97]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

THE GENERAL APPROACH TAKEN TO CREATE THE NEW GUIDELINES

The ASCCP and NCI cooperatively planned and supported the consensus process, with administrative support provided by the ASCCP. The convening of the consensus group is described in the main guidelines article. Once convened, the major task of the participating representatives was to decide on durable clinical action thresholds, striving to represent US consensus as to what clinical actions are recommended for increasing severity of cervical screening abnormalities. The following axiomatic principles were followed: the main purpose of cervical screening in the United States is to find precancerous lesions ("precancer") that can be treated easily to prevent invasive cervical cancer. Putting aside temporarily whether precancer is best defined as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2/CIN 3/AIS, or CIN 3/adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), or histologic high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion/AIS, there are a limited number of clinical actions available to clinicians and patients when faced with a cervical screening abnormality. Logically, a patient known to be at very high risk of having precancer has the greatest need of preventive treatment; at the highest risk, expedited treatment might be preferred without need for colposcopic biopsy. At somewhat lower but still high risk, colposcopic biopsies are recommended to find or rule out precancer requiring treatment. At lower but nonnegligible risk, colposcopy is not needed, but surveillance at shortened intervals is prudent (1 and 3 years were maintained as the 2 levels of concern/attention) to reduce the risk of "interval cancers" occurring before the next testing visit. Women at very low risk provided by a negative human papillomavirus (HPV) test (or HPV and cytology cotest) are recommended to continue screening at the 5-year interval.

### Human papillomavirus testing with pap triage for cervical cancer prevention in Canada: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^5fbd1c69]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our findings suggest that a strategy of screening every three years, beginning at age 25, with HPV testing first followed by Pap triage for women with positive HPV results, and referral to colposcopy for any woman with an ≥ ASC-US Pap result may be more effective at preventing cancer, and less costly than the currently recommended strategy of screening every year beginning at age 18 and then every three years at age 21 with referral to colposcopy for any woman with an ≥ low grade squamous intra-epithelial lesion Pap result, and repeat testing for women with ASC-US Pap results. These findings were consistent at both the Provincial level and for Canada as a whole.

These findings reflect those of Mayrand et al. 2007, who showed that a strategy of HPV testing followed by Pap triage would be more sensitive and as specific as a strategy of sending everyone to colposcopy with a test result of ≥ LSIL, but less sensitive and more specific than a strategy of sending everyone with an ≥ ASC-US test result to colposcopy. This is because the currently recommended strategy for screening in Canada is a hybrid: women with ASC-US Pap test results have repeat exams instead of being sent immediately to colposcopy; women with ≥ LSIL are referred for immediate colposcopy. The strategy of HPV testing followed by Pap triage was more effective because all women with a positive test result for both were sent to colposcopy, and women with a negative HPV test result were assumed to return to routine screening. We assumed that women with discordant results would receive a repeat HPV test and be referred for colposcopy if positive, or return to routine screening if negative. This strategy thus avoids the increased costs of screening women at an early age, but increases the likelihood of detecting significant disease by using HPV testing first, followed by Pap testing. Our findings are similar to those of Goldhaber-Fiebert et al. (2008) who showed that in the US, triennial Pap-based screening with HPV triage, beginning at age 21, with a switch to HPV testing with Pap triage at age 30 years was cost-effective.

ASCCP post-treatment CIN 2 or CIN 3 — immediate and 5-year CIN 3+ risk by current results (Table 5A) shows that for history CIN 2 or 3 (treated) with HPV-negative and NILM cytology, CIN 3+ immediate risk, % is 0.03 and CIN 3+ 5-y risk, % is 1.7 with 1-y follow-up and recommendation confidence score 100; for HPV-positive with NILM, CIN 3+ immediate risk, % is 5.8 and CIN 3+ 5-y risk, % is 12 with Colposcopy and confidence 86; for HPV-positive ASC-US/LSIL, CIN 3+ immediate risk, % is 10 and CIN 3+ 5-y risk, % is 21 with Colposcopy and confidence 100; and for HPV-positive High grade, CIN 3+ immediate risk, % is 53 and CIN 3+ 5-y risk, % is 63 with Colposcopy/treatment. The text states that "all of the HPV-positive results lead to immediate referral back to repeat colposcopy", whereas HPV-negative NILM and HPV-negative ASC-US/LSIL have deferred "1-year surveillance", and that to maximize safety "management is recommended based on treated CIN 3"; patients "being followed after a treatment for CIN 2 or CIN 3 can be managed by Table 5A".

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines: updates through 2023 [^8f01adf7]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

MINOR 2019 GUIDELINE UPDATES TO CORRECT TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS OR CLARIFY WORDING

1) Correction to Figure 7 clarifying that a total of 3 negative HPV-based tests are needed after treatment to return to a 3-year testing interval: The original Figure 7 of the 2019 Guidelines was updated. The revised Figure 7 in this report replaces the original Figure 7 and should be used for clinical management. The revised Figure 7 matches the information included in Table 5b of Egemen et aland the text of the guidelines article, which reads: "In patients treated for histologic or cytologic HSIL, after the initial HPV-based test at 6 months, annual HPV or cotesting is preferred until 3 consecutive negative tests have been obtained (AII)". Risk estimates for the 2019 Guidelines indicate that, following excisional treatment for histologic HSIL/CIN2–3, three consecutive negative HPV tests or cotests are needed at 1-year intervals to identify a group of patients at sufficiently low risk that they can safely return to 3-year testing interval. The 2019 Guidelines recommend that the first test occur 6 months after the excisional procedure. Figure 7 erroneously recommended an HPV test or cotest at 6 months followed by 3 consecutive annual HPV or cotests (a total of 4 consecutive negative tests). This has been corrected to recommend the first HPV test or cotest at 6 months followed by additional HPV or cotests at 18 months and 30 months. The figure has also been modified to clarify that follow-up should continue at 3-year intervals for a minimum of 25 years and through at least age 65 years and may continue for as long as the patient is in good health.
2) Prior Correction to Figure 2 Legend Published October 2020: The legend for Figure 2 of the original 2019 Guidelines articlewas updated to clarify the algorithm for management after a minimally abnormal screening test result followed by a colposcopy at which high-grade histology was not found. The figure legend is repeated here for clarity: "This figure demonstrates how a patient with a common minimally abnormal screening test result (HPV-positive ASC-US) would be managed based on risk estimates. The initial screening result would lead to colposcopy (immediate risk 4.45%). If colposcopy shows less than CIN 2, the 5-year risk is 2.9% (1-year return). At the 1-year return visit, a second HPV-positive ASC-US result has an immediate risk of 3.1% (1-year return). Note similar management would be recommended if the initial abnormality preceding colposcopy were any minimally abnormal test result (i.e. less severe than ASC-H). If the HPV-based test performed for the second postcolposcopy surveillance test is negative, return in 3 years is recommended. If the second postcolposcopy surveillance test results are either a positive HPV test with any cytology result or a negative HPV test result with a cytology result of ASC-H or higher, colposcopy is recommended. Return in 1 year is recommended for HPV-negative ASC-US or LSIL results".

### The value of monitoring human papillomavirus DNA results for Papanicolaou tests diagnosed as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance: a college of American pathologists Q-probes study of 68 institutions [^378cf3ba]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Context

Papanicolaou (Pap) tests are often diagnosed as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US). Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing has been proposed as a quality metric for this diagnosis.

Objective

To measure the frequency of HPV positivity in Pap tests diagnosed as ASC-US and to examine laboratory variables that are associated with institutional deviation from the mean percent of HPV positivity.

Design

As part of a College of American Pathologist Q-Probes program, 68 participating laboratories retrospectively identified approximately 50 consecutive ASC-US Pap tests that had HPV testing results.

Results

The mean percentage of HPV positivity for ASC-US was 43.74% among institutions surveyed, but it had a broad distribution, with an SD of 17.77%. Associations were found for lower difference of the institutional mean from the surveyed interinstitutional mean percentage of positive HPV with (1) higher numbers of Pap tests in the past year that had HPV testing, (2) in-house HPV testing, and (3) teaching hospitals. All 3 factors correlated with a larger volume of Pap tests per institution. An association was found between patient age and the probability of a positive HPV result, indicating a dependence upon prevalence of HPV.

Conclusions

Larger volumes of Pap tests may offer an opportunity to gain greater comfort in interpreting Pap tests. While there is significant variability in interinstitutional HPV-positive rates in ASC-US Pap tests, monitoring the HPV-positive rate in ASC-US Pap tests is a valuable broad measure of quality. Performance beyond 2 SDs of the mean should prompt reassessment of diagnostic criteria used in the evaluation of Pap tests and/or investigation of the prevalence of HPV positivity in the population from which the Pap tests are obtained.

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical screening tests [^c8636ce3]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Medium credibility.

Postmenopausal women with LSIL — acceptable options and follow-up: Acceptable options include reflex HPV DNA testing, repeat cytological testing at 6 and 12 months, and colposcopy (CIII). If the HPV DNA test is negative or if CIN is not identified at colposcopy, repeat cytology in 12 months is recommended, whereas if either the HPV DNA test is positive or the repeat cytology is ASC-US or greater, colposcopy is recommended (AII). If 2 consecutive repeat cytological tests are negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy, return to routine cytological screening is recommended.

### Clinical human papillomavirus detection forecasts cervical cancer risk in women over 18 years of follow-up [^60b0174a]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe the long-term (≥ 10 years) benefits of clinical human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing for cervical precancer and cancer risk prediction.

Methods

Cervicovaginal lavages collected from 19,512 women attending a health maintenance program were retrospectively tested for HPV using a clinical test. HPV positives were tested for HPV16 and HPV18 individually using a research test. A Papanicolaou (Pap) result classified as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or more severe was considered abnormal. Women underwent follow-up prospectively with routine annual Pap testing up to 18 years. Cumulative incidence rates (CIRs) of ≥ grade 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN3+) or cancer for enrollment test results were calculated.

Results

A baseline negative HPV test provided greater reassurance against CIN3+ over the 18-year follow-up than a normal Pap (CIR, 0.90% v 1.27%). Although both baseline Pap and HPV tests predicted who would develop CIN3+ within the first 2 years of follow-up, only HPV testing predicted who would develop CIN3+ 10 to 18 years later (P = 0.004). HPV16- and HPV18-positive women with normal Pap were at elevated risk of CIN3+ compared with other HPV-positive women with normal Pap and were at similar risk of CIN3+ compared with women with a low-grade squamous intraepithelial Pap.

Conclusion

HPV testing to rule out cervical disease followed by Pap testing and possibly combined with the detection of HPV16 and HPV18 among HPV positives to identify those at immediate risk of CIN3+ would be an efficient algorithm for cervical cancer screening, especially in women age 30 years or older.

### Contributions of liquid-based (Papanicolaou) cytology and human papillomavirus testing in cotesting for detection of cervical cancer and precancer in the United States [^6e067b3c]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Accordingly, detection of prevalent "precancers" (detection sensitivity) is likely to overestimate the effectiveness of any screening formulation in preventing invasive cancer. Because of this bias, the performance of screening tests targeting the diagnosis of invasive cancer as the primary end point of screening effectiveness is especially relevant in judging the limitations of available screening options. This view suggests a significant, unrecognized weakness in the ASCCP "risk-based guidelines" calculations that use CIN 3+ as the key measured end point, since most detected lesions in this end point are nonprogressing intraepithelial lesions. The significant differences between the HPV genotypes detectable in invasive cervical cancers compared with HPV genotypes detectable in CIN 3 also reflect the nonprogressive character of many high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions.

This study is limited by including only women who sought medical care and were referred for laboratory services to Quest Diagnostics. However, given the broad representation of patients served by Quest Diagnostics, this is also a key strength of the study. The inclusion of women 30 years and older who had cotesting excluded women who may have been tested with only LBC or HPV. Given that cotesting is currently preferred (not the only standard of care) for these patients, the approach excludes a trivial fraction of testing outside of these practice patterns.

Our findings clearly demonstrate that the rates of positive cervical screening test results (both LBC and HPV testing) decline as the interval between cotesting and CxCa diagnosis increases (Figure 1). Declining rates for positive cervical screening test results prior to CxCa diagnoses are of far greater concern than declining positive rates before precancer diagnoses, because cervical screening primarily strives to prevent cervical cancer and minimize morbidity and mortality. This study and all previous large US cotesting studies have shown that both abnormal cytologic and HPV-positive test results decline progressively as time before CxCa diagnoses increases, -, most likely due to smaller lesional size and increased difficulty in sampling infected lesional cells. In European trials, HPV-negative rates in women developing incidental CxCa 2.5 to 8 years after the start of trials rose to 42%. Also critically, the risks associated with declining screening test performance before CxCa diagnoses have been obscured by the primary focus of clinical trials on a CIN 3 end point.

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical screening tests [^24d14bd6]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Medium credibility.

Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) — prevalence and risk — In 1996, the median percentile reporting rate for US laboratories was 1.6%, increasing to 2.1% by 2003; in 2003, the median percentile reporting rate of LSIL was 1.4% for conventional cytology specimens and 2.4% for liquid-based specimens. A meta-analysis reported that the pooled estimate of high-risk HPV DNA positivity among women with LSIL was 76.6%, and the prevalence of CIN 2,3 or cancer at initial colposcopy among women with LSIL is 12% to 17%; postmenopausal women are an exception with lower HPV prevalence after an LSIL result. Data from ALTS indicate that the risk of high-grade cervical neoplasia in women with LSIL is the same as in those with ASC-US who are high-risk HPV DNA positive.

Postcolposcopy Scenario

Patients identified as high risk in the precolposcopy scenario are recommended to colposcopy or expedited treatment. If the colposcopy does not detect the presence of CIN 2+, then these patients previously defined as high risk are in a postcolposcopy scenario. In the analysis of the postcolposcopy scenario, we restricted to patients with no known history of CIN 2+ or hysterectomy, who were referred to colposcopy for the first time in the KPNC, and whose colposcopy results were normal/CIN 1. We dichotomized the prior level of risk by whether patients were referred to colposcopy after low-grade abnormalities (i.e. HPV positive/NILM, ASC-US, or LSIL) or after a high-grade cytology result (i.e. ASC-H, AGC, or HSIL+). Risk estimates were used to determine management immediately after the < CIN 2 colposcopy and at the first postcolposcopy follow-up surveillance visit. The second and third surveillance rounds were used to determine when patients with multiple negative HPV or cotests results after a < CIN 2 colposcopy could safely extend their testing intervals.

### An analysis of high-risk human papillomavirus DNA-negative cervical precancers in the ASCUS-LSIL triage study (ALTS) [^15997506]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe women diagnosed with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia-grade 3 (CIN-3) diagnosed over the 2-year duration of the atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) Triage Study (ALTS) that tested negative for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) at enrollment.

Methods

Clinical center pathologists and quality control pathology group reviewed all histology; any CIN-3 diagnosis on biopsy or loop electrosurgical excision procedure (n = 621) by at least one pathology review over the duration of ALTS led to inclusion in this analysis. Enrollment cervical specimens were tested for high-risk HPV DNA by two HPV assays; results were combined to minimize simple testing errors. We compared the characteristics of baseline high-risk HPV-negative (n = 33) to baseline high-risk HPV-positive (n = 588) cumulative diagnosed CIN-3.

Results

High-risk HPV-negative CIN-3 cases were less likely to have a second, confirming diagnosis of CIN-3 (24% compared with 56%) by the other pathology group, were more likely to be diagnosed later in follow-up, and more likely to be referred into ALTS because of an ASCUS Pap test rather than an LSIL Pap. Upon review of case histories of the 33 baseline high-risk HPV-negative CIN-3 (5.3% of all cases), there was evidence that these cases were due to incident (new) cases (n = 12, 1.9%), non-high-risk HPV (n = 5, 0.8%), misclassified histology (n = 8, 1.3%), and false-negative high-risk HPV (n = 8, 1.3%).

Conclusion

In any sizeable population, even among women with evidence of cytologic abnormalities, there will be a few cases of cervical precancer that will test high-risk HPV negative for one or more reasons.

Human papillomavirus genotyping conducted on residual aliquots was available for almost 19,000 patients at KPNC who were also at NCI-KPNC Persistence and Progression (PaP) study conducted from 2006 to 2013. Selection occurred through a 2-phase stratified sampling design. In the first phase of sampling, patients at KPNC with a cotest within the PaP enrollment window (2006–2011) were selected for storage of residual HPV testing specimens; the collection included approximately 45,000 HPV-positive patients (representing > 3/4 of all HPV positive patients in that period) and a random group of approximately 10,000 HPV-negative patients. Approximately 8% of patients opted out, leaving 44,340 patients enrolled in the study. In the second phase of sampling, residual aliquots of patients in the PaP cohort were selected for genotyping using a complex stratified sampling design based on HPV results and histopathology outcomes (as of 2014) to maximize information yield. Typing focused primarily on HPV-positive patients, which included a random draw plus all unselected patients who were diagnosed with cancer or AIS, 500 unselected patients with CIN 3, and 500 unselected patients with CIN 2. Retesting by research typing assays of HPV-negative patients was restricted to a random group of 500 plus all unselected patients with rare outcomes suggesting elevated cancer risks (i.e. CIN 2+ histopathology or high-grade cytology). Both the KPNC and NCI-KPNC PaP studies have been reapproved yearly by both KPNC and NCI institutional review board committees.

Screening Tests and Clinical Management in the KPNC

Since 2001, patients at the KPNC have been tested with HPV to triage cytology results of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US). Beginning in 2003, patients 30 years or older underwent screening with concurrent HPV and cytology cotests. In 2013, cotesting was extended to ages 25–29 years.

The clinical HPV testing was conducted using Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2; Qiagen, Germantown, MD) according to manufacturer's instructions. It reports HPV status as negative versus positive for infection with any of the 13 high-risk HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68) and also inadvertently detects through cross-reaction a percentage of closely related low-risk HPV types (e.g. 53, 66, 67, 70, 82, and 82).

K. SPECIAL POPULATIONS

Introduction: Guidelines described previously apply to the average risk individual with an intact cervix and are based primarily on screening and management data from patients aged 25 to 65 years in the KPNC population. However, several populations require special management considerations. Management of patients who are younger than 25 years, pregnant, immunosuppressed, posthysterectomy, and older than 65 years are detailed hereinafter.

K.1 Management of Patients Younger Than 25 Years

In the 2012 guidelines, patients aged 21 to 24 years were considered to be a special population. In the current guidelines, the consensus was to reference this group as "patients younger than 25 years".

Initial Management After an Abnormal Screening Test Result

Guideline: In patients younger than 25 years with low-grade cytology screening results of LSIL, ASC-US HPV-positive, or ASC-US without HPV testing, repeat cytology alone at 1 and 2 years after the initial abnormal result is recommended (BII). Colposcopy is recommended if high-grade cytology is found at any point (HSIL, ASC-H, AGC, AIS) or if low-grade cytology persists at the 2-year follow-up visit (BII). If reflex HPV testing for ASC-US is performed and the results are negative, repeat cytology in 3 years is recommended (BII). After 2 consecutive negative cytology results, return to routine age-based screening is recommended (BII). If colposcopy is performed and the results are less than CIN 2 (i.e. histologic LSIL [CIN 1] or less), repeat cytology in 1 year (BII), and manage as above (e.g. repeat cytology for ASC-US/LSIL, colposcopy for ASC-H or higher). Clinicians should switch to using risk estimates when patients reach the age of 25 years (see Figures 12, 13).

### Enlarged squamous cell nuclei in cervical cytologic specimens from perimenopausal women ("PM cells"): a cause of ASC overdiagnosis [^c00dfc75]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

We studied the appropriateness of interpreting squamous cells with enlarged, smooth, bland nuclei in perimenopausal women ("PM cells") as atypical squamous cells (ASCs). Papanicolaou smears (Paps) from 100 women (40–55 years old) with a cytologic interpretation of ASC of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and human papillomavirus (HPV) testing or a biopsy within 6 months were reviewed by 2 observers without knowledge of the biopsy diagnosis or HPV results. Cases in which both reviewers agreed that the Paps were diagnosed more properly as "negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy" were compared with cases of "true ASCUS", using histologic squamous intraepithelial lesion and/or a positive high-risk HPV test as a positive outcome (abnormal follow-up). Of 100 cases, 28 were reclassified as benign by both observers. In 15 of these, the original ASCUS interpretation was based on cells with bland nuclear enlargement (2–3 times the area of intermediate cell nuclei), smooth nuclear membranes, and fine chromatin. Abnormal follow-up was identified in 1 (7%) of 15 benign cases but in 30 (42%) of 72 true ASCUS cases (P = 0.023). PM cells are a significant cause of ASC overdiagnosis in women 40 to 55 years old. Cervical Paps with cells no more atypical than these can be interpreted safely as negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^e0263b20]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing — predictive value and triage in people with HIV — Observational epidemiologic studies supported the incorporation of cervical HPV testing for determining referral to colposcopy versus retesting in 1 year or during routine follow-up. Despite the very high prevalence of HPV in women with HIV, normal cytology with negative HPV co-testing had a strong negative predictive value with low 3- to 5-year incidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (CIN 2+) regardless of CD4 count, whereas the risk of precancer was high when oncogenic HPV was positive despite normal cervical cytology and several-fold greater still if HPV16 was specifically detected; additional studies showed oncogenic HPV testing had high sensitivity and negative predictive value in the triage of atypical squamous cells of uncertain significance (ASC-US).

### Risks of CIN 2 +, CIN 3 +, and cancer by cytology and human papillomavirus status: the foundation of risk-based cervical screening guidelines [^9283c18f]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2017). Low credibility.

When we ordered the 5-year risk of CIN 3+ for all possible cytology and HPV categories, we observed that with the exception of HSIL+ results, risk clearly divided between HPV negative and positive women, regardless of cytology. As described earlier, HSIL+ risks remained high independently of HPV status. For all other cytology categories, HPV-negative results predicted risks less than 3.5%, equivalent to the risk of an ASC-US cytologic result ignoring HPV results. On the other hand, HPV positivity predicted risk of 4.0% (HPV-positive NILM) to 50% (HPV-positive HSIL+).

Previous guidelines compared co-test results to the risk "benchmarks" associated with cytology. However, the interpretation of cytology can change over time. In particular, KPNC shifted to cytologic interpretations informed by HPV status. This tended to increase the percentage of ASC-US results that were HPV positive, decreased HPV positivity very slightly in NILM, and very slightly increased the risk after ASC-US cytology.

Materials and methods

Study population

The Cancer Prevention and Research Institute (ISPO) has been running an organised population-based cervical screening in the Florence District since 1980. Cervical cancer screening is offered to all women aged 25–64 years who live in the Florence district and who are invited by mail to perform a Pap test every 3 years. Negative results are mailed to participants with a recommendation to repeat screening in 3 years. Non-respondents to the first invitation receive a reminder within 6 months. The 2001 Bethesda system terminology (TBS 2001) is used for cytologic classification. Women with abnormal Pap test (Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance or more severe, ASC-US+) are invited to perform a hr-HPV test or a colposcopy in according to the current protocol. The women diagnosed with ASC-US are invited to have a hr-HPV test; the hr-HPV-positive women are referred to colposcopy and hr-HPV-negative women returned to routine cytological screening interval. All women with other categories of abnormal cytology (ASC-H, AGC, LSIL, HSIL and cancer) are referred to immediate colposcopy at the ISPO clinic. Atypical glandular findings have been categorised following the TBS 2001 as to cell type origin (endocervical or endometrial), as the clinical management may vary significantly. Consequently, in this study we take into account only atypical endocervical or glandular cells referred to colposcopy. Women with abnormal Pap test and final histological diagnosis of CIN2+ lesions are recommended for an excisional treatment.

### An introduction to the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^dee11827]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

WHY THE 2019 REVISION WAS NEEDED

The revision was motivated by the complexity of the 2012 guidelines and the queue of soon-to-be available new tests. It gradually became clear that there were too many acceptable choices in use, or in final development, to continue as before. In a departure from previous versions, the 2019 guidelines therefore do not present separate algorithm figures for most screening and triage combinations. For example, there are no algorithm figures entitled "Triage of ASC-US" or "Follow-up of HPV-Positive Results". Dozens of algorithm diagrams would have been required to cover the many test combinations now in use or proposed to be introduced soon (such as extended genotyping or dual-stain cytology), along with the influence of past screening history on the meaning of current abnormal test results.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) and ASCCP agreed formally in 2017 through a Memorandum of Understanding to embark on a new set of guidelines. Three times before, in 2001, 2006, and 2012, the NCI and ASCCP had collaborated in a formal consensus guidelines process and also helped produce several other related guidances.

The role of NCI epidemiologists and statisticians who specialize in cervical screening has been to provide state-of-the-art epidemiologic evidence regarding test performance based on NCI and other research. The role of ASCCP has been to convene and conduct a consensus process bringing together US clinical organizations and other important "stakeholders" to create the guidelines. The objective of the new agreement was to produce clear and simple consensus recommendations based on risk, to achieve a "long shelf-life" for this version of the 2019 guidelines before another guidelines conference is needed, despite the abundance of competing tests and strategies.

TABLE 1
Participating Organizations

Box 1. Essential Changes From Prior Management Guidelines

1) Recommendations are based on risk, not results.

Recommendations of colposcopy, treatment, or surveillance will be based on a patient's risk of CIN 3+ determined by a combination of current results and history (including unknown history). The same current test results may yield different management recommendations depending on the history of recent past test results. 2) Colposcopy can be deferred for certain patients.
Repeat HPV testing or cotesting at 1 year is recommended for patients with minor screening abnormalities indicating HPV infection with low risk of underlying CIN 3+ (e.g. low-grade cytologic abnormalities after a documented negative screening HPV test or cotest).
At the 1-year follow-up test, referral to colposcopy is recommended if results remain abnormal. 3) Guidance for expedited treatment is expanded (i.e. treatment without colposcopic biopsy).
Expedited treatment was an option for patients with HSIL cytology in the 2012 guidelines; this guidance is now better defined.
For nonpregnant patients 25 years or older, expedited treatment, defined as treatment without preceding colposcopic biopsy demonstrating CIN 2+, is preferred when the immediate risk of CIN 3+ is ≥ 60%, and is acceptable for those with risks between 25% and 60%. Expedited treatment is preferred for nonpregnant patients 25 years or older with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) cytology and concurrent positive testing for HPV genotype 16 (HPV 16) (i.e. HPV 16–positive HSIL cytology) and never or rarely screened patients with HPV-positive HSIL regardless of HPV genotype.
Shared decision-making should be used when considering expedited treatment, especially for patients with concerns about the potential impact of treatment on pregnancy outcomes. 4) Excisional treatment is preferred to ablative treatment for histologic HSIL (CIN 2 or CIN 3) in the United States. Excision is recommended for adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS). 5) Observation is preferred to treatment for CIN 1.
Treatment remains acceptable for patients with repeat diagnoses of CIN 1 persisting 2 years or more. 6) Histopathology reports based on Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology (LAST)/World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for reporting histologic HSIL should include CIN 2 or CIN 3 qualifiers, i.e. HSIL(CIN 2) and HSIL (CIN 3). 7) All positive HPV tests, regardless of genotype, should have additional reflex triage testing performed from the same laboratory specimen (e.g. reflex cytology).
Additional testing from the same laboratory specimen is recommended because the findings may inform colposcopy practice. For example, those with HSIL cytology and concurrent positive testing for HPV genotype 16 qualify for expedited treatment.
HPV 16 or 18 infections have the highest risk for CIN 3 and occult cancer, so additional evaluation (e.g. colposcopy with biopsy) is necessary even when cytology results are negative.
If HPV 16 and 18 testing is positive, and additional laboratory testing of the same sample is not feasible, the patient should proceed directly to colposcopy. 8) Continued surveillance with HPV testing or cotesting at 3-year intervals for at least 25 years is recommended after treatment of histologic HSIL, CIN 2, CIN 3, or AIS. Continued surveillance at 3-year intervals beyond 25 years is acceptable for as long as the patient's life expectancy and ability to be screened are not significantly compromised by serious health issues.
The 2012 guidelines recommended return to 5-year screening intervals and did not specify when screening should cease. New evidence indicates that risk remains elevated for at least 25 years, with no evidence that treated patients ever return to risk levels compatible with 5-year intervals.
Surveillance with cytology alone is acceptable only if testing with HPV or cotesting is not feasible. Cytology is less sensitive than HPV testing for detection of precancer and is therefore recommended more often. Cytology is recommended at 6-month intervals when HPV testing or cotesting is recommended annually. Cytology is recommended annually when 3-year intervals are recommended for HPV or cotesting. 9) Human papilloma virus assays that are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for screening should be used for management according to their regulatory approval in the United States. (Note: all HPV testing in this document refers to testing for high-risk HPV types only).
For all management indications, HPV mRNA and HPV DNA tests without FDA approval for primary screening alone should only be used as a cotest with cytology, unless sufficient, exceptionally rigorous data are available to support primary HPV testing in management.
