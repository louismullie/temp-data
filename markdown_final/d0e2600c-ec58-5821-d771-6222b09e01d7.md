## Question

Diminished sounds bilateral bases in heart failure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the significance of "diminished breath sounds at bilateral lung bases" in the context of heart failure, including how to interpret this finding, what it implies pathophysiologically, how reliable it is diagnostically, and what confirmatory tests and differentials to consider. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise definition and documentation standards for "diminished breath sounds". Then, I should verify the pathophysiology linking this sign to heart failure, especially pleural effusions and pulmonary congestion. Next, I will review the diagnostic value and limitations of auscultation compared with imaging. After that, I need to check the differential diagnosis and how to distinguish cardiogenic from non-cardiogenic causes. Finally, I will outline a practical, evidence-based workup and monitoring plan, including when to use chest radiography, lung ultrasound, natriuretic peptides, and echocardiography, and I will integrate guideline recommendations to anchor decisions.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't misinterpret the sign. "Diminished breath sounds" at the bilateral lung bases is a documented auscultatory finding that can be recorded as "decreased breath sounds or dullness", and it is distinct from rales, wheezes, or absent breath sounds; this is a standard data element in ACC/AHA heart failure documentation and in COVID-19 cardiovascular data standards, which helps ensure consistent capture across settings [^ccabd27f] [^395e4355] [^36f7e04d].

> Now, I need to think about the pathophysiology in heart failure. Wait, let me verify the mechanism. Elevated left-sided filling pressures in heart failure transmit backward to the pulmonary circulation, causing pulmonary venous hypertension and interstitial edema; when hydrostatic pressure exceeds pleural capillary oncotic pressure, fluid accumulates in the pleural space, producing pleural effusions that blunt breath sound transmission at the bases, yielding diminished sounds and dullness to percussion; this is explicitly listed among heart failure signs in the universal definition and supported by pathophysiology reviews of acute decompensated heart failure [^d855c5a2] [^e604dc5e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnostic accuracy. I should double-check how reliable auscultation is for detecting pulmonary edema or effusion. Physical examination has modest sensitivity and specificity for pulmonary edema compared with lung ultrasound, which detects interstitial edema via bilateral B-lines and pleural effusions with far greater sensitivity and specificity; in acute heart failure, LUS for three or more B-lines in two or more bilateral intercostal spaces carries about 94% sensitivity and 92% specificity, whereas exam and chest radiography are notably less sensitive, reinforcing that diminished sounds are supportive but insufficient on their own [^936f88b3] [^1f650948].

> Next, I should review the differential so I don't anchor on heart failure alone. Diminished breath sounds at the bases can reflect weak sound generation, impaired transmission, or reduced airflow; causes include pleural effusion, atelectasis, emphysema/COPD, pneumothorax, obesity, shallow respirations, and diaphragmatic elevation, among others; in heart failure, pleural effusion is common, but COPD and obesity frequently coexist and can produce similar auscultatory findings, so I need to correlate with the rest of the exam and imaging rather than assume a single etiology [^14c20645] [^3f11ce57] [^abefe123].

> I will now examine how to confirm the suspicion at the bedside. Let me consider the sequence: start with chest radiography to assess cardiomegaly, pulmonary congestion, and pleural effusions; obtain natriuretic peptides to support or exclude heart failure when the diagnosis is uncertain; and add lung ultrasound to quantify effusions and B-lines when available, because LUS outperforms exam and rivals radiography for effusion and edema detection; this aligns with ACC/AHA/HFSA and ESC guidance to use CXR and natriuretic peptides in suspected HF, and with expert consensus on LUS for acute heart failure evaluation [^7056ffdd] [^21528c26] [^133306b1] [^936f88b3] [^1f650948].

> But wait, what if the effusion is unilateral or the clinical picture is atypical? I should confirm whether pleural fluid NT-proBNP helps. In suspected heart failure–related pleural effusions, especially when unilateral, pleural fluid NT-proBNP can support a cardiogenic etiology, though it is not superior to serum NT-proBNP and should be interpreted in context; the British Thoracic Society suggests considering pleural NT-proBNP in this scenario rather than ordering it routinely, which prevents overuse without added value [^0a9c058a] [^559e223e].

> Next, I should review the full heart failure workup to establish phenotype and guide therapy. Echocardiography is the diagnostic standard to confirm systolic versus diastolic dysfunction, quantify EF, and assess valves and filling pressures; in parallel, I need to check for precipitating factors and comorbidities such as ischemia, hypertension, diabetes, renal disease, and COPD, and document congestion signs including JVP, S3, edema, and rales, because these inform both prognosis and treatment selection; this is consistent with guideline-directed evaluation and the universal definition's emphasis on corroborating structural or functional cardiac abnormalities with objective congestion evidence [^b17afe9c] [^7417de34] [^1e38c1f7].

> Let me reconsider the prognostic implications so I counsel accurately. The presence of congestion signs, including rales and peripheral edema, correlates with worse outcomes in heart failure cohorts; in PARAGON-HF, orthopnea and rales were particularly predictive of heart failure hospitalization and cardiovascular death, underscoring that bibasilar findings, when accompanied by other congestion signs, carry prognostic weight and should prompt aggressive decongestion and guideline-directed therapy [^01e8d8ba].

> I should double-check monitoring and follow-up plans. Serial assessment of congestion is essential; lung ultrasound can track the resolution of B-lines and effusions in response to diuresis, and consistent patient positioning during LUS improves comparability over time; in outpatient or resource-limited settings, structured symptom and sign tracking with periodic biomarkers and imaging as indicated helps detect early decompensation and adjust therapy proactively [^936f88b3] [^27119fae].

> In summary, diminished breath sounds at the bilateral lung bases in heart failure most often reflect pleural effusions from elevated pulmonary venous pressures and interstitial edema that impair sound transmission; while this is a supportive clinical sign, it lacks the sensitivity and specificity to stand alone, so I need to confirm with chest radiography, natriuretic peptides, lung ultrasound when available, and echocardiography to establish the diagnosis and guide therapy, while keeping broader differentials in mind and using serial assessments to track response to treatment [^d855c5a2] [^7056ffdd] [^936f88b3] [^1e38c1f7].

Diminished breath sounds at the bilateral lung bases in heart failure most often reflect **pleural effusions** from elevated right-sided pressures and **basilar atelectasis** from compressive edema or shallow respirations [^d855c5a2] [^e604dc5e]. These findings are **non-specific** and can also occur with COPD, obesity, or other pleural diseases, so they should be confirmed with chest radiography or lung ultrasound [^7056ffdd] [^936f88b3] [^14c20645]. Management focuses on treating the underlying heart failure with diuretics and addressing volume overload; serial exams and imaging help track response [^e357c58e] [^936f88b3].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** explain diminished breath sounds at the bilateral lung bases in heart failure:

- **Pleural effusions**: Elevated right atrial and pulmonary venous pressures in heart failure cause fluid to accumulate in the pleural space, particularly at the lung bases, which dampens breath sound transmission [^3f11ce57] [^1decc7be].

- **Basilar atelectasis**: Compression of basal lung tissue by pleural effusions or interstitial edema, along with shallow respirations from dyspnea, can cause partial collapse of basal alveoli, reducing airflow and breath sounds [^notfound].

- **Interstitial edema**: Fluid accumulation in the interstitium and alveoli reduces lung compliance and airflow, especially in dependent regions, contributing to diminished breath sounds [^c31deb26].

---

## Clinical significance and diagnostic implications

Diminished breath sounds at the bilateral lung bases are a **non-specific** finding with moderate diagnostic value for heart failure. They should be interpreted alongside other clinical signs and diagnostic tests:

- **Pleural effusions**: Commonly associated with heart failure, particularly right-sided failure, and can be confirmed by chest radiography or lung ultrasound [^bb00ac46] [^936f88b3].

- **Basilar atelectasis**: Often coexists with pleural effusions and can be identified on imaging studies [^notfound].

- **Other causes**: Diminished breath sounds can also result from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity, or other pleural diseases, necessitating careful differential diagnosis [^14c20645] [^abefe123].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

When diminished breath sounds are detected at the bilateral lung bases in a patient with suspected heart failure, the following **diagnostic evaluation** is recommended:

| **Diagnostic test** | **Role in evaluation** |
|-|-|
| Chest radiography | - Assesses cardiomegaly <br/> - Pulmonary congestion <br/> - Pleural effusions <br/> - Alternative diagnoses [^7056ffdd] [^11d407fc] |
| Lung ultrasound | - Detects pleural effusions <br/> - Interstitial edema (B-lines) <br/> - Superior to chest radiography for certain findings [^936f88b3] [^1f650948] |
| Natriuretic peptides (BNP, NT-proBNP) | Supports diagnosis or exclusion of heart failure [^133306b1] [^896d3544] |
| Echocardiography | - Assesses cardiac structure and function <br/> - Confirms heart failure diagnosis [^b17afe9c] |

---

## Management strategies

Management of diminished breath sounds at the bilateral lung bases in heart failure focuses on **treating the underlying heart failure** and relieving congestion:

- **Diuretics**: Loop diuretics are first-line therapy to reduce fluid overload, relieve pleural effusions, and improve breath sounds [^notfound].

- **Monitoring**: Serial clinical examinations and imaging (chest radiography or lung ultrasound) are essential to monitor response to therapy and detect recurrence of effusions or atelectasis [^936f88b3].

- **Addressing underlying causes**: Treating precipitating factors such as hypertension, ischemia, or valvular disease is crucial to prevent recurrence [^b8483b17].

---

## Prognostic implications

The presence of diminished breath sounds at the bilateral lung bases in heart failure is associated with **increased morbidity and mortality**, reflecting significant fluid overload and disease severity. Persistent pleural effusions or recurrent atelectasis indicate poor prognosis and the need for aggressive management and close follow-up [^01e8d8ba].

---

Diminished breath sounds at the bilateral lung bases in heart failure primarily reflect **pleural effusions** and **basilar atelectasis** due to fluid overload and compressive edema. These findings are non-specific and should be confirmed with imaging and integrated with other clinical data. Management centers on diuretic therapy, monitoring, and treating underlying causes, with prognostic implications tied to disease severity and response to treatment.

Journal of Cardiac Failure (2021). High credibility.

Universal definition of heart failure (HF) — common symptoms and signs are enumerated and an objective marker is proposed to complement symptom-based diagnosis. Common symptoms and signs of HF are listed in Table 6, with typical symptoms including breathlessness, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, reduced exercise tolerance, fatigue (tiredness with increased time to recover after exercise), and ankle swelling; less typical symptoms include nocturnal cough, wheezing, bloated feeling, postprandial satiety, loss of appetite, decline in cognitive function or confusion (especially in the elderly), depression, and dizziness or syncope. Signs more specific for HF include elevated jugular venous pressure, third heart sound, summation gallop with third and fourth heart sounds, cardiomegaly with a laterally displaced apical impulse, hepatojugular reflux, and Cheyne Stokes respiration in advanced HF, whereas less specific signs include peripheral edema, pulmonary rales, unintentional weight gain (> 2 kg/week), weight loss in advanced HF with muscle wasting and cachexia, cardiac murmur, reduced air entry and dullness to percussion at lung bases suggestive of pleural effusion, tachycardia or irregular pulse, tachypnea, hepatomegaly/ascites, cold extremities, oliguria, and narrow pulse pressure. The current ACCF/AHA Classification of HF includes 2 presymptomatic stages, A and B; although the definition of the syndrome of HF is restricted to being a symptomatic clinical condition, a new categorization of Stages A and B into "at risk" and "pre-HF" is proposed. To strengthen diagnostic consistency, the incorporation of an objective measurement in addition to the symptoms in the HF definition is proposed.

Context

Dyspnea is a common complaint in the emergency department where physicians must accurately make a rapid diagnosis.

Objective

To assess the usefulness of history, symptoms, and signs along with routine diagnostic studies (chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and serum B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP]) that differentiate heart failure from other causes of dyspnea in the emergency department.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE (1966-July 2005) and the reference lists from retrieved articles, previous reviews, and physical examination textbooks.

Study Selection

We retained 22 studies of various findings for diagnosing heart failure in adult patients presenting with dyspnea to the emergency department.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently abstracted data (sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios [LRs]) and assessed methodological quality.

Data Synthesis

Many features increased the probability of heart failure, with the best feature for each category being the presence of (1) past history of heart failure (positive LR = 5.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.1–8.0); (2) the symptom of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (positive LR = 2.6; 95% CI, 1.5–4.5); (3) the sign of the third heart sound (S₃) gallop (positive LR = 11; 95% CI, 4.9–25.0); (4) the chest radiograph showing pulmonary venous congestion (positive LR = 12.0; 95% CI, 6.8–21.0); and (5) electrocardiogram showing atrial fibrillation (positive LR = 3.8; 95% CI, 1.7–8.8). The features that best decreased the probability of heart failure were the absence of (1) past history of heart failure (negative LR = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.38–0.53); (2) the symptom of dyspnea on exertion (negative LR = 0.48; 95% CI, 0.35–0.67); (3) rales (negative LR = 0.51; 95% CI, 0.37–0.70); (4) the chest radiograph showing cardiomegaly (negative LR = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.23–0.48); and (5) any electrocardiogram abnormality (negative LR = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.47–0.88). A low serum BNP proved to be the most useful test (serum B-type natriuretic peptide < 100 pg/mL; negative LR = 0.11; 95% CI, 0.07–0.16).

Conclusions

For dyspneic adult emergency department patients, a directed history, physical examination, chest radiograph, and electrocardiography should be performed. If the suspicion of heart failure remains, obtaining a serum BNP level may be helpful, especially for excluding heart failure.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^c4d26763]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Acute right heart failure (ARHF) — clinical presentation includes that edema may initially be less prominent or absent, symptoms include shortness of breath resulting from diminished peripheral oxygen delivery and atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, and examination signs include increased jugular venous pressure with a prominent v wave, prominent midprecordial cardiac impulse, right-sided third heart sound, and holosystolic murmur of tricuspid regurgitation; hepatomegaly, ascites, and peripheral edema may occur when ARHF is superimposed on chronic RHF, right upper quadrant discomfort may result from hepatic congestion, and if a patent foramen ovale is present (≈15% of adults) right-to-left shunting at the atrial level can lead to systemic hypoxemia and cyanosis.

### The pulmonary manifestations of left heart failure [^c31deb26]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Determining whether a patient's symptoms are the result of heart or lung disease requires an understanding of the influence of pulmonary venous hypertension on lung function. Herein, we describe the effects of acute and chronic elevations of pulmonary venous pressure on the mechanical and gas-exchanging properties of the lung. The mechanisms responsible for various symptoms of congestive heart failure are described, and the significance of sleep-disordered breathing in patients with heart disease is considered. While the initial clinical evaluation of patients with dyspnea is imprecise, measurement of B-type natriuretic peptide levels may prove useful in this setting.

Pneumothorax

LUS can be used to exclude pneumothorax in the area scanned with higher sensitivity than supine chest radiography by recognizing lung sliding, a slight horizontal movement of the pleural line with respiration; see Supplementary information S1 (video). In the setting of a pneumothorax, lung sliding is absent in the affected area of the chest. At the border of a pneumothorax, a transition point between normal lung surface (with lung sliding) and pneumothorax (without lung sliding) can sometimes be identified. This so-called 'lung point' confirms the diagnosis. Lung sliding might be absent in several other pathological conditions (such as pleural adhesions or selective mainstem intubation) and, therefore, should not be used in isolation to make the diagnosis of pneumothorax, but rather in conjunction with the full range of sonographic features.

Differential diagnosis and potential pitfalls

The major questions when using LUS for the assessment of patients with possible AHF include whether there is evidence of pulmonary oedema (such as multiple bilateral B-lines), whether there are other findings suggestive of AHF (such as pleural effusion), and finally, whether there are findings of alternate or concurrent conditions (such as pulmonary consolidation or pneumothorax). Despite its apparent simplicity, a number of caveats exist for the use of LUS. First, B-lines can resolve rapidly in response to treatment, and, therefore, LUS data must be interpreted in the context of previous interventions. Second, B-lines can be seen in a number of pulmonary conditions, including pulmonary fibrosis or interstitial lung disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and pneumonitis. The observation of B-lines together with other LUS abnormalities might indicate that two pathologies coexist, or that the B-lines are an expression of pathology other than AHF (for example, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or pulmonary oedema in patients receiving haemodialysis). Third, large pleural effusions might interfere with B-line quantification in the affected thoracic zones and induce lung consolidation (FIG. 1d). Together, these considerations outline why LUS should not be used in isolation, but rather integrated into clinical and laboratory assessment.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^876e4e57]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Other qualities of dyspnea and overall perception — sensations of effort, tightness, and air hunger are more reliably characterized than others, and the mechanisms above do not adequately explain dyspnea from vascular problems such as congestive heart failure and pulmonary hypertension; pulmonary vascular receptors (J-receptors?) may play a role, but only suggestive evidence is available. Multiple distinguishable sensations seldom occur in isolation, and multiple uncomfortable sensations are often present and together produce the overall perception of dyspnea; even specific laboratory stimuli generally stimulate more than one afferent pathway. Assessment with magnitude scales may be more sensitive than binary choices, though reports of dyspnea are not as consistent as reports of colors or sounds.

### Evaluating the utility of chest X-rays for non-traumatic chest pain in Australia-a retrospective cohort study [^a3130c4d]. Emergency Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Findings of hemoptysis in the context of NTCP can be associated with pneumonia, lung abscess, cancer, or pulmonary embolism. Auscultation findings of diminished lung sounds can stem from either weak sound generation or impaired transmission from obstruction. Possible causes are obstructive respiratory conditions like asthma and COPD, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or shallow breathing upon examination. Our definition of rales included coarse and fine crackles or crepitations, with fine crackles being heard in conditions like early congestive heart failure and interstitial lung disease. Coarse crackles are heard in conditions like asthma, COPD, pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. However, even though the auscultation findings were found to be associated with clinically significant abnormal CXRs, they are highly variable as clinical features to utilize. Auscultation is subject to differing clinical expertise, external noise level, and patient factors like body habitus, or effort of breathing during the examination. Oxygen saturations are in comparison more reliable as a clinical marker for disease.

### 13-year-old female with new onset multifocal pulmonary ground-glass opacities [^593eec25]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

A 13-year-old female who recently emigrated from Honduras presented to an emergency department in Texas with a 2-month history of weight loss, fatigue, cough, and progressive shortness of breath. Her symptoms started with a nonproductive cough, and she later developed dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea. On physical examination, she was tachycardic and tachypneic. She had a thin, emaciated body habitus. She was visibly in respiratory distress with nasal flaring, tracheal tugging, and intercostal and subcostal retractions. She had diminished breath sounds at the bases and bibasilar crackles. A computed tomography scan of the chest revealed multifocal ground-glass opacities throughout all lobes of both lungs with small bilateral pleural effusions and prominent bilateral hilar lymph nodes. We will discuss the approach to the initial evaluation and subsequent diagnosis.

### Lung sound patterns help to distinguish congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma exacerbations [^1cd1eb29]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

Although congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and asthma patients typically present with abnormal auscultatory findings on lung examination, respiratory sounds are not normally subjected to rigorous analysis. The aim of this study was to evaluate in detail the distribution of respiratory sound intensity in CHF, COPD, and asthma patients during acute exacerbation.

Methods

Respiratory sounds throughout the respiratory cycle were captured and displayed using an acoustic-based imaging technique. Breath sound distribution was mapped to create a gray-scale sequence of two-dimensional images based on intensity of sound (vibration). Consecutive CHF (n = 22), COPD (n = 19), and asthma (n = 18) patients were imaged at the time of presentation to the emergency department (ED). Twenty healthy subjects were also enrolled as a comparison group. Geographical area of the images and respiratory sound patterns were quantitatively analyzed.

Results

In healthy volunteers and COPD patients, the median (interquartile range [IQR]) geographical areas of the vibration energy images were similar, at 75.6 (IQR = 6.0) and 75.8 (IQR = 10.8) kilopixels, respectively (p > 0.05). Compared to healthy volunteers and COPD patients, areas for CHF and asthma patients were smaller, at 66.9 (IQR = 9.9) and 53.9 (IQR = 15.6) kilopixels, respectively (p < 0.05). The geographic area ratios between the left and right lungs for healthy volunteers and CHF and COPD patients were 1.0 (IQR = 0.2), 1.0 (IQR = 0.2), and 1.0 (IQR = 0.1), respectively. Compared to healthy volunteers, the geographic area ratio between the left and right lungs for asthma patients was 0.5 (IQR = 0.4; p < 0.05). In healthy volunteers and CHF patients, the ratios of vibration energy values at peak inspiration and expiration (peak I/E ratio) were 4.6 (IQR = 4.4) and 4.7 (IQR = 3.5). In marked contrast, the peak I/E ratios of COPD and asthma patients were 3.4 (= 2.1) and 0.1 (IQR = 0.3; p < 0.05), respectively.

Conclusions

The pilot data generated in this study support the concept that relative differences in respiratory sound intensity may be useful in distinguishing acute dyspnea caused by CHF, COPD, or asthma.

### Breathing SPACE-a practical approach to the breathless patient [^3366ee88]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Cardiac causes

A cardiac cause of breathlessness is suggested by a history of hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia or ischaemic heart disease, and by physical findings such as lung crepitations, the presence of oedema, tachycardia, cardiac murmurs, or atrial fibrillation. A normal electrocardiogram (ECG) reduces the likelihood of cardiac disease but consider investigations such as blood natriuretic peptide (BNP) and echocardiography if there is clinical suspicion.

Lung disease is also common in people with heart disease, so the possibility of a dual diagnosis should be considered. For example, 15–24% of people with COPD also have ischaemic heart diseaseand one-third of people with atrial fibrillation have a diagnosis of asthma or COPD. Evidence suggests systematic undertreatment of patients with COPD following myocardial infarction; they are less likely to receive beta blockers, although these can be safely administered.

Hyperinflation caused by airflow obstruction restricts cardiac outputand the "cardiac" aspects of lung diagnoses should be considered. In patients with COPD, low oxygen saturations, especially if they are disproportionate to the degree of airflow obstruction, may represent pulmonary hypertension that can lead to right-sided heart failure. Consider sleep-disordered breathing with nocturnal hypoxia in individuals with a high body mass index (BMI), oedema, or a history of type II respiratory failure. Ask about daytime somnolence, morning headaches, and confusion.

Interstitial fluid and pulmonary oedema

Quantification of B-lines (vertical artefacts that result from an increase in interstitial density; FIG. 1b) has been shown to be useful for the diagnosis, monitoring, and risk assessment of patients with known or suspected AHF –. Either curvilinear or phased array transducers can be used, typically at an imaging depth of 18 cm. Although the assessment of eight or more anterior and lateral thoracic zones (four on each hemithorax) has been recommended in a consensus statement, a subsequent study demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy with examination of only six thoracic regions. The visualization of three or more B-lines in two or more intercostal spaces bilaterally should be considered diagnostic for pulmonary oedema, with sensitivity of 94% (95% CI 81–98%) and specificity of 92% (95% CI 84–96%). By contrast, physical examination and chest radiography have a sensitivity of only 62% (95% CI 61–64%) and 57% (95% CI 55–59%), and a specificity of 68% (95% CI 67–69%) and 89% (95% CI 88–90%) for a diagnosis of pulmonary oedema, respectively. The presence of multiple bilateral B-lines in AHF has been well-correlated with natriuretic peptide levels, and only variably correlated with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and measures of extravascular lung water. Given that studies to assess the incremental diagnostic value of LUS compared with natriuretic peptides for the identification of AHF in patients with dyspnoea reported variable results in different cohorts, this topic warrants further investigation. The number of B-lines is thought to decrease with treatment for AHF and, therefore, this technique is potentially useful in the monitoring of pulmonary oedema in response to therapy. For serial assessments, patient positioning (sitting versus supine) should be kept consistent. Importantly, a higher number of B-lines on LUS at the time of discharge from hospital might help to identify patients with heart failure who have a worse prognosis.

Pleural effusion

Similarly to B-lines, the presence of pleural effusions can be assessed using curvilinear or phased array transducers in the posterior–axillary line(FIG. 1d). Current data regarding the diagnostic utility of pleural effusions identified on ultrasonography in patients with AHF are less robust, but have been reported with sensitivities of 79–84% and specificities of 83–98% in small studies of patients with dyspnoea.

Symptoms and Detection of Heart Failure

Many normal symptoms in pregnancy may mimic HF Signs such as peripheral edema, palmar erythema, systolic murmur, and a third heart sound, further complicate detection of cardiac decompensation. Signs that warrant further investigation for cardiac disease are cyanosis, clubbing, resting tachycardia, any type of arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, hypoxia, tachypnea, elevated jugular venous pressure, diastolic murmur, murmur radiating beyond the left sternal edge, murmur associated with a thrill, marked peripheral edema, or evidence of pulmonary edema; symptoms such as shortness of breath and orthopnea also indicate a need for further consideration. Pregnant women with HF commonly displayed dyspnea, cough, bilateral pitting pedal edema, elevated jugular venous pressure, third heart sound, and tender hepatomegaly. Most patients with HF presented with bibasal crepitations. To help clinicians identify cardiac disease in pregnancy the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative and California Department of Public Health created a California Quality Improvement Toolkit on cardiovascular screening and assessment. This framework gives providers clear guidance on what signs and symptoms are cause for concern and how to proceed with diagnostic testing and further management. Application of the toolkit evidenced that 88% of pregnancy‐related cardiovascular mortalities could have been identified before death with the use of this screening tool. It is now recommended that all women should be assessed for cardiovascular disease in the antepartum and postpartum periods using this toolkit algorithm. Family history and other underlying medical conditions can also help guide medical judgment.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of heart failure [^b17afe9c]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Heart failure is a common clinical syndrome characterized by dyspnea, fatigue, and signs of volume overload, which may include peripheral edema and pulmonary rales. Heart failure has high morbidity and mortality rates, especially in older persons. Many conditions, such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular heart disease, and diabetes mellitus, can cause or lead to decompensation of chronic heart failure. Up to 40 to 50 percent of patients with heart failure have diastolic heart failure with preserved left ventricular function, and the overall mortality is similar to that of systolic heart failure. The initial evaluation includes a history and physical examination, chest radiography, electrocardiography, and laboratory assessment to identify causes or precipitating factors. A displaced cardiac apex, a third heart sound, and chest radiography findings of venous congestion or interstitial edema are useful in identifying heart failure. Systolic heart failure is unlikely when the Framingham criteria are not met or when B-type natriuretic peptide level is normal. Echocardiography is the diagnostic standard to confirm systolic or diastolic heart failure through assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction. Evaluation for ischemic heart disease is warranted in patients with heart failure, especially if angina is present, given that coronary artery disease is the most common cause of heart failure.

AHF: a diagnostic and management challenge

AHF is a syndrome rather than a diagnosis per se, caused by a wide array of pathologies that result in a spectrum of disease severity ranging from breathlessness to cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest. AHF is a highly lethal condition, and studies have shown that minimizing the 'time to appropriate therapy' — the initiation of treatment as soon as possible, including in the prehospital setting — is potentially beneficial in improving outcomes. AHF is variably defined as the rapid onset or acute worsening of symptoms and signs of heart failure that is associated with elevated plasma levels of natriuretic peptides. However, substantial diagnostic uncertainty is inevitable when relying only on traditional clinical findings, and currently a lack of specificity exists in routine investigations for this condition. Indeed, although patients often present with a suggestive history, clinical features (such as shock, and pulmonary or peripheral congestion), and/or symptoms related to the underlying potential cause, these traditional clinical features are frequently absent; over-reliance on these factors might delay diagnosis and implementation of appropriate therapy, or contribute to a missed diagnosis in up to 20% of patients. Furthermore, patients' clinical features might vary according to the site of initial medical contact and the management strategies employed.

The majority of patients with AHF present to emergency departments; however, many patient are also assessed and managed in other acute care settings such as in intensive care and inpatient cardiology units. Patients with AHF usually present with symptoms of congestion and breathlessness rather than cardiac arrest or shock. Symptoms of breathlessness account for 3–5% of emergency department attendances in Europe and the USA, and the major causes of breathlessness and their prevalence include AHF (50%), pneumonia or bronchitis (20%), exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma (20%), and pulmonary embolism (5–10%). Current guidelines recommend that clinical examination and investigations should be integrated to form the diagnosis, including the use of electrocardiogram (ECG), chest radiograph, and biomarkers such as natriuretic peptides, troponin, and D-dimer as indicated. Unfortunately, these data can be challenging to interpret, in particular in the 10–15% of patients in whom two concomitant diagnoses exist. Specifically, although included in the current definition of AHF, levels of natriuretic peptides can be elevated in respiratory disease and other acute conditions such as pulmonary embolism, sepsis, and anaemia –.

### High prevalence of undetected heart failure in long-term care residents: findings from the heart failure in care homes (HFinCH) study [^6199ae39]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Differential definitions of heart failure

Definitions of HF were based on ESC guidelines available at the time of the study, modified for the potential impact of both cognitive impairment and immobility resulting from co-morbidities. Symptoms and signs compatible with HF were defined as: (i) breathlessness, graded as New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II, III, or IV; (ii) moderate oedema (up to the knees bilaterally); or (iii) mild oedema (confined to the ankles) + one other clinical sign (see below); (iv) mild oedema and taking at least furosemide 40 mg (or equivalent) per day; or (v) two or more other signs [raised jugular venous pressure (JVP), lung crackles, respiratory rate > 20/min, third heart sound].

Left ventricular systolic dysfunction was assessed: using the 'eyeball' method as normal, or mildly, moderately, or severely impaired; by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) calculated by Simpson's rule; and by wall motion index using the ASC recommendations. Doppler and tissue Doppler measurements of the longitudinal function of the heart were used to determine left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD). Measurements of the ratio of early transmitral flow velocity and early mitral annular velocity (E/E') were recorded at both the septum and lateral wall.

All residents with clinical features and either an LVEF of ≤ 50% or whose left ventricular systolic function was assessed by 'eyeball' to be mildly, moderately, or severely impaired were classified as having HF due to LVSD. HFpEF was diagnosed in accordance with ESC guidelinesusing clinical, echocardiographic, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) measurements. Patients with clinical features of HF whose LVEF was > 50% with an E/E' > 15, or those with an equivocal E/E' (8–15) but BNP > 200 pg/mL or N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP) > 220 pg/mL were diagnosed as having HFpEF.

Study endpoints

Point prevalence was measured according to the clinical diagnosis of HF, and differentiated as LVSD, LVSD-HF, or HFpEF. Symptom and sign profiles (including MMSE, AMTS, and NYHA class), co-morbidities and prescribed medications, quality of life (EQ-5D and EQ-VAS), and characteristics of care provision and diagnostic agreement in general practice and care facility records were reported for those with and without HF.

### Bilateral spontaneous pneumothorax in SARS-CoV-2 infection: a very rare, life-threatening complication [^f63b18f0]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) era, the presence of acute respiratory failure is generally associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome; however, it is essential to consider other differential diagnoses that require different, and urgent, therapeutic approaches. Herein we describe a COVID-19 case complicated with bilateral spontaneous pneumothorax. A previously healthy 45-year-old man was admitted to our emergency department with sudden-onset chest pain and progressive shortness of breath 17 days after diagnosis with uncomplicated COVID-19 infection. He was tachypneic and presented severe hypoxemia (75% percutaneous oxygen saturation). Breath sounds were diminished bilaterally on auscultation. A chest X-ray revealed the presence of a large bilateral pneumothorax. A thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed the large bilateral pneumothorax, with findings consistent with severe COVID-19 infection. Chest tubes were inserted, with immediate clinical improvement. Follow-up chest CT scan revealed resolution of bilateral pneumothorax, reduction of parenchymal consolidation, and formation of large bilateral pneumatoceles. The patient remained under observation and was then discharged home. Bilateral spontaneous pneumothorax is a very rare, potentially life-threatening complication in patients with COVID-19. This case highlights the importance of recognizing this complication early to prevent potentially fatal consequences.

### "Velcro-type" crackles predict specific radiologic features of fibrotic interstitial lung disease [^34b0f9d6]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Emphysema did not correlate with the presence of crackles, in keeping with the concept that destruction of alveolar walls result in a weaker transmission of lung sounds, either normal or adventitious. In patients with coexisting fibrosis and emphysema it is possible that emphysema could mask "Velcro-type" crackles, thus decreasing the sensitivity of an acoustic assessment for fibrosis. To investigate this possibility, within this study we compared the emphysema scores between subgroups of FILD patients with different acoustic findings, and identified no evidence that emphysema reduces the sensitivity of auscultation to identify lung fibrosis.

This study has some points of strength. We recruited a large population of patients with a broad spectrum of lung pathologies. Lung sounds were recorded using a simple, point-of-care tool: an electronic stethoscope which is easily applicable in every clinical setting. The assessment of the recordings was performed by physicians blinded to any clinical information and unbiased towards their source (same or different patients). Lung sounds were paired with single HRCT slices: this approach allowed a precise matching with radiologic abnormalities in the lung parenchyma below the site of auscultation. Whilst lung sounds generated from a specific area might spread towards different regions of the same lung or to the other side of the chest, the transmission of "Velcro-type" crackles over different areas has been shown to be more limited than in other conditions such as chronic heart failure or pneumonia, supporting the rationale for the approach followed in this study. The limitations of this study are mainly related to the research setting and cross-sectional design, which did not allow a comprehensive characterisation of the study population. The participants were not followed up and the final clinical diagnosis remained unknown in most cases. Physiology measurements and other clinical data were not collected, thereafter the relationships between "Velcro-type" crackles and clinical or functional deterioration were not addressed. Nevertheless, the study primarily focused on the validity of the subjective assessment of "Velcro-type" crackles against HRCT imaging, irrespectively of the clinical diagnosis or the functional status of the patients.

### Prevalence of airflow obstruction in patients with stable systolic heart failure [^28566e63]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

In this study we found that almost one fourth of the patients had a lung function impairment with a non-obstructive pattern. Treatment of this condition can be difficult and therefore might the clinical relevance of this finding be limited. While some of the patients might have an impaired lung function du to non-pulmonary causes (adipositas or chronic congestion) some of the patients could potentially have severe primary lung disease (i.e. pulmonary fibrosis). The relevance of this finding should therefore be investigated in future studies.

We could confirm previous findings of a very low agreement rate between self-reported COPD and airflow obstruction diagnosed by spirometry. The sharing of symptoms –dyspnoea - implicates that there are significant diagnostic challenges between HF and COPD. Both auscultation and history is difficult to use for differentiation between heart disease and lung disease and even though natriuretic peptides can diagnose HF, they can not exclude pulmonary disease. Diagnosing and treating undiagnosed COPD might be essential in patients with HF as a growing level of evidence has shown that targeted treatment for COPD reduces symptoms, improves quality of life and may improve prognosis. Furthermore, the knowledge of patients having COPD may reduce the risk of overdosing diuretics due to misinterpretation of the background for patients having dyspnoea. It therefore seems relevant to perform spirometry – a simple, cost-effective, non-invasive and objective examination – in all patients with HF.

### Diagnostic potential of oscillometry: a population-based approach [^160bc0eb]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Symptoms and diagnosis were assessed with an interview-based questionnaire, which is a strength, but the presence of disease was self-reported without objective supportive data. Finally, the present dataset does not have statistical power to assess oscillometry performance in patients with restrictive conditions. Furthermore, although all participants were in stable condition, the contribution of congestive heart failure to symptoms cannot be completely ruled out.

Conclusions

This study strongly supports oscillometry as a simple, feasible, and sensitive point-of-care method to objectify respiratory symptoms in the general population. Our results underscore the value of integrating oscillometry into routine respiratory assessments to detect and manage respiratory diseases early, particularly in individuals with preserved spirometry. Last, future studies including oscillometry in the battery of patient-related outcomes are likely to yield unique insights.

Case presentation

An 85-year-old woman with a history of dextrocardia with situs inversus was referred to our facility for treatment of decompensated heart failure. She had been experiencing a gradual increase in exertional dyspnoea and bilateral lower extremity oedema for 2 months, although up to then she had been independent and able to walk. She had been diagnosed with heart failure 5 years prior to admission. At that time, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed right heart enlargement and pericardial effusion; however, the causes of heart failure were unclear. Her medical history also included atrial fibrillation, diabetes and interstitial pneumonia.

On physical examination, the patient had an irregular heart rhythm of 110 bpm. Her blood pressure was 127/91 mm Hg. SpO₂ was 90% under 5 L/min of oxygen using a nasal cannula. She had jugular vein distention and leg pitting oedema. Chest auscultation revealed crackles on both the lung bases.

### Congestive heart failure: diagnosis, pathophysiology, therapy, and implications for respiratory care [^e357c58e]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a common clinical disorder that results in pulmonary vascular congestion and reduced cardiac output. CHF should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any adult patient who presents with dyspnea and/or respiratory failure. The diagnosis of heart failure is often determined by a careful history and physical examination and characteristic chest-radiograph findings. The measurement of serum brain natriuretic peptide and echocardiography have substantially improved the accuracy of diagnosis. Therapy for CHF is directed at restoring normal cardiopulmonary physiology and reducing the hyperadrenergic state. The cornerstone of treatment is a combination of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor and slow titration of a beta blocker. Patients with CHF are prone to pulmonary complications, including obstructive sleep apnea, pulmonary edema, and pleural effusions. Continuous positive airway pressure and noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation benefit patients in CHF exacerbations.

Cardiovascular Morbidities

Cardiovascular morbidities are frequently present in patients experiencing ECOPDs, and thus a patient history is important to assess their presence or impact. Chest pain/discomfort, fluid retention, or irregular pulse suggest a cardiovascular cause as an alternative or contributing diagnosis to an ECOPD.

Acute HF

Acute HF is defined by worsening of dyspnea at rest (particularly while supine) or during exertion and/or fatigue, together with signs of fluid retention such as pulmonary congestion, increased jugular vein distension, or ankle swelling, with objective evidence of an abnormality of the structure or function of the heart. Some of these clinical findings can make distinguishing ECOPD from acute HF difficult. In addition, COPD is present in up to 50% of patients with HF, and HF occurs in roughly 20% of individuals with COPD because of overlapping risk factors (aging and smoking) and underlying mechanisms (systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and muscular atrophy). Furthermore, an HF diagnosis is often difficult to confirm in patients with preserved ejection fraction, which is common in patients with COPD. Hypoxemia and tachycardia in ECOPD can promote decompensation in HF, whereas pulmonary fluid retention in HF can worsen airway obstruction. In addition, wheezing is common in acute HF (approximately 30%), whereas COPD can mask the presence of basilar crackles. However, their presence, coupled with evidence of leg edema, elevated jugular venous pressure, and a third heart sound increases the likelihood of HF being the cause of, or a contributor to, the acute event.

There were no risk factors for TB, nor was there a history of fevers, chills, shortness of breath, leg swelling, changes in his urine color and frequency or urgency, or unintended weight loss. On admission, he was noted to be breathing comfortably. Vital signs revealed a temperature of 36.6ºC, BP of 138/70 mm Hg, heart rate of 66 beats/min, respiratory of rate of 18 breaths/min, and a blood oxygen saturation level of 98% on room air. Physical examination was significant for decreased bilateral breath sounds with no wheezing, crackles, or rhonchi. Cardiovascular examination revealed normal cardiac rhythm without murmur, rubs, or gallops. There was no clubbing or edema on his extremities.

Case presentation

A 10 year old girl of Afro-Caribbean descent presented to the emergency department with complaints of chest pain, shortness of breath and fever over the past 4 days. The left-sided chest pain was described as "squeezing", and was associated with palpitations. Both the pain and shortness of breath were worse in the supine position and partially relieved on leaning forward. She had no past medical history. However, over the last three months she was becoming increasingly fatigued and noticed significant weight loss, intermittent fevers and arthralgia affecting the wrist and elbow joints. She denied hair loss, oral ulcers, a rash or any medication use. There was no known family history of autoimmune disease.

On examination she had a heart rate of 135 bpm, a respiratory rate of 40 breaths/min, blood pressure of 93/63 mmHg and a temperature of 37.7°C. She was underweight with a body mass index of 13.8 kg/m², had pale conjunctivae and maintained an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. On cardiovascular examination heart sounds were muffled and the apex beat was diffuse and displaced inferiorly. The pulse was diminished on inspiration. It was difficult to formally assess for pulsus paradoxus due to the patient's abnormal respiration. Jugular venous distension was evident. Respiratory examination revealed decreased breath sounds at the left lung base which was also dull on percussion. The rest of the examination only proved significant for generalized lymphadenopathy. There was no evidence of joint inflammation, peripheral oedema or clubbing.

Future Developments

Obtain information from high quality large studies to define optimal time intervals at which LUS should be repeated for monitoring in specific clinical situations.

The possibility to assess pulmonary congestion and cardiogenic pulmonary edema by LUS is well‐documented. When evaluating pulmonary edema, B‐line artifacts, their number, gravitational gradient and bilateral occurrence can be qualitatively analyzed by visual analysis of the US clips. The term "interstitial syndrome", indicating the presence of fluid in the interstitial space, has been proposed (be aware of the non‐specificity of interstitial syndrome for the diagnosis of pulmonary edema as interstitial space density can be altered not only by fluid increase but also by others pathological conditions, eg, collagen deposition). Interstitial syndrome has been defined by the presence of multiple B‐line artifacts in a single scan (be aware that number of vertical artifacts can vary depending on machine type and settings, frequency and incidence angle used. See technical statements). The appearance of these patterns can be linked to the increase of fluids in the interstitial space. In fact, fluid may seep into alveoli, filling them to various degrees. During an US assessment, two signs are searched for: the alveolar‐interstitial syndrome (AIS) and white lung that, respectively, indicate a more advanced involvement that is secondary to the progression of pulmonary edema. In the US assessment of patients with pulmonary edema, attention is also paid to the regularity of the pleural line and its continuity, as the presence of irregular pleural line together with vertical artifacts must lead to think to an overlap of pneumogenic pathological condition. Pleural effusion may be a co‐occurring sign.

LUS is considered to be very helpful for the monitoring of patients with pulmonary edema in a hospital setting. In patients hospitalized due to cardiogenic pulmonary edema, correlation has been reported between the number of B‐lines and the NYHA functional class, NT‐proBNP level, and other echocardiographic parameters. The applicability of LUS for the ambulatory monitoring of patients with congestive heart failure have also been documented, with positive effects on the reduction of hospitalizations reported.

Statement 10 (Clinical Statement)

LUS should be performed on the largest possible area of the chest that is available during LUS examination (the limitation of the examination area should be justified by the patient's clinical condition).

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^95def10b]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome in which impaired ventricular filling and ejection of blood into circulation causes decreased stroke volume and cardiac output. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (50% or more) is the most common type of heart failure, and up to 1 in 10 adults will be affected in their lifetime. Clinical symptoms such as peripheral edema, dyspnea, and orthopnea, with clinical findings including jugular venous distention, third heart sound, and laterally displaced apical impulse should prompt consideration of heart failure. Laboratory values (eg, elevated N-terminal fragment of the prohormone brain natriuretic peptide) can also aid in diagnosis, which can then be confirmed with specific echocardiographic findings. Once heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is diagnosed, medications should be initiated to manage comorbid symptoms and conditions such as hypertension, obesity, and obstructive sleep apnea. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors have been shown to reduce hospitalizations related to heart failure and cardiovascular-related mortality in patients with symptomatic heart failure, elevated natriuretic peptide levels, and an ejection fraction more than 40%; therefore, they should be considered in all patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Additionally, loop diuretics, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and angiotensin receptor blocker/neprilysin inhibitors can be used. In patients with end-organ dysfunction or signs of refractory treatment, consultation with a heart failure specialist should be considered.

1 INTRODUCTION

Heart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome due to a structural or functional disorder that results in elevated intracardiac pressures and/or inadequate cardiac output at rest and/or during exercise.

HF is a serious heart condition with significant prevalence. Due to the increased survival of coronary vascular disease patients, the prevalence of HF is rising worldwide.

The mortality of HF patients remains high and can range from 5% to 15%, even during hospitalization. The high hospitalization rate also adds to the economic burden making HF a leading cause of hospitalization for patients older than 65 years of age.HF has high mortality even after, in time hospitalization. According to some studies, the mortality can be as high as 10.4% within 30 days of hospitalization. The mortality rate doubles to 22% in 1 year and quadruples to 42.3% in 5 years. The improvement of therapies and medication has improved survivability, but still, a lot needs to be done to reduce high mortality rates.

Patients of HF often present with dyspnea as one of the chief complaints. A chest X‐ray is the first modality of imaging as this is low‐cost, noninvasive, and helps differentiate between cardiac and pulmonary reasons of dyspnea.HF has many signs that can be picked up on X‐ray; these include cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) > 50%, pulmonary congestion, bilateral pleural effusions, Kerley B lines, hilar haziness, cephalization of pulmonary vessels, and so forth. Bilateral pleural effusion results in difficulty in breathing and is one of the indicators of HF. However, an increased CTR may not be present in patients with HF. A study on the utility of X‐rays in HF patients demonstrated that cardiomegaly and redistribution were good indicators of reduced HF. However, they were not sufficient findings for the diagnosis of HF. Additionally, in a multicentre study, only cardiomegaly was found to have a sensitivity of more than 50%. Thus, cardiomegaly or an increase in CTR, along with the presence of congestion in the form of pleural effusion, can be identified, and an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model can be used to identify potential HF patients.

### Does the physical examination still have a role in patients with suspected heart failure? [^204b6a7b]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2011). Low credibility.

Aims

The prognostic value of signs of congestion in patients suspected of having chronic heart failure (CHF) is unknown. Our objectives were to define their prevalence and specificity in diagnosing CHF and to determine their prognostic value in patients in a community heart failure clinic.

Methods and Results

Analysis of referrals to a community clinic for patients with CHF symptoms. Systolic CHF (S-HF) was defined as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 45%, heart failure with normal ejection fraction (HeFNEF) as LVEF > 45%, and amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide > 50 pmol L(-1); other subjects were defined as not having CHF. Signs of congestion were as follows: no signs; right heart congestion (RHC: oedema, jugular venous distension); left heart congestion (LHC: lung crackles); or both (R + LHC). Of 1881 patients referred, 707 did not have CHF, 853 had S-HF, and 321 had HeFNEF. The median inter-quartile range (IQR) age was 72 years (64–78), 40% were women, and LVEF was 47% (35–59). Overall, 417 patients had RHC of whom 49% had S-HF and 21% HeFNEF. Eighty-five patients had LHC of whom 43% had S-HF and 20% had HeFNEF. One hundred and seventy-two patients had R + LHC of whom 71% had S-HF and 16% had HeFNEF. During a median (IQR) follow-up of 64(44–76) months, 40% of the entire patient cohort died. The combination of R + LHC signs was an independent marker of an adverse prognosis (χ(2)-log-rank test = 186.1, P < 0.0001).

Conclusion

Clinical signs of congestion are independent predictors of prognosis in ambulatory patients with suspected CHF.

RESULTS

Study Population Characteristics

In total, 78 hospitalized patients with AHF and 38 patients with stable chronic HF from the OP were included. Ten patients with AHF and 2 OP patients with stable HF were excluded from the analyses, because 1 or more exclusion criteria were met as described in the methods section. The baseline characteristics of the remaining study population is summarized in Table 1. Overall, patients with AHF were older than OP patients (76.1 ± 9.2 versus 67.2 ± 12.8 years, P < 0.001). Patients were predominantly male in both cohorts (72% and 89%, P = 0.086). LVEF was higher in patients with AHF (44.3 ± 15.7 versus 36.7 ± 9.4%, P = 0.010). Patients with AHF were categorized in higher NYHA classes III and IV (72% versus 6%, P < 0.001), showed higher levels of circulating NT‐proBNP (4292 [2477, 8175] versus 578 [224, 3730] pg/mL, P < 0.001), and showed higher levels of dyspnea (≥ 3) as measured by the American Thoracic Society scale (54% versus 0%, P < 0.001). These higher levels of dyspnea were consistent with higher levels of self‐reported dyspnea on the VAS. Patients with AHF and OP patients with stable HF reported a VAS of 4 [3, 6] versus 1 [0, 2] cm, respectively (P < 0.001). The presentation of moderate to severe peripheral edema differed significantly across the 2 groups (34% versus 11%, P = 0.023). Likewise, abnormal lung auscultation, defined as the presence of crackles or rales, was significantly more frequent in patients with AHF (63% versus 3%, P < 0.001). Only 2 patients (1 from each cohort) presented with crackles.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^6682d11b]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Right-sided heart failure (RHF) physical examination — patients with severe RHF may appear emaciated, tachypneic, and cyanotic, and typically have elevated jugular venous pressure with a prominent V wave from tricuspid regurgitation (TR); atrial fibrillation is common. Increased jugular venous pressure with inspiration (Kussmaul sign) may also be seen with a noncompliant right ventricle (RV). The abdominojugular reflex test, defined as a sustained rise of > 3 cm in the jugular venous pressure for at least 15 seconds with calm spontaneous respiration, may unmask subtle venous hypertension. For RHF secondary to pulmonary hypertension (PH), a prominent pulmonic component of the second heart sound (P2) may be heard, whereas in congenital heart disease (CHD) P2 may be soft or even absent when there is a structural or postsurgical abnormality of the pulmonic valve (PV). A low-amplitude holosystolic murmur of TR may be present, the Carvallo sign may distinguish TR from mitral regurgitation, and in repaired tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) a to-and-fro murmur of combined pulmonic stenosis (PS) and insufficiency may occur at the upper left sternal border with radiation to the lungs.

### Burden of heart Failure signs and symptoms, prognosis, and response to Therapy: the PARAGON-HF trial [^01e8d8ba]. JACC: Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study investigated the prognostic importance of heart failure (HF) signs and symptoms in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and the effect of sacubitril/valsartan on HF signs and symptoms.

Background

In patients with HFpEF, worsening of HF symptoms, as a marker of cardiac decompensation, is frequently the reason for hospitalization. In this heterogenous disease entity, the prognostic value of HF signs and symptoms with regard to cardiovascular (CV) outcomes is poorly defined.

Methods

The authors examined the association between baseline HF signs and symptoms (rest dyspnea, exertional dyspnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, fatigue, edema, jugular venous distension, rales, and third heart sound) as well as burden of these HF signs and symptoms (classified as ≤ 2 and ≥ 3 HF signs and symptoms) and the primary composite of total HF hospitalizations and CV death, its components, and all-cause death in 4,725 patients enrolled in PARAGON-HF (Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ARB Global Outcomes in HFpEF) with available signs and symptoms at randomization. Response to sacubitril/valsartan on the basis of the presence of signs and symptoms was evaluated. Effects of sacubitril/valsartan on signs and symptoms over time were assessed using binary repeated-measures logistic regression.

Results

Patients with high (≥ 3) burden of HF signs and symptoms (n = 1,772 [38%]) were more commonly women, had slightly lower left ventricular ejection fractions, higher body mass index, and more advanced New York Heart Association functional class compared with patients with low (≤ 2) burden (n = 2,953 [62%]) (p < 0.001 for all). Levels of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide did not differ significantly between groups (p = 0.14). Greater burden of signs and symptoms was associated with higher risk for total HF hospitalizations and CV death (rate ratio [RR]: 1.50; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.30 to 1.74) and all-cause death (RR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.21 to 1.65). Among individual signs and symptoms, orthopnea (RR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.61) and rales (RR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.10 to 2.10) were most predictive of the primary endpoint. Treatment response to sacubitril/valsartan was not significantly modified by burden of HF signs and symptoms (p for interaction = 0.08), though patients with orthopnea appeared to derive greater benefit from sacubitril/valsartan (RR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.49 to 0.90) than those without orthopnea (RR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.82 to 1.14; p for interaction = 0.04). Compared with valsartan, sacubitril/valsartan did not significantly decrease overall burden of HF signs and symptoms over time (odds ratio: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.67 to 1.07) but did reduce exertional dyspnea (odds ratio: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.63 to 0.93).

Conclusions

High burden of HF signs and symptoms, particularly the presence of orthopnea and rales, portends a higher risk for adverse CV events in patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction. Sacubitril/valsartan did not significantly decrease the burden of HF signs and symptoms over time but did reduce exertional dyspnea relative to valsartan.

### Voice assessment and vocal biomarkers in heart failure: a systematic review [^f2e99bb8]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite major advances in recent years, the timely detection and prevention of incipient congestion in patients with chronic heart failure remains challenging. Most approaches are either invasive or require the acquisition of additional hardware. Leveraging voice analysis for the purposes of diagnosing, predicting risks, and telemonitoring clinical outcomes of patients with heart failure represents a promising, cost-effective, and convenient alternative compared with hitherto deployed methods. To expand this field, close collaboration of several disciplines of medicine and computer science is an obligatory requirement. The current review aims to lay out the state-of-the-art in this quickly advancing area of research. It elucidates the foundation for voice feature extraction, describes the prospective capabilities of this evolving technology, and outlines the challenges involved in identifying vocal biomarkers both in general and in the context of heart failure.

### Pathophysiology and therapeutic approaches to acute decompensated heart failure [^e604dc5e]. Circulation Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Physical exam findings include pulmonary crackles in the presence of pulmonary edema and pleural effusions, peripheral edema, ascites, elevated jugular venous distension, abdominojugular or hepatojugular reflux, third heart sound, and worsening mitral or tricuspid regurgitation murmurs. Signs of end-organ dysfunction secondary to congestion include aforementioned pulmonary edema, gastrointestinal edema, hepatocellular damage, and cardiorenal syndrome. Additionally, in the presence of decreased cardiac output, reduced organ perfusion can contribute to end-organ damage. Increased ventricular pressures and neurohormonal compensatory mechanisms to augment chronotropy and inotropy can trigger tachycardia, arrhythmias, and increased myocardial strain and ischemia.

The pathophysiology of ADHF is pleiotropic and dependent on a number of factors including the degree of systolic and diastolic cardiac dysfunction, the relative involvement of the right and left ventricles, the arterial and venous vascular tone, the neurohormonal and inflammatory activation state, and comorbid contributing influences. Further complicating the standardization of ADHF management lies in the difference between the underlying substrate and pathophysiology of chronic HFrEF and HFpEF. The central defect in HFrEF can be readily conceptualized as reduced systolic function with resultant increases in left ventricular filling pressures and diastolic dysfunction producing increased pulmonary venous pressures and congestion, often resulting in right HF and peripheral signs of congestion, associated with decreased cardiac output resulting in end-organ hypoperfusion and dysfunction. However, the pathophysiology of HFpEF is more complicated and poorly understood, thought to be related, in part, to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis, impaired compliance and diastolic filling of the left ventricle, microvascular inflammation, altered adrenergic-adipokine signaling, and peripheral arterial stiffness and vasoconstriction affecting afterload. – There is a paucity of chronic therapeutic options for patient with HFpEF, which predominantly focus on the management of comorbidities. Additionally, the vast majority of landmark studies and current guideline-directed medical therapy have only been shown to have significant clinical benefit in the chronic HF patient population due to significant logistical limitations related to the acuity and oftentimes clinical severity of patients admitted with ADHF.

### Interstitial lung diseases in the hospitalized patient [^b0ded745]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

How are ILDs clinically differentiated in the hospitalized patient?

Patients with ILD can be hospitalized at the time the ILD is first recognized, or during the progression of an established ILD. When presenting for the first time, clinical, radiographic, and laboratory tests are required to differentiate the cause of the ILD. Historical clues include the patient having symptoms consistent with a connective tissue disease (such as joint pain, swelling, rash, Raynaud's phenomenon, or muscle weakness), use of a medication that causes ILD, or risk factors for organizing pneumonia (medications, cancer, radiation therapy, inhalational injury). Useful laboratory tests include serologies to rule out a connective tissue disease, for example, tests for antinuclear antibody (ANA) and subtypes, rheumatoid factor (RF), cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP), and synthetase antibodies. These tests should be considered even in patients without systemic symptoms of a CTD, since ILD can be the first manifestation of a CTD.

Chest imaging should be performed in all patients hospitalized with an ILD. Chest radiography is useful as an initial assessment of the amount of lung involvement, but is insensitive to new opacities, especially those overlying preexisting abnormalities. HRCT is more sensitive to detect radiographic abnormalities and does not require iodinated contrast. The pattern and distribution of abnormality on HRCT can aid in refining the differential diagnosis of the ILD and in some cases establish the diagnosis of a specific ILD. In patients without a prior history of ILD, HRCT features that suggest presence of a preexisting ILD are architectural distortion such as traction bronchiectasis or honeycombing. These findings can be used to differentiate AE of a chronic ILD from AIP or ARDS, which typically do not have traction bronchiectasis or honeycombing.

The most common cause for hospitalization of patients with previously diagnosed ILD is AE of preexisting ILD. Clinical manifestations include acute progressive dyspnea, cough, with or without fever, and bilateral inspiratory crackles. These exacerbations may be due to progression of the underlying ILD. However, it is important to consider secondary causes such as a superimposed lung infection, left-sided heart failure, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, or adverse effects of treatment. Pulmonary function tests typically cannot be performed on patients suffering an AE of ILD due to the severity of their illness. If performed, they typically demonstrate progressive reduction of forced vital capacity (FVC) and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO).

### A rare case of plasma cell leukemia presenting as dyspnea [^874eb4b6]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 74-year-old man presented to the ED with acute chronic exertional dyspnea of 5-day duration. As part of his previous evaluation, 5 months earlier, he had undergone cardiopulmonary stress testing, routine laboratory evaluation, and chest radiography that were unremarkable. Over the subsequent months, he had waxing and waning exercise capacity until his incident hospitalization; the exercise was limited to < 40 meters. He reported associated nonproductive cough, 15-pound unintentional weight loss over the past 5 months, night sweats, easy fatigability, and early satiety. A chest radiograph was performed that showed a left hilar, mass-like consolidation with loss of the left heart border that was associated left-sided pleural effusion and left lower lung zone consolidation. On physical examination, he was afebrile and normotensive with a sinus tachycardia of 125 beats per minute. He was noted to be tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute and saturation of 95% on room air. Examination of the chest showed diminished breath sounds over left lower lung fields with scattered end expiratory wheezing.

### Age-related pulmonary crackles (rales) in asymptomatic cardiovascular patients [^f3586a34]. Annals of Family Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

The presence of age-related pulmonary crackles (rales) might interfere with a physician's clinical management of patients with suspected heart failure. We examined the characteristics of pulmonary crackles among patients with stage A cardiovascular disease (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association heart failure staging criteria), stratiffed by decade, because little is known about these issues in such patients at high risk for congestive heart failure who have no structural heart disease or acute heart failure symptoms.

Methods

After exclusion of comorbid pulmonary and other critical diseases, 274 participants, in whom the heart was structurally (based on Doppler echocardiography) and functionally (B-type natriuretic peptide < 80 pg/mL) normal and the lung (X-ray evaluation) was normal, were eligible for the analysis.

Results

There was a significant difference in the prevalence of crackles among patients in the low (45–64 years; n = 97; 11%; 95% CI, 5%-18%), medium (65–79 years; n = 121; 34%; 95% CI, 27%-40%), and high (80–95 years; n = 56; 70%; 95% CI, 58%-82%) age-groups (P < .001). The risk for audible crackles increased approximately threefold every 10 years after 45 years of age. During a mean follow-up of 11 ± 2.3 months (n = 255), the short-term (≤ 3 months) reproducibility of crackles was 87%. The occurrence of cardiopulmonary disease during follow-up included cardiovascular disease in 5 patients and pulmonary disease in 6.

Conclusions

Recognition of age-related pulmonary crackles (rales) is important because such clinically unimportant crackles are so common among elderly patients that, without knowledge of this phenomenon, their existence might interfere with the physician's management of cardiopulmonary patients.

### Airway resistance in chronic heart failure measured by impulse oscillometry [^83442a21]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) complain of breathlessness and fatigue on exertion, have reduced peak oxygen consumption (pV(O(2))), and an increased ventilatory response to exercise (V(E)/V(CO(2)) slope). These limitations correlate with abnormalities of spirometry (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV(1)] and forced ventilatory capacity [FVC]). Increased airway resistance by increasing the work of breathing might contribute to exercise intolerance in CHF.

Methods

Impulse oscillometry (IOS) measures airway resistance and lung compliance independently of respiratory muscle strength and patient compliance. Sound waves of varying frequencies are sent into the lungs and the amplitude and phase shift of the reflected waves give a measure of airway resistance (R) and reactance (X). Twenty-three CHF patients and 18 controls underwent peak exercise testing with metabolic gas analysis and had airway resistance assessment using the Jaeger (Würtzberg, Germany) IOS system.

Results

Patients had a lower pV(O(2)) (18.7 (4.0) v 39.2 (8.3) mL x kg x min; P < .0001), elevated V(E)/V(CO(2)) slope (41.6 (8.1) v 27.4 (2.9)), and lower FEV(1) (2.4 (0.4) v 3.2 (0.7) L/min; P = 0.0001) and FVC (3.3 (0.7) v 4.1 (1.1) L; P < .005) than controls. R and X correlated with spirometric abnormalities and were different between patients and controls (R at 5 Hz 0.44 (0.16) v 0.30 (0.15) kPa (L/s); P < .005 and X at 5 Hz -0.16 (0.08) v -0.09 (0.08) kPa (L/s); P < .05). R at 5 Hz correlated with pV(O(2)) (0.46; P = 0.0025) and V(E)/V(CO(2)) slope (0.43; P < .05).

Conclusion

CHF patients have elevated airway resistance and reduced reactance measured with IOS compared with control subjects.

### Heart failure events in randomized controlled trials for adults receiving maintenance dialysis: a meta-epidemiologic study [^830e8ff0]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Heart failure is a clinical syndrome with symptoms and/or signs caused by a structural and/or functional cardiac abnormality corroborated by objective evidence of congestion and/or elevated ventricular filling pressures. Heart failure is a common comorbidity in patients with kidney failure receiving dialysis and is an important contributor to morbidity and mortality. While cardiovascular (CV) events are clearly recognized as important to patients with kidney disease, there is uncertainty as to whether CV events, including heart failure, are defined adequately in patients with kidney failure. Heart failure events are particularly problematic because they share many features of pure volume overload due to dietary sodium and fluid non-adherence or underdialysis that can make the entities frequently clinically indistinguishable in clinical and research settings.

In randomized controlled trials (RCTs), outcome events are ideally important to both patients and clinicians by virtue of their prognostic relevance (e.g. impact on survival, function, or quality of life). Outcome events should also be easily differentiated from other events that are dissimilar in their importance and pathophysiology. We make a distinction between a diagnostic definition, which provides the concept of a diagnosis (e.g. elevated cardiac filling pressures due to cardiac dysfunction), and diagnostic criteria, which provide explicit criteria that clinicians can use to establish a diagnosis (e.g. diagnostic criteria for heart failure requires dyspnoea and at least one of the of the following signs [i.e. elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), respiratory crackles, S3] and either radiographic findings [i.e. vascular redistribution, interstitial pulmonary oedema] with implementation of heart failure treatments such as diuretics or ultrafiltration and documented clinical improvement). When diagnostic criteria are poorly specified, they introduce 'noise', which quickly diminishes statistical power and makes the interpretation of treatment effects challenging. In heart failure populations without concomitant kidney failure, standardized consensus diagnostic criteria for heart failure events exist and these diagnostic criteria help ensure events are of similar meaning to stakeholders (i.e. patients, caregivers, healthcare providers, researchers, industry, regulators), are prognostically relevant, comparable across clinical studies, and ideally have shared pathophysiology to facilitate the identification of effective therapies.

### A structured diagnostic algorithm for patients with ARDS [^6dc7fa69]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of ARDS

The diagnosis of ARDS is largely based on hypoxic respiratory failure and the detection of pulmonary edema, from which hydrostatic cardiogenic pulmonary edema must be excluded. It is therefore essential that false positive results are excluded as much as possible by means of non-invasive imaging. Ultrasound of the lungs is superior to chest X-ray for detecting and ruling out pleural effusion. The chest X-ray can give the illusion that the lung is consolidated when there is a large effusion and this can result in a false positive diagnosis, but the treatment differs. Transthoracic ultrasound of the heart can facilitate the diagnosis of acute heart failure. In general, acute heart failure is sufficient explanation for pulmonary edema and treatment should be focused on decongestion. However, a complicating factor is that cardiomyopathy due to a hyperinflammatory state can be associated with ARDS (and thus non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema). Usually, these are patients with sepsis, with a high a priori risk of ARDS who should also be diagnosed with ARDS.

Practical steps

Determine that the patient meets the ARDS criteria according to the 'Berlin definition' and report the diagnosis of ARDS in the status (Table 1), both when the cause is evident and when the cause is unclear, as ARDS is a descriptive — and not causal — diagnosis. The presence of ARDS should trigger both a standardized set of evidence-based interventions (e.g. lung protective ventilation, restrictive fluid therapy) and, importantly, an investigation into the cause of the pulmonary injury.
Perform ultrasound of the lungs to rule out pulmonary effusion as the cause for the bilateral consolidations. Finding pleural abnormalities with lung ultrasound strongly suggests an inflammatory cause of the pulmonary edema.
Perform transthoracic cardiac ultrasound to exclude acute heart failure as a cause of pulmonary edema. Ultrasound evidence of cardiomyopathy does not exclude ARDS in an underlying condition with a high pre-probability of ARDS (such as sepsis) and in this case ARDS should be diagnosed despite the contribution of acute heart failure to the onset of pulmonary edema.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of the cause of HF — history, physical examination, and family assessment should guide workup. Evaluation "begins with a thorough history and careful physical examination", and clinicians "should inquire about a history of hypertension; diabetes mellitus; dyslipidemia; tobacco use; coronary, valvular, or peripheral vascular disease; rheumatic fever;… mediastinal irradiation; sleep-disordered breathing; and exposure to cardiotoxic agents", and also ask about "illicit drug use, current and past alcohol consumption", and exposures to sexually transmitted diseases. The history and physical should consider noncardiac diseases including collagen vascular disease, infection, obesity, thyroid excess/deficiency, amyloidosis, and pheochromocytoma. The physical examination "should document specific signs of right or left HF, with particular attention to the presence of elevated jugular venous pressure and a third heart sound". A detailed family history should identify relatives with cardiomyopathy, sudden unexplained death, conduction system disease, and skeletal myopathies; "as many as 30% of cases of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy may be familial". Genetic testing is not routine, but "an electrocardiogram and echocardiogram should be considered in first-degree relatives", and families with multiple cases "should be referred to a center with expertise in genetic analysis and counseling".

ACC/AHA heart failure data elements — chest radiography defines the data element as "Documented findings from the radiological examination of the chest", with permissible values including "Pulmonary vascular redistribution, pulmonary congestion, or pulmonary edema", "Cardiomegaly, chamber enlargement", "Pleural effusion(s)", and "No abnormalities related to HF". Pulmonary edema is defined as "Accumulation of fluid in the lung tissues causing disturbance of the gas exchange that may lead to respiratory failure. It is caused by direct injury to the lung parenchyma or congestive HF". Cardiomegaly/chamber enlargement is "Abnormal enlargement of the heart", and pleural effusion(s) are described as "Increased amounts of fluid within the pleural cavity. Symptoms include shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain. It is usually caused by lung infections, congestive HF; pleural and lung tumors, connective tissue disorders, and trauma".

### The coming era of a new auscultation system for analyzing respiratory sounds [^414715d9]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

In this review, we will check the limitations of the existing auscultation method by checking the types of abnormal breathing sounds and the accuracy of analysis through the existing stethoscope. Next, we will introduce the new auscultation methods developed so far (AI-assisted analysis and wireless or attached stethoscopes) and the current status of breath sound analysis using them. Furthermore, we will suggest further research directions in the future.

Classification of abnormal respiratory sounds

Respiratory sounds are produced by the airflow in the respiratory tract and are divided into two categories: Normal or abnormal sound. Normal respiratory sound is made when there is no pulmonary disorder and consist of tracheal, bronchial, bronchovesicular, and vesicular sounds. Abnormal respiratory sounds are caused by diseases at the lung or bronchus. They can be described by the mechanism of production, location they are detected in, characteristics (such as continuity, range of pitch, timing mostly heard), and acoustic features (Table 1).

Table 1
Classification of abnormal lung sounds and related diseases

Crackles are short, discontinuous, explosive sounds heard during inspiration and sometimes on expiration. Fine crackles are generated by inspiratory opening of small airways and associated with interstitial pneumonia or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and congestive heart failure (CHF). Coarse crackles are produced by gas passing through intermittent airway opening and are related to secretory diseases such as chronic bronchitis and pneumonia.

Wheezes are generated in the narrowed or obstructed airway. They have high frequency (> 100–5000 Hz) and sinusoidal oscillation in sound analysis. They usually occur in obstructive airway diseases like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Rhonchi are induced by the narrowing of airways, caused by the production of secretions, so rhonchi can disappear after coughing (Table 1).

Stridor is a high-pitched, continuous sound produced by turbulent airflow through a narrowed airway of upper respiratory tract. It is usually a sign of airway obstruction that requires prompt intervention. In patients with pleural inflammation such as pleurisy or pleural tumor, a visceral pleura becomes rough, and its friction with the parietal pleura generates crackling sounds, a friction rub (Table 1).

Although respiratory sounds are not difficult for a trained clinician to discern in usual cases, some sounds are ambiguous even for an expert to distinguish accurately. In addition, there are some cases where a mixture of several abnormal breathing sounds can be heard. Novel AI-assisted stethoscope can be useful for these challenging situations.

### Heart failure and hearing loss among older adults in the United States… [^193c9feb]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

© 2024 Hearing loss is common among older adults in the United States1 and is associated with coronary heart disease and its risk factors. 2 Yet, the prevalence of hearing loss among adults with heart failure has not been well described. The World Health Organization criteria were used to classify the severity of hearing loss based on the pure-tone average in the better ear. No hearing loss was 25 dB or less; mild, more than 25 but 40 dB or less; moderate, more than 40 but 60 dB or less; severe, more than 60 but 80 dB or less; and profound, more than 80 dB. Participants with HF were older, had more cardiovascular comorbidities, and had a higher burden of hearing loss compared with those without HF. Overall, the prevalence of hearing loss among participants with HF was 74. 4% and the prevalence of hearing loss among those without HF was
63. 3%. Extrapolating these estimates to the US population, 1.

7 million older adults with HF currently have hearing loss and by 2020,
2. 4 million will. The association between HF and hearing loss was also examined. Participants with HF had 1. 67 higher odds of mild or greater hearing loss compared with those without HF. Although the point estimate and upper bound of the confidence interval remained similar, this association was not significant in a fully adjusted model. In this model, being 80 years or older, having less education, and greater noise exposure were independently associated with mild or greater hearing loss.

### Why does chronic heart failure cause breathlessness and fatigue? [^8ab8325c]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Traditional explanations for the symptoms of fatigue and breathlessness experienced by patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) focus on how reduced cardiac output on exercise leads to impaired skeletal muscle blood supply, thus causing fatigue, and on how the requirement for a raised left ventricular filling pressure to maintain cardiac output results in reduced pulmonary diffusion owing to interstitial edema, thus causing breathlessness. However, indices of left ventricular function relate poorly to exercise capacity and symptoms, suggesting that the origin of symptoms may lie elsewhere. There is a specific heart failure myopathy that is present early in the condition which may contribute largely to the sensation of fatigue. Receptors present in skeletal muscle sensitive to work (ergoreceptors) are overactive in patients with CHF, presumably as a consequence of the myopathy, and their activity is related both to the ventilatory response to exercise and breathlessness, and to the sympathetic overactivity of CHF. In the present paper, we review the systemic consequences of left ventricular dysfunction to understand how they relate to the symptoms of heart failure.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1decc7be]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Chest radiograph — imaging signs of right-sided disease include a globular cardiac silhouette in cases of significant right ventricular (RV) enlargement, loss of the retrosternal airspace on a lateral projection indicating RV enlargement, and rightward displacement of the cardiac silhouette, well beyond the spine, which almost always represents right atrial (RA) enlargement. With coexisting pulmonary hypertension (PH), the main pulmonary artery (PA) will be enlarged and the distal PA branches may have a "pruned" appearance, and elevated central venous pressure (CVP) may be recognized by an enlarged azygous vein. Pulmonary vascular redistribution, increased interstitial markings, and Kerley lines are signs of pulmonary venous hypertension, and pleural effusions are frequent in severe right heart failure (RHF), particularly when pulmonary and systemic venous pressures are both elevated.

### Computed tomography scan contribution to the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia [^6dfa2c6e]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

CURRENT LIMITATIONS IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF PNEUMONIA

An ideal reference diagnosis for pneumonia should be based upon the detection of pathogenic agents in lung parenchyma, along with suggestive clinical findings. However, this cannot be carried out in routine clinical practice for evident practical reasons. Hence, pneumonia is usually suspected in the presence of respiratory and infectious signs and symptoms, and confirmed by the demonstration of a new lung infiltrate on a radiologic examination. Unfortunately, signs and symptoms are neither sensitive nor specific, leading to a poor predictive value of clinical data for the diagnosis of chest X-ray (CXR) or computed tomography (CT)-proven pneumonia.

The clinical diagnosis of pneumonia is even more difficult in elderly patients, because symptoms are less specific, and decompensated comorbidities (e.g. heart failure and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) can further blur the clinical picture. The prevalence of most symptoms, including fever and shivers, is reduced with increasing age. Elderly patients tend to report symptoms less accurately because of memory disorders or delirium. Finally, the incidence of alternative diagnoses to pneumonia (e.g. pulmonary embolism, lung cancer, nonrespiratory sepsis and so on), and the prevalence of chronic respiratory conditions (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and interstitial lung disease) is also increased in elderly patients (Figs. 1–4).

### Mechanism of inspiratory and expiratory crackles [^3e1ca400]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Although crackles are frequently heard on auscultation of the chest of patients with common cardiopulmonary disorders, the mechanism of production of these sounds is inadequately understood. The goal of this research was to gain insights into the mechanism of crackle generation by systematic examination of the relationship between inspiratory and expiratory crackle characteristics.

Methods

Patients with a significant number of both inspiratory and expiratory crackles were examined using a multichannel lung sound analyzer. These patients included 37 with pneumonia, 5 with heart failure, and 13 with interstitial fibrosis. Multiple crackle characteristics were calculated for each crackle, including frequency, amplitude, crackle transmission coefficient, and crackle polarity.

Results

Spectral, temporal, and spatial characteristics of expiratory and inspiratory crackles in these patients were found to be similar, but two characteristics were strikingly different: crackle numbers and crackle polarities. Inspiratory crackles were almost twice as numerous as expiratory crackles (n = 3,308 vs 1,841) and had predominately negative polarity (76% of inspiratory crackles vs 31% of expiratory crackles).

Conclusion

These observations are quantitatively consistent with the so-called stress-relaxation quadrupole hypothesis of crackle generation. This hypothesis holds that expiratory crackles are caused by sudden airway closure events that are similar in mechanism but opposite in sign and far less energetic than the explosive opening events that generate inspiratory crackles. We conclude that the most likely mechanism of crackle generation is sudden airway closing during expiration and sudden airway reopening during inspiration.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: diagnosis and management [^61357186]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, also referred to as diastolic heart failure, causes almost one-half of the 5 million cases of heart failure in the United States. It is more common among older patients and women, and results from abnormalities of active ventricular relaxation and passive ventricular compliance, leading to a decline in stroke volume and cardiac output. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction should be suspected in patients with typical symptoms (e.g., fatigue, weakness, dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, edema) and signs (S3 heart sound, displaced apical pulse, and jugular venous distension) of chronic heart failure. Echocardiographic findings of normal ejection fraction with impaired diastolic function confirm the diagnosis. Measurement of natriuretic peptides is useful in the evaluation of patients with suspected heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in the ambulatory setting. Multiple trials have not found medications to be an effective treatment, except for diuretics. Patients with congestive symptoms should be treated with a diuretic. If hypertension is present, it should be treated according to evidence-based guidelines. Exercise and treatment by multidisciplinary teams may be helpful. Atrial fibrillation should be treated using a rate-control strategy and appropriate anticoagulation. Revascularization should be considered for patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and coronary artery disease. The prognosis is comparable to that of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and is worsened by higher levels of brain natriuretic peptide, older age, a history of myocardial infarction, and reduced diastolic function.

Future Developments

Investigate to use LUS as first line diagnostic tool for monitoring of disease/conditions such as pleural effusion, chronic heart failure, and community acquired pneumonia.

The primary care physician/general practitioner (GP) in his/her office has limited diagnostic possibilities and often finds himself/herself in a situation where the medical history and physical examination need to be supplemented with additional examinations, including imaging examinations. Point‐of‐care US in the GP office is enjoying increasing popularity. The use of LUS at the stage of outpatient diagnostics is beneficial for not only the patient and physician, indeed given its cost‐effectiveness it should also be viewed in light of its potential for health care system costs reduction. Numerous examples of the use of US in the diagnostics of adults and children in outpatient treatment and even during home visits have been described. The use of US in the GP office reduces the time to make an accurate diagnosis, helps in making therapeutic decisions and may improve the patient's prognosis. Moreover, LUS used as point‐of‐care examination method may reduce disproportions in the quality of medical services depending on the place of residence and reduce the costs of patient care. In everyday practice, LUS can provide support for a quick differentiation of the causes of such common symptoms as dyspnea or cough. The main pathologies that can be quickly assessed with LUS are pleural fluid, cardiogenic or non‐cardiogenic pulmonary edema, subpleural consolidation in the course of pneumonia, and pneumothorax. Compared with the classic physical examination, LUS is characterized by greater accuracy in the assessment of changes in the course of lower respiratory tract infection and the presence of fluid in the pleural cavities. Moreover, compared with classic imaging examinations of the respiratory system (X‐ray and CT of the chest), LUS is characterized by high or comparable sensitivity and specificity in detecting pulmonary parenchyma pathology in various clinical situations. LUS is also used as a reference method in the diagnosis of the presence of free fluid in the pleural cavities.

Description of the condition

Heart failure is a condition in which the heart does not pump enough blood to meet all the needs of the body. It is caused by dysfunction of the heart due to muscle damage (systolic or diastolic dysfunction), valvular dysfunction, arrhythmias or other rare causes (NICE 2014). Clinically, it is a syndrome in which patients have typical symptoms (e.g. breathlessness, ankle swelling, and fatigue) and signs (e.g. elevated jugular venous pressure, pulmonary crackles, and displaced apex beat). The diagnosis can be difficult as many of the symptoms of heart failure are non‐discriminating so the demonstration of an underlying cardiac cause is central to the diagnosis. Identification of the underlying cardiac problem is also crucial for therapeutic reasons, as the precise pathology determines the specific treatment used (e.g. valve surgery for valvular disease, specific pharmacological therapy for left ventricular systolic dysfunction, etc.) (McMurray 2012).

Heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) is caused by impaired left ventricular contraction, and is usually characterised by a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) is usually associated with impaired left ventricular relaxation, rather than left ventricular contraction, and is characterised by a normal or preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (NICE 2010).

Approximately 1% to 2% of the adult population in developed countries has heart failure, with the prevalence rising to ≥ 10% among persons 70 years of age or older (McMurray 2012). The prevalence is expected to rise in future as a result of an ageing population, improved survival of people with ischaemic heart disease and more effective treatments for heart failure (Owan 2006).

Heart failure has a poor prognosis: 30% to 40% of patients diagnosed with heart failure die within a year – but thereafter the mortality is less than 10% per year. There is evidence of a trend of improved prognosis in the past 10 years. The six‐month mortality rate decreased from 26% in 1995 to 14% in 2005. Within the NHS, heart failure accounts for a total of 1 million inpatient bed‑days – 2% of all NHS inpatient bed‐days – and 5% of all emergency medical admissions to hospital. Hospital admissions because of heart failure are projected to rise by 50% over the next 25 years, largely as a result of the ageing population. This is despite a progressive decline of the age‐adjusted hospitalisation rate at 1% to 1.5% per annum since 1992/1993 (NICE 2010).

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^d5d3dfde]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Multidetector computed tomography (CT) — similar to cardiac MRI and 3-dimensional echocardiography, multidetector computed tomography provides volumetric information about RV size and function. The high spatial resolution of contrast-enhanced computed tomography, combined with its rapid scan sequence, makes it an appealing modality for RV assessment, but limitations include the need to bolus potentially nephrotoxic iodinated contrast material and the need for ionizing radiation, which is a problem for radiosensitive patient populations, including children, and for serial surveillance studies. Although the patient must be able to lie flat and perform a breath hold, the scan process occurs over a shorter period compared with cardiac MRI, and implanted devices do not prevent the use of computed tomography, with claustrophobia rarely an issue given the short bore length.

### Transthoracic echocardiography with Doppler tissue imaging predicts weaning failure from mechanical ventilation: evolution of the left ventricle relaxation rate during a spontaneous breathing trial is the key factor in weaning outcome [^72fbbde1]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Spontaneous breathing trial

The SBT lasted one hour and consisted of a low pressure support trial at 7 cm H2O without PEEP. Patients were considered to have failed the SBT if they developed any of the following signs during the one-hour SBT: respiratory frequency > 35 breaths per minute, arterial oxygen saturation < 90%, heart rate > 140 beats per minute or sustained increase or decrease in blood pressure with systolic arterial pressure > 200 or < 80 mmHg, diaphoresis and signs of distress. The time of occurrence of these signs after starting the SBT was noted. Patients who succeeded the SBT were extubated. The attending physician in charge of the patient had no access to the TTE findings. Failure of the weaning process was defined as a failed SBT or the need for reintubation within 48 hours following extubation. Diagnosis of weaning failure was carried out by two intensivists blinded to the TTE report. Based on clinical and radiological findings they confirmed or excluded the diagnosis of cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The following signs or information were used and were assumed to be suggestive of weaning induced pulmonary edema: previous history of heart disease, exclusion of other causes of respiratory failure, early onset of respiratory distress after suppression of PEP, the presence of frothy secretions and bilateral crackles and onset of newer bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray.

Bedside monitoring

During assisted mechanical ventilation, the level of pressure support (AI), PEEP, the patient's respiratory rate (RR), tidal volume (VT) and the RR/VT ratio were recorded just before initiation of the SBT. Arterial blood gas analysis was performed just before and at the end of the SBT. The heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, pulsed oximetry and consciousness were monitored throughout the SBT.

Universal definition of heart failure (HF) and HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — diagnosis requires "symptoms and/or signs of HF caused by a structural and/or functional abnormality" corroborated by at least one of: "elevated natriuretic peptides" or "objective evidence of cardiogenic pulmonary or systemic congestion". HFpEF-specific considerations include "EF 50% or greater", "Lower levels of natriuretic peptides relative to HFrEF for a given elevation in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure", and that "Higher BMI (prevalent in HFpEF) is inversely associated with natriuretic peptide levels". When using natriuretic peptides, ambulatory thresholds are "BNP ≥ 35 pg/mL or NT-proBNP ≥ 125 pg/mL", and hospitalized thresholds are "BNP ≥ 100 pg/mL or NT-proBNP ≥ 300 pg/mL". As a complementary reference, the Framingham HF Diagnostic Criteria state that "Two or more major criteria or 1 major criterion plus 2 minor criteria are strictly required to make the diagnosis", with major criteria including "orthopnea, jugular venous distension, hepatojugular reflux, rales, S₃ gallop rhythm, acute pulmonary edema, and cardiomegaly", and minor criteria including "dyspnea on exertion, nocturnal cough, ankle edema, tachycardia with heart rate over 120 beats per minute, hepatomegaly, and pleural effusion".

### Flash pulmonary edema [^d83e5a4f]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Flash pulmonary edema (FPE) is a general clinical term used to describe a particularly dramatic form of acute decompensated heart failure. Well-established risk factors for heart failure such as hypertension, coronary ischemia, valvular heart disease, and diastolic dysfunction are associated with acute decompensated heart failure as well as with FPE. However, endothelial dysfunction possibly secondary to an excessive activity of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, impaired nitric oxide synthesis, increased endothelin levels, and/or excessive circulating catecholamines may cause excessive pulmonary capillary permeability and facilitate FPE formation. Renal artery stenosis particularly when bilateral has been identified has a common cause of FPE. Lack of diurnal variation in blood pressure and a widened pulse pressure have been identified as risk factors for FPE. This review is an attempt to delineate clinical and pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for FPE and to distinguish pathophysiologic, clinical, and therapeutic aspects of FPE from those of acute decompensated heart failure.

### Chronic heart failure in the community: missed diagnosis and missed opportunities [^93541518]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of congestive heart failure (CHF) in patients discharged from a hospital without a diagnosis of CHF who were admitted with shortness of breath and had a low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). CHF is a devastating disease in terms of financial cost, prevalence, and effect on morbidity and mortality. The true incidence rate is not known because of reliance on discharge records and death certificates, and because diagnosis remains a clinical judgment.

Methods and Results

CHF was diagnosed by the Framingham criteria. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 225 randomly selected patients admitted with a complaint of shortness of breath and discharged without a diagnosis of CHF (group 1). We compared group 1 with patients admitted at the same time with a diagnosis of CHF and of similar age and LVEF (group 2). In group 1, 100 patients had a low LVEF (≤ 40%) and 51% met criteria for CHF that had been missed. Readmission rate was high (42%). Mortality at 12 months was 18%. Rate of cardiomegaly on x-ray films was similar in groups 1 and 2 (64.6% v 64.4%, respectively). Third heart sound (39% v 10%; P < .001) and heart rate > 120 beats/min (41.7% v 12.5%; P < .001) were significantly more frequent in group 1. By contrast, signs and symptoms suggestive of fluid overload were more frequent in group 2.

Conclusions

Many patients admitted with shortness of breath and low LVEF have CHF but are not diagnosed. Physicians are more likely to miss CHF in patients presenting without signs of fluid overload even when third heart sound is present with resting tachycardia. A missed diagnosis of CHF is associated with a high readmission rate, multiple admissions, and a mortality rate comparable to that of patients with newly diagnosed CHF.

### A picture is worth 2, 000 words [^295f6f04]. JACC: CardioOncology (2023). Medium credibility.

The patient returned to the hospital 5 days later with worsening complaints of dyspnea, episodic oxygen desaturation, and a history of a syncopal event 2 days earlier. The patient also described coughing with intermittent hemoptysis. His vital signs were notable for temperature of 97.9 °F (36.6 °C), blood pressure of 87/55 mm Hg, pulse of 65 beats/min, respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T level was increased to 51 ng/L (normal 0–14 ng/L), and N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide was increased to 2,016 pg/mL (normal adjusted for age and sex < 900 pg/mL). A third follow-up chest CT scan demonstrated similar appearing pulmonary emboli with an evolving pulmonary infarct. The patient was evaluated by the cardiology team for lytic therapy or thrombectomy using the EkoSonic Endovascular System (Boston Scientific), but the decision was made to not perform these interventions because he was out of the therapeutic window.

The patient was admitted to the cardiology floor and was transitioned to intravenous heparin; yet, he continued to suffer from exertional dyspnea with accompanying oxygen desaturation. He was presumed to have a superimposed bacterial or fungal infection, and broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics were prescribed. An extensive work-up for microbial respiratory pathogens revealed no positive findings. On the 13th day of admission, the patient developed acute hypoxic respiratory failure with an oxygen saturation of 68% and required urgent intubation. The following day he developed pulseless electrical activity requiring resuscitation. Bedside transthoracic echocardiography showed severe biventricular dysfunction. After a discussion with the patient's family, the decision was made to pursue comfort measures only, and the patient was extubated and died peacefully with family at his bedside.

At autopsy, there was a large 6-cm nodule in the basal portion of the left upper lobe that was found to be a primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma on histology. There was extensive vascular invasion in both lungs, and some of the arteries were completely occluded by a combination of tumor and superimposed thrombus (Figures 2A and 2B), resulting in extensive bilateral parenchymal necrosis and infarction. Examination of the heart revealed severe right ventricular hypertrophy and dilation and acute and healing right ventricular infarction consistent with demand ischemia secondary to the increasing tumor/thrombus burden in the pulmonary circulation.

A 67-year-old man with a 45-pack-year smoking history presented with worsening dyspnea. His resting oxygen saturation was 94%, declining to 86% after walking for 60 meters. A pulmonary examination revealed inspiratory crackles at the bases and diminished breath sounds at the apices. A cardiovascular examination showed normal results, without peripheral edema. A chest x-ray showed hyperinflation and increased interstitial markings. Pulmonary function tests were obtained. Heckman EJ, O'Connor GT. Pulmonary Function Tests for Diagnosing Lung Disease.

### An uncommon cause of bilateral pulmonary nodules in a long-term smoker [^14544f01]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Dyspnea caused by pulmonary disease is a common symptom encountered by internists. The most likely diagnosis of pulmonary nodules in a long-term smoker is lung cancer. PATIENT/PARTICIPANT: We report a case of an elderly male with a 70-pack-year smoking history, presenting with exertional dyspnea for 6 months.

Interventions

Detailed review of history was negative. Examination was normal except for diminished breath sounds in all lung fields. Chest x-ray showed bilateral nodular opacities. Computed tomography of thorax revealed multiple bilateral lung masses. A whole-body positron emission tomography revealed enhancement only of the pulmonary masses. Bronchoalveolar lavage was negative for acid fast bacilli, nocardia, and fungi.

Main Results

Lung biopsy showed findings consistent with amyloidosis. Bone marrow biopsy done to investigate primary amyloidosis showed no clonal plasma cells or amyloid staining, thus suggesting a diagnosis of localized pulmonary amyloidosis. Patient is being managed conservatively with close follow-up for signs of progression.

### Universal definition and classification of heart failure: a report of the Heart Failure Society of America, heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Japanese heart failure society and writing committee of the universal definition of heart failure [^1e38c1f7]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2021). High credibility.

Universal definition of heart failure — Heart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome with current or prior symptoms and/or signs caused by a structural and/or functional cardiac abnormality, as determined by an EF of ≤ 50%, abnormal cardiac chamber enlargement, E/E′ of > 15, moderate/severe ventricular hypertrophy or moderate/severe valvular obstructive or regurgitant lesion, and corroborated by at least one of the following: elevated natriuretic peptide levels or objective evidence of cardiogenic pulmonary or systemic congestion by diagnostic modalities (eg, chest radiograph or elevated filling pressures by echocardiograph) or by hemodynamic measurement (eg, right heart catheterization, pulmonary artery catheter) at rest or with provocation (eg, exercise).
