## Question

What is the treatment for an insect bite that burns

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment for an insect bite that burns. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate first aid and pain control. Then, I should verify topical options that specifically target burning and pruritus. Next, I will consider when to escalate to oral therapies. After that, I need to check for red flags that warrant urgent care or antibiotics. Finally, I will review prevention and special scenarios, and I will double-check any claims that seem uncertain before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the basics: most insect bites are local, self-limited, and primarily need symptomatic care, so I should anchor on immediate measures like cleansing, cold, and simple analgesia before moving to pharmacologics [^411092af] [^650abcd0].

> Wait, let me verify the role of cold therapy. The 2024 AHA/ARC first aid guideline supports topical ice or cold packs for pain and swelling from insect bites, and mechanistically, cooling activates TRPM8 to relieve itch and burning sensations, which aligns with translational data on menthol and cold as antipruritics, so a cold compress or ice in a barrier for 10–15 minutes at a time is reasonable [^411092af] [^7eecd1bb].

> I need to check analgesic choices next. Over-the-counter acetaminophen or ibuprofen are recommended for pain relief after bites, and I should confirm that this applies broadly beyond just scorpion stings; yes, the AHA/ARC guidance frames OTC analgesics as appropriate for local pain from bites and stings, so either agent is fine unless contraindicated [^411092af] [^0663cfa3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about topical steroids. I initially thought "low-potency hydrocortisone 1% is first-line for burning", but wait, I should verify the evidence base. The AHA/ARC notes data support oral antihistamines and topical corticosteroids for mosquito-bite itch, yet evidence for stings is limited, so for burning I should prioritize topical anesthetics and cooling first, and consider a low-potency hydrocortisone if inflammation and itch persist, recognizing the evidence gap and the risk of transient burning with some steroid creams [^411092af] [^e7117736] [^3713ce19].

> Let me consider topical anesthetics carefully. Lidocaine-containing OTC products are indicated for temporary relief of pain and itching from minor burns, abrasions, and insect bites, and scorpion sting guidance also supports topical lidocaine when the skin is intact, so a 3–5% lidocaine cream or ointment can be applied to intact skin to blunt burning and pain; I should confirm the intact-skin caveat and avoid mucosa or broken skin unless a product is specifically labeled for that use [^44fb5794] [^3925714b] [^0663cfa3].

> I should double-check antihistamines. Oral non-sedating antihistamines are reasonable for itch and may help indirectly with discomfort, though they do not directly treat pain or burning; still, given their safety and potential to reduce scratching, using cetirizine, loratadine, or fexofenadine is reasonable if itch is prominent, especially at night [^411092af] [^c232f666].

> But wait, what if the "burning" reflects a large local reaction rather than a simple bite. Large local reactions are IgE-mediated, peak at 48–72 hours, and are managed symptomatically with cold, antihistamines, and analgesics; a short course of oral corticosteroids can be considered for severe swelling or functional impairment, though definitive proof of steroid benefit is limited, so I should reserve steroids for significant morbidity and avoid antibiotics unless there is infection [^dc0d7813] [^7404f8eb].

> I need to ensure I screen for infection and systemic features. If there is expanding erythema, warmth, purulence, fever, chills, or systemic upset, I should consider secondary bacterial infection and follow cellulitis pathways; swabbing purulent discharge and marking the border can help track progression, and empiric oral antibiotics such as flucloxacillin are appropriate when infection is likely, whereas routine antibiotics for uninfected bites are discouraged [^c1aad354] [^e89da286].

> Hold on, I should verify special scenarios. If there is a history of systemic allergic reactions to stings, the patient should carry epinephrine and be referred for venom immunotherapy; conversely, patients with only large local reactions generally do not require immunotherapy, though it may be considered if reactions are frequent and unavoidable, so I must tailor counseling to risk and exposure [^2fa264ef] [^64a7934d].

> Let me reconsider prevention, since avoiding future bites reduces recurrence. DEET 20–50% or picaridin 20% on exposed skin, permethrin-treated clothing, and protective clothing in high-risk settings are evidence-based strategies; for facial bites during sleep, nightly 1% ivermectin cream has case-level evidence for prevention, though I should acknowledge the limited data and individualize use [^650abcd0] [^b84a3e87].

> I should confirm that I have not overlooked any burning-specific topical. While menthol and cooling can transiently relieve itch, they may irritate some skin; if burning predominates, lidocaine or even a short, carefully timed application of a concentrated heat device (e.g. Bite Away) may help some patients, but I need to warn that such devices evoke a brief burning sensation and evidence quality varies, so patient selection and counseling are essential [^e4a55887].

> Putting this together, my hierarchy is: cleanse the bite, apply cold for 10–15 minutes with a barrier, use acetaminophen or ibuprofen for pain, apply topical lidocaine for burning if the skin is intact, consider a low-potency hydrocortisone if inflammation and itch persist, add a non-sedating oral antihistamine if itch is bothersome, escalate to oral corticosteroids only for severe large local reactions, and treat infection if present; throughout, I will monitor for systemic allergic features and counsel on prevention for future exposures [^411092af] [^44fb5794] [^dc0d7813] [^c1aad354] [^650abcd0].

For an insect bite that burns, start with **cool compresses** for 10–15 minutes to reduce pain and inflammation [^411092af], and clean the area with mild soap and water. Apply a **topical anesthetic** (e.g. lidocaine 2–5%) [^44fb5794] or a topical corticosteroid (e.g. hydrocortisone 1%) [^411092af] to relieve burning and itch; if pain persists, take acetaminophen or ibuprofen [^411092af]. Avoid scratching to prevent infection, and seek medical care if there is spreading redness, pus, fever, or systemic symptoms [^0663cfa3].

---

## Immediate first aid measures

- **Cool compresses**: Apply a cold compress or ice pack wrapped in a cloth for 10–15 minutes at a time, repeating every few hours as needed. This helps reduce pain, swelling, and inflammation [^411092af].

- **Cleaning the bite**: Gently wash the affected area with mild soap and water to remove any contaminants and reduce the risk of infection [^notfound].

- **Elevation**: If the bite is on a limb, elevate it to minimize swelling and discomfort.

---

## Topical treatments for burning sensation

Several **topical treatments** can provide relief from the burning sensation associated with insect bites:

| **Treatment** | **Mechanism of action** | **Application** |
|-|-|-|
| Topical anesthetics (e.g. lidocaine 2–5%) | Temporarily numbs the skin, providing relief from burning and pain [^44fb5794] | Apply a thin layer to the affected area up to three times daily |
| Topical corticosteroids (e.g. hydrocortisone 1%) | Reduces inflammation, itching, and burning sensation [^notfound] | Apply a thin layer to the affected area once or twice daily for up to a week |
| Calamine lotion | Provides a cooling effect and relieves itching and burning | Apply as needed throughout the day |
| Aloe vera gel | Soothes the skin and reduces inflammation | Apply a thin layer to the affected area as needed |

---

## Oral medications

Oral medications may be necessary for more severe reactions or when topical treatments are insufficient:

- **Antihistamines**: Oral antihistamines (e.g. diphenhydramine, cetirizine) can help reduce itching, burning, and allergic reactions [^c232f666].

- **Analgesics**: Acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen can help manage pain and inflammation [^411092af].

---

## Home remedies

Several **home remedies** may provide relief from burning insect bites:

- **Baking soda paste**: Mix baking soda with water to form a paste and apply to the bite. This can help neutralize acids and reduce itching and burning.

- **Honey**: Applying a small amount of honey to the bite may help reduce inflammation and provide soothing relief.

- **Tea tree oil**: Diluted tea tree oil has antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties that may help reduce burning and prevent infection [^5a67c371].

---

## When to seek medical attention

Medical attention should be sought if any of the following occur:

- **Signs of infection**: Increased redness, warmth, swelling, pus, or red streaks spreading from the bite site.

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or difficulty breathing.

- **Severe allergic reaction**: Difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, dizziness, or loss of consciousness.

- **Persistent symptoms**: Burning sensation or other symptoms persist beyond a week without improvement.

---

## Preventive measures

Preventing insect bites is the best way to avoid the associated burning sensation and other symptoms. Recommended preventive measures include:

- **Insect repellents**: Use repellents containing DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus when outdoors [^650abcd0].

- **Protective clothing**: Wear long sleeves, pants, and closed shoes when in areas with high insect activity.

- **Avoidance**: Avoid areas with high insect activity, especially during dawn and dusk when insects are most active.

### Evaluation and management of the dysesthetic patient [^8d5d0664]. Clinics in Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Dysesthesia is symptomatology that includes but is not limited to sensations of pain, burning, crawling, biting, numbness, piercing, pulling, cold, shock-like, pulling, wetness, and heat. These sensations can cause significant emotional distress and functional impairment in affected individuals. Although some cases of dysesthesia are secondary to organic etiologies, most cases exist without an identifiable infectious, inflammatory, autoimmune, metabolic, or neoplastic process. Ongoing vigilance is required for concurrent or evolving processes, including paraneoplastic presentations. Elusive etiologies, unclear treatment regimens, and stigma leave patients and clinicians with a difficult path forward marked by "doctor shopping", lack of treatment, and significant psychosocial distress. We address this symptomatology and the psychosocial burden that often comes with it. Although notoriously labeled as "difficult to treat", dysesthesia patients can be effectively managed, making life-changing relief possible for patients.

Cooling is an effective temporary remedy for itch, bringing welcome relief to itchy insect bites, nettle stings, poison ivy, atopic dermatitis, and psoriasis. Menthol, causing a cooling sensation, has similar itch-relieving effects. Palkar et al. demonstrate that TRPM8, a menthol- and cold-activated ion channel, is essential for cooling to relieve itch, suggesting that pharmacologic TRPM8 activation should be explored further as an antipruritic strategy.

### Trial of a trivial quantitative heat-pain stimulus for detecting severe loss of nociception [^038d0a02]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2024). Medium credibility.

Preparations

The whole investigation took about five minutes to complete. Each study person was placed in supine position and bare-footed in a separate quiet room with the ambient temperature around 18°C. After accommodation, the person was familiarized by the examiner with the test procedure, the pain stimulators, and the numerical pain rating scale. The pinprick pain was compared with a toothpick pricking pain and the heat stimulus with the drinking temperature of a cup of coffee. The bite away device for treating insect bites or stings by concentrated heat had been used by, or was already known to, some of the study participants.

Explanation and ascertainment of stimulus responses

The sensations of interest "painful sting-like or burning discomfort" were explained in plain language. Every stimulation was accompanied by the examiner's questions: "Does it hurt? And if so, how much?" Then, the pain intensity should be rated immediately on a numerical scale ranging from 0 to 10 (no pain at all, worst imaginable pain); this procedure was slightly different from that used in the earlier study.

Pain rating

From a screen in front of them showing a 0 to 10 numerical scale with corresponding painless/painful facial expressions, participants were asked to choose a pain intensity from 0 to 10 and to tell it to the examiner for recording.

### Management of simple insect bites: where's the evidence? [^e7117736]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2012). Low credibility.

Many insects bite in order to obtain a blood meal and, in the process, inject the victim with saliva that may contain a number of substances, some of which can be immunogenic. The consequences of insect bites include local reactions, immune (allergic) reactions including anaphylaxis, and secondary bacterial infections (e.g. impetigo, cellulitis). Although insect bites are perceived to be common in the UK, the exact incidence is difficult to estimate since most are likely to go unreported: only those causing the more serious reactions are seen in primary care settings. Simple insect bites are those that are not accompanied or followed by anaphylactic shock or systemic infection. Many preparations for the treatment of insect bites, including antihistamines and topical corticosteroids, are available for purchase over the counter (OTC) in the UK. However, there is a lack of evidence for the efficacy of these treatments and, in general, recommendations for treatment are based on expert opinion and clinical experience. This article reviews the evidence for the management of simple bites by insects commonly encountered in the UK, but excludes ticks, mites and lice.

Annotations to the algorithm — Box 1: Specific detailed history and physical examination emphasizes careful history and insect identification. Most people of all ages who are stung have only local reactions and require only symptomatic, if any, treatment, and clinicians should obtain a careful history and encourage patients to bring the offending insect for identification, noting whether the patient was stung once or multiple times. Identification clues include the presence of a stinger commonly left by honeybees or a sterile pustule from an imported fire ant sting lasting up to 24 hours or longer.

### Common questions about wound care… [^e89da286]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Empiric antibiotic treatment should be based on the potentially causative organism. Superficial mild infections can be treated with topical agents, whereas mild and moderate infections involving deeper tissues should be treated with oral antibiotics. Most severe infections, and moderate infections in high-risk patients, require initial parenteral antibiotics. 30, 31 Cultures should be obtained for wounds that do not respond to empiric therapy, and in immunocompromised patients.
30. Moderate wound infections in immunocompromised patients and severe wound infections usually require parenteral antibiotics, with possible transition to oral agents. 30, 31 The choice of agent should be based on the potentially causative organism, history, and local antibiotic resistance patterns. For severe infections with potential methicillin-resistant S. aureus involvement, treatment should start with linezolid, daptomycin, or vancomycin.
30.

Human bite wounds may include streptococci, S. aureus, and Eikenella corrodens, in addition to many anaerobes. 30 For mild to moderate infections, a five- to 10-day course of oral amoxicillin/clavulanate is preferred. Doxycycline, tri-methoprim/sulfamethoxazole, or a fluoroquinolone plus clindamycin should be used in patients who are allergic to penicillin. 30 For severe infections, parenteral ampicillin/sulbactam, cefoxitin, or ertapenem should be used. Because E. corrodens is resistant to most oral antibiotics, clenched-fist bite wounds should be treated with parenteral ampicillin/sulbactam.
30. Burns. Secondary infections from burns may progress rapidly because of loss of epithelial protection. These infections require broad-spectrum antibiotics that are active against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including S. aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Klebsiella.

Widespread fungal infection is a rare but serious complication of broad-spectrum antibiotic use in burns. In these cases, systemic antifungals with coverage of Candida, Aspergillus, and Zygomycetes* should be considered. 28, 29, 37.

### Are insect bites responsible for the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing in United Kingdom general practices? [^fff23d32]. Family Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Our data suggests there could be scope to change and improve the management of insect bites, with greater use of non-antibiotic management. To help detect early cellulitis swab of purulent discharge and drawing round the erythema to monitor spread may be helpful. Exploration of antihistamine, topical steroid, and topical antiseptics in insect bite management may reduce antibiotic use. Our findings highlight the next steps needed in a QI approach to generate practice-based evidence on optimal management of insect bites, specifically work on alternatives to antibiotic prescribing.

The James Lind alliancehas worked with patients to identify research questions related to the management of cellulitis, including "What are the early signs and symptoms of cellulitis that can help to ensure speedy treatment?". For insect bites in general practice, we suggest "What early symptoms and signs in insect bite reactions do not require antibiotics?" and "What non-antibiotic treatments reduce inflammation and cellulitis?" as changes to design and implement as the next step in a QI model to develop practice-based evidence.

Stinging insect hypersensitivity — symptomatic care and antibiotics for large local reactions: Most patients with large local reactions need only symptomatic care and are not candidates for testing for venom-specific IgE or VIT, and swelling and erythema may be caused by mediator release rather than infection, so antibiotics are not indicated unless there is clear evidence of secondary infection.

### Dissecting the precise nature of itch-evoked scratching [^5de7e219]. Neuron (2021). Medium credibility.

The drive to scratch

Scratching behavior has a long and intimate history with itch sensation and perception. Through much of evolutionary time, scratching has been tied specifically and robustly to itch and is therefore uniquely suited to yield insight into its nature. Acute itch sensations arise in response to a variety of external stimuli, such as insects, parasites, allergens, and chemical irritants. For itch associated with parasite infiltration, scratching is induced as a tightly linked reflex-like response to remove harmful substances/organisms embedded in the skin. On the other hand, in the case of a mosquito bite, where itch-evoked scratching often occurs after the mosquito has left the skin, itch may serve a protective function to promote avoidance behaviors, and scratching may prime the immune system to diminish future infection by mosquito-transmitted diseases. This raises questions as to whether the intensity, frequency, and duration of the scratching response to itch are tuned to carry out these protective functions. For example, do parasites or other infiltrating agents trigger a different degree of itch intensity compared with other irritants, and does this determine the ferocity of the scratch response fine-tuned to remove them?

Itch-evoked scratching is also a symptom of chronic inflammatory skin conditions, such as AD and psoriasis, liver and kidney disease, and peripheral neuropathy. The consequences of scratching are likely distinct in these different settings, but no functional benefit has yet been uncovered. Rather than warning of the presence of an external, potentially dangerous agent as in acute itch, chronic itch disorders are thought to be caused by sensory neurons reacting to endogenous factors triggered by local disease states. This kind of itch is likely a maladaptive adaptation of a process that is protective under other circumstances and initiates a damaging itch-scratch cycle. In response to acute adaptive itch, scratching can occur on a range of seconds to days in response to the offending stimulus. However, without a recurring stimulus, the itch then subsides along with the urge to scratch. On the other hand, in chronic itch, the itch and scratching persist, often for a duration sufficient to cause damage to the skin (Figure 1). In animal models and humans, an itch-scratch cycle is initiated where cycles of skin damage and healing result in increased itch and further scratching. Breaking this cycle requires treatment of the itch, typically via topical steroids, antihistamines or other drugs that address the underlying causes of the itch.

Materials and Methods

Heat Stimulator

For delivering the 51°C heat-pain stimulus, a bite away® device (mibeTec G.m.b.H. 06796 Brehna, Germany;) was purchased in a local drug store. The bite away device has been marketed since 2006 for the local application of heat to treat insect bites and stings and is being sold all over the world. It is approved by the European Union as a medical device of class 2A (noninvasive device intended for administration to the body, which exchanges energy with the patient in a therapeutic manner). The device consists of a short plastic handle with a battery-driven electric heater inside and a circular 38.5-mm² ceramic heating plate at one end (see Figure 1a and 1b).

Figure 1.
The bite away® device. (a) Upper side, showing activating buttons. (b) Lower side, showing heating plate (diameter 7 mm) on one end of the handle.

According to the instructions for use, the plate is pressed firmly onto the acute insect bite spot, and automatic heating of the plate is activated by a button on the upper side of the handle. Within about five seconds, the working temperature of 51°C (manufacturer's specification) is reached, indicated by a light signal. (The working temperature was checked by infrared thermometry [QUIGG DSO 364, sensor diameter 3 mm; Shenzhen Dongdixin Technology Co. Ltd. Shenzhen, P. R. China].) According to a former supplier of bite away (Riemser AG, 17493 Greifswald, Germany) "its microchip-controlled time-heat-constant guarantees a maximum temperature of 51°C for either three or six seconds, recognized by the patients as a very short and targeted induction of almost painful high temperature on the skin". However, when bite away is applied to normal intact skin without insect bite, the heating evokes a short-lived, increasingly unpleasant and eventually truly painful burning or piercing sensation (distinguishable from flash-like, punctate pinprick pain), which subsides upon cessation of the heating (E.-A.C. own experience, unpublished). In fact, approximately 98% of healthy persons will perceive skin heating to 51°C as painfuland as suprathreshold stimulation (which induces much higher pain ratings than threshold-level stimulation).

Recommendation statement types and clinician implications — strong recommendation (StrRec) means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms and may use lesser evidence in specific circumstances; clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Recommendation (Rec) means benefits exceed harms with not-as-strong evidence and may use lesser evidence in specific circumstances; clinicians should generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. Option (Opt) means the quality of evidence is suspect or well-done studies show little clear advantage; clinicians should be flexible in their decision making regarding appropriate practice, although they may set bounds on alternatives, and patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. No recommendation (NoRec) means a lack of pertinent evidence and unclear benefit–harm balance; clinicians should feel little constraint in their decision making and be alert to new published evidence, and patient preference should have a substantial influencing role.

### Therapeutic potential of tea tree oil for scabies [^5a67c371]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2016). Low credibility.

Anti-inflammatory activity.

Terpinen-4-ol, at concentrations equivalent to 0.125%, can inhibit the production of several inflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1β, and prostaglandin E 2, as well as superoxide production, resulting in diminished inflammatory response.TTO has been shown to reduce hypersensitivity responses in the skin including responses to insect bites, bee stings, hives, and metal-induced hypersensitivity. This is chiefly attributed to the ability of TTO to modulate the vasodilation and plasma extravasation associated with histamine-induced inflammation.

Application of the topical scabicide benzyl benzoate is typically associated with a burning sensation, and in children it needs to be diluted to reduce the severe stinging sensation. Dilution compromises its potency and efficacy. The incorporation of TTO (5%) into a commercial product (Ascabiol ®, 25% benzyl benzoate) has been found to improve the tolerability of the product, chiefly attributed to the anti-inflammatory activity of TTO components.

Antipruritic activity.

TTO has also demonstrated benefit in reducing pruritus in human and animal studies.–However, large scale RCTs to further explore the antipruritic efficacy of TTO-containing formulations have not been performed. Sufficient anecdotal evidence exists to warrant comparing TTO formulations against active comparators for the therapeutic management of pruritic skin conditions.

### Stinging insect hypersensitivity: a practice parameter update 2016 [^64a7934d]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Stinging insect hypersensitivity — management of large local reactions: A large local reaction is described as extreme swelling extending from the sting site, usually peaking at 48 to 72 hours after a sting and lasting 1 week or more, and the risk of a systemic reaction in such patients is 4% to 10%. Because of this relatively low risk, diagnostic testing and VIT are generally not required; Summary Statement 16: Counsel patients who have experienced only large local reactions to stings that VIT is generally not required but might be considered in those who have frequent unavoidable exposure. Providing injectable epinephrine for these patients is usually not necessary but might be considered if it provides reassurance, and most patients will experience similar large local reactions after subsequent stings, with those who have frequent and/or severe reactions potentially benefiting from VIT.

5.3 Treatment approaches acting on peripheral sensory nerves

Antihistamines are well‐established antipruritic agents that inhibit H1R, which is expressed by itch‐transmitting peripheral sensory nerve fibers and thus attenuates histaminergic itch. Histaminergic itch is a significant contributor to itch observed in urticaria and insect bites/stings. These forms of itch can be effectively treated with antihistamines. However, the other majority of itching cases outside of these dermatoses may result from nonhistaminergic itch mechanisms, and, thus, antihistamines may not be the optimal treatment option.

Analgesics and anesthetics inhibit the activation of ion channels (particularly Na v channels) and the generation of action potentials (Figure 4). Topical creams containing lidocaine are available as over‐the‐counter antipruritics in Japan and other countries. Topical ketamine (10% or 5%)–amitriptyline (5%)–lidocaine (5%) (TKAL) has been demonstrated to alleviate both inflammatory itch (itch in atopic dermatitis and prurigo nodularis) and neuropathic itch (brachioradial pruritus and other forms of neuropathic itch).

The use of coolants (cooling agents) result in partial and transient alleviation of the itching sensation. They activate cold‐sensing TRPM8‐expressing nociceptors, which, in turn, stimulate Bhlhb‐5‐expressing itch‐inhibitory interneurons in the spinal cord (Figure 3). Topical formulations containing TRPM8 agonists menthol (1%–3%) and/or camphor are available over‐the‐counter in Japan and other countries. Of note, a subset of patients with chronic itch report exacerbation of their itch when exposed to cold, and they should be recommended to avoid cold sensation.

Capsaicin, an active alkaloid compound contained in chili peppers and a ligand for TRPV1, has been demonstrated to alleviate itching when applied topically. The precise mechanism of action of capsaicin in the itch treatment remains to be elucidated. Treatment with capsaicin may result in functional and/or structural alterations of TRPV1‐expressing peripheral sensory nerve fibers that are involved in the transmission of itching sensations. The capsaicin 8% patch is indicated in adults for the treatment of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia in some countries, but it is not approved for itching conditions. Topical formulations containing capsaicin at lower concentrations are available over‐the‐counter in Japan and other countries.

### Large local reactions to insect stings [^d81ae94f]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Large local reactions (LLRs) are IgE-mediated late-phase inflammatory reactions that can cause great morbidity but are associated with a relatively low risk of future anaphylaxis. Patients with LLR may benefit from consultation with an allergist to help clarify the relative risk, to plan the best treatment for future stings, and to determine whether or not to pursue testing or venom immunotherapy (VIT). The chance of anaphylaxis to future stings is < 5%, so VIT is not generally recommended to people who have had LLR. Whether to prescribe an epinephrine injector is often determined by the frequency of exposure, the proximity to medical care, and the impact on quality of life. For people who have unavoidable exposure and need treatment almost every year for LLR, VIT can be recommended with confidence that it will significantly and safely reduce the severity of LLR to stings.

### Insect bite-induced hypersensitivity and the SCRATCH principles: a new approach to papular urticaria [^d1708367]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Insect bites and the associated hypersensitivity reactions known as papular urticaria account for a significant number of all referrals from pediatricians and dermatologists to our pediatric dermatology clinic. Unfortunately, children affected by these eruptions are frequently misdiagnosed and often subject to expensive evaluations including invasive and unnecessary procedures. Here we review the course of 4 children with the typical physical findings and natural history of these reactions. On the basis of our clinical findings and experience with this patient population, we propose a set of principles (termed "SCRATCH") as clinical features to aid clinicians in making an early and accurate clinical diagnosis. We conclude that a more appropriate term for future study and diagnosis of this entity is insect bite-induced hypersensitivity.

### Neurocutaneous disease: neurocutaneous dysesthesias [^8df49e8b]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Dysesthesia is a generic term for a cutaneous symptom — such as pruritus, burning, tingling, stinging, anesthesia, hypoesthesia, tickling, crawling, cold sensation, or even pain — without a primary cutaneous condition in a well-defined location that is often caused by nerve trauma, impingement, or irritation. There are multiple types of dysesthesias depending on the body location and the nerves involved. While location, exact symptoms, and etiologies might vary, the underlying theme is that these conditions are of neurologic origin and have dermatologic consequences. For many of these conditions, the symptoms are localized to the skin, and patients frequently present to the dermatologist; it is important for dermatologists to be knowledgeable about these symptoms and their underlying causes. In part II of this continuing medical education review, the primary diagnoses associated with underlying cutaneous dysesthesias will be explored, including scalp dysesthesia, trigeminal trophic syndrome, meralgia paresthetica, notalgia paresthetica, and brachioradial pruritus. The typical demographics in terms of symptoms, location, and patient populations will be discussed in addition to the specific etiologies, workups, and possible treatment options.

### Summer buzz: all you need to know about insect sting allergies [^aeb4acba]. Pediatrics in Review (2020). Medium credibility.

Insect stings can generate a range of immune and clinical reactions. Most reactions are local and self-limiting. Allergic reactions to insect stings can occur at all ages, with or without previous stings. Individuals with a history of anaphylaxis carry a significant risk of life-threatening anaphylaxis with future stings. Health-care providers are often unaware of the tremendous clinical benefits of venom immunotherapy for these select patients. Scientific knowledge about the natural history, risk factors, and optimal therapy for insect sting allergies has improved considerably in recent years.

### Stinging insect hypersensitivity: a practice parameter update 2016 [^6b22757a]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Stinging insect hypersensitivity — indications and non-indications for venom immunotherapy (VIT): "Approximately 30% to 60% of patients with a history of systemic allergic reaction to an insect sting who have specific IgE antibodies detectable by means of skin or in vitro testing will experience a systemic reaction when restung. Therefore, VIT should be considered in such patients". "VIT is generally not necessary in children (younger than 17 years) who have experienced isolated cutaneous systemic reactions", and adults with only cutaneous manifestations "are also considered to be at low risk for a severe reaction and do not require VIT". For large local reactions, "VIT is also generally not necessary… most patients who have had a large local reaction do not need to be tested for specific IgE antibodies", though "VIT significantly reduces the size and duration of large local reactions and thus might be useful" when unavoidable and/or frequent. Intentional sting challenges "are not consistently reproducible and are associated with considerable risk", and "The standard management… does not include a sting challenge". In low-risk patients, "the decision regarding initiation of VIT is based on a risk-benefit discussion with the patient".

4 PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF ITCH: ITCH PATHWAY FROM THE SKIN TO THE BRAIN

The four consecutive steps of the skin, peripheral sensory nerves, the spinal cord, and the brain are essential in the sense of itching (Figure 1).

FIGURE 1
Itch pathway from the skin to the brain and targeted approaches for itch. The four consecutive steps of the skin, peripheral sensory nerve fibers, the spinal cord, and the brain are of importance in the sense of itching. A variety of treatment approaches targeting these four steps are currently in use in clinical practice. JAK, Janus kinase; PDE4, phosphodiesterase‐4.

Chemical itch typically develops when itch event(s) occur in the periphery. Such itch events encompass allergic skin inflammation (e.g. atopic dermatitis and prurigo nodularis) and external stimuli (e.g. insect bites). These itch events facilitate the release of pruritogens from various types of cells in the periphery. These pruritogens include histamine and other nonhistaminergic substances, including amines, neuropeptides, lipid mediators, and cytokines (particularly type 2 cytokines, e.g. interleukin [IL]‐4, IL‐13, and IL‐31) (Table 2). These pruritogens stimulate sensory nerve fibers in the skin via their receptors, thereby generating the electrical signals (action potential) through the opening of ion channels, including transient receptor potential A1 (TRPA1) and TRPV1, and voltage‐gated sodium channels (Na v), particularly Na v 1.7 (Figure 2).

### Stinging insect hypersensitivity: a practice parameter update 2016 [^7404f8eb]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Large local reactions — clinical course and management — are usually IgE mediated, almost always self-limited, and rarely create serious health problems; patients with prior large local reactions often have recurrences, and up to 10% might eventually have a systemic reaction. For patients with large local reactions, it is optional to prescribe injectable epinephrine for use if a systemic reaction occurs in the future, most need only symptomatic care and are not candidates for testing for venom specific IgE or venom immunotherapy (VIT), although increasing evidence shows VIT significantly reduces the size and duration of large local reactions and might be useful in those with frequent unavoidable reactions and detectable venom specific IgE; the decision to give VIT must be weighed against added cost and potential inconvenience. Supportive care can include cold compresses, oral antihistamines, and oral analgesics; although many physicians use oral corticosteroids for large local reactions, definitive proof of efficacy is lacking, and antibiotics are not indicated unless there is clear evidence of secondary infection (eg, fever, chills, or sweats).

### Pyrethroids inhibit K2P channels and activate sensory neurons: basis of insecticide-induced paraesthesias [^753f4e00]. Pain (2018). Low credibility.

1. Introduction

Pyrethroid insecticides have been highly used since the 1970s for domestic pest control and in public health, commonly as topical treatments for scabies and head lice. Their use is still very important for control of mosquito populations and malaria spread despite the increasing incidence of resistance. They are more than 2000 times more toxic to insects than to humans because of insects' increased sodium channel sensitivity, lower body temperature, and smaller size. High doses of pyrethroids can cause paralysis, ataxia, convulsions, hypersensitivity, choreoathetosis, tremor, and in extreme cases, death by provoking neuronal hyperexcitability. More commonly, local effects are seen after skin contact or ingestion. Tactile, painful, and paraesthetic effects including tingling, itching, burning, and stinging sensations of the skin have been associated with repetitive activity in skin nerve terminals because of the known effects of pyrethroids on Na + channels, where a slowing of the kinetics of channel opening and closing results in delayed and prolonged openings. These effects diminish action potential threshold and cause repetitive firing of sensory neurons, which is thought to underlie the reported abnormal sensations. At higher doses, the effects on sodium tail currents are large enough to prevent the generation of further action potentials, thus producing a conduction block. Inhibitory effects on chloride, calcium, and GABA-induced chloride currents have also been described.

### Treatment of imported fire ant stings with mitigator sting and bite treatment – a randomized control study [^1991c22b]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of the commercially available product Mitigator Sting and Bite Treatment in reducing the pain after imported fire ant stings.

Methods

Twenty-four volunteer subjects were exposed to imported fire ant stings on both fore-arms. The subjects received Mitigator paste on 1 arm and calamine lotion on the opposite arm, in a blinded manner, from 90 seconds to 10 minutes after exposure. Subjects recorded pain on a 100-mm visual analog scale 60 seconds, 20 minutes, and 3 days after exposure. A 2-tailed paired t test was used to compare the difference in reduction of pain over time between the Mitigator-treated arms and the calamine-treated arms.

Results

At 60 seconds, the mean visual analog scale pain score was 23.9 mm for the Mitigator group and 24.5 mm for the calamine group. At 20 minutes, the mean score was 7.6 mm (delta = 16.3) for the Mitigator group and 12.7 mm (delta = 11.8) for the calamine group. At 3 days, the mean score was 2.4 mm (delta = 21.5) for the Mitigator group and 2.9 mm (delta = 21.6) for the calamine group. There was no significant difference between groups for change in visual analog scale pain score at 60 seconds, 20 minutes (P = 0.256), or 3 days (P = 0.64).

Conclusions

There was no significant difference in pain relief between calamine and Mitigator for imported fire ant stings.

Stinging insect hypersensitivity — management of large local reactions and indications for venom immunotherapy (VIT): Treat large local reactions symptomatically, with antihistamines, cold compresses, and analgesics as needed, noting that in severe cases a short course of oral corticosteroids may be useful and that antibiotics are usually not necessary and should be prescribed only if specifically indicated (Recommendation; D evidence). Recommend and initiate VIT in all patients who have experienced an anaphylactic reaction to an insect sting and who have specific IgE to venom allergens (Strong Recommendation; A evidence). Avoid VIT based solely on in vivo and in vitro testing for venom IgE, without a history of systemic reaction to a sting (Strong Recommendation; A evidence). Counsel patients who have experienced only large local reactions to stings that VIT is generally not required but might be considered in those who have frequent unavoidable exposure (Recommendation; B evidence). In a change from previous recommendations, advise both children and adults who have experienced only cutaneous systemic reactions without other systemic manifestations after an insect sting that VIT is generally not required but may be considered when there are special circumstances, with shared decision making that considers high-risk factors and effects on quality of life (Recommendation; C evidence). Discuss with adults with cutaneous systemic reactions who are already receiving VIT the reasons for the change in recommendations, possible special circumstances, and the relative risks and benefits of discontinuing or completing the course of VIT (Recommendation; D evidence).

### Recurrent fungal keratitis and blepharitis caused by aspergillus flavus [^3a352232]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2016). Low credibility.

Aspergillus species produces a wide spectrum of fungal diseases like endophthalmitis and fungal keratitis ophthalmologically, but there has been no report about blepharitis caused by Aspergilus flavus to date. Herein, we report a 61-year-old ethnic Han Taiwanese male who had suffered from pain with burning and foreign body sensation after an insect bite on his left eye. Specimens from bilateral eyelids suggested infection of A. flavus, whereas corneal scraping showed the presence of Gram-negative bacteria. He was admitted for treatment of infectious keratitis with topical antibiotic and antifungal eye drops. Two weeks after discharge, recurrent blepharitis and keratitis of A. flavus was diagnosed microbiologically. Another treatment course of antifungal agent was resumed in the following 6 months, without further significant symptoms in the following 2 years. Collectively, it is possible for A. flavus to induce concurrent keratitis and blepharitis, and combined treatment of keratitis as well as blepharitis is advocated for as long as 6 months to ensure no recurrence.

### Are insect bites responsible for the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing in United Kingdom general practices? [^c1aad354]. Family Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Evidence shows that general practice flucloxacillin prescribing increases in summer months, peaking in July. A specialist Insect Bite Group (IBG) within the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) were considering whether this seasonal effect might be due to increased presentation with insect bites, and if so whether increased prescribing is appropriate or not. This IBG is within the RCGP overdiagnosis special interest group (OD). The OD group's interest is in inappropriate medicalisation of self-limiting illness and over-use of antibiotics. The group includes general practitioners (GPs), including educators and researchers. We used Quality Improvement (QI) methodologies to undertake an initial analysis/assessment of this problem.

Best practice in the management of insect bites is not as clearly described as it is for other infective conditions such as tonsillitis. Current guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on insect bites and stingsstate that "most will not require antibiotics" and recommends the use of antihistamines. GP clinicians (GPCs) may access allied guidance, for example, NICE guidance on impetigorecommends an antiseptic (hydrogen peroxide1% cream) for well patients with localised non-bullous impetigo, and, if not suitable, topical antibiotics. More widespread or severe non-bullous impetigo, and all bullous impetigo, are recommended a course of oral antibiotics, flucloxacillin, first line. Finally, NICE have guidance on erysipelas and cellulitiswhich recommends taking a swab from broken skin, drawing round the area with a pen, and offering an oral antibiotic, first-line flucloxacillin, it also recommends reassessing if worsening or not improving at 2 or 3 days. However, guidelines drawn from committee consensus and published evidence usually describes case studies of severe infection, and may not translate to this common clinical scenario seen in primary care. Applying guidelines in practice requires key clinical judgements concerning which bites need medical management, or whether self-management is more appropriate. For GPCs, it can be difficult to distinguish clinical features of redness and heat from inflammatory reactions or secondary cellulitis.

### Arthropod envenomation in north America [^eb8679b6]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Arthropods (phylum Arthopoda) account for a higher percentage of morbidity and mortality to humans than do mammalian bites, snake bites, or marine envenomation. They are ubiquitous in domestic dwellings, caves, and campsites and in wilderness settings such as deserts, forests, and lakes. Although arthropods are most intrusive during warmer months, many are active throughout the winter, particularly indoors. Arthropods are also nocturnal and often bite unsuspecting victims while they are sleeping. Encounters with humans are generally defensive, accidental, or reactive. An individual stung by an insect or bitten by an arachnid may experience pain and local swelling, an anaphylactic reaction, or life-threatening toxicity. This review discusses the clinical presentation and latest treatment recommendations for bites and stings from spiders, scorpions, bees, ants, ticks and centipedes of North America.

Case report

A 64-year-old Caucasian male worker in an ETU in Kakata, Liberia felt a burning sensation on the right antecubital fossa in the middle of the night. He awoke with a circumscribed vesiculobullous eruption from a rove beetle crush injury (Fig 1, Fig 2, Fig 3). He immediately washed the area and applied hydrocortisone 1%. Later that day, he applied clobetasol. The cutaneous eruption persisted for over a week and healed with residual scarring. He was taken out of the work rotation as a result of concern that the open wound increased the chance of transmission of Ebola to the affected health care worker. The beetles were easily recognized among the workers in the ETUs, being small (7–10 mm long and 0.5 mm wide) with vivid orange bodies and front wings. They were commonly seen crawling along the rafters of the work tents and portable latrines. The beds in Kakata did not have mosquito netting.

### Venom immunotherapy for preventing allergic reactions to insect stings [^b1efd3ac]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Venom immunotherapy (VIT) is commonly used for preventing further allergic reactions to insect stings in people who have had a sting reaction. The efficacy and safety of this treatment has not previously been assessed by a high-quality systematic review.

Objectives

To assess the effects of immunotherapy using extracted insect venom for preventing further allergic reactions to insect stings in people who have had an allergic reaction to a sting.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to February 2012: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), PsycINFO (from 1806), AMED (from 1985), LILACS (from 1982), the Armed Forces Pest Management Board Literature Retrieval System, and OpenGrey. There were no language or publication status restrictions to our searches. We searched trials databases, abstracts from recent European and North American allergy meetings, and the references of identified review articles in order to identify further relevant trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of venom immunotherapy using standardised venom extract in insect sting allergy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently undertook study selection, data extraction, and assessment of risk of bias. We identified adverse events from included controlled trials and from a separate analysis of observational studies identified as part of a National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence Health Technology Assessment.

Main Results

We identified 6 randomised controlled trials and 1 quasi-randomised controlled trial for inclusion in the review; the total number of participants was 392. The trials had some risk of bias because five of the trials did not blind outcome assessors to treatment allocation. The interventions included ant, bee, and wasp immunotherapy in children or adults with previous systemic or large local reactions to a sting, using sublingual (one trial) or subcutaneous (six trials) VIT. We found that VIT is effective for preventing systemic allergic reaction to an insect sting, which was our primary outcome measure. This applies whether the sting occurs accidentally or is given intentionally as part of a trial procedure. In the trials, 3/113 (2.7%) participants treated with VIT had a subsequent systemic allergic reaction to a sting, compared with 37/93 (39.8%) untreated participants (risk ratio [RR] 0.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.03 to 0.28). The efficacy of VIT was similar across studies; we were unable to identify a patient group or mode of treatment with different efficacy, although these analyses were limited by small numbers. We were unable to confirm whether VIT prevents fatal reactions to insect stings, because of the rarity of this outcome. Venom immunotherapy was also effective for preventing large local reactions to a sting (5 studies; 112 follow-up stings; RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.69) and for improving quality of life (mean difference [MD] in favour of VIT 1.21 points on a 7-point scale, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.67). We found a significant risk of systemic adverse reaction to VIT treatment: 6 trials reported this outcome, in which 14 of 150 (9.3%) participants treated with VIT and 1 of 135 (0.7%) participants treated with placebo or no treatment suffered a systemic reaction to treatment (RR 8.16, 95% CI 1.53 to 43.46; 2 studies contributed to the effect estimate). Our analysis of 11 observational studies found systemic adverse reactions occurred in 131/921 (14.2%) participants treated with bee venom VIT and 8/289 (2.8%) treated with wasp venom VIT.

Authors' Conclusions

We found venom immunotherapy using extracted insect venom to be an effective therapy for preventing further allergic reactions to insect stings, which can improve quality of life. The treatment carries a small but significant risk of systemic adverse reaction.

Recorded features of bites (Table 3)

Time from the presentation was recorded in 79.2% and mode presentation was 1–3 days post bite, 42.5% of the cohort, with a range of presentations from within 1 day to over 3 weeks There were single bite presentations in 58.3% of cases and multiple bites in 38% with 3.7% unrecorded. The site was not recorded in 58% of cases, perhaps due to image use, but when recorded were mainly lower limb (27%) and 2.3% were recorded as facial, 0.9% involving the eye area.

Recorded features of insect bites at first attendance to GPCs 355 April–September 2022 inclusive.

Recorded symptoms and signs were reported by patients or GPCs in the consultation. Redness in 77.7%, itch in 45.4%, heat in 36.9%, and pain occurred in 31.5%. Swelling was recorded in 19.7% and discharge in 6.8%. Systemic upset, for example, malaise, was recorded in 10.7% of cases, and 8.1% of malaise was reported in phone alone consultations. Pyrexia (> 37.5C) was recorded in 1.4% and other vital signs, for example, pulse, in 7.6% of the cohort. We cannot report on comorbidities as it was unclear if these were used by GPCs accessing "digital problem screens" or not, nor could we analyse the size of bites due to uncertainty if size included areas of surrounding inflammation or not. No systemic allergic reactions presented, nor any other insect-borne diseases (Lyme disease cases had already been excluded).

A mild burning immediately after the injection is to be expected; this usually leaves in 10 to 20 seconds. Prolonged pain, or pain radiating up the arm, is usually the result of intramuscular injection, making this injection route undesirable. Subcutaneous injection is the recommended route.

2) 	Systemic Reactions

With careful attention to dosage and administration, such reactions occur infrequentIy, but it must be remembered that allergenic extracts are highly potent to sensitive individuals and OVERDOSE could result in anaphylactic symptoms. Therefore, it is imperative that physicians administering allergenic extracts understand and be prepared for the treatment of severe reactions.

Adverse reaction frequency data for allergenic extract administration is not available. Inherent difficulties in establishing such data are the wide variations in clinical allergy types, patient sensitivity, treatment schedules used by allergists, potency of extracts from various sources, etc.

It cannot be overemphasized that, under certain unpredictable combinations of circumstances, anaphylactic shock is always a possibility. Other possible systemic reaction symptoms are, in varying degrees of severity, fainting, pallor, bradycardia, hypotension, angioedema, cough, wheezing, conjunctivitis, rhinitis, and urticaria.17,18

### Are insect bites responsible for the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing in United Kingdom general practices? [^44b983b1]. Family Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Insect bite inflammation may mimic cellulitis and promote unnecessary antibiotic usage, contributing to antimicrobial resistance in primary care. We wondered how general practice clinicians assess and manage insect bites, diagnose cellulitis, and prescribe antibiotics.

Method

This is a Quality Improvement study in which 10 general practices in England and Wales investigated patients attending for the first time with insect bites between April and September 2021 to their practices. Mode of consultation, presentation, management plan, and reattendance or referral were noted. Total practice flucloxacillin prescribing was compared to that for insect bites.

Results

A combined list size of 161,346 yielded 355 insect bite consultations. Nearly two-thirds were female, ages 3–89 years old, with July as the peak month and a mean weekly incidence of 8 per 100,000. GPs still undertook most consultations; most were phone consultations, with photo support for over half. Over 40% presented between days 1 and 3 and common symptoms were redness, itchness, pain, and heat. Vital sign recording was not common, and only 22% of patients were already taking an antihistamine despite 45% complaining of itch. Antibiotics were prescribed to nearly three-quarters of the patients, mainly orally and mostly as flucloxacillin. Reattendance occurred for 12% and referral to hospital for 2%. Flucloxacillin for insect bites contributed a mean of 5.1% of total practice flucloxacillin prescriptions, with a peak of 10.7% in July.

Conclusions

Antibiotics are likely to be overused in our insect bite practice and patients could make more use of antihistamines for itch before consulting.

We report 7 cases of patients bitten by giant water bugs, large predatory insects belonging to the Belostomatidae family (Hemiptera, Heteroptera). These insects have toxic saliva capable of provoking intense pain and paralysis in vertebrates. Victims experienced intense, excruciating pain and 1 manifested hypoesthesia in the forearm. Bites by Belostomatidae are often reported by clinicians working in areas where these insects live, but there are no detailed case reports in the medical literature. There are no specific treatment modalities known to be effective, making prevention an important strategy.

### Horsefly (genus tabanus) bite: allergy or infection? [^3cc4dc29]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Summer heatwaves are often associated with increased reports of insect bites as people enjoy spending time outdoors. The horsefly (genus Tabanus), or 'cleg' as it is colloquially known, often receives negative publicity due to peak activity in summer. Following an increase in local hospital presentations due to complications of bites, discussion among colleagues suggested a lack of knowledge regarding best management. We present a case of a woman in her 30s with a large erythematous swelling on her thigh following a suspected horsefly bite. Review revealed no clinical evidence of sepsis but a localised inflammatory response. Inflammatory markers were normal and she was treated with intravenous antibiotics and oral antihistamines to good effect. This case highlights secondary care presentation of a common condition and discusses potential complications, pathogenesis and uncertainties around best practice guidelines for treatment. We highlight strategies to aid antibiotic stewardship, reduce complications and secondary care presentation.

### Bee stings – a remedy for postherpetic neuralgia? A case report [^aacd3176]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

This case report describes the effects of bee stings on painful postherpetic neuralgia in a 51-year-old man.

Case Report

The patient was stung by 3 bees in the distribution in which he had been experiencing postherpetic neuralgia. One day after the bee stings, the patient's painful postherpetic neuralgia was completely relieved, and the relief lasted for 1 and a half months. Subsequently, the patient's pain returned, but at significantly less intensity and frequency than what he had experienced prior to the bee stings.

Conclusions

Bee venom and bee sting therapy have been shown to have both antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory properties, which may explain why the bee stings relieved the patient's postherpetic neuralgia. Bee sting or bee venom therapy should be further investigated as a potential treatment modality for postherpetic neuralgia.

### Stinging insect hypersensitivity: a practice parameter update 2016 [^9890654c]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Stinging insect hypersensitivity — epinephrine prescribing and education: Patients who have experienced a systemic reaction to an insect sting should be referred to an allergist and should be given a prescription for an injectable epinephrine device, be instructed in its proper use, and be advised to carry it with them at all times. Some patients who experience anaphylaxis might require more than one injection of epinephrine, so prescription of more than 1 epinephrine injector should be considered, and patients and advocates who might administer epinephrine should be taught how and when to give it. Although coexisting conditions or concomitant medications might require special attention, there is no contraindication to the use of epinephrine in a life-threatening situation, such as anaphylaxis. In patients with relatively low risk, the decision to carry epinephrine can be determined by discussion, and low-risk patients include those receiving maintenance VIT and those who have discontinued VIT after more than 5 years of treatment.

### Arthropod bites [^f6146f3a]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

The phylum Arthropoda includes arachnids and insects. Although their bites typically cause only local reactions, some species are venomous or transmit disease. The two medically important spiders in the United States are widow spiders (Latrodectus), the bite of which causes intense muscle spasms, and the brown recluse (Loxosceles), which may cause skin necrosis. Widow bites usually respond to narcotics, benzodiazepines, or, when necessary, antivenom. Most recluse bites resolve uneventfully without aggressive therapy and require only wound care and minor debridement. Tick bites can transmit diseases only after prolonged attachment to the host. Treatment of clothing with permethrin and proper tick removal greatly reduce the risk of infection. Ticks of medical importance in the United States include the black-legged tick, the Lone Star tick, and the American dog tick. The prophylactic use of a single dose of doxycycline for Lyme disease may be justified in high-risk areas of the country when an attached, engorged black-legged tick is removed. Bites from fleas, bedbugs, biting flies, and mosquitoes present as nonspecific pruritic pink papules, but the history and location of the bite can assist with diagnosis. Flea bites are usually on ankles, whereas mosquito bites are on exposed skin, and chigger bites tend to be along the sock and belt lines. Antihistamines are usually the only treatment required for insect bites; however, severe mosquito reactions (skeeter syndrome) may require prednisone. Applying insect repellent containing diethyltoluamide (DEET) 10% to 35% or picaridin 20% is the best method for preventing bites.

### Novel use of topical ivermectin for the prevention of facial insect bites [^b84a3e87]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Options to prevent facial insect bites while sleeping are limited. Patients may prefer to avoid facial application of potentially neurotoxic insect repellants. Non-toxic &ldquo; natural&rdquo; repellants have limited efficacy, and netting may not be well-tolerated. Nightly facial application of 1% topical ivermectin (IVM) cream completely prevented overnight bites in 2 patients, both of whom reported recurrent bites after discontinuation, and a return to complete bite prevention after IVM resumption. Topical IVM may be an alternative facial mosquito bite prevention modality. J Drugs Dermatol. 2022;21(8):906–907. doi:10.36849/JDD.6432.

### Severe Ludwig's angina caused by an unknown insect bite [^4bcb14a5]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Hereby, we report a case of a 75-year-old man who presented with a 3-day history of facial swelling and choking sensation. The only history of note was an insect bite on the left parotid gland area 3days prior. The patient was later diagnosed with insect-bite-induced Ludwig's angina. Enterococcus faecalis was detected on blood cultures and was presumed the source of infection. Intravenous antibiotics and corticosteroids were initiated. The patient was intubated and was subsequently made to undergo a tracheostomy insertion to establish a definitive airway. He was admitted to the intensive care unit and when his condition improved, he was transferred to the ward for full recovery. The patient spent a total of 66 days in hospital before being discharged. This case suggests that Ludwig's angina can be caused by insect bites. However, further similar cases are needed to be documented to explore this theory.

### A case report of Venezuelan suntiger tarantula (psalmopoeus irminia) envenomation and review of tarantula exposures [^e23c9dad]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Tarantula envenomations are encountered infrequently but may increase with increased exotic animal ownership. This case report presents the first documented toxicity from a Venezuelan suntiger tarantula (VST), Psalmopoeus irminia, and provides a general framework for approaching patients with tarantula exposures.

Case Report

A 35-year-old man presented to an emergency department 4 h after experiencing a bite from his pet VST. He developed erythema, pain, and edema to the bite site on the left thenar eminence that extended proximally. Within 4 h, he developed abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, throat itching, and tightness. The patient had a blood pressure of 131/105 mm Hg, heart rate of 102 beats/min, 36.6°C, respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min, and SpO 2 of 94%. Laboratory evaluations were within normal limits (other than chronically elevated but improved transaminases). The patient received 0.5 mg epinephrine intramuscularly, 50 mg diphenhydramine IV, 20 mg famotidine IV, 0.4 mg ondansetron IV, and 1 L of normal saline for a suspected anaphylactic reaction. Shortly after epinephrine administration, his gastrointestinal and upper airway symptoms resolved. All symptoms resolved within 1 week. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Little is known about VST toxicity. Therefore, providers should rely on a general framework for approaching patients with tarantula exposures. Morbidity from tarantula exposures is mediated by mechanical injury, venom effects, and hypersensitivity reactions. Typical clinical findings include local pain, pruritis, edema, erythema, and burning. Muscle cramping, ophthalmia nodosa, and hypersensitivity reactions may occur. Treatment is primarily supportive and includes decontamination, cool compresses, analgesia, treatment of anaphylaxis, and ophthalmology evaluation if ocular exposure.

### Successful treatment of ivermectin refractory demodicosis with isotretinoin and permethrin cream [^8a6924dd]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case report

A healthy 63-year-old man presented with dry, scaly, erythematous patches and telangiectasia with a stinging and burning sensation on both cheeks (Fig 1). He also had a history of itchy bumps resembling insect bites on his face, which spontaneously disappeared in a few days. Two years ago, he was diagnosed with demodicosis and treated successfully with 2 doses of oral ivermectin (200 μg/kg) in combination with metronidazole gel 0.75%. Approximately 10 months ago, he developed a scaly, eczematous rash with irritation on his face and was treated with triamcinolone cream 0.1%. The rash improved, but after stopping topical medication for a few weeks, the rash reappeared at the same location. Despite continued treatment, his clinical course slowly deteriorated with the development of more stinging, burning sensation and telangiectasia on both cheeks that no longer responded to topical steroids. At this time, the standardized skin surface biopsy (SSSB) was performed on the rash, revealing numerous Demodex mites (68 mites/cm 2). He was diagnosed with demodicosis and treated with 2 doses of oral ivermectin (200 μg/kg, 1 week apart) in combination with metronidazole gel 0.75%. This therapy resulted in a slight improvement of the clinical lesions at the 2-week follow-up, so ivermectin treatment was continued for another 4 doses. At the 1-month follow-up, there was some improvement with reductions in skin hypersensitivity and telangiectasia. However, the dry, scaly erythematous patches and some papules persisted. SSSB revealed 61 Demodex mites/cm 2. Ivermectin and metronidazole gel were discontinued. A trial of low-dose oral isotretinoin 10 mg, 4 times a week (0.1 mg/kg/day) combined with permethrin cream 1% was administered for another 8 weeks. This therapy resulted in marked improvement of the lesions (Fig 2). There was a complete resolution of all clinical symptoms, and repeat SSSB confirmed the eradication of Demodex mites, defined by the consecutive negative results with less than 5 Demodex mites/cm 2 spanning beyond 2 mite-life cycles. The isotretinoin treatment and permethrin cream were continued for 6 months. There was no recurrence at 9 months after isotretinoin administration.

### The 2020 international alliance for the control of scabies consensus criteria for the diagnosis of scabies [^cb2c988c]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

H1. Itch

Itch (pruritus) is a very common feature of scabies, but is not universal. 40, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54 Individuals typically do not develop itch for 4–6 weeks after initial infestation. 1 Individuals with cognitive impairment are less likely to report itch. 7, 55 For some, itch is extremely severe and profoundly affects quality of life, whereas for others itch may be a minor complaint. 54, 56, 57 Itch is typically described as more severe at night, 58, 59 although this pattern is shared by many pruritic conditions and is not useful for diagnosis. 57, 60 Itch may be localized to the site of visible scabies lesions, or generalized to other body parts. Itch may be attenuated (e.g. by corticosteroids) or exacerbated (e.g. by benzyl benzoate) by treatments.

In order to fulfil this criterion, an individual (or carer) may report either generalized or localized itch. Signs of excoriations and behaviours including scratching affected skin, particularly in children, also meet the definition. Itch that is considered to be more likely due to another cause (e.g. localized to arthropod bites) 61 does not fulfil this criterion.

### Are insect bites responsible for the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing in United Kingdom general practices? [^d5f5e218]. Family Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

These results highlight a mean incidence of first presentation to general practices of insect bites of 8 per 100,000 population weekly over the 6 months of the study. A studyof 1999–2003 exploring both insect bites and impetigo reported an incidence of 5.4 per 100,000 population of England and Wales over 12 months and as insect bite incidence reduces in the winter our figure is comparable but does not represent additional consultations by alternative primary care providers.

In contrast to NICE guidance,74% of our patients received an oral or topic antibiotic, most commonly flucloxacillin. This choice adheres to guideline recommendations for cellulitisand some prescribing reflected reported patient adverse reactions or allergies. Flucloxacillin for insect bites is, therefore, a small contributor to the rises in flucloxacillin practice prescribing over the summer months. We found a difference between the previously reported idealisation of practice by surveyed GPsand practice-based clinician activity, for example, vital signs were not prime factors in antibiotic prescribing. Either there is a high incidence of cellulitis or there is overprescribing, with scope to improve antibiotic stewardship by exploring management as the next stage of QI. Although a small effect at the level of ten practices, the potential impact on antibiotic stewardship at the UK level is significant.

In addition, most patients still contact their general practices first but meet an expanded clinical team with nurses over a third of consulters. Almost 70% of consultations start by phone and less than 10% are converted to f2f consultations. Images support consultations in just over half of interactions. Most people present 1–7 days post bite, most commonly days 1–3 with common features of redness, itchness, pain, and swelling, July was the peak month. A review of cellulitisgave key symptoms as pain, swelling, and heat, similar to our study, except we also had itching as a key symptom. Only 22% of patients used oral antihistamine before consultation, despite 45.4% complaining of itch. The use of antihistamines, as recommended by NICE, may be an area for improvement, although there is uncertainty about their efficacy in reducing itch or cellulitis complications and this is a priority area for future research. Topical steroids were not commonly used and when used were mainly hydrocortisone cream. There is a need to establish the efficacy and best strength of local steroid to reduce inflammation, and itch and prevent secondary cellulitis.

The IL-4– and IL-13–mediated Janus kinase (JAK) and STAT intracellular signaling pathways are critical for T H 2 cell differentiation and type 2 inflammatory processes. Inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling can improve clinical symptoms of AD, including itch. Binding of IL-4 and IL-13 to IL-4Rα activates JAK1, JAK3, tyrosine kinase 2, and STAT6. These molecules play an important role in triggering type 2 inflammatory responses, including pruritic responses, as well as acute pruritic responses to stimuli such as insect bites.– Importantly, STAT6 gain of function is associated with chronic atopic conditions in humans.– Although exogenous itch such as that from insect bites has been associated with type 1 and type 2 cytokines, evidence suggests that chronic inflammatory itch is associated with the IL-4/IL-13/JAK1/STAT6 axis.–

1 INTRODUCTION

Insect‐bite hypersensitivity (IBH) in horses is caused by an allergy against insect bites, more specifically against Culicoides spp. It is a severe and chronic disease affecting a large number of horses worldwide. Although IBH is the best characterized allergic dermatitis in horses, effective treatment is still lacking. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 We recently proposed a new therapeutic vaccination targeting eosinophils by active vaccination against IL‐5. 9 Host‐made auto‐antibodies induced by active vaccination show overall similar advantages and safety profiles as monoclonal antibodies (mAb) administered via passive vaccination. A major drawback of mAbs is the potential induction of anti‐mAb antibodies and their relative short half‐life, thus limiting its clinical long‐term use. On the other hand, a specific concern of therapeutic vaccines is the potential irreversibility of the antibody responses, potentially causing lifelong blockage of target self‐molecules. 10 The most prominent therapeutic vaccine in veterinary use is the anti‐boar vaccine Improvac ®, targeting gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH). 11 A similar immunocontraceptive vaccine was developed for horses, known as GonaCon‐Equine™, 12 registered in the US for female wild/feral horses and burros. For human use, a number of anti‐self vaccines are in preclinical and clinical development mostly targeting cytokines in inflammatory conditions and personalized anti‐cancer vaccines. 13, 14

### Arthropod bites and stings [^650abcd0]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Arthropods, including insects and arachnids, significantly affect humans as vectors for infectious diseases. Arthropod bites and stings commonly cause minor, usually self-limited reactions; however, some species are associated with more severe complications. Spider bites are rarely life-threatening. There are two medically relevant spiders in the United States. Widow spider (Latrodectus) envenomation can cause muscle spasm and severe pain that should be treated with analgesics and benzodiazepines. Antivenom is not widely available in the United States but may be considered for severe, refractory cases. Recluse spider (Loxosceles) bites are often overdiagnosed, should be treated supportively, and only rarely cause skin necrosis. Centruroides scorpions are the only medically relevant genus in the United States. Envenomation causes neuromuscular and autonomic dysfunction, which should be treated with analgesics, benzodiazepines, supportive care, and, in severe cases, antivenom. Hymenoptera, specifically bees, wasps, hornets, and fire ants, account for the most arthropod-related deaths in humans, most commonly by severe allergic reactions to envenomation. In severe cases, patients are treated with analgesia, local wound care, and systemic glucocorticoids. Diptera include flies and mosquitoes. The direct effects of their bites are usually minor and treated symptomatically; however, they are vectors for numerous infectious diseases. Arthropod bite and sting prevention strategies include avoiding high-risk areas, covering exposed skin, and wearing permethrin-impregnated clothing. N, N-diethyl- m-toluamide (DEET) 20% to 50% is the most studied and widely recommended insect repellant.
