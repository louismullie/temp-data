## Question

Screening recommendations for abdominal aortic aneurysm

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about screening recommendations for abdominal aortic aneurysm. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core evidence base and how to appraise it. Then, I should verify the highest-credibility guidelines and reconcile any differences. Next, I will stratify recommendations by sex, smoking status, age, and family history, and clarify the screening modality and frequency. After that, I should review surveillance intervals for small aneurysms and special populations. Finally, I will consider implementation gaps, cost-effectiveness, and synthesize a practical clinical algorithm with clear takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the core evidence base. The foundation rests on four large randomized trials in men aged 65 years and older, which consistently show that a one-time ultrasound invitation reduces AAA-related mortality by about 35–42% over long-term follow-up, with an absolute risk reduction of roughly 4 per 1000 and a number needed to screen around 238, while not reducing all-cause mortality; this is supported by a high-quality USPSTF evidence review and meta-analyses, and the benefit persists beyond a decade in cohort follow-up, which I should keep in mind as I interpret guideline strength [^a0dba6ff] [^62f46c2d] [^d51cdb78].

> Wait, let me verify the highest-credibility guidelines before drawing conclusions. The 2019 USPSTF Recommendation Statement is the most authoritative for U.S. primary care, and it assigns a Grade B to one-time ultrasound screening for men aged 65–75 who have ever smoked, a Grade C to selective screening in men 65–75 who never smoked, a D against routine screening in women who never smoked and have no family history, and an I statement for women who ever smoked or have a family history; I should align my synthesis to these grades while noting the evidence gaps USPSTF highlights for women [^658187af] [^b84e6b69] [^261e4f1a].

> Next, I should review other major societies to ensure consistency and capture nuances. The 2022 ACC/AHA guideline recommends ultrasound screening in men ≥ 65 who ever smoked, recommends screening first-degree relatives of patients with AAA, considers screening reasonable in women ≥ 65 who ever smoked, and advises against repeat screening after a negative initial screen in those > 75; the SVS recommends one-time ultrasound for men and women 65–75 with tobacco history, suggests screening first-degree relatives, and proposes rescreening after 10 years if the initial aortic diameter is 2.6–2.9 cm; the ESVS emphasizes ultrasound as first-line for screening and surveillance and supports rescreening men with 2.5–2.9 cm after 5–10 years; I need to reconcile these with USPSTF's more conservative stance on women and on repeat screening [^c0c1682a] [^2a2dfba2] [^6b7ffe7a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about women. I initially thought the evidence clearly supports screening women who smoke, but I should double-check. The only randomized trial in women was underpowered, so the benefit signal is uncertain; however, modeling and observational data suggest potential value in older women smokers given higher rupture risk at smaller diameters, with some guidelines (ACC/AHA, SVS) allowing consideration in this subgroup, whereas USPSTF issues an I statement pending better trials; I need to frame this as reasonable to discuss in shared decision-making rather than a blanket recommendation [^93e75298] [^203f3193] [^c0c1682a] [^e7670192].

> I will now examine the primary screening modality and performance. Ultrasound is the first-line test because it is noninvasive, avoids radiation, and has high sensitivity (94–100%) and specificity (98–100%); CT is accurate but not recommended for screening due to radiation, and physical examination is insensitive and not suitable for screening; I should confirm that this aligns with USPSTF and ACR guidance, which it does [^3ce3fd40] [^696061f4] [^add1d238].

> Let me think about frequency and whether repeat screening helps. All population trials used a one-time invitation strategy, and cohort data show very low AAA-related mortality over 5–12 years after a normal screen, supporting no routine repeat screening; USPSTF explicitly recommends against repeat screening after a negative initial screen in those older than 75, and ACC/AHA concurs; SVS suggests a one-time rescreen at 10 years if the initial aorta is 2.6–2.9 cm, which is a niche scenario rather than routine policy [^f1ec1fac] [^8eba58d5] [^71c35b73].

> Next, I should review surveillance intervals once a small aneurysm is found. For 3.0–3.9 cm, 3-year intervals are reasonable; for 4.0–4.9 cm, annual imaging is advised; for 5.0–5.4 cm, 6-month intervals are appropriate; these intervals are supported by SVS and ACC/AHA, and I should note that women may warrant closer surveillance given higher rupture risk at smaller diameters, even though exact thresholds differ across guidelines [^ad2b16bb] [^b87139c7].

> But wait, what about special populations and implementation realities. Prevalence is declining, yet many ruptures occur in people not captured by current programs, including women, those under 65 with risk factors, and individuals who decline screening; real-world uptake remains suboptimal, with studies showing low utilization of the Medicare Welcome-to-Medicare benefit, suggesting that system-level prompts and provider education can improve detection and earlier treatment at smaller sizes [^f4ce1958] [^d6eb9308] [^de205a3c].

> I should confirm the practical clinical algorithm and make sure it is actionable. For men 65–75 who ever smoked, offer a one-time ultrasound (Grade B). For men 65–75 who never smoked, discuss selective screening based on family history, other vascular aneurysms, or cardiovascular risk, recognizing a small net benefit (Grade C). For women who never smoked and have no family history, do not screen (Grade D). For women 65–75 who ever smoked or have a family history, consider screening after discussing uncertain benefits and potential value in shared decision-making (I statement). For anyone older than 75 with a prior negative screen, do not repeat screening. If a small aneurysm is found, follow size-based surveillance intervals and refer for elective repair when thresholds are met, integrating patient preference and operative risk [^658187af] [^c0c1682a] [^ad2b16bb].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and evidence-aligned. One-time ultrasound screening in men aged 65–75 who ever smoked reduces AAA-related mortality with moderate certainty and should be routinely offered; selective screening in never-smoking men is reasonable; routine screening is not recommended for low-risk women; women with smoking history or family history may be considered for screening in shared decision-making given plausible benefit but insufficient trial evidence; ultrasound is the preferred modality; and surveillance intervals should be size-based with no routine repeat screening after a negative initial screen in older adults [^658187af] [^c0c1682a] [^3ce3fd40] [^8eba58d5].

Screen for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with a **one-time ultrasound** [^3ce3fd40] in men aged 65–75 who have ever smoked [^658187af], as this reduces AAA-related mortality [^a0dba6ff] with moderate net benefit (Grade B) [^b84e6b69]. For men 65–75 who never smoked, **selectively offer screening** [^bd2e27c4] based on individual risk factors and patient preferences, given a small net benefit (Grade C) [^2964d274]. Do not routinely screen women, including those who never smoked and have no family history (Grade D) [^6eafbb15], and use an I statement for women aged 65–75 who smoke or have a family history, as evidence is insufficient [^e7670192]. Ultrasound is the **preferred modality** [^3ce3fd40] due to its high accuracy, safety, and lack of radiation [^696061f4]; if the initial screen is negative, repeat screening is not recommended [^8eba58d5].

---

## Populations recommended for screening

### Men aged 65–75 years who have ever smoked

- **Recommendation**: One-time ultrasound screening [^3ce3fd40] is recommended (Grade B) [^b84e6b69].
- **Rationale**: Moderate certainty of moderate net benefit; screening reduces AAA-related mortality [^a0dba6ff] and rupture [^62f46c2d] without significant harms [^71905321].
- **Evidence**: Multiple RCTs and meta-analyses show a 42–48% reduction in AAA-related mortality [^62f46c2d] [^4b8495e0].

---

### Men aged 65–75 years who have never smoked

- **Recommendation**: Selectively offer screening [^bd2e27c4] based on individual risk factors and patient preferences (Grade C) [^2964d274].
- **Rationale**: Small net benefit; benefits and harms should be balanced individually [^261e4f1a].
- **Risk factors**: Family history, other vascular aneurysms, coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, peripheral artery disease [^944fa37d].

---

### Women

- **Never smoked, no family history**: Do not screen (Grade D) [^6eafbb15]; harms outweigh benefits [^261e4f1a].
- **Ever smoked or family history**: Evidence insufficient (I statement) [^e7670192]; consider individualized decisions [^b1164a47].
- **Rationale**: Lower prevalence, smaller benefit, and higher operative risk in women [^93e75298] [^a0dba6ff].

---

## Screening modality

Ultrasound is the **preferred screening test** [^3ce3fd40] because it is noninvasive, accurate (sensitivity 94–100%, specificity 98–100%) [^696061f4], and does not involve radiation [^3ce3fd40]. CT is accurate but not recommended for routine screening due to radiation exposure [^3ce3fd40].

---

## Frequency of screening

One-time screening is recommended for the target populations [^658187af]; **repeat screening is not advised** if the initial ultrasound is negative [^8eba58d5].

---

## Management of screen-detected AAA

| **Aneurysm size** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|
| < 3.0 cm | No routine surveillance |
| 3.0–3.9 cm | Rescreen in 3 years [^ad2b16bb] |
| 4.0–4.9 cm | Ultrasound every 12 months [^ad2b16bb] |
| 5.0–5.4 cm | Ultrasound every 6 months [^ad2b16bb] |
| ≥ 5.5 cm | Refer for surgical evaluation [^notfound] |

---

## Special considerations

- **Family history**: First-degree relatives of AAA patients have a higher risk; consider screening in men ≥ 65 with family history [^c0c1682a] [^3916f5ff].
- **Older adults**: Screening may be considered in healthy adults > 75 with risk factors, but evidence is limited [^2a2dfba2] [^f4c47e82].
- **Ethnicity**: Prevalence varies; lower in Asian and Black populations, but screening decisions should be individualized [^29f37ac5].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Population** | **Recommendation** | **Grade** |
|-|-|-|
| Men 65–75, ever smoked | One-time ultrasound | B |
| Men 65–75, never smoked | Selective screening | C |
| Women, never smoked, no family history | Do not screen | D |
| Women 65–75, ever smoked or family history | Evidence insufficient | I |

---

Screening for AAA is **most beneficial in men aged 65–75 who have ever smoked** [^658187af], with selective screening considered for never-smokers and individualized decisions for women with risk factors [^bd2e27c4] [^e7670192]. Ultrasound is the preferred modality [^3ce3fd40], and repeat screening is not recommended after a negative initial screen [^8eba58d5].

### Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^658187af]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is typically defined as aortic enlargement with a diameter of 3.0 cm or larger. The prevalence of AAA has declined over the past 2 decades among screened men 65 years or older in various European countries. The current prevalence of AAA in the United States is unclear because of the low uptake of screening. Most AAAs are asymptomatic until they rupture. Although the risk for rupture varies greatly by aneurysm size, the associated risk for death with rupture is as high as 81%.

Objective

To update its 2014 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence on the effectiveness of 1-time and repeated screening for AAA, the associated harms of screening, and the benefits and harms of available treatments for small AAAs (3.0–5.4 cm in diameter) identified through screening.

Population

This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults 50 years or older. However, the randomized trial evidence focuses almost entirely on men aged 65 to 75 years.

Evidence Assessment

Based on a review of the evidence, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for AAA in men aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked is of moderate net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for AAA in men aged 65 to 75 years who have never smoked is of small net benefit. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the net benefit of screening for AAA in women aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked or have a family history of AAA. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the harms of screening for AAA in women aged 65 to 75 years who have never smoked and have no family history of AAA outweigh the benefits.

Recommendations

The USPSTF recommends 1-time screening for AAA with ultrasonography in men aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer screening for AAA with ultrasonography in men aged 65 to 75 years who have never smoked rather than routinely screening all men in this group. (C recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against routine screening for AAA with ultrasonography in women who have never smoked and have no family history of AAA. (D recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for AAA with ultrasonography in women aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked or have a family history of AAA. (I statement).

### ACR appropriateness criteria® screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm [^add1d238]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a significant vascular disease found in 4% to 8% of the screening population. If ruptured, its mortality rate is between 75% and 90%, and it accounts for up to 5% of sudden deaths in the United States. Therefore, screening of AAA while asymptomatic has been a crucial portion of preventive health care worldwide. Ultrasound of the abdominal aorta is the primary imaging modality for screening of AAA recommended for asymptomatic adults regardless of their family history or smoking history. Alternatively, duplex ultrasound and CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast may be appropriate for screening. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Extended screening guidelines for the diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm [^4b1a50de]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines are the most widely used criteria for screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). However, when the USPSTF criteria are applied retrospectively to a group of patients who have undergone treatment for AAA, there are many patients who satisfy none of the AAA screening criteria. The more sensitive Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) guidelines have expanded the criteria for screening for AAA with the hope of capturing a greater fraction of those individuals who can undergo treatment for their AAA before presenting with AAA rupture. We sought to identify the number of patients who would have been identified as having criteria for screening for AAA by both the USPSTF and SVS criteria, in a cohort of patients who have undergone treatment for AAA.

Methods

We assessed demographic, comorbidity, and perioperative complication data for all patients undergoing endovascular and open AAA repair in the Vascular Quality Initiative. Patients meeting each of the screening criteria were identified. Clinical factors and demographic variables were collected.

Results

We identified 55,197 patients undergoing AAA repair in the Vascular Quality Initiative, including 44,602 patients who underwent endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and 10,595 patients undergoing open repair. Of these, the USPTF guidelines would have identified fewer than one-third of patients (32% EVAR and 33% open repair). Applying the SVS guidelines increased the number meeting criteria for screening by 6% and 12% for the EVAR and open repair cohorts, respectively. Finally, adoption of the expanded SVS guidelines (including the "weak recommendations") would have identified an additional 34% of EVAR patients and 21% of open AAA repair patients. Use of the expanded criteria would have resulted in 27% of patients undergoing EVAR and 33% of patients undergoing open AAA repair who would not have met any screening criteria. In EVAR patients not meeting the criteria, 52% were younger than 65 years had a history of heavy smoking. Of all those who did not meet screening criteria, ruptured AAA was twice as prevalent as those who met screening criteria (8.5% vs 4.4%; P ≤ .0001).

Conclusions

Expanding established USPSTF screening guidelines to include the expanded SVS criteria may potentially double the number of patients identified with AAA. Smokers under the age of 65, and elderly patients 70 and older with no smoking history, represent two groups with AAA and potentially twice the risk of presenting with rupture.

### Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm [^7b8c2fff]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Guidelines are systematically developed statements to assist patients and providers in choosing appropriate health care for specific clinical conditions. Consensus exists across guidelines on one-time screening of elderly men to detect and treat abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) ≥ 5.5 cm. However, the recommendations regarding other age groups, imaging intervals for small AAAs, inclusion of women, and cost-effectiveness have not been universally adopted. As many countries are considering the initiation of an AAA screening program, this is an overview on the current status of such programs.

### Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms [^b8de71a7]. Clinical Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Ultrasonography remains the screening modality of choice for abdominal aortic aneurysms despite many advances in imaging modalities. Several randomized trials were performed that demonstrated the effectiveness of ultrasound-based screening to reduce aneurysm-related mortality. Ultrasound is both cost effective and low risk. Controversies do persist in selecting the appropriate populations for screening, and several national societies have set recommendations.

### Abdominal aortic aneurysm: populations at risk and how to screen [^560ff9d9]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) account for significant morbidity and mortality in adults. Because they are most often asymptomatic until rupture occurs, screening that allows early detection and management has been advocated. In this review, the authors examine evidence to support screening at-risk populations for AAAs and evaluate various screening methods.

### The case for expanding abdominal aortic aneurysm screening [^6cffa85a]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Both the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence are re-evaluating their screening paradigms for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). Currently, most countries that screen for AAA do so only in male ever-smokers between the ages of 65 and 75 years and in patients with a family history of AAA. However, these recommendations are based primarily on screening trials predating the endovascular era. The wider applicability of endovascular aneurysm repair and its safety profile, especially in the elderly, have changed the risk-benefit of repair and, by extension, screening. This is despite the decreasing prevalence of AAA thanks to improved medical therapies and lower smoking rates. This evidence summary critically examines the evidence behind screening and the potential for expanded screening.

### Systematic review of guidelines on abdominal aortic aneurysm screening [^8c352da3]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Usually, physicians base their practice on guidelines, but recommendations on the same topic may vary across guidelines. Given the uncertainties regarding abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening, physicians should be able to identify systematically and transparently developed recommendations. We performed a systematic review of AAA screening guidelines to assist physicians in their choice of recommendations.

Methods

Guidelines in English published between January 1, 2003 and February 26, 2010 were retrieved using MEDLINE, CINAHL, the National Guideline Clearinghouse, the National Library for Health, the Canadian Medication Association Infobase, and the G-I-N International Guideline Library. Guidelines developed by national and international medical societies from Western countries, containing recommendations on AAA screening were included. Three reviewers independently assessed rigor of guideline development using the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument. Two independent reviewers performed extraction of recommendations.

Results

Of 2415 titles identified, seven guidelines were included in this review. Three guidelines were less rigorously developed based on AGREE scores below 40%. All seven guidelines contained a recommendation for one-time screening of elderly men by ultrasonography to select AAAs ≥ 5.5 cm for elective surgical repair. Four guidelines, of which three were less rigorously developed, contained disparate recommendations on screening of women and middle-aged men at elevated risk. There was no agreement on the management of smaller AAAs.

Conclusions

Consensus exists across guidelines on one-time screening of elderly men to detect and treat AAAs ≥ 5.5 cm. For other target groups and management of small AAAs, prediction models and cost-effectiveness analyses are needed to provide guidance.

### Analysis of clinical benefit, harms, and cost-effectiveness of screening women for abdominal aortic aneurysm [^93e75298]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) traditionally has been considered a disease of men, strongly associated with smoking. However, a third of deaths caused by AAA rupture are in women. In men, synthesis of four randomised trials has shown a benefit of population-based screening in reducing AAA-related mortality by up to 40% although any reduction in all-cause mortality is small. Several countries including Sweden and the UK have introduced cost-effective population screening programmes for AAA in men aged at least 65 years, and screening for older men is available in the USA, and regionally in Italy and other countries., The only randomised trial of AAA screening in women, which was done in the 1990s, was underpowered. In 2014, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended against screening in women. The reasons for this recommendation include the reportedly lower prevalence of AAA in women, on the basis of the maximum aortic diameter threshold of at least 3 cm, and paucity of evidence about the management of AAA in women. However, with long-term health-economic modelling in men suggesting that population-based screening would be cost-effective with an AAA prevalence as low as 0·35–0·5%, smoking now almost as common in women as in men, and with the association between smoking and AAA almost twice as strong for women compared with men, the case for AAA screening in women needs to be formally assessed.

### Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^63f01072]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force — abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening recommendations state that the USPSTF recommends 1-time screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with ultrasonography in men aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked; the USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer screening for AAA with ultrasonography in men aged 65 to 75 years who have never smoked rather than routinely screening all men in this group, noting that evidence indicates that the net benefit of screening all men in this group is small and that patients and clinicians should consider the balance of benefits and harms and the basis of evidence relevant to the patient's medical history, family history, other risk factors, and personal values; the USPSTF recommends against routine screening for AAA with ultrasonography in women who have never smoked and have no family history of AAA; and the USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for AAA with ultrasonography in women aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked or have a family history of AAA.

### Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^261e4f1a]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening rationale — by sex, smoking, and family history: Ultrasonography is described as "a safe and accurate screening test for AAA." In men aged 65 to 75 who have ever smoked, "1-time screening for AAA with ultrasonography results in a moderate benefit," the harms "are small to moderate," and there is "moderate certainty" this "has a moderate net benefit." In men aged 65 to 75 who have never smoked, screening yields "a small benefit," with harms "small to moderate," and "moderate certainty" of "a small net benefit." For women who have ever smoked or have a family history of AAA, there is "inadequate evidence to conclude whether 1-time screening… is beneficial," and "the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined." For women who have never smoked and have no family history of AAA, "1-time screening… results in no benefit," and "the harms of screening… outweigh the benefits."

### Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^cd6de2fc]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening recommendations — Asymptomatic adults: For men aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked, Grade B recommends, "Perform 1-time screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with ultrasonography in men who have a history of smoking." For men aged 65 to 75 years who have never smoked, Grade C says to "Selectively offer screening to men who do not have a history of smoking, rather than routinely screening all men in this group." For women who have never smoked and have no family history of AAA, Grade D advises, "Do not screen women who have never smoked and do not have a family history of AAA." For women aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked or have a family history of AAA, the USPSTF issues an I statement: "Evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for AAA with ultrasonography in women aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked or have a family history of AAA." This recommendation applies to "Asymptomatic adults"; abdominal duplex ultrasonography is "the standard approach for AAA screening," screening is "One-time," and "Ever-smoker" is commonly defined as "smoking 100 or more cigarettes."

### The Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines on the care of patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm [^f6e3ee51]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for aneurysm screening — Randomized trials of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening showed benefit: four trials including 127,891 men and 9342 women aged 65 to 79 years found ultrasound screening reduced aneurysm-related mortality, with benefit beginning within 3 years and persisting up to 15 years, and screening was associated with reduced risk for AAA rupture and emergency surgery. In the MASS trial over 13 years there was a 42% reduction in AAA-related mortality, an estimated 216 men needed to be invited to screening to save one death during 13 years, and roughly half of ruptures had an initial diameter of 2.5 to 2.9 cm. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) in 2005 recommended a one-time abdominal ultrasound for men aged 65 to 75 years with a history of smoking, and in 2014 updated to one-time screening for men aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked (grade B) with selective screening for those who have never smoked (grade C); screening was not recommended for women aged 65 to 75 years who have never smoked (grade D), and evidence was insufficient for women aged 65 to 75 years with a smoking history. In the absence of a smoking history, prevalence drops to 2%; among women of similar age with a past smoking history prevalence is 0.8%, in current smokers prevalence is 5%, and in women who have never smoked AAA prevalence is < 0.60%. Under the SAAAVE amendment, Medicare began offering one-time ultrasound screening for men aged 65 to 75 years if they had smoked ≥ 100 cigarettes and for men and women with a family history of AAA disease as part of the Welcome to Medicare exam, and originally the order could be placed only by the primary care physician within 6 months of activation of Medicare benefits.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) definition, epidemiology, and rupture risk — An AAA is typically defined as aortic enlargement with a diameter of 3.0 cm or larger; the prevalence of AAA has declined over the past 2 decades among screened men 65 years or older in various European countries, and the current prevalence of AAA in the United States is unclear because of the low uptake of screening; most AAAs are asymptomatic until they rupture, and the associated risk for death with rupture is as high as 81%.

### Should the frequency of surveillance for small abdominal aortic aneurysms be reduced? [^36851be6]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Different national screening programmes use a variety of surveillance intervals for patients identified with small abdominal aortic aneurysm. An individual patient meta-analysis of > 15000 persons with small aneurysm has provided a strong scientific basis for safe surveillance frequency. In many screening programmes the number of surveillance visits for men could be reduced by up to half. The higher rate of aneurysm rupture in women leads to different recommendation for women.

### Analysis of clinical benefit, harms, and cost-effectiveness of screening women for abdominal aortic aneurysm [^203f3193]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

There would be no quick answers from doing a randomised trial of AAA screening in women, because of the large sample size and long-term follow-up that would be required. The alternative is long-term modelling. This requires contemporary and reliable estimates of parameters that can influence the clinical and cost-effectiveness of screening in women. The aim of this project was to obtain this information and then apply discrete event simulation modelling to explore the hypothesis that a variation of the current AAA screening programmes for men might prove clinically beneficial and cost-effective in reducing deaths from ruptured AAA in women.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Historically, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) has been considered to be a disease in older male smokers, with prevalence being 4–5 times higher in men than in women. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL using the terms "abdominal aortic aneurysm", "aneurysm", "women" OR "gender" OR "sex" OR "women's health" OR "sex difference", "prevalence" OR "incidence" OR "occurrence" OR "frequency", "screening", and "population" OR "population-based". The search was restricted to major European languages and the final search date was Jan 15, 2017. Four randomised trials of population screening in older men have shown that screening can reduce AAA-related deaths by up to half, meta-analysis of these trials indicate a small decrease in all-cause mortality, and associated studies have shown that screening is cost-effective. Therefore, in many countries or regions, there are programmes for ultrasonographic AAA screening for men. In women, AAA screening is not recommended as there has been only a single underpowered randomised trial to date. However, the rupture rate of small AAAs is four times higher in women than in men, and a third of the deaths from AAA rupture are in women. Moreover, women with incidentally detected AAA are disadvantaged with respect to availability of elective repair, the types of treatment available, and the higher elective operative mortality and complication rates compared with men. Although the effect of AAA screening on quality of life has been assessed in men, the instruments used might not be sensitive to detect either small changes or changes in specific health domains such as depression and emotional status and, to our knowledge, there have been no studies in women to date.

### Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm: a best-evidence systematic review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^71905321]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

While the prognosis for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture is poor, ultrasound imaging is an accurate and reliable test for detecting AAAs before rupture.

Purpose

To examine the benefits and harms of population-based AAA screening.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1994 to July 2004) supplemented by the Cochrane Library, a reference list of retrieved articles, and expert suggestions.

Study Selection

Randomized trials of AAA population screening, population studies of AAA risk factors, and data on adverse screening and treatment events from randomized trials and cohort studies.

Data Extraction

All studies were reviewed, abstracted, and rated for quality by using predefined criteria.

Data Synthesis

The authors identified 4 population-based randomized, controlled trials of AAA screening in men 65 years of age and older. On the basis of meta-analysis, an invitation to attend screening was associated with a significant reduction in AAA-related mortality (odds ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.45 to 0.74]). A meta-analysis of 3 trials revealed no significant difference in all-cause mortality (odds ratio, 0.98 [CI, 0.95 to 1.02]). No significant reduction in AAA-related mortality was found in 1 study of AAA screening in women. Screening does not appear to be associated with significant physical or psychological harms. Major treatment harms include an operative mortality rate of 2% to 6% and significant risk for major complications.

Limitations

The population screening studies focused on men and provided no information on racial or ethnic groups. No information was available on uninvited control group characteristics, so the importance of risk factors such as tobacco use or family history could not be assessed. Since all trials were conducted in countries other than the United States, generalizability to the U.S. population is uncertain.

Conclusion

For men age 65 to 75 years, an invitation to attend AAA screening reduces AAA-related mortality.

### Epidemiology of age-, sex-, and race-specific hospitalizations for abdominal aortic aneurysms highlights gaps in current screening recommendations [^29f37ac5]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The detection and elective repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) guided by known risk-factor specific screening decrease AAA-related mortality. However, minimal epidemiologic data exist for AAA in female persons and racial minority groups. We established the contemporary risk of US AAA hospitalization across age, sex, and race.

Methods

National Inpatient Sample and US Census (2012–2018) data were used to quantify age-, sex-, and race-specific incidences and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) of AAA hospitalizations (≥ 18 years), associated risk factors, and in-hospital mortality. Interaction terms evaluated subgroups.

Results

Among 1,728,374,183 US residents during the study period (51.3% female; 78.4% White, 12.7% Black, 5.7% Asian), 211,501,703 were hospitalized (aged 57.56 ± 0.04 years; 58.4% female; 64.9% White, 14.3% Black, 2.5% Asian) of which 291,850 were for AAA (aged 73.17 ± 0.04 years; 22.6% female; 81.8% White, 5.6% Black, 1.6% Asian). An estimated 15.2 (95% CI, 15.1–15.3) and 1.7 (95% CI, 1.7–1.7) hospitalizations per 100,000 residents were for intact AAA (iAAA) and ruptured AAA (rAAA) AAA, respectively. In addition, 16.2% of iAAA (83.8% male; 79.1% White) and 18.4% of rAAA (86.4% male; 75.0% White) hospitalizations occurred in patients less than 65 years of age. For iAAA, female sex (aOR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.27–0.28) compared with male sex and both Black (0.47; 95% CI, 0.45–0.49) and Asian (0.86; 95% CI, 0.83–0.93) persons compared with White persons had a reduced aOR for hospitalization. For rAAA, the reduced aOR persisted for female sex (0.33; 95% CI, 0.32–0.36) and for Black persons (0.52; 95% CI, 0.46–0.58). Although female sex demonstrated an overall decreased odds of AAA hospitalization, female persons who were older, Black, or had peripheral vascular disease (P interactions < .001) had a relative increase in AAA hospitalization aOR. Female sex (aOR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.38–1.70), but not Black or Asian race, was associated with increased mortality which was more pronounced for iAAA (1.93; 95% CI, 1.66–2.25) than rAAA (1.29; 95% CI, 1.13–1.48]; P interaction < .001).

Conclusions

We confirmed a substantially decreased adjusted risk of AAA hospitalization for females and racial minority groups; however, aging and comorbid peripheral vascular disease decreased these differences. The disparate risk of AAA hospitalization by sex and race highlights the importance of inclusivity in future AAA studies.

### Abdominal aortic aneurysms in women [^63c88c0c]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) has long been recognized as a condition predominantly affecting males, with sex-associated differences described for almost every aspect of the disease from pathophysiology and epidemiology to morbidity and mortality. Women are generally spared from AAA formation by the immunomodulating effects of estrogen, but once they develop, the natural history of AAAs in women appears to be more aggressive, with more rapid expansion, a higher tendency to rupture at smaller diameters, and higher mortality following rupture. However, simply repairing AAAs at smaller diameters in women is a debatable solution, as even elective endovascular AAA repair is fraught with higher morbidity and mortality in women compared to men. The goal of this review is to summarize what is currently known about the effect of gender on AAA presentation, treatment, and outcomes. Additionally, we aim to review current controversies over screening recommendations and threshold for repair in women.

### Abdominal aortic aneurysm [^944fa37d]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm refers to abdominal aortic dilation of 3.0 cm or greater. The main risk factors are age older than 65 years, male sex, and smoking history. Other risk factors include a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, coronary artery disease, hypertension, peripheral artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction. Diagnosis may be made by physical examination, an incidental finding on imaging, or ultrasonography. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force released updated recommendations for abdominal aortic aneurysm screening in 2014. Men 65 to 75 years of age with a history of smoking should undergo one-time screening with ultrasonography based on evidence that screening will improve abdominal aortic aneurysm-related mortality in this population. Men in this age group without a history of smoking may benefit if they have other risk factors (e.g., family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, other vascular aneurysms, coronary artery disease). There is inconclusive evidence to recommend screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm in women 65 to 75 years of age with a smoking history. Women without a smoking history should not undergo screening because the harms likely outweigh the benefits. Persons who have a stable abdominal aortic aneurysm should undergo regular surveillance or operative intervention depending on aneurysm size. Surgical intervention by open or endovascular repair is the primary option and is typically reserved for aneurysms 5.5 cm in diameter or greater. There are limited options for medical treatment beyond risk factor modification. Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm is a medical emergency presenting with hypotension, shooting abdominal or back pain, and a pulsatile abdominal mass. It is associated with high prehospitalization mortality. Emergent surgical intervention is indicated for a rupture but has a high operative mortality rate.

### Primary care screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm: updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^a0dba6ff]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) have mortality estimated at 81%.

Objective

To systematically review the evidence on benefits and harms of AAA screening and small aneurysm treatment to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, PubMed (publisher supplied only), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for relevant English-language studies published through September 2018. Surveillance continued through July 2019.

Study Selection

Trials of AAA screening benefits and harms; trials and cohort studies of small (3.0–5.4 cm) AAA treatment benefits and harms.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two investigators independently reviewed abstracts and full-text articles and extracted data. The Peto method was used to pool odds ratios (ORs) for AAA-related mortality, rupture, and operations; the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model was used to pool calculated risk ratios for all-cause mortality.

Main Outcomes and Measures

AAA and all-cause mortality; AAA rupture; treatment complications.

Results

Fifty studies (N = 323 279) met inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of population-based randomized clinical trials (RCTs) estimated that a screening invitation to men 65 years or older was associated with a reduction in AAA-related mortality over 12 to 15 years (OR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.57–0.74]; 4 RCTs [n = 124 926]), AAA-related ruptures over 12 to 15 years (OR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.55–0.70]; 4 RCTs [n = 124 929]), and emergency surgical procedures over 4 to 15 years (OR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.48–0.68]; 5 RCTS [n = 175 085]). In contrast, no significant association with all-cause mortality benefit was seen at 12- to 15-year follow-up (relative risk, 0.99 [95% CI 0.98–1.00]; 4 RCTs [n = 124 929]). One-time screening was associated with significantly more procedures over 4 to 15 years in the invited group compared with the control group (OR, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.34–1.55]; 5 RCTs [n = 175 085]). Four trials (n = 3314) of small aneurysm surgical treatment demonstrated no significant difference in AAA-related mortality or all-cause mortality compared with surveillance over 1.7 to 12 years. These 4 early surgery trials showed a substantial increase in procedures in the early surgery group. For small aneurysm treatment, registry data (3 studies [n = 14 424]) showed that women had higher surgical complications and postoperative mortality compared with men.

Conclusions and Relevance

One-time AAA screening in men 65 years or older was associated with decreased AAA-related mortality and rupture rates but was not associated with all-cause mortality benefit. Higher rates of elective surgery but no long-term differences in quality of life resulted from screening.

### Management of abdominal aortic aneurysm disease: similarities and differences among cardiovascular guidelines and NICE guidance [^2390ef26]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

The development of endovascular techniques has improved abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) management over the past 2 decades. Different cardiovascular societies worldwide have recommended the endovascular approach as the standard of care in their currently available guidelines. While endovascular treatment has established its role in daily clinical practice, a new debate has arisen regarding the indications, appropriateness, limitations, and role of open surgery. To inform this debate, the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched from 2010 to May 2020; the systematic search identified 5 articles published between 2011 and 2020 by 4 cardiovascular societies and the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Four debatable domains were assessed and analyzed: diagnostic methods and screening, preoperative management, indications and treatment modalities, and postoperative follow-up and endoleak management. The review addresses controversial proposals as well as widely accepted recommendations and "gray zone" issues that need to be further investigated and analyzed, such as screening in women, medical management, and follow-up imaging. While the recommendations for AAA management have significant overlap and agreement among international cardiovascular societies, the NICE guidelines diverge regarding the role of open repair in aortic disease, recommending conventional surgery in most elective cases.

### An international, expert-based, Delphi consensus document on controversial issues in the management of abdominal aortic aneurysms [^a4244939]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

As a result of conflicting, inadequate or controversial data in the literature, several issues concerning the management of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) remain unanswered. The aim of this international, expert-based Delphi consensus document was to provide some guidance for clinicians on these controversial topics.

Methods

A three-round Delphi consensus document was produced with 44 experts on 6 prespecified topics regarding the management of AAAs. All answers were provided anonymously. The response rate for each round was 100%.

Results

Most participants (42 of 44 [95.4%]) agreed that a minimum case volume per year is essential (or probably essential) for a center to offer open or endovascular AAA repair (EVAR). Furthermore, 33 of 44 (75.0%) believed that AAA screening programs are (probably) still clinically effective and cost effective. Additionally, most panelists (36 of 44 [81.9%]) voted that surveillance after EVAR should be (or should probably be) lifelong. Finally, 35 of 44 participants (79.7%) thought that women smokers should (or should probably/possibly) be considered for screening at 65 years of age, similar to men. No consensus was achieved regarding lowering the threshold for AAA repair and the need for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis in patients undergoing EVAR.

Conclusions

This expert-based Delphi consensus document provides guidance for clinicians regarding specific unresolved issues. Consensus could not be achieved on some topics, highlighting the need for further research in those areas.

### Analysis of the differences between the ESVS 2019 and NICE 2020 guidelines for abdominal aortic aneurysm [^e6e48e30]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim was to understand why two recently published guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2020 guidelines and the European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) 2019 guidelines, have discordant recommendations in several important areas.

Methods

A review of the approach, methodology, and evidence used by the two guideline committees was carried out to understand potential reasons for their differing recommendations in their two final published guidelines.

Results

NICE guidelines use a multidisciplinary committee to address a limited number of prospectively identified questions, using rigorous methods heavily reliant on evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) supported by in house economic modelling, with the purpose of providing the best, cost-effective health care in the UK in 46 main recommendations. The ESVS guidelines use an expert committee to encourage clinical effectiveness across a range of European health economies. ESVS guideline topics, but not questions, are prospectively identified, assessment of evidence was less rigorous, and 125 recommendations were made. More up to date evidence searches by the ESVS committee partially underscore the differences in recommendations for screening women. The NICE committee did not consider sex specific analysis or evidence for thresholds for intervention but relied on sex specific modelling to support their advice to use endovascular repair (EVAR) for ruptures in women. Their recommendation to use open repair for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in men aged < 71 years was based on in house economic modelling. NICE recommends an open first strategy for non-ruptured AAA mainly based on earlier RCTs and UK specific economic modelling, while the ESVS guidelines recommend an EVAR first strategy after consideration of modern, but lower quality, evidence from observational studies. Similar reasons explain differences in the recommended treatments of juxtarenal aneurysms.

Conclusion

Differences between the NICE and ESVS guidelines can be explained, at least in part, by their differing perspectives, methodologies, and quality assurance. Future ESVS guidelines may benefit from more multidisciplinary input and prospectively identified questions.

### Screening and management of abdominal aortic aneurysm… [^06b59e77]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

1 What sets AAA apart from more common causes of death is that it is a preventable problem. Ultrasonographic screening for aortic aneurysms is rapid, accurate, and relatively inexpensive. A single normal ultrasound examination in men 65 years or older virtually excludes future risk of AAA-related death. 2 More than 50 years of experience has shown that open surgical repair nearly eliminates the risk of AAA-related death. 3 A recent meta-analysis 4 found that aneurysm screening reduced AAA-related deaths by 43 percent over four to five years in men 65 years and older. In 2005, the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force issued a recommendation for one-time aneurysm screening for all men 65 years and older who have ever smoked. The significance of these recommendations was underscored by the recent passage of the Screening Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms Very Efficiently Act.

Beginning in January 2007, Medicare will provide coverage to new enrollees for one-time ultrasonography in men with a history of smoking and in men and women 65 to 74 years of age with a family history of AAA. Once an AAA is identified, the question is how to proceed. Periodic surveillance every two to three years is warranted for those with 3. 0- to
3. 9-cm AAAs because they rarely rupture. 6 For 4. 0- to
5. 4-cm AAAs, two clinical trials 7, 8 have demonstrated that immediate surgical repair does not improve overall survival compared with periodic surveillance. Based on these trial outcomes, it is generally safe to refer patients with AAAs of 5. 0 cm or larger. For patients with aortic aneurysms 5. 5 cm or larger in diameter, the risk of rupture increases progressively with size, and mortality with aneurysm rupture is about 80 percent. 9 Elective open surgical repair in those fit for surgery is the accepted standard of care.

Trials are underway in the United States and Europe to examine this question. How will physicians, given what is and is not known about interventions for AAA, provide the patient with informed advice about options. The physician should encourage surveillance when it is prudent. When intervention is indicated, surgical repair is still the standard of care. When advising patients about the option of endovascular repair, long-term outcomes from ongoing clinical trials should provide the best guidance for the appropriate role of this intervention.

### Screening and surveillance for abdominal aortic aneurysms: who needs it and when [^ef7a87ac]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Early detection of abdominal aortic aneurysms potentially can save many lives by preventing aneurysm rupture. Screening programs, however, have yet to be proven as an efficient means of accomplishing this goal and improving overall life expectancy. Until more information is available, selective high-risk screening may be the only viable option. Recently, 2 large prospective studies have better defined the utility of screening programs and have provided guidelines for the safe nonoperative management of small aneurysms. Using ultrasound surveillance, these can be followed up at 3- to 12-month intervals, depending on their size, with operative intervention reserved for aneurysms that enlarge rapidly, become symptomatic, or reach 5.5 cm in diameter.

### Derivation and validation of a 10-year risk score for symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm: cohort study of nearly 500 000 individuals [^d1998dcd]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

An aneurysm is a pathological distension of a section of blood vessel, typically the aorta. – Aortic aneurysms can occur anywhere in the aorta's length, but abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are associated with increased mortality if rupture occurs (around 50% in those who reach the hospital) because of catastrophic bleeding. In the Oxford Vascular Study, among 65- to 74-year-olds, the incidence was 5.5 events per 10 000 person-years in men and 1.1 events per 10 000 person-years in women. Death from AAA accounts for around 2% of all deaths in men aged 65 and over, and few clinical symptoms are noted in AAA that subsequently rupture.

In the United Kingdom, a routine screening program invites men in the year of their 65th birthday for abdominal ultrasonography, and more recent updates suggest women of age 70 years and over be screened if they have risk factors such as ever smoking, or if they have cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral arterial disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, or a family history of AAA. If an AAA of > 5.5 cm diameter is detected, the patient is rapidly referred for surgical intervention, with slower referral for smaller-sized AAA. In 2019, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended screening for AAA in men aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked. The USPSTF recommends against routine screening in women who have never smoked and have no family history of AAA and states that evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against AAA screening in women with either history of smoking or family history of AAA. Although not all international recommendations agree on a precise screening strategy, others are broadly similar. Screening for AAA in women has not been demonstrated to be clinically effective. In considering balancing the risks and benefits of screening, ultrasonography itself has high sensitivity (94%–100%) and specificity (98%–100%) for the detection of AAA, although risk and benefits of surgical intervention for smaller aneurysms must be carefully considered. Although age-based screening thresholds in women may not be cost-effective, a more refined risk score based on systematic routine clinical data may help improve clinical care.

This study aimed to use a large, well-phenotyped United Kingdom database to develop, and internally validate, an AAA risk score using simple clinical data. It was hypothesized that such a risk score could more precisely discriminate those at risk of adverse outcomes from AAA than current approaches.

### Risk factor-targeted abdominal aortic aneurysm screening: systematic review of risk prediction for abdominal aortic aneurysm [^1df92bee]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity. In England and Wales each year, AAA rupture causes over 3000 deaths and more than 7000 patients undergo surgical AAA repair to prevent rupture.

Risk prediction models can be used to calculate the probability that an individual has a certain pathology or disorder; prognostic models work similarly to predict the probability or risk of future occurrence of a particular pathology or outcome. In healthcare, these models often use information about a patient's demographics and associated co-morbidities to calculate the person's risk/prognosis.

Multiple trials have confirmed the long-term effectiveness of screening in reducing the risk of dying from ruptured AAA. In the UK, the NHS AAA screening programme has been established since 2009, offering men in their 65th year a one-off ultrasound examination to screen for AAA. Currently the programme detects an aneurysm in less than 1% of the men screened, and this number is expected to drop further in the future. As disease prevalence falls over time, screening will become less and less cost-effective. Targeted screening has the potential to improve the cost-effectiveness of existing population-based AAA screening programmes. Any targeted screening strategy is likely to be based, at least in part, on AAA risk factors. In the USA, a targeted screening strategy for AAA has been established since 2005. In this programme, men aged 65–75 years who have a history of smoking are recommended for screening with ultrasound imaging.

Electronic healthcare records (EHRs), such as those that exist in primary care or hospitals, offer an opportunity to apply clinical prediction models for screening, based on multiple risk factors (provided that these risk factors are recorded/detected in such records).

The aim of this review was to investigate the current state of risk prediction for AAA in the literature, identifying and comparing published models, and describing their performance and applicability to targeted screening strategies using EHR-based populations.

Importance — definition, prevalence, and rupture risk indicate that an AAA is typically defined as aortic enlargement with a diameter of 3.0 cm or larger; population-based studies in men older than 60 years have found an AAA prevalence ranging from 1.2% to 3.3%; previous prevalence rates of AAA reported in population-based screening studies ranged from 1.6% to 2.7% of the general population 60 to 65 years or older; and although the risk for rupture varies greatly by aneurysm size, the associated risk for death with rupture is as high as 81%.

### Abdominal aortic aneurysm screening practices: impact of the 2014 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations [^adf6c2d0]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess changes in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) ultrasound screening associated with the release of revised U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations on June 24, 2014.

Methods

All AAA screening ultrasound examinations performed in the Massachusetts General Hospital radiology department in the 15 months before and after the new guidelines were retrospectively reviewed to assess changes in examination volume and appropriateness, demographics, aneurysm detection rate and size at diagnosis, frequency and type of incidental findings, and radiologist recommendations. Examinations were considered "definitely appropriate" if meeting USPSTF grade "B" evidence and "possibly appropriate" if meeting grade "C" or "I" evidence, based on available guidelines. Means were compared with the t test.

Results

A total of 831 examinations were reviewed, 417 (50.2%) performed before and 414 (49.8%) after the new guidelines, with overall mean (SD) subject age 67.9 (6.8) years, 89.2% male. Appropriate examinations increased from 289 of 417 (69.3%) to 313 of 414 (75.6%) after the new guidelines (P = 0.04), mostly due to definitely appropriate examinations (253/417 [60.7%] versus 286/414 [69.1%], P = 0.01). Aneurysm detection rates increased from 23 of 417 (5.5%) to 39 of 414 (9.4%), P = 0.03. Mean (SD) aneurysm size (cm) at diagnosis decreased from 3.8 (0.7) to 3.3 (0.6), P = 0.01. Examination volume, demographics, and rates of incidentals and recommendations remained similar. Incidentals arose in 15.4% of all examinations, often iliac artery aneurysms or renal masses. Recommendations were made in 5.1%, mostly for cross-sectional imaging.

Conclusions

The revised USPSTF guidelines have been associated with increased AAA screening appropriateness and aneurysm detection in our practice, with smaller aneurysm size at diagnosis.

### Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms in outpatient primary care clinics [^de205a3c]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines recommend one-time abdominal aortic aneurysm ultrasound screening for men aged 65 to 75 years who ever smoked. Reported screening rates have been 13% to 26% but did not include computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and nonaortic abdominal ultrasound, which provide adequate visualization of the aorta. The objective of this study was to evaluate rates of screening performed intentionally with ultrasound and incidentally with other abdominal imaging, determine rates of redundant screening, and evaluate patient and physician characteristics associated with screening.

Methods

Cross-sectional study of patient encounters in 2007 and 2012 to determine abdominal aortic aneurysm screening trends in primary care practices. Participants included all patients who were seen in a primary care office and were eligible for screening by USPSTF guidelines. The primary outcome was percentage of eligible patients screened for abdominal aortic aneurysm by ultrasound or other abdominal imaging.

Results

There were 15,120 patients eligible for screening in 2007, and 22,355 in 2012. Screening with ultrasounds increased from 3.6% in 2007 to 9.2% in 2012. Screening with any imaging that included the aorta increased from 31% in 2007 to 41% in 2012. Of 2595 screening ultrasounds performed in either cohort, 800 (31%) were performed on patients who had already undergone another imaging modality. Of 153 physicians who had > 50 eligible patients, rates of abdominal aortic aneurysm screening ranged from 7.5% to 79% (median 39%, interquartile range 31%-47%), and rates of ultrasound screening ranged from 0% to 47% (median 6.3%, interquartile range 3.6%-11.4%). Physician characteristics positively associated with screened patients included female sex (odds ratio [OR] 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12–1.54), specialty (Internal Medicine vs Family Medicine: OR 1.32; 95% CI, 1.14–1.54), and location (academic medical center vs family health center: OR 1.30; 95% CI, 1.04–1.62).

Conclusions

Abdominal aortic aneurysm screening rates remain below 50%, but are improving over time. Screening by individual physicians varied widely, indicating substantial opportunity for educational interventions. Most abdominal aortic aneurysm screening is completed incidentally, and some patients later undergo unnecessary ultrasound screening. Before ordering screening, physicians and electronic health record-based reminder tools should ensure that the aorta has not been previously visualized.

### Abdominal aortic aneurysm screening: how many life years lost from underuse of the Medicare screening benefit? [^d6eb9308]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Since 2007, Medicare has provided one-time abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening for men with smoking history, and men and women with a family history of AAA as part of its Welcome to Medicare visit.

Objective

We examined utilization of the new AAA screening benefit and estimated how increased utilization could influence population health as measured by life years gained. Additionally, we explored the impact of expanding screening to women with smoking history.

Design

Analysis of Medicare claims and a simulation model to estimate the effects of screening, using published data for parameter estimates.

Setting

AAA screening in the primary care setting.

Patients

Newly-enrolled Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years, with smoking history or family history of AAA.

Main Measures

Life expectancy, 10-year survival rates.

Key Results

Medicare data revealed low utilization of AAA screening, under 1% among those eligible. We estimate that screening could increase life expectancy per individual invited to screening for men with smoking history (0.11 years), with family history of AAA (0.17 years), and women with family history (0.08 years), and smoking history (0.09 years). Average gains of 131 life years per 1,000 persons screened for AAA compare favorably with the grade B United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation for breast cancer screening, which yields 95–128 life years per 1,000 women screened. These findings were robust over a range of scenarios.

Limitations

The simulation results reflect assumptions regarding AAA prevalence, treatment, and outcomes in specific populations based on published research and US survey data. Published data on women were limited.

Conclusions

The Welcome to Medicare and AAA screening benefits have been underutilized. Increasing utilization of AAA screening would yield substantial gains in life expectancy. Expanding screening to women with smoking history also has the potential for substantial health benefits.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaPulsatile abdominal mass suspected abdominal aortic Aneurysm [^096fcca7]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical palpation of a pulsating abdominal mass alerts the clinician to the presence of a possible abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Imaging studies are important in diagnosing and categorizing the extent of the aneurysm and may aid in treatment planning. The consensus of the literature supports the use of ultrasound as the initial screening test in patients with suspected AAA. Population-based ultrasound screening studies have been recommended and have proved effective for male patients > 65 years of age. For diagnosis and pre-intervention evaluation, either multidetector CT or CT angiography is the optimal choice for detailed characterization of the aneurysm. MR angiography may be substituted if CT cannot be performed (for example, because the patient is allergic to iodinated contrast material). Invasive angiography has little role in the diagnosis of AAA and PET and CT remain experimental in patients with suspected aneurysms. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### A further meta-analysis of population-based screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm [^4b8495e0]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

It remains unclear whether population-based screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in men reduces all-cause long-term mortality. We performed an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of AAA screening for prevention of long-term mortality in men.

Methods

To identify all randomized controlled trials of population-based AAA screening with long-term (≥ 10 year) follow-up in men, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched through June 2009. Data regarding AAA-related and all-cause mortality (including Cox regression hazard ratios [HRs] and 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were abstracted from each individual study. For each study, data regarding mortality in both the screening and control groups were used to generate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. Study-specific estimates were combined using inverse variance-weighted averages of logarithmic ORs or HRs (or risk ratios where no HR was reported) in both fixed- and random-effects models.

Results

Our search identified four randomized controlled trials of population-based AAA screening with long-term follow-up in men aged ≥ 65 years. Pooled analysis demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in AAA-related mortality (random-effects OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.86; P = 0.008; P for heterogeneity = .01; absolute risk reduction [ARR], 4 per 1000; number needed to screen [NNS], 238; random-effects HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.86; P = 0.009; P for heterogeneity = .009) and revealed a statistically nonsignificant reduction (but a strong trend toward a significant reduction) in all-cause mortality (fixed-effects OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.00 [1.001]; P = 0.06; P for heterogeneity = .93; ARR, 5 per 1000; NNS, 217; fixed-effects HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.00 [1.0001]; P ≥ .05 [P = 0.052]; P for heterogeneity = .74) with AAA screening relative to control.

Conclusion

The results of our analysis suggest that population-based screening for AAA reduces AAA-related long-term mortality by 4 per 1000 over control in men aged ≥ 65 years. Whereas, screening for AAA shows a strong trend toward a significant reduction in all-cause long-term mortality by 5 per 1000, which does not narrowly reach statistical significance.

### Abdominal aortic aneurysm – to screen or not to screen [^692f9262]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

With the ten WHO criteria for a screening program to be started, screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm is analyzed. Most of the criteria are fulfilled concerning the 65-year old male population, whereas concerning females we need more knowledge. Still the aneurysmal diameter is the most important factor to select patients for treatment meaning that many aneurysms are treated where rupture should never have occurred. Research projects giving more information on pathophysiological processes behind expansion and rupture should have priority.

### Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of polygenic risk score-stratified screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm [^f4ce1958]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an enlargement of the abdominal aorta to greater than 3 cm diameter. To promote early detection and management of AAA (which reduces the likelihood of fatal aortic ruptures), authorities in the UK, Sweden, and Oslo, Norway, offer screening to all men aged 65. By contrast, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends a one-off screening with ultrasound scan (USS) in men aged 65–75 who have ever smoked and recommends selective screening based on clinical judgement in men who have never smoked. However, despite the introduction of such screening programmes, ruptured AAA continues to be a significant source of morbidity and mortality, exemplified by AAA's contribution to around 0.8% of deaths in men aged 65 and older and 0.4% in women aged 65 and older in England and Wales.

Rupture of AAAs occurs primarily in people not captured by current screening programmes. They include, for example women, men under 65, men invited to screening at 65 but who did not attend, and men with a normal aortic ultrasound scan at age 65 but who develop an AAA later in life. A small number of ruptures also occur in screen-detected AAAseither prior to reaching the threshold for elective intervention, whilst waiting for this intervention, or after being declared unfit for intervention. However, the prevalence of AAA is falling over time. For example, less than 1% of men screened as part of the UK National Health Service (NHS) abdominal aortic aneurysm screening programme (NAAASP) in 2021 were observed to have an AAA. By contrast, the prevalence of AAA was 4.9% in the UK Multicentre Aneurysm Screening Study (MASS), carried out in 1997–9. This temporal decline in the population burden of AAA suggests that the cost-effectiveness of AAA screening may also be changing, encouraging consideration and evaluation of more targeted screening approaches. The USPSTF has, for example, highlighted that research is needed to define the benefits of screening in particular subgroups, suggesting that a stratified approach may have net benefit over current strategies. One potential subgroup is current cigarette smokers, for whom a strong association with AAAhas been reported (7-fold increase in risk in men, and 15-fold in women).

### Meta-analysis of the current prevalence of screen-detected abdominal aortic aneurysm in women [^5b9b006a]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The data for the contemporary prevalence of AAA in women should be considered in the context of the ongoing debate about whether AAAs in women are diagnosed and treated adequately. If AAA screening in 65‐year‐old men is cost‐effective down to a prevalence rate as low as 0·35 per cent 39, AAA screening also may be cost‐effective in 70‐year‐old women, especially as the AAA rupture rate in women is about four times that in men for a given AAA diameter 40. Indeed, a modelling study from Sweden 41 has already suggested that AAA screening for older women would be cost‐effective, based on an AAA prevalence of 1·1 per cent in 65‐year‐old women.

Present guidelines for AAA screening in women are only that it is not recommended for older women who have never smoked 37. This contemporary review, showing a pooled prevalence of 0·74 per cent in women aged at least 60 years, rising to over 1·0 per cent in ever smokers and those aged 70 years or older, might stimulate the debate about offering targeted AAA screening to older women.

AAA screening tests — accuracy and modality: The primary method of screening for AAA is conventional abdominal duplex ultrasonography, which "is noninvasive, is simple to perform, has high sensitivity (94%-100%) and specificity (98%-100%) for detecting AAA, and does not expose patients to radiation." Computed tomography is accurate for identifying AAA but "is not recommended as a screening method because of the potential for harms from radiation exposure." Physical examination has "low sensitivity (39%-68%) and specificity (75%) and is not recommended for screening."

Introduction

Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm in men over 65 years of age has been recommended on the basis of several randomised controlled trials and meta-analyses. These studies have shown that a single screening examination using ultrasound with follow-up intervention as appropriate can reduce aneurysm related mortality, with benefits extending to at least 10 years. Screening has been shown to be cost effectiveand has already been, or is being, introduced in the United Kingdom. Patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm, however, have also been shown to have an increased mortality from other vascular disease, which in some part may be responsible for the failure of screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm to reduce all cause mortality in most studies.

Most screening protocols use a threshold aortic diameter of 30 mm. Men with an aorta at or above this diameter are entered into a follow-up programme and those below are reassured and no follow-up planned. Among those without an aneurysm, however, there is some evidence of a possible association between aortic diameter and mortality, raising the possibility of a significantly increased risk among those whose aortic diameter is just below the threshold for aneurysm.

We used record linkage to investigate the health outcomes of a group of 8146 men who attended the Highland aortic aneurysm screening programme between 2001 and 2004 and were followed until mid 2010, and to determine how these outcomes related to aortic diameter. We examined morbidity and mortality for men who had an aortic aneurysm (aortic diameter ≥ 30 mm), and those who had an ectatic aorta (25–29 mm) compared with those whose aorta was ≤ 24 mm at initial screening.

Discussion

The benefit of inviting men aged 65–74 to screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm continues at about the same rate 7–10 years after screening, as observed in previous years. The reduction in number of deaths related to abdominal aortic aneurysm in MASS is estimated as 42% at four years,47% at seven years, and now 48% at 10 years. This is surprising as it might be expected that ruptures of the aneurysm in those originally screened as normal and incidental detection of abdominal aortic aneurysm in the control group would erode the benefit over time. Being based on a population based sample of UK men, these figures correspond to the expected benefit that will derive from the UK national screening programme. About 1900 deaths each year, half of the deaths related to abdominal aortic aneurysm that occur in men aged 65 or more in the UK, should be prevented in due course by the screening programme. Such a programme will never prevent all ruptures but to optimise performance our results show that emphasis should be placed on achieving a high initial attendance rate and good adherence to clinical follow-up, preventing delays in undertaking surgery, and maintaining a low operative mortality after elective surgery. More evidence may be needed to choose the best intervals between recall scans, for different sizes of aneurysm less than 5.5 cm; any strategy needs to balance the effectiveness in preventing ruptures while under surveillance against the costs.

A crucial problem is the extent to which those screened as normal will go on to develop an aneurysm that ruptures and whether rescreening of participants after a normal scan is justified at any stage. We observed a noticeable increase in ruptures after eight years of follow-up; although most were fatal, the absolute numbers remained small. For example, 15 fatal ruptures occurred during years 8–10; over the same period there was an overall reduction of 40 deaths related to abdominal aortic aneurysm in the group invited to screening compared with the control group. Hence the deaths due to rupture after a normal scan seem not to have impacted yet on the diverging curves from deaths related to abdominal aortic aneurysm shown in figure 1. Recommending rescreening those with an initial normal scan would only become justified in subsequent years if future analyses show that there is a further noticeable increase in ruptures in this group that is not sufficiently offset by the reduction in number of deaths related to abdominal aortic aneurysm for those with an aneurysm detected (or rendered unimportant by the overall toll of mortality from all causes).

Small abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) management — Four trials evaluated early surgical intervention compared with surveillance of smaller aneurysms (4.5–5.4 cm in diameter), and two good-quality open repair trials (n = 2226) and 2 fair-quality EVAR trials (n = 1088) showed no differences in all-cause and AAA-related mortality. However, there was a reduction in rupture rate with early open surgery compared with surveillance for small AAAs, and seven pharmacotherapy RCTs (n = 1953) showed no significant effect on AAA growth compared with placebo.

Background

Decision-making related to the care of patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is complex. Aneurysms present with varying risks of rupture, and patient-specific factors influence anticipated life expectancy, operative risk, and need to intervene. Careful attention to the choice of operative strategy along with optimal treatment of medical comorbidities is critical to achieving excellent outcomes. Moreover, appropriate postoperative surveillance is necessary to minimize subsequent aneurysm-related death or morbidity.

Methods

The committee made specific practice recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. Three systematic reviews were conducted to support this guideline. Two focused on evaluating the best modalities and optimal frequency for surveillance after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). A third focused on identifying the best available evidence on the diagnosis and management of AAA. Specific areas of focus included (1) general approach to the patient, (2) treatment of the patient with an AAA, (3) anesthetic considerations and perioperative management, (4) postoperative and long-term management, and (5) cost and economic considerations.

Results

Along with providing guidance regarding the management of patients throughout the continuum of care, we have revised a number of prior recommendations and addressed a number of new areas of significance. New guidelines are provided for the surveillance of patients with an AAA, including recommended surveillance imaging at 12-month intervals for patients with an AAA of 4.0 to 4.9 cm in diameter. We recommend endovascular repair as the preferred method of treatment for ruptured aneurysms. Incorporating knowledge gained through the Vascular Quality Initiative and other regional quality collaboratives, we suggest that the Vascular Quality Initiative mortality risk score be used for mutual decision-making with patients considering aneurysm repair. We also suggest that elective EVAR be limited to hospitals with a documented mortality and conversion rate to open surgical repair of 2% or less and that perform at least 10 EVAR cases each year. We also suggest that elective open aneurysm repair be limited to hospitals with a documented mortality of 5% or less and that perform at least 10 open aortic operations of any type each year. To encourage the development of effective systems of care that would lead to improved outcomes for those patients undergoing emergent repair, we suggest a door-to-intervention time of < 90 minutes, based on a framework of 30-30-30 minutes, for the management of the patient with a ruptured aneurysm. We recommend treatment of type I and III endoleaks as well as of type II endoleaks with aneurysm expansion but recommend continued surveillance of type II endoleaks not associated with aneurysm expansion. Whereas antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for patients with an aortic prosthesis before any dental procedure involving the manipulation of the gingival or periapical region of teeth or perforation of the oral mucosa, antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended before respiratory tract procedures, gastrointestinal or genitourinary procedures, and dermatologic or musculoskeletal procedures unless the potential for infection exists or the patient is immunocompromised. Increased utilization of color duplex ultrasound is suggested for postoperative surveillance after EVAR in the absence of endoleak or aneurysm expansion.

Conclusions

Important new recommendations are provided for the care of patients with an AAA, including suggestions to improve mutual decision-making between the treating physician and the patients and their families as well as a number of new strategies to enhance perioperative outcomes for patients undergoing elective and emergent repair. Areas of uncertainty are highlighted that would benefit from further investigation in addition to existing limitations in diagnostic tests, pharmacologic agents, intraoperative tools, and devices.

### Risk factor-targeted abdominal aortic aneurysm screening: systematic review of risk prediction for abdominal aortic aneurysm [^af2398ed]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

A systematic literature review was undertaken in accordance with the PRISMA statement. Before conducting the review, a protocol was developed and registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023395635).

With the aid of a clinical librarian, the following databases were searched for all relevant studies published before the search date (13 February 2024): MEDLINE (via Ovid), Embase (via Ovid), MedRxiv, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. The search strategy combined search terms used for the pathology 'abdominal aortic aneurysm' with the type of intervention 'risk prediction model' and appropriate combinations of Boolean operators 'AND', 'OR', and 'NOT'; the full search strategy is available in the supplementary material.

Studies were eligible and included if they complied with the following criteria: article includes a risk prediction model that predicts the presence of an AAA; the prediction model is reported in full (in order that it can be replicated); the model was developed on a cohort or study group derived from the general population; and the model used multiple variables with at least one modifiable risk factor. Conference abstracts, editorials, case reports, and commentaries were excluded.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening context — family history, sex/age considerations, and repeat screening: The "lifetime prevalence of AAA is estimated to be 32% in brothers of those with AAA," and "Select women may be at risk for AAA and related complications." "Select patients < 65 years of age may be at increased risk of AAA rupture," but "in patients < 65 years, data are lacking on the mortality benefit of AAA screening." "Some patients may develop AAA after the age of 75 years even if they had an initial negative screen between the ages of 65 and 75 years," yet "data from cohort studies suggest long-term AAA-related mortality is low among patients with an initial negative screening ultrasound who had a subsequent AAA detected on repeat screening after the age of 75 years." For borderline enlargement with risk factors, selected low-surgical-risk patients "may be considered for repeat screening on an individualized basis."

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening evidence and risk factors — In randomized trials of men ≥ 65 years of age, screening reduced long-term AAA-related mortality (4 RCTs: OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.57–0.74) and AAA-related ruptures (4 RCTs: OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.55–0.70) over 12 to 15 years, and a population-based study reported that two-thirds of the acute AAA events occurred in those ≥ 75 years of age; consequently, screening to elderly patients should be offered, provided they would benefit from potential aortic repair. Family history markedly elevates risk: among relatives of those with AAA, ultrasound screening has identified an overall prevalence of new AAA of 10% to 20%, with the highest prevalence of 25% found among brothers, and the overall lifetime prevalence of AAA is estimated to be 32% in brothers of those with AAA. In women, smoking was associated with a 15-fold increased risk of AAA (relative risk, 15.0; 95% CI, 13.2–17.0) versus 7-fold among men (relative risk, 7.3). Table 15 lists strong risk factors (smoking history, older age, male sex, family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm) and additional risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, white race, inherited vascular connective tissue disorder, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease).

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening — supportive evidence and definitions — Smoking history is defined as lifetime use of ≥ 100 cigarettes, with risk attributable to smoking varying by exposure and lower risk in those with lower versus higher pack-year history. Based on a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials inclusive of nearly 125 000 mostly male patients, screening of men ≥ 65 years of age reduced long-term AAA-related mortality (4 RCTs: OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.57–0.74) and AAA-related ruptures (4 RCTs; OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.55–0.70) over 12 to 15 years. In a population-based study in the United Kingdom, two-thirds of the acute AAA events occurred in those ≥ 75 years of age; consequently, screening to elderly patients should be offered, provided they would benefit from potential aortic repair. Having a first-degree relative with AAA is a well-known and well-established risk factor for development of AAA, and small cohort studies of ultrasound screening in relatives have identified an overall prevalence of new AAA of 10% to 20%, with the highest prevalence of 25% found among brothers.
