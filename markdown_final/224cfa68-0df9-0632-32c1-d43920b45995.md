## Question

An archer needs to practice. He intends to shoot 200 shots 4 days a week. He is able to recover 20% of his arrows. The arrows he uses cost $5.5 per arrow. His team agrees to pay for 70% of the cost of his arrows. How much does he spend for arrows a week?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how much an archer spends per week on arrows, given his practice volume, arrow recovery rate, cost per arrow, and the team's contribution. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the total number of arrows shot per week. Then, I should verify how many arrows are lost versus recovered. Next, I will calculate the total cost of arrows consumed. After that, I need to determine the archer's share after the team pays 70%. Finally, I will double-check the arithmetic and present the answer clearly.

> Let me first confirm the weekly arrow usage. He shoots 200 shots per day, 4 days a week, so 200 × 4 equals 800 arrows per week. Wait, let me verify that multiplication: 200 × 4 is indeed 800, so the gross weekly usage is 800 arrows.

> Next, I should review recovery. He recovers 20% of his arrows, which means 80% are lost. So, arrows lost per week are 800 × 0.80, which equals 640 arrows. Hold on, I should double-check that: 800 × 0.8 is 640, correct.

> Now, I will calculate the total cost of arrows consumed. Each arrow costs $5.50, so 640 lost arrows × $5.50 equals $3,520 per week. Hmm, wait a minute, that seems high for a weekly expense; let me reconsider the context and the numbers. Yes, 640 × 5.5 is indeed 3,520, so the total weekly cost of lost arrows is $3,520.

> I need to determine the archer's out-of-pocket share. The team pays 70%, so the archer pays 30%. Therefore, the archer's weekly cost is $3,520 × 0.30, which equals $1,056. Let me verify that calculation: 3,520 × 0.3 is 1,056, correct.

> Final answer: The archer spends $1,056 per week on arrows after accounting for recovery and the team's contribution.

The archer shoots **200 arrows per day, 4 days a week**, totaling 800 arrows weekly. With a **20% recovery rate**, 160 arrows are reused, so 640 arrows are lost each week. At $5.50 per arrow, the total cost is $3,520 per week, and the team covers 70% ($2,464), leaving the archer to pay **$1,056 per week**.

---

## Step-by-step calculation

| **Step** | **Description** | **Calculation** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Total arrows shot per week | 200 arrows/day × 4 days/week = 800 arrows/week |
| 2 | Arrows recovered (20%) | 800 arrows × 0.20 = 160 arrows/week |
| 3 | Arrows lost (not recovered) | 800 arrows − 160 arrows = 640 arrows/week |
| 4 | Total cost of arrows lost | 640 arrows × $5.50/arrow = $3,520/week |
| 5 | Team's contribution (70%) | $3,520 × 0.70 = $2,464/week |
| 6 | Archer's out-of-pocket cost | $3,520 − $2,464 = $1,056/week |

---

The archer spends **$1,056 per week** on arrows after accounting for recovery and the team's contribution.

Methods

Participants

Participants were 15 male volunteer archers with at least 4 years of training experience, who compete at the National Teams (age = 20.5 ± 1.9 years, height = 177.9 ± 6.5 cm, bodyweight = 78.3 ± 10.6 kg). They were not taking any medication similar to BBs and were also not consuming any medication that might affect BBs' absorption or metabolism. Participants were asked not to consume alcohol, caffeine and caffeinated drinks during the testing period. Informed consent was obtained.

The study design comprised a randomised four-trial, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Each archer had to compete four times during the study (control, bisoprolol (β1), propranolol (β1, β2) and placebo). Control shots were performed 24 hours before the substance or placebo was given. There were 7 days in between testing days to allow washout of the substances.

The experiments were carried out in an indoor hall to provide standard ambient conditions. Archers were invited to the hall at 0900 hour on the testing days and requested to prepare as in a normal competition. On arrival, the archers resting HR (RHR) values was determined in lying and standing positions by telemetric HR monitors (Polar RS800 Finland). After determining RHR, on separate occasions, archers performed either control shots or were given an oral dose of either bisoprolol 5 mg (β1), propranolol 40 mg (β1, β2) or placebo in a randomised fashion. Two hours after the BBs or placebo administration, archers performed 30 shots (3 arrows and 10 sets in 2 min, which is the official competition time). After the shots, archers waited for another 2 hours and then their RHR was measured again and performed another 30 shots as in the previous trial. For all conditions, data was collected 2 and 4 hours after BBs and placebo intake to ensure peak blood levels following the specifications of each drug (for bisoprolol 2 hours, for propanolol 4 hours). During the shots, the mechanical data related with the CoP and aim point fluctuation (APF) were recorded on a computer at 0.3 s before arrow release.

Figure 3
Run chart showing the median for the daily mean vaccination lead time (the mean time from precheck-in to vaccination) before and after implementation of bundle of improvements (arrow).

Vaccinations began on 5 April and occurred each Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday for 10 hours. For the first week, all vaccinations were prescheduled by online appointments, allowing an accurate estimate of the vaccine demand for each day. As the appointments began to decrease, we also accepted walk-ins, 150–200/day. Our highest vaccine demand occurred during the 1st week and consisted of 5000 appointments/day (online supplemental table S2). To meet the demand of 5000 vaccinations over 10 hours, we calculated that the maximum time for each vaccination needed to be 7.2 s (36 000 s/5000 = 7.2 s). Our time observation sheet (online supplemental figure S3) revealed the time required for one vaccinator to complete one injection varied from 73 s to 138 s (mean: 97 s). To meet the 5000 vaccines in 10-hour demand, we calculated that we would need between 10 vaccinators and 19 vaccinators (73/7.2 = 10.1; 138/7.2 = 19.1). To assure we had an adequate number of vaccinators, we chose to recruit 20 vaccinators per session and set as their goal to inject one person every 144 s or 25 vaccinees/hour. To assure smooth work flow, all other steps needed to take no longer than 144 s and as shown on the time observation sheet (online supplemental figure S3) and value stream map (figure 2): this condition was met.

### Population-level predictors of changes in success rates of smoking quit attempts in england: a time series analysis [^c81677da]. Addiction (2020). Medium credibility.

To assess expenditure on smoking, current smokers were asked: 'On average about how much per week do you think you spend on cigarettes or tobacco?' and to report the number of cigarettes they smoked per day (including hand‐rolled). Smokers' average expenditure of smoking (in £/week) was derived from the following liberal assumptions for upper and lower estimates of plausible levels of consumption and expenditure per week: (1) smokers smoke a maximum of 560 cigarettes per week; (2) spending does not exceed £280 per week; and (3) single cigarettes expenditure between £0.05 and £1 52. Expenditure of smoking was adjusted for inflation using Consumer Prices Index (CPI) of all items from the Office for National Statistics.

Monthly tobacco mass media expenditure (in million £) was obtained from Public Health England. Total spending on campaigns was calculated for each month and included spending on 'Smokefree' campaigns, Stoptober campaigns and Health Harms campaigns. Spend included TV, radio, print, cinema and on‐line advertisements.

The following tobacco control policies were assessed using a temporary pulse effect (i.e. an effect lasting only for the month in which the policy was implemented), in which a dummy variable was coded 0 before and after the policy was introduced and 1 during the month the policy was introduced: (1) the introduction of a smoking ban in July 2007 36; (2) change in the minimum age of sale of cigarettes in October 2007 37; (3) pictorial health warnings on product packaging introduced in October 2008 38; (4) licensing of NRT for harm reduction in December 2009 40; (5) point‐of‐sale display ban introduced in England in April 2012 39; (6) the move in commissioning of stop smoking services to local authorities in April 2013 41; and (7) the publication of NICE guidance on harm reduction in June 2013 42.

### The 'vicious circle' of sports injuries: an analysis of 165 athletics (track and field) athletes over a 39-week follow-up using Markov chains [^0ac926e1]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

For the second objective, we considered the four states (H, IF, IP, IN) separately without accounting for the number of ICPRs sustained. There was, thus, a total of 16 transitions (figure 1B).

To construct the Markov chain of each objective, we used each athlete's week-by-week injury status encoded either in two states (objective 1) or four states (objective 2) (figure 2A). We defined the transitions from any one state to any other (figure 2B), and we counted the number of transitions from any one state to any other (figure 2C). If some transitions were never observed for one athlete, their count was 0. Then, we added the counts of each transition observed by all athletes (figure 2D). Finally, for each transition, we divided its count by the sum of those transitions that had the same starting state with that transition (figure 2E). This was equivalent to the probability of that transition. This process would produce a transition matrix with values corresponding to the transition probabilities from one state to another (figure 2E), which could be graphically represented with nodes as states and arrows as transitions (figure 2F).

Figure 2
Step-by-step example of creating a two-state Markov chain model using fictitious weekly injury data from a group of athletes. (A) The athletes' raw data of timelines shows the injury status (healthy 'h' or injured 'i'). (B) Transform of the timelines to transitions between injury states (eg, from healthy to injured: h→ i = 'hi') of consecutive time points. (C) Each timeline of transitions is summarised in a transition matrix showing how many times each transition was observed (frequency). (D) The individual transition matrices are summed (cell-by-cell), creating the overall transition matrix of frequencies. (E) By dividing each cell of the frequency matrix with the sum of observations in each row (ie, how many transitions shared the same starting state), the probability matrix is created, showing the probability of transitioning to an ending state given a starting state. (F) The Markov chain can be visualised by plotting the states as nodes in a graph, interconnected by arrows indicating the probability of transitioning from the start of the arrow to the end.

### Sedentary behaviors, light-intensity physical activity, and healthy aging [^1b51bb09]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods

The protocol for this cohort was approved by the institutional review boards of the Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Participants provided implied consent by returning the questionnaires. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

Study Participants

The NHS was established in 1976, and information on lifestyle and health outcomes has been updated biennially. For this analysis, study baseline was defined as 1992, when information on time spent on SBs was first collected. Participants aged 50 years or older and free of major chronic diseases were potentially eligible and followed aup for 20 years, when all participants could potentially reach age 70 years (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1). We excluded individuals with missing information on time sitting watching television, implausible values on exposure variables, or missing assessment of healthy aging, leaving 45 176 women in the final analysis. Participants with missing healthy aging status did not differ substantially from those with this information (eTable 1 in Supplement 1).

Assessment of Behaviors

We included 3 SBs, 2 LPAs, MVPA, and sleep duration (eFigure 2 in Supplement 1). Of these, we considered time spent sitting watching television as our primary exposure, because among the various surrogates for SB, time spent television watching is most strongly associated with adverse health outcomes. This variable was assessed by the question "On average, how many HOURS PER WEEK do you spend: sitting at home while watching TV [television] /VCR [videocassette recorder]?" SB-Work was assessed by "On average, how many HOURS PER WEEK do you spend: sitting at work or away from home or while driving", which mainly reflect time spent sitting at work. SB-Home was assessed by "On average, how many HOURS PER WEEK do you spend: other sitting at home (e.g. reading, meal times, at desk)?" which does not include television watching. LPA-Work was assessed by "On average, how many HOURS PER WEEK do you spend: standing or walking around at work or away from home?" mainly reflecting occupational activity. LPA-Home was assessed by "On average, how many HOURS PER WEEK do you spend: standing or walking around at home?" typically reflecting household work. The 9 possible responses for each behavior ranged from 0 hours per week to more than 90 hours per week.

14.2 Pediatric Subjects

ARROW (COL105677) was a 5-year, randomized, multicenter trial which evaluated multiple aspects of clinical management of HIV-1 infection in pediatric subjects. HIV-1–infected, treatment-naïve subjects aged 3 months to 17 years were enrolled and treated with a first-line regimen containing abacavir and lamivudine, dosed twice daily according to World Health Organization recommendations. After a minimum of 36 weeks of treatment, subjects were given the option to participate in Randomization 3 of the ARROW trial, comparing the safety and efficacy of once-daily dosing with twice-daily dosing of abacavir and lamivudine, in combination with a third antiretroviral drug, for an additional 96 weeks. Virologic suppression was not a requirement for participation at baseline for Randomization 3. At baseline for Randomization 3 (following a minimum of 36 weeks of twice-daily treatment), 75% of subjects in the twice-daily cohort were virologically suppressed, compared with 71% of subjects in the once-daily cohort.

Of the 1,206 original ARROW subjects, 669 participated in Randomization 3. Subjects randomized to receive once-daily dosing (n = 336) and who weighed at least 25 kg received abacavir 600 mg and lamivudine 300 mg, as either the single entities or as abacavir and lamivudine.

The proportions of subjects with HIV-1 RNA less than 80 copies per mL through 96 weeks are shown in Table 5. The differences between virologic responses in the two treatment arms were comparable across baseline characteristics for gender and age.

aAnalyses were based on the last observed viral load data within the Week 96 window.

bRisk difference (95% CI) of response rate is -2.4% (-9% to 5%) at Week 96.

cIncludes subjects who discontinued due to lack or loss of efficacy or for reasons other than an adverse event or death, and had a viral load value of greater than or equal to 80 copies per mL, or subjects who had a switch in background regimen that was not permitted by the protocol.

dOther includes reasons such as withdrew consent, loss to follow-up, etc. and the last available HIV-1 RNA less than 80 copies per mL (or missing).

### Smoking prevalence following the announcement of tobacco tax increases in england between 2007 and 2019: an interrupted time-series analysis [^597acecc]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Per‐capita self‐reported cigarette consumption

Smokers were asked on average how many cigarettes they smoked per day. The per‐capita consumption per day was then calculated as the summation of cigarettes smoked per day (which was set to zero for all non‐current smokers, i.e. non‐smokers and ex‐smokers) divided by the entire population. Consumption within the population rather than among smokers was used to reflect quitting, i.e. a reduction may reflect an increase in recent ex‐smokers without a change in consumption by continuing smokers.

The mean per‐capita consumption was calculated separately per day for (i) FM cigarettes and (ii) RYO cigarettes. FM conusmption was calculated as the summation of cigarettes smoked per day among those exclusively smoking FM cigarettes divided by cigarette consumption for the entire population, which was set to 0 for all non‐current exclusive FM cigarette smokers; RYO consumption was calculated as the summation of cigarettes smoked per day among those exclusively smoking RYO cigarettes divided by cigarette consumption for the entire population, which was set to 0 for all non‐current exclusive RYO cigarette smokers.

Cost per cigarette (£)

To assess self‐reported cost per cigarette, current smokers were asked: 'On average about how much per week do you think you spend on cigarettes or tobacco?' and the number of cigarettes they smoked per week was calculated (including hand‐rolled). Smokers' average expenditure of smoking (in £/week) was derived from the following liberal assumptions for upper and lower estimates of plausible levels of consumption and expenditure per week: (1) consumption of a maximum of 560 cigarettes per week; (2) spending does not exceed £280 per week; and (3) single cigarette expenditure between £0.05 and £1. The cost of smoking was adjusted for inflation using Consumer Prices Index data of all items from the Office for National Statistics, with January 2007 as the baseline/reference. The total cost per week was divided by the total number of cigarettes smoked per week to give an estimate of cost per cigarette. Cost per cigarette (£) was derived separately for those exclusively smoking FM cigarettes and those exclusively smoking RYO cigarettes. Cost per cigarette was stratified in this way as any associations between tax increases and cigarette cost may be diluted by smokers switching between FM and RYO cigarettes, depending on the nature of the tax increase.

Clinical Endpoint Trial

ACTG300 was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial that provided for comparison of lamivudine plus RETROVIR (zidovudine) with didanosine monotherapy. A total of 471 symptomatic, HIV-1-infected therapy-naive (less than or equal to 56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric subjects were enrolled in these 2 treatment arms. The median age was 2.7 years (range: 6 weeks to 14 years), 58% were female, and 86% were non-white. The mean baseline CD4+ cell count was 868 cells per mm3(mean: 1,060 cells per mm3and range: 0 to 4,650 cells per mm3for subjects aged less than or equal to 5 years; mean: 419 cells per mm3and range: 0 to 1,555 cells per mm3for subjects aged over 5 years) and the mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 5.0 log10copies per mL. The median duration on trial was 10.1 months for the subjects receiving lamivudine tablets plus RETROVIR and 9.2 months for subjects receiving didanosine monotherapy. Results are summarized in Table 11.

### Long-term evaluation of the rise in legal age-of-sale of cigarettes from 16 to 18 in england: a trend analysis [^d9f43f6a]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Finally, sensitivity analyses adjusted for self-reported average weekly spend on tobacco. To assess expenditure on smoking, current smokers were asked: 'On average about how much per week do you think you spend on cigarettes or tobacco?' and to report the number of cigarettes they smoke per day. Smokers' average cost of smoking (in £/week) was derived from the following liberal assumptions for upper estimates of plausible levels of consumption and expenditure per week: (1) smokers smoke a maximum of 560 cigarettes per week, (2) spending does not exceed £280 per week, and (3) single cigarettes cost between £0.05 and £1.

These covariates were chosen a priori and included in the pre-registered analysis plan. Decisions were based on previous research showing their association with smoking uptake and quitting activity. For example, the introduction of a ban in enclosed public spaces in July 2007 was found to be associated with a temporary increase in the percentage of smokers attempting to stop, while pictorial health warnings on product packaging introduced in October 2008 have been found to promote smoking cessation and may reduce uptake. An evaluation of the partial (i.e. supermarket) tobacco point-of-sale display ban introduced in England in April 2012 found evidence for a decline in smoking prevalence. Licencing of nicotine replacement therapy for use in harm reduction, and higher expenditure on tobacco control mass media have been found to be associated with the success of quit attempts. Time series analyses have also shown that cuts on tobacco mass media expenditure have been associated with a reduction in use of smoking cessation support. Smoking prevalence is highest among those from disadvantaged backgrounds, and these smokers appear less likely to succeed in qutting than those from more advantaged groups. There are also gender differences in smoking, with men tending to use tobacco products at higher rates than women. Finally, tax increases over the study period have resulted in the rise in cost of smoking, and although smokers often adjust their behaviour to account for these, tax increases have been shown to be a cost-effective intervention for reducing smoking prevalence by promoting quitting and reducing uptake.

### Physical activity and exercise during pregnancy and the postpartum period: ACOG committee opinion, number 804 [^7aa306cd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Recommended weight limits for lifting at work during pregnancy — an on-page algorithm and stepwise method describe how to determine a recommended weight limit (RWL). The algorithm asks, "At work do you perform lifting tasks more than once every 5 minutes?" and, if yes, "Do you lift more than three times per minute?", then queries "How many hours per day do you spend lifting at work?" with categories "Less than 1 continuous hour" or "1 or more hours per day", corresponding to infrequent, repetitive short duration, or repetitive long duration lifting panels.

### Opportunities for improving the efficiency of paediatric HIV treatment programmes [^6a84a72c]. AIDS (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To conduct two economic analyses addressing whether to: routinely monitor HIV-infected children on antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinically or with laboratory tests; continue or stop cotrimoxazole prophylaxis when children become stabilized on ART.

Design and Methods

The ARROW randomized trial investigated alternative strategies to deliver paediatric ART and cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in 1206 Ugandan/Zimbabwean children. Incremental cost-effectiveness and value of implementation analyses were undertaken. Scenario analyses investigated whether laboratory monitoring (CD4 tests for efficacy monitoring; haematology/biochemistry for toxicity) could be tailored and targeted to be delivered cost-effectively. Cotrimoxazole use was examined in malaria-endemic and non-endemic settings.

Results

Using all trial data, clinical monitoring delivered similar health outcomes to routine laboratory monitoring, but at a reduced cost, so was cost-effective. Continuing cotrimoxazole improved health outcomes at reduced costs. Restricting routine CD4 monitoring to after 52 weeks following ART initiation and removing toxicity testing was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $6084 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) across all age groups, but was much lower for older children (12+ years at initiation; incremental cost-effectiveness ratio = $769/QALY). Committing resources to improve cotrimoxazole implementation appears cost-effective. A healthcare system that could pay $600/QALY should be willing to spend up to $12.0 per patient-year to ensure continued provision of cotrimoxazole.

Conclusion

Clinically driven monitoring of ART is cost-effective in most circumstances. Routine laboratory monitoring is generally not cost-effective at current prices, except possibly CD4 testing amongst adolescents initiating ART. Committing resources to ensure continued provision of cotrimoxazole in health facilities is more likely to represent an efficient use of resources.

### How much time do physicians spend providing care outside of office visits? [^3a852539]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

People with chronic illness require care outside of office visits, much of which is not reimbursed under current Medicare guidelines.

Objective

To describe the amount of time geriatricians spend and the nature of care they provide outside of office visits.

Design

Cross-sectional study on the time spent by physicians in clinical interactions outside of patient visits during 3 randomly sampled, 1-week periods.

Setting

An academic geriatric medicine ambulatory practice.

Participants

16 physicians.

Measurements

Information on the method, content, outcome, and participants in clinical interactions outside of office visits was collected on a structured form.

Results

There were 472 discrete interactions, representing 296 episodes of care for 226 patients. Fifty-four percent of interactions were linked as multistep episodes, whose mean duration (range; 25th, 75th percentiles) was 18.9 minutes (3 to 70 minutes; 9, 21 minutes). Thirty-six percent of episodes involving a new medical symptom resulted in medication use, 27% resulted in an office visit, and 9% resulted in a referral to another physician. Mean time spent per physician per week was 112.2 minutes (range, 36 to 260 minutes), which represents an additional 6.7 minutes (range, 1.7 to 13.8) of care provided outside of office visits for every 30 minutes of time spent scheduled to see ambulatory patients. For a full-time physician scheduled to see 14 patients per day in 30-minute visits over a 5-day workweek, this would represent an extra 7.8 hours of clinical work per week.

Limitation

Data were self-reported and were limited to an academic geriatric medicine practice.

Conclusion

Physicians spend a considerable amount of time providing care outside of office visits for patients with chronic illness. This study suggests that collecting empirical data on the amount and nature of nonreimbursed care activities is feasible and should be done in more generalizable settings to inform debates about reimbursement reform.

### Lamivudine (Epivir) [^a4148b16]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

14.2 Pediatric Subjects

Clinical Endpoint Trial

ACTG300 was a multicenter, randomized, double‑blind trial that provided for comparison of EPIVIR plus RETROVIR (zidovudine) with didanosine monotherapy. A total of 471 symptomatic, HIV-1–infected therapy-naive (less than or equal to 56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric subjects were enrolled in these 2 treatment arms. The median age was 2.7 years (range: 6 weeks to 14 years), 58% were female, and 86% were non-white. The mean baseline CD4+ cell count was 868 cells per mm3(mean: 1,060 cells per mm3and range: 0 to 4,650 cells per mm3for subjects aged less than or equal to 5 years; mean: 419 cells per mm3and range: 0 to 1,555 cells per mm3for subjects aged over 5 years) and the mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 5.0 log10copies per mL. The median duration on trial was 10.1 months for the subjects receiving EPIVIR plus RETROVIR and 9.2 months for subjects receiving didanosine monotherapy. Results are summarized in Table 11.

Once-Daily Dosing

ARROW (COL105677) was a 5-year randomized, multicenter trial which evaluated multiple aspects of clinical management of HIV-1 infection in pediatric subjects. HIV-1–infected, treatment-naïve subjects aged 3 months to 17 years were enrolled and treated with a first-line regimen containing EPIVIR and abacavir, dosed twice daily according to World Health Organization recommendations. After a minimum of 36 weeks on treatment, subjects were given the option to participate in Randomization 3 of the ARROW trial, comparing the safety and efficacy of once-daily dosing with twice-daily dosing of EPIVIR and abacavir, in combination with a third antiretroviral drug, for an additional 96 weeks. Of the 1,206 original ARROW subjects, 669 participated in Randomization 3. Virologic suppression was not a requirement for participation: at baseline for Randomization 3 (following a minimum of 36 weeks of twice-daily treatment), 75% of subjects in the twice-daily cohort were virologically suppressed, compared with 71% of subjects in the once-daily cohort.

### Association of prevalence of electronic cigarette use with smoking cessation and cigarette consumption in england: a time-series analysis between 2006 and 2017 [^2ea6f5d1]. Addiction (2020). Medium credibility.

The affordability index was derived using a formula and data published by the Office for National Statistics 14:

The adjusted real households' disposable income index is an index of total households' income, minus payments of income tax and other taxes, etc. per capita. The tobacco price index shows how much the average price of tobacco has changed compared with the price in the base year (set at 1987), while the retail price index shows by how much the prices of all items have changed compared with the price in the base year.

We replaced the tobacco price index with a weekly tobacco expenditure index derived from the STS 14, 18. Expenditure on smoking among current smokers was assessed by asking: 'On average about how much per week do you think you spend on cigarettes or tobacco?', and to report the number of cigarettes they smoked per day. Smokers' average cost of smoking (in £/week) was derived from the following liberal assumptions for upper and lower estimates of plausible levels of consumption and expenditure per week: (1) smokers smoke a maximum of 560 cigarettes per week; (2) spending does not exceed £280 per week and (3) single cigarettes cost between £0.05 and £1 27. We also used a quarterly rather than yearly retail price index (adopted by the Office for National Statistics) and disposable income index, and changed the base year from 1987 to January 2007 as the start of our time–series analysis. Thus, an affordability index greater than 100 in a given quarter signifies that cigarettes were more affordable than in the first quarter of 2007.

### Nutrition and physical activity: an Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) clinical practice statement 2022 [^5a4b7ac6]. Obesity Pillars (2022). High credibility.

Steps and energy expenditure categorization — In terms of number of steps taken, < 5,000 steps per day is considered sedentary, 5,000–7,500 steps per day is low active, 7,500–10,000 steps per day is somewhat active, and ~10,000 steps or more per day is active. Although variable, one Calorie (kcal) is "burned" for every 20 steps (i.e., 4,000 steps/200 Calories), and 10,000 steps per day x 7 days per week x one Calorie per 20 steps = 3500 Calories burned per week; the adage of "3500 Calories per pound of fat" is an approximation, and the amount of physical activity required to "burn 3500 Calories" depends on body weight and related efficiencies.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^19d38640]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Exercise and physical activity — behavioral and activity targets for ASCVD prevention state that adults should be routinely counseled in healthcare visits to optimize a physically active lifestyle, and adults should engage in at least 150 minutes per week of accumulated moderate-intensity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity (or an equivalent combination of moderate and vigorous activity) to reduce ASCVD risk. For adults unable to meet the minimum physical activity recommendations (at least 150 minutes per week of accumulated moderate-intensity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity), engaging in some moderate- or vigorous-intensity physical activity, even if less than this recommended amount, can be beneficial to reduce ASCVD risk. Decreasing sedentary behavior in adults may be reasonable to reduce ASCVD risk, sedentary behavior refers to waking behavior with an energy expenditure of ≤ 1.5 metabolic equivalents while in a sitting or reclining posture, and US adults spend > 7 h/d on average in sedentary activities.

### Multiple lifestyle factors and depressed mood: a cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of the UK biobank (N = 84, 860) [^dc9ffa23]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Sedentary screen time

Sedentary screen time is calculated in hours per week, adding together the participants' answers to the questions 'In a typical DAY, how many hours do you spend watching TV?' (FC: 1070) and 'In a typical DAY, how many hours do you spend using a computer? (not including time using a computer at work)' (FC: 1080).

Alcohol frequency

Alcohol frequency is categorised as 6 = 'daily', 5 = 'three to four times per week', 4 = 'once or twice per week', 3 = 'one to three times per month', 2 = 'special occasions only', or 1 = 'never' using participant response to the question 'About how often do you drink alcohol?' (FC: 1558). For the purposes of this study, this ordinal variable was treated as linear, so that results can be interpreted as a dose-response relationship.

Depressive mood assessment

Frequency of depressed mood were assessed over the last 2 weeks, with the following question of a computerised questionnaire administered at the baseline visit:

' Over the past two weeks, how often have you felt down, depressed or hopeless?' (FC: 2050).

And this similarly worded question, assessing the same construct of frequency of depressed mood, at follow-up (administered via an online survey):

'Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by any of the following problems? Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless' (FC: 20510).

With participants responding as 'Prefer not to Answer', 'Not at all', 'Several days', 'More than half of days', and 'Nearly every day' in both cases.

The answers were assigned scores of missing for 'prefer not to answer' then 1, 2, 3, or 4, respectively, for frequency of depressed mood, and used as an ordinal measure.

### How to measure monetary losses in gambling disorder? An evidence-based refinement [^59904617]. Psychiatry Research (2018). Low credibility.

2.2.2 Monetary variables

We evaluated 3 primary measures: 1) money lost last year in gambling (in US$). Money lost (expenditure) was defined as the total amount of money spent on gambling and was assessed in terms of net expenditure i.e. [money available at the beginning of the session] plus [subsequent withdrawals or borrowing] less [money available and the end of the session]. This approach to monetary losses in GD is arguably considered the most appropriate; 2) personal annual income last year in US$ (including income from formal work and additional earning such as investments); and 3) gambling frequency in gambling episodes per week. A gambling episode was defined as a session of bets without significant interruption by other activities such as: a) work; b) going home; c) interactions with others not associated with gambling; d) other activities. For example, three separated visits to the casino over the course of one day would count as 3 gambling episodes.

Using these values, we calculated the following final absolute and relative (percentage of income) monetary variables. The variables computed were: a) average monthly monetary losses in gambling (money lost last year in gambling/12); b) average money lost per gambling episode (money lost last year/[gambling frequency in times per week × 52.2]). Note that 52.2 is the average number of weeks in a year; c) average percentage of monthly income lost in gambling ([money lost last year/12]/[income last year/12]); and d) percentage of income lost per gambling episode ({money lost last year/[gambling frequency in times per week × 52.2]}/income last year).

2.2.3 Primary form of gambling

Physical activity

MVPA was measured by the following questions in the EBRB-questionnaire: "On how many days during the last week did you (parent) spend MVPA for a total of at least 30 min per day?" and "On how many days during the last week did your child spend in MVPA for a total of at least 1 h per day?". This question was asked separately for weekdays and weekend days (ICC range 0.37–0.70). To assess the percentage of children and parents meeting the WHO Europe PA guidelines, the number of days meeting the PA guidelines on weekdays and weekend days were summed. The levels of PA in a whole week were dichotomized into not meeting the WHO guideline (< 7 days a week for children and < 5 days a week for parents) and meeting the guideline (7 days a week for children and ≥ 5 days a week for parents).

The proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA of less than 80 copies per mL through 96 weeks is shown in Table 12. The differences between virologic responses in the two treatment arms were comparable across baseline characteristics for gender and age.

Table 12. Virologic Outcome of Randomized Treatment at Week 96 (ARROW Randomization 3)

aAnalyses were based on the last observed viral load data within the Week 96 window.

bPredicted difference (95% CI) of response rate is -4.5% (-11% to 2%) at Week 96.

cIncludes subjects who discontinued due to lack or loss of efficacy or for reasons other than an adverse event or death, and had a viral load value of greater than or equal to 80 copies per mL, or subjects who had a switch in background regimen that was not permitted by the protocol.

dOther includes reasons such as withdrew consent, loss to follow-up, etc. and the last available HIV-1 RNA less than 80 copies per mL (or missing).

Analyses by formulation demonstrated the proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA of less than 80 copies per mL at randomization and Week 96 was higher in subjects who had received tablet formulations of lamivudine and abacavir (75% [458/610] and 72% [434/601]) than in those who had received solution formulation(s) (with lamivudine solution given at weight band-based doses approximating 8 mg per kg per day) at any time (52% [29/56] and 54% [30/56]), respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. These differences were observed in each different age group evaluated.

### Expenditure on smoking and alternative nicotine delivery products: a population survey in england [^2c6643d5]. Addiction (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The expense associated with using non-combustible nicotine products as an alternative to smoking may deter smoking reduction or cessation. This study aimed to estimate (i) how much adults in England spend each week on smoking and alternative nicotine products and (ii) the potential cost saving that could be achieved by switching from smoking to using an alternative nicotine delivery product.

Design and Setting

Data came from September to November 2018 waves of the Smoking Toolkit Study, a series of national household surveys of the adult population in England.

Participants

A total of 859 adults (aged ≥ 16 years) who reported current smoking or current use of an alternative nicotine product.

Measurements

Participants reported their average weekly expenditure on smoking and alternative nicotine products [nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or e-cigarettes].

Findings

Current smokers who did not use any alternative nicotine delivery products (n = 602) reported spending on average £23.09 [95% confidence interval (CI) = £21.64–24.54] on smoking each week. Ex-smokers who used alternative nicotine products (n = 91) reported spending on average £8.59 (95% CI = £6.80–10.39) on these products each week; £8.03 (95% CI = £6.03–10.03) on e-cigarettes and £10.05 (95% CI = £5.62–14.47) on NRT. People who both smoked and used alternative nicotine products (dual users, n = 166) spent on average £24.54 (95% CI = £21.78–27.29) on smoking and £7.49 (95% CI = £6.00–8.99) on alternative nicotine products each week. Expenditure on smoking was higher among heavier, more addicted smokers and lower among those with routine/manual occupations, non-daily smokers and roll-your-own tobacco users. Expenditure on e-cigarettes was higher among men, users from central and southern versus northern England and smokers who had tried to quit in the past year, and lower among current smokers. Expenditure on NRT was lower among roll-your-own tobacco users.

Conclusions

In England, expenditure among e-cigarette and nicotine replacement therapy users is approximately one-third of the expenditure of smokers. The average smoker may save an estimated £15.06 per week by switching completely to e-cigarettes or £13.04 per week by switching to nicotine replacement therapy, although this is likely to differ according to individual usage patterns.

SMART goal-setting for lifestyle change — The figure presents examples and guidance to make goals specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. For specificity, it prompts clinicians to ask, "ASK What do you want to do? How are you going to do it?" and to "USE Action verbs like I will walk, I will eat or I will quit", while avoiding "AVOID Lofty and vague goals that promise too much too fast". For measurability, it advises "What metrics will you use? How will you keep track of your progress?" and supports "Measuring tools based on patient preference such as logging with pen and paper, wearable devices, or pedometer", while avoiding "Excessive pressure to track multiple times a day, complicated measuring programs requiring lots of time". For achievability, it cautions against "Goals that are too easy and goals that are too hard". For relevance, it asks "How does this goal connect to your priorities, your purpose, and your personal mission?" and includes "Open ended questions to explore what matters to the patient and how the goal is connected to that" and "Determining what is relevant to the patient. Let the patient decide". For time-boundedness, it highlights "A sense of excitement and urgency about the goal and set the expectation that there will be more time for weekly goals".

### A survey of locus-specific database curation. human genome variation society [^d63ebb40]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2007). Low credibility.

It is widely accepted that curation of variation in genes is best performed by experts in those genes and their variation. However, obtaining funding for such variation is difficult even though up-to-date lists of variations in genes are essential for optimum delivery of genetic healthcare and for medical research. This study was undertaken to gather information on gene-specific databases (locus-specific databases) in an effort to understand their functioning, funding and needs. A questionnaire was sent to 125 curators and we received 47 responses. Individuals performed curation of up to 69 genes. The time curators spent curating was extremely variable. This ranged from 0 h per week up to 5 curators spending over 4 h per week. The funding required ranged from US$600 to US$45,000 per year. Most databases were stimulated by the Human Genome Organization-Mutation Database Initiative and used their guidelines. Many databases reported unpublished mutations, with all but one respondent reporting errors in the literature. Of the 13 who reported hit rates, 9 reported over 52,000 hits per year. On the basis of this, five recommendations were made to improve the curation of variation information, particularly that of mutations causing single-gene disorder: 1. A curator for each gene, who is an expert in it, should be identified or nominated. 2. Curation at a minimum of 2 h per week at US$2000 per gene per year should be encouraged. 3. Guidelines and custom software use should be encouraged to facilitate easy setup and curation. 4. Hits per week on the website should be recorded to allow the importance of the site to be illustrated for grant-giving purposes. 5. Published protocols should be followed in the establishment of locus-specific databases.

### Sedentary behavior and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality: a science advisory from the American Heart Association [^e032e667]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Sedentary behavior prevalence — adults shows rising sedentary occupations and substantial daily sedentary time: sedentary occupations constituted ≈15% of US jobs in 1960, increasing to > 20% by 2008; average sedentary time rose from 26 hours per week in 1965 to 38 hours in 2009 in the United States and from 30 hours per week in 1960 to 42 hours per week in 2005 in the United Kingdom. On the basis of objective accelerometer measurements, adults spend an average of 6 to 8 hours per day in sedentary time and adults > 60 years average 8.5 to 9.6 hours per day, with NHANES indicating stability from 2003–2004 to 2005–2006. Across activity strata, those with more moderate-to-vigorous physical activity had similar sedentary time to less active peers (mean sedentary time 472 minutes per day vs 489 minutes per day [7.9 hours per day versus 8.2 hours per day]). Sex patterns differed by age in 2003 to 2004 NHANES, where women < 60 years were more sedentary than men, but after age 60, men were more sedentary. Self-report estimates vary widely, ranging from 2 to 8 hours per day, including 7.8 hours per day among civil service employees in Northern Ireland and ≈5 hours per day across 49 493 adults in 20 countries using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire.

### Is the price right? Paying for value today to get more value tomorrow [^5204208e]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Consider that when some medications are prescribed and adhered to, healthcare spending declines by lowering emergency admissions. Eleven such medications reduce emergency admissions by hundreds of thousands annually. These drugs essentially displace a non-genericizable service with a genericizable medicine, a logical way to save money in the long run, and yet, if one only scrutinizes the drug's temporary branded cost without considering the alternative of forever relying on emergency department services to manage patients, society could easily end up misallocating resources away from developing such a medicine. Reasons for not performing value assessments on hospital procedures may include a lack of randomized controlled trial data which are important inputs into cost-effectiveness analyses. However, this and other reasons are not insurmountable, and real-world data can provide important information on the effectiveness of an intervention potentially through time series analyses if comparators are not obvious. Comprehending the potential cost-effectiveness of all varieties of healthcare interventions is paramount for enhancing the efficiency of healthcare systems and optimizing the health of populations.

### Improved glycemic control using a bluetooth ®-connected blood glucose meter and a mobile diabetes app: real-world evidence from over 144 000 people with diabetes [^d6758d47]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2024). Medium credibility.

Effect of Time Spent Using the OneTouch Reveal App on Glycemic Control

Significant reductions in mean BG were observed in PwT1D spending five to 10 minutes per week on the OTR app (−10.7 mg/dL) over 180 days, with the highest reduction in those spending between 40 and 60 minutes per week (−17.5 mg/dL). Clinically meaningful improvements in RIR were seen in PwT1D spending over 10 to 20 minutes on the app (+7.0 percentage points), and this increased to +9.7 percentage points in those spending up to 60 minutes per week. Improvements in RIR were mirrored by similar reductions in proportion of hyperglycemic readings in PwT1D, with clinically significant reductions in hyperglycemic readings observed in those spending up to 20 minutes on the app (−7.7 percentage points), increasing to −10.0 percentage points in those engaging with the app for up to 60 minutes per week. (Table 3A). In the larger dataset of 97 119 PwT2D, there were greater improvements in mean BG, RIR and reductions in hyperglycemic readings than for PwT1D. People with type 2 diabetes who spent up to 10 minutes per week on the OTR app improved mean BG (−18.0 mg/dL) and RIR (+10.9 percentage points) and had concomitant reductions in hyperglycemic readings of −11.1 percentage points (Table 3B). In keeping with the data on app sessions per week, monitoring frequency was significantly higher in both PwT1D (4.5 vs 3.4 checks per week) and PwT2D (2.8 vs 2.3 checks per week) comparing those spending the most to the least time on the app per week. However, similar to what was seen with categories of sessions on the app per week, monitoring frequency remained largely unchanged within each category of time spent on the app from baseline to 180 days, again suggesting that monitoring frequency does not explain the glycemic improvements seen.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness analysis perspectives — Table 1 delineates cost components and examples by perspective (Health Care Sector, "Modified Societal", Full Societal). Components and examples include health care costs paid by third-party payers (drug/device costs, hospital services, physician services, home care services, allied health), costs paid out-of-pocket by patients (drug copayment/coinsurance and user fees), patient-time costs (time spent seeking care), unpaid caregiver-time costs (time spent in caregiving), and productivity losses (formal/informal labor earnings lost, cost of unpaid lost productivity due to illness, cost of uncompensated household production). Broader sectors listed include social services, housing, legal or criminal justice, education, and environmental. Footnotes instruct that analysts should attempt to capture all relevant costs from a societal perspective and describe a "modified" societal perspective that includes some societal costs, such as patient time and lost productivity, but excludes costs from other sectors of the economy.

### Hourly step recommendations to achieve daily goals for working and older adults [^878e0045]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Two-part model (zero-step counts part and positive-step counts part)

We stratified the hourly step count data into weekdays and weekends (Figs. 2 and 3). Many hours of inactivity resulted in a high proportion of zeroes (46.8% including sleeping hours). Thus, for each hour, we fitted a two-part model to the step count data. The zero-step counts part of the model was specified as a binary logistic regression model to estimate the probability of a participant having any positive step counts. The positive-step counts part of the model was specified as a gamma regression model with a log link function to accommodate the positive support and right skew observed in the data.

Sedentary behavior is defined as waking behavior with energy expenditure ≤ 1.5 METs while sitting, reclining, or lying; light activity corresponds to 1.6–2.9 METs, moderate to 3.0–5.9 METs, and vigorous to ≥ 6 METs. These intensities are illustrated with example activities in the accompanying table and legend noting that MET indicates metabolic equivalent (MET).

Cost-effectiveness plane (Figure 1) — when a new intervention produces less health and lower costs compared with the comparator, it may be considered cost-effective if the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is greater than the cost-effectiveness threshold; however, this situation does not arise often because patients, clinicians, and health systems rarely accept worse health outcomes even if it reduces spending, and the figure includes labels "Intervention is cost-saving ("dominant") or always acceptable" and "Intervention is inferior ("dominated") or never acceptable".

Input Data

For this international, population-based modeling approach, we included patient-based direct and indirect cost data, country-level economic indicators, cutaneous melanoma incidence rates per country, and population per country numbers (Figure 1). We obtained databases on a total of 50 072 patients from sources outlined in eTables 1 to 3 in Supplement 1. Our input data included patients with melanoma with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage information for the direct treatment costs calculation from the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland, from 2017 to 2020, and the Veneto Region in Italy from 2016. Further, we included data on melanoma incidence from the Swiss National Cancer Registry from 2013 to 2015, from Hungary from 2019, from National Health Service England from 2015 to 2017, and from Public Health Wales from 2016 to 2017. Indirect treatment costs and melanoma numbers were collected from the Belgian Cancer Registry from 2009 to 2011. We included patients aged 18 years and older with invasive primary cutaneous melanomas stages I to IV, according to the AJCC seventh and eighth editions, including melanomas of unknown primary (T0). Additional information is provided in eTable 1 and eTable 4 in Supplement 1.

### Hourly step recommendations to achieve daily goals for working and older adults [^588d8957]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 3 shows the predicted mean step counts and 95% CI for the rest of the day, given the step counts accumulated from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. adjusting for age group, BMI group and sex. Overall, there was little difference in the conditional predicted mean step counts for the rest of the days between the weekdays and the weekends. On weekdays, participants who accumulated 6000 steps by 6 p.m. had a 0.692 probability of achieving 10,000 steps (all the goals) by the end of the day (refer to the Goal 3 diagonal line in Fig. 3, Table 3, and Supplementary Table S2). Similarly, participants who had accumulated 7000 steps by 7 p.m. 8000 steps by 8 p.m. 8500 steps by 9 p.m. and 9500 steps by 10 p.m. achieved 10,000 mean steps by the end of the day with a probability of 0.910, 0.982, 0.700, and 1, respectively. On weekends, participants who had accumulated 6500 steps by 6 p.m. 7000 steps by 7 p.m. 8000 steps by 8 p.m. 8500 steps by 9 p.m. and 9500 steps by 10 p.m. achieved 10,000 mean steps by the end of the day with probability 0.852, 0.583, 0.947, 0.717 and 1, respectively. The step counts required to achieve 5000 and 7500 steps by the end of the day can be found in Supplementary Tables S3 and S4, respectively.

The posterior sample size is 20,000. Further details are provided in the Supplementary Method. The bars denote the 95% CIs, and the dots denote the mean. The means and the 95% CIs were plotted assuming the participant had accumulated total step counts in intervals of 500 steps at the start of the hour from 0 to 12,500 steps (x -axis). The daily step goals (diagonal lines) were 5000, 7500, and 10,000 steps.

For the first half of the day (12 a.m. to 12 p.m.), the logistic and gamma regression covariates were dummy variables for age group, BMI group and sex, as these covariates were associated with physical activity.

Accounting for the financial incentive structure of NSC3, the daily step goals were 5000, 7500, and 10,000 steps, which earned participants 10, 25, and 40 HealthPoints, respectively (Supplementary Table S1). For the second half of the day (12 p.m. to 12 a.m.), we defined four disjoint intervals: (i) 0–4999 steps, (ii) 5000–7499 steps, (iii) 7500–9999 steps, and (iv)10,000 steps. The model was stratified into the above four disjoint intervals based on the sum of the step counts up to the previous hour. The logistic and gamma regression covariates were age, BMI, sex, and the sum of step counts up to the previous hour divided by 10,000. This scaling ensured that the variable was equal to one when participants had just completed all their daily step goals. A value that exceeded one meant that the participant exceeded the daily 10,000-step goal. Furthermore, the scaling ensured that the prior was uninformative.

ACC/AHA cost/value methodology — societal perspective highlights that all costs for a medical intervention or program should be counted regardless of payer, and shifting costs between stakeholders does not save money, so all costs should be included. Specifically, costs "should be counted, regardless of who pays for them (ie, a 'societal perspective')", and shifting costs "does not save money; it merely redistributes it", thus "all costs should be included, irrespective of who pays for them".

### Are sunscreens luxury products? [^b6984ad5]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of skin cancers is rapidly increasing in Western countries. One of the main sun-protection measures advocated is application of sunscreen. Some studies report a failure to comply with sunscreen application guidance. One explanation is their cost.

Objective

To evaluate the true cost of sunscreen in two situations: a 4-member family spending 1 week at the beach and a transplant patient respecting all the sun protection recommendations.

Methods

We performed an analysis of prices of sunscreens sold via Internet drugstores in Europe and North America. Standard sunscreen application recommendations were followed. We tested the recommended amount of sunscreen to be applied (ie, 2 mg/cm²).

Results

Six hundred seven sunscreens from 17 drugstores in 7 countries were evaluated. Median price of sunscreen was $1.7 US per 10 grams. The price decreased with the size of the bottle. The median price for a family varied from $178.2 per week to $238.4 per week. The price decreased by 33% if the family wore UV-protective T-shirts and by 41% if large-volume bottles were used. The median price for a transplant patient varied from $245.3 per year to $292.3 per year.

Limitations

Anti-UVA activity and topical properties were not evaluated. We tested the recommended amount (2 mg/cm²) rather than the amount actually used (1 mg/cm²).

Conclusion

Under acute sun exposure conditions (a week at the beach), the cost of sun protection appears acceptable if sun protective clothing is worn and large-format bottles and low-cost sunscreens are used. Conversely, in a sun-sensitive population requiring year-round protection, the annual budget is relatively high and patients may require financial assistance to be compliant with sun protection guidelines.

ACC/AHA cost/value methodology — initial and subsequent costs and time horizon states that analyses "should include both initial and subsequent costs of a given care program", the overall net cost of an intervention may be lower or "pay for itself" if it prevents future events, whereas an initially low-cost decision can incur substantial overall costs; therefore, the time horizon "must be of sufficient duration" and for chronic diseases guidelines "recommend a life-long time horizon".

Table 1 — cost-effectiveness analysis perspectives delineate cost components by perspective: Health care costs paid by third-party payers and costs paid out-of-pocket by patients are included across Health Care Sector, "Modified Societal", and Full Societal; patient-time costs, unpaid caregiver-time costs, transportation costs, and productivity are included under "Modified Societal" and "Full Societal"; and cross-sector items such as social services, housing, legal or criminal justice, education, and environmental are included only under Full Societal. The footnote adds that analysts "should attempt to capture all relevant costs from a societal perspective", that a "'modified' societal perspective includes some societal costs, such as patient time and lost productivity, but excludes costs from other sectors of the economy", and that "An Impact Inventory can aid in communicating and discussing these limitations".

### A retrospective impact analysis of the wannaCry cyberattack on the NHS [^e17f2148]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The attack also affected outpatient services. During the WannaCry week, infected trusts had on average 50% more cancellations than non-infected trusts per day (59.7 cancellations, 95% confidence interval 41.4 to 78.0). This resulted in 55 fewer outpatient attendances per day at infected trusts, but this was not precisely estimated (−140 to 30.2).

Mortality

Across all trusts, compared to the baseline week, there was no significant difference in the number of deaths in A&E. There was also no significant difference in deaths in A&E between infected and non-infected trust (0 deaths (−0.1 to 0.1).

Financial impact

The total economic value of the lower activity at the infected trusts during the WannaCry week was £5.9 m (95% confidence interval £3.6 m to £8.2 m), including £4 m (£1.5 m to £6.6 m) in lost inpatient admissions, £0.6 m (£0.4 m to £0.8 m) from lost A&E activity, and £1.3 m (£0.9 m to £1.7 m) from cancelled outpatient appointments (Table 3). Assuming that all trusts had been infected by WannaCry and affected to the same extend as the actually infected trusts, the total value of lost activity could have amounted to £35 m (£21.2 m to £48.8 m) in activity alone.

Leisure PA includes light physical activity (LPA), moderate physical activity (MPA), and vigorous physical activity (VPA) done during leisure time. The total number of hours of LPA in the past week is based on responses to two questions in the PASE assessment tool — "How many days in the past seven days have you engaged in the following light physical activities? For example, yoga, watering flowers, hiking, etc.?" and "On average, how many hours per day do you spend engaged in LPA? Multiply the average number of hours of LPA per day by the corresponding number of days to calculate the total number of hours of LPA for the last week.

The total number of hours of MPA in the past week is based on responses to two questions in the PASE assessment tool — "How many days in the past seven days have you engaged in the following moderate physical activities? For example, aerobics, Tai Chi, table tennis, etc.?" and "On average, how many hours per day do you spend engaged in MPA? Multiply the average number of hours of moderate physical activity per day by the corresponding number of days to calculate the total number of hours of MPA for the last week.

The total number of hours of VPA in the past week is based on responses to two questions in the PASE assessment tool — "How many days in the past seven days have you engaged in the following vigorous physical activities? For example, tennis, soccer, rope skipping, etc.?" and "On average, how many hours per day do you spend engaged in VPA? Multiply the average number of hours of VPA per day by the corresponding number of days to calculate the total number of hours of VPA for the last week.

### Life-space and movement behavior in nursing home residents: results of a new sensor-based assessment and associated factors [^497f4aa9]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Fig. 1
Overview of one nursing home including the division of life-space into four hierarchical zones. Hierarchical zones are delineated as concentric circles as defined by Tinetti & Ginter (1990). Black dots indicate positions of wireless receivers of the measurement system, encasing the whole building; Zone 1 (green) stands for the private room; Zone 2 (blue) stands for the whole living unit in which the private room is located; Zone 3 (orange) stands for the public area outside the living unit but within the facility; Zone 4 (red) delineates the whole area outside the facility. Arrows point out passages between zones. Zone 1 (exemplary private room) is bordered with a black frame. The dining area within Zone 2 is marked with a "D" and bordered with another black frame

After the system components had been installed in the nursing homes, the network's connectivity was tested and warranted before measurement started. During the first four measurement days, a Fraunhofer technician monitored communication between sensors using maintenance software that could immediately identify technical problems or failure of single sensors. Due to network capacities, a maximum of 22 participants at a time were equipped with sensors for two consecutive days; the average of both days was used for the analyses. Residents were visited on normal weekdays and equipped with one end node each morning as soon as they left their private room and entered the public dining room. They kept the end node until they returned to their private room in the evening after dinner. To achieve comparability between subjects, LS data were analyzed for each participant from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (hereafter referred to as "daytime").

Several steps were taken to control for actual end node wearing time. During measurement, participants were visited every two to three hours to ensure adherence to measurement protocol. In addition, nursing staff were asked to immediately report on lost/found end nodes in order to follow up on reasons for loss or to continue measurement if appropriate. If position reports of end nodes were not received steadily according to maintenance software, end nodes were immediately checked. If participants had not worn end nodes constantly during measurement, they were excluded from analysis. In case of occasional gaps where end nodes were without reception within the network, the duration of these gaps was added to the duration of the preceding episode. This was based on the assumption that an end node is more likely to regain reception as soon as the person wearing it changes her/his location.

The fellows saw a range of inpatients in a week in the inpatient services according to the responses of 45 trainees. Twelve (27%) would average 1 patient per week in the inpatient setting while 18 (40%) had 2–4 patients on the rheumatology service in a week. Fifteen (33%) were busier with 5 or over patients per week on the inpatient service.

Didactics

The question attempted to capture the total number of hours per week that trainee spent in didactic activities, e.g. lectures, grand rounds, journal clubs. Of the 45 trainees who responded, six (13%) spend two hours in didactic activities, sixteen (36%) spent an average of 3 hours, thirteen (29%) spent 4 hours, and 10 (22%) spent 5 hours or more in these activities.

Research

This question enquired about the total number of hours per week that each trainee usually spent on research activities such as literature research, data collection, clinical or bench research, or other such activities. Of the 44 respondents, 19 (43%) reported spending 20 hours or less per week in research activities, 19 (43%) reported 21–40 hours per week, 5 (11%) 41–60 hours per week, and 1 (2%) 60 hours or more each week.

Combined clinical conferences

This question addressed with whom the trainees have had combined clinical or research conferences with other subspecialties. More than one answer was acceptable.

Of 42 trainees who answered this question, 32 (81%) trainees had joint conferences routinely with adult rheumatologists, 25 (60%) had conferences with radiology, 20 (48%) with nephrology and 18 (43%) with histopathology.

Journal club presentations

Of the 45 trainees who responded, there was a wide range of journal club presentations each year with no particular trends and no relation to the year of fellowship. Most trainees (34/45 or 76%) presented at 2–4 journal clubs per year.

### Insights into informal caregivers' well-being: a longitudinal analysis of care intensity, care location, and care relationship [^e83050d1]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2024). Medium credibility.

Caring intensity and caregivers' psychological well-being by care relationship

Table 3 shows the link between caring intensity and psychological well-being (depressive symptoms) for each caregiver–care recipient relationship. Column 1 shows that spousal caregivers report a higher GHQ-12 score than noncaregivers, regardless of the level of care intensity. People who spend 50+ hours per week caring for a spouse have a 1.273 higher GHQ-12 score (95% CI: 1.088 to 1.459) than noncaregivers. There is no statistically significant difference in the GHQ-12 score between noncaregivers and those who look after their child for less than 50 hours per week (Column 2). Parents who spend more than 50 hours per week taking care of their child with a long-term illness or disability report a 0.692 higher GHQ-12 score than noncaregivers (95% CI: 0.434 to 0.950).

Table 3.
Psychological Well-being and Caring Intensity by Caregiver–Care Recipient Relationship

People who spend 0–4 hours per week caring for their parents have a similar GHQ-12 score as noncaregivers (β = −0.071, 95% CI: −0.156 to 0.014). However, if the care is given for more than 5 hours per week, those who look after their parent have a higher GHQ-12 score than noncaregivers. Caring for 0–4 hours per week is associated with a 0.180 lower GHQ-12 score for those caring for "other relatives" (95% CI: −0.308 to −0.053) and a 0.183 lower GHQ-12 score for respondents who look after nonrelatives (95% CI: −0.303 to −0.063). There is no significant difference in the depressive symptoms of noncaregivers and respondents who spend over 5 hours per week caring for "other relatives" or nonrelatives.

### How to appraise the effectiveness of treatment [^095b36ef]. World Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Before implementing a new therapy, we should ascertain the benefits and risks of the therapy and assure ourselves that the resources consumed during the intervention will not be exorbitant. In the hierarchy of research designs, the results of randomized controlled trials, especially if systematically reviewed, are considered the highest level of evidence. We suggest a three-step approach to using an article from the medical literature to guide your patient care. We recommend that readers ask whether the study can provide valid results, review the results, and consider how the results can be applied to patient care. Given the time constraints of busy surgical practices and surgical training programs, applying this analysis to every relevant article will be challenging. However, the basis of this process is essentially what we all do many times each week when making decisions about whether and how to treat patients. Making this process explicit with guidelines to assess the strength of the available evidence can serve to improve patient care. It also allow us to defend therapeutic interventions based on available evidence and not anecdote.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis for clinicians [^6438d463]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The current economic news is bad. Expenditure on health care is under scrutiny in every country and with predictions of another economic crash comes pressure on the funding of health care systems - systems that, according to the World Health Organizationare meant to deliver quality service to all people, when and where they need them.

At the same time, new products - pharmaceuticals, diagnostic tests, new technologies - continue to be developed and launched. Health care systems are under pressure to pay for all of the potential hope that these provide, sometimes with good reason, sometimes without. This is where cost-effectiveness analysis comes in.

### 'New medicine service': supporting adherence in people starting a new medication for a long-term condition: 26-week follow-up of a pragmatic randomised controlled trial [^ea72f18f]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2020). High credibility.

Economic analysis

The probabilistic analysis reported that NMS generated a mean of 0.04 (95% CI −0.01 to 0.13) more QALYs per patient, at a mean reduced cost of −£113.9 (95% CI −1159.4 to 683.7) (see table 4). The deterministic analysis reported very similar results (online supplementary appendix 4). The NMS dominates normal practice with probability of 0.653 (ICER: −£2847.5 per QALY, 2.5%, 97.5% percentiles: −38 739.5, 34 024.2) (see figure 1A). NMS has an 89.0% probability of cost-effectiveness compared with normal practice at a willingness to pay of £20 000 per QALY (see figure 1B).

### ACC / AHA statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines and performance measures: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on performance measures and task force on practice guidelines [^e08cd1f2]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA cost/value methodology — limitations and challenges outlines barriers to incorporating value into guidelines, citing "widespread unwillingness to acknowledge that resources are limited" and "lack of confidence in the science of value determination (cost-effectiveness)". It notes that the "value of care (cost-effectiveness) is not constant", that dollar-based cost measures are confounded, and that the committee favors "cost as true resource utilization". Additional challenges include integrating long-term costs, the lack of a U.S. "national consensus" on cost-effectiveness in decision making, and that attempts to set spending priorities via cost-effectiveness have been "limited", even as available evidence is "informative and increasing". The committee hopes to encourage routine cost-effectiveness assessment in multicenter trials and acknowledges that this document's focus on individual procedures "does not address system changes that may improve efficiency of cardiovascular care".

### Revisiting "how many steps are enough? " [^1c927d3d]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2008). Low credibility.

With continued widespread acceptance of pedometers by both researchers and practitioners, evidence-based steps/day indices are needed to facilitate measurement and motivation applications of physical activity (PA) in public health. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to reprise, update, and extend the current understanding of dose-response relationships in terms of pedometer-determined PA. Any pedometer-based PA guideline presumes an accurate and standardized measure of steps; at this time, industry standards establishing quality control of instrumentation is limited to Japan where public health pedometer applications and the 10,000 steps.d slogan are traceable to the 1960s. Adult public health guidelines promote ≥ 30 min of at least moderate-intensity daily PA, and this translates to 3000–4000 steps if they are: 1) at least moderate intensity (i.e., ≥ 100 steps.min); 2) accumulated in at least 10-min bouts; and 3) taken over and above some minimal level of PA (i.e., number of daily steps) below which individuals might be classified as sedentary. A zone-based hierarchy is useful for both measurement and motivation purposes in adults: 1) < 5000 steps.d (sedentary); 2) 5000–7499 steps.d (low active); 3) 7500–9999 steps.d (somewhat active); 4) ≥ 10,000–12,499 steps.d (active); and 5) ≥ 12,500 steps.d (highly active). Evidence to support youth-specific cutoff points is emerging. Criterion-referenced approaches based on selected health outcomes present the potential for advancing evidence-based steps/day standards in both adults and children from a measurement perspective. A tradeoff that needs to be acknowledged and considered is the impact on motivation when evidence-based cutoff points are interpreted by individuals as unattainable goals.

Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Patient and caregiver costs and treatment burden in atopic dermatitis (AD) are substantial. Survey data report that "the median annual AD out-of-pocket expense was $600; 42% of patients with AD reported greater than $1000 out-of-pocket expenses annually and 9% reported out-of-pocket expenses greater than $5000 per year", and that "Higher out-of-pocket expenses are associated with increased disease severity and flares". Treatment intensity is common: "many patients with AD use, including concurrently, at least 3 prescription therapies", and cost gaps are frequent as "Nearly half of all study respondents (49%) reported out-of-pocket costs for prescription medications that were not covered by insurance". Caregiving demands are high, with "Caregivers of children with moderate-to-severe AD reported spending an average 20 hours per week managing the disease".

### Hourly step recommendations to achieve daily goals for working and older adults [^8519c6bc]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Hourly step counts

The three peaks in the mean step count on weekdays were associated with these time periods: (i) 7–9 a.m.: 1230 steps (SD = 1420), (ii) 12–2 p.m.: 1300 steps (SD = 1260), and (iii) 6–8 p.m.: 1610 steps (SD = 1730) (Fig. 1b). The mean step count during these three periods was 4140 steps (SD = 2800). The two peaks in the mean step count on weekends were associated with these time periods: (i) 9–11 a.m.: 1320 steps (SD = 1790) and 5–7 p.m.: 1310 steps (SD = 1650). The mean step count during these two periods was 2620 steps (SD = 2460). For weekdays and weekends, the proportion of zero step counts peaked from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m. and was the lowest from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. (Fig. 1c). A higher proportion of zero step counts was associated with the weekends (51.2%) compared to weekdays (45.1%). For participants aged between 30 and 59, the three peaks in the mean step count on weekdays were associated with going to work (7–9 a.m.), lunch (12–2 p.m.) and returning from work (6–8 p.m.) (Fig. 1e). On weekdays, participants aged 60 and above were associated with a slightly later peak in the morning (8–10 a.m.) and a smaller peak over lunch (12–2 p.m.) and late evening (6–8 p.m.). Overall, on weekdays, participants aged 60 and above were associated with higher hourly mean step counts compared to participants aged 30–59 from the start of the day till 6 p.m. after which the latter group was associated with higher hourly mean step counts from leaving work. Participants aged 60 and above were associated with a lower hourly proportion of zero step counts compared to participants aged 30–59 from the start of the day till the evening (Fig. 1f). Overall, the cumulative hourly step counts trajectory exhibited high variability; on weekends, there were later starts and fewer mean step counts after 7 p.m. (Supplementary Fig. S3).

### Yin and yang, or peas in a pod? Individual-sport versus team-sport athletes and altitude training [^d2bd05da]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Key similarities

So far, the differences between cycling and soccer athletes have been highlighted, but there are a number of important similarities as well. Neither cyclists nor soccer players compete at a constant intensity — that is, both are involved in stochastic events. Even in a cycling time-trial, pacing strategies, variations in terrain and environmental factors such as wind speed and direction dictate a varied application of power by the rider. Typical of cycling and soccer, athletes spend a large amount of time at low intensity during competition. In mass-start cycling races over flat terrain, approximately 89% of stages are spent at low–moderate intensity. In English Premier League soccer matches, time spent in the lower (< 14.4 km/h) activity bands is approximately 85%.

Despite the majority of competition being spent at submaximal intensity in both sports, the higher intensity activities are often aligned with key events that determine the outcome of respective competitions. For example, when establishing a breakaway in cycling, there are numerous 5–15 s efforts > ∼9.5–14 W/kg. Further, during criterium racing, there are a higher number of sprints compared to road stages due to the specific requirement of repeatedly accelerating out of corners. Finally, the finish of a cycling race typically results in a sprint between two and more riders, or at least a sustained high-intensity effort, and the outcome of that sprint decides the outcome of the race. In professional soccer, straight sprints represent the most frequent action immediately prior to goal scoring. Figure 1 depicts crank power data collected on an SRM power metre (Schoberer Rad Messtechnik, SRM Training System) from an International Criterium Race (multiple laps of a short circuit) and velocity data from 10 Hz global positioning system (GPS, Catapult Innovations V4) from one-half of an International Youth Soccer Friendly Match. The extent of the accelerations undertaken by each type of athlete is evident, as is the underlying high volume of low-intensity activity. Energetically, these high-intensity tasks are largely fuelled by phosphocreatine (PCr) degradation, and the resynthesis of this is a purely aerobic task. It is therefore possible that altitude training could enhance this capacity in cycling as well as soccer athletes.

### Sustained improvements in readings in-range using an advanced bluetoothConnected blood glucose meter and a mobile diabetes app: real-world evidence from more than 55, 000 people with diabetes [^7303a0cb]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Effect of Time Spent Using the OTR App on Glycemic Outcomes

Lower mean BG values were found in PwT1D spending > 10 to 20 min per week on the OTR App (− 14.4 mg/dL) over 180 days, with the most pronounced changes seen in those spending either > 40 to 60 min (− 21.0 mg/dL) or > 60 min per week (− 25.2 mg/dL). Readings in range improved by 8.2 percentage points in PwT1D who spent > 10 to 20 min on the app, and this rose to 12.7 percentage points in those who spent > 60 min on the app. Improved RIR in PwT1D were consistent with nearly equivalent reductions in hyperglycemia, with hyperglycemic readings reducing by − 9.0 percentage points in those spending > 10 to 20 min on the app, improving to a − 13.8 percentage point reduction in those spending > 60 min per week on the app. (Fig. 3 a). Encouragingly, glycemic outcomes in PwT2D were consistent with those seen in PwT1D, although PwT2D had more clinically meaningful improvements in outcomes at lower levels of app usage than PwT1D. For example, PwT2D who spent just > 5 to 10 min on the app lowered mean BG (− 19.7 mg/dL), increased RIR (12.0 percentage points), and reduced hyperglycemic readings by − 12.1 percentage points (Fig. 3 b). In terms of app sessions, a higher frequency of checking was seen in both PwT1D (3.8 vs 2.8 checks per day) and PwT2D (2.4 vs 1.8 checks per day) in those spending the most compared to the least time on the app. Nonetheless, monitoring frequency was similar in PWDs within each category of time spent using the app from baseline to 180 days and this indicates that monitoring frequency per se cannot explain the glycemic changes seen.

### Television viewing time and reduced life expectancy: a life table analysis [^44341c86]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Prolonged television (TV) viewing time is unfavourably associated with mortality outcomes, particularly for cardiovascular disease, but the impact on life expectancy has not been quantified. The authors estimate the extent to which TV viewing time reduces life expectancy in Australia, 2008.

Methods

The authors constructed a life table model that incorporates a previously reported mortality risk associated with TV time. Data were from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study, a national population-based observational survey that started in 1999–2000. The authors modelled impacts of changes in population average TV viewing time on life expectancy at birth.

Results

The amount of TV viewed in Australia in 2008 reduced life expectancy at birth by 1.8 years (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 8.4 days to 3.7 years) for men and 1.5 years (95% UI: 6.8 days to 3.1 years) for women. Compared with persons who watch no TV, those who spend a lifetime average of 6 h/day watching TV can expect to live 4.8 years (95% UI: 11 days to 10.4 years) less. On average, every single hour of TV viewed after the age of 25 reduces the viewer's life expectancy by 21.8 (95% UI: 0.3–44.7) min. This study is limited by the low precision with which the relationship between TV viewing time and mortality is currently known.

Conclusions

TV viewing time may be associated with a loss of life that is comparable to other major chronic disease risk factors such as physical inactivity and obesity.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Budget impact in economic evaluations — Budget impact refers to the effect of adopting the intervention on total health care expenditures, accounting for both increased spending due to intervention-related costs and downstream savings from improved health in the treated population, and high-quality evaluations typically report changes in intervention-related costs, the cost of cardiovascular care (for example, savings from averted major adverse cardiovascular events), and the cost of noncardiovascular care (for example, increased spending due to prolonged survival). The budget impact is directly proportional to the number of eligible patients who receive the intervention, with studies typically reporting the projected effect on health care spending if all eligible patients were to receive the drug, and because budget impact may inform strategies for adoption at a population level, this information may be included in the supporting text accompanying the economic value statement where available.

### Assessment of drinking water sold from private sector kiosks in post-earthquake port-au-prince, Haiti [^a5a8bb89]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Respondents were also asked about the water storage reservoirs on-site, in terms of specifications and cleaning practices. Of those who knew the reservoir size (N = 1,140), the majority (84.3%) reported having a reservoir between 1,000 and 2,000 gallons in size. The most common response was 1,200 gallons (51.0%), followed by 1,400 gallons (16.9%). For those kiosks where it was reported that the tank was cleaned (method not specified) (N = 1,272; 76.1%), the most common frequency was "every month" (25.7%), followed by "after each use" (21.7%). Sixteen percent of respondents did not know the frequency of cleaning.

Sales volume and price.

All kiosks inventoried sold water by one and five gallon volumes. The reported total volume sold per week varied considerably. One-third of respondents (35.4%) did not know how much water they sold on a weekly basis. For those who reported knowing the volume sold (N = 845), the mean and median volume sold per week was 835.8 and 700 gallons, respectively. The highest weekly volume sold reported was 8,400 gallons (Figure 3).

Figure 3.
Box and whisker plot of reported weekly sales volume (gallons) for kiosks inventoried in metropolitan Port-au-Prince, July–August 2013.

The majority of kiosks (90.0%) sold water for 5 Gourdes (USD0.12 at the time of the inventory) per gallon; this equates to USD31.70 per m³. Using the mean volume sold per week, this equates to an average weekly gross sales per kiosk of USD97.41. If an individual were to purchase solely their drinking water from a private kiosk, this would equate to a weekly expenditure of on average USD0.67 on drinking water (annual total: USD34.69). Based on the per capita GNI in 2013, this would equate to spending approximately 4.3% of annual income on drinking water. If purchased water was used for basic consumption, this would equate to spending 10.8% of income annually.

Keep a calendar to track your period:

SLYND Day 1 Start:

You will use a Day 1 Start if your healthcare provider told you to take your first pill (Day 1) on the first day of your period.

Take 1 pill every day in the order of the blister pack, at the same time each day, for 28 days.
After taking the last pill on Day 28 from the blister pack, start taking the first pill from a new pack, on the same day of the week as the first pack. Take the first pill in the new pack whether or not you are having your period.

Instructions for using your pill blister pack:

Step 1. Look at your SLYND pill pack. See Figure A.

The SLYND pill pack has:

24 white (active) pills with hormone for Week 1 through Week 3 and the first 3 days of Week 4 (Days 1–24)
4 green (inactive) pills without hormones for the last 4 days of Week 4 (Days 25–28).

Step 2.

Place the day label strip (see Figure B) that starts with the first day of your period (Day 1) on top of the pill blister pack over "Place the label here". See Figure C. For example, if your period begins on Monday, place the day label strip with Monday as the first day on the top of your pill pack. See Figure C.

Key economic concepts — scarcity, opportunity cost, and efficiency are defined to frame value assessment. Scarcity is foundational: "the most fundamental of which is the concept of scarcity", requiring that "choices, or more precisely trade-offs, must be made", and leading to the notion of cost as "opportunity cost". "The opportunity cost of medical care is whatever else we might desire that cannot be produced because of the decision to produce more health care". Efficiency is highlighted as "A second critical economic concept", with the policy objective to "maximize the well-being (sometimes referred to as utility) of the members of society collectively", and with "Cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis" presented as tools that quantify efficiency of policy choices.

### Hourly step recommendations to achieve daily goals for working and older adults [^2ef2d192]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The cumulative step counts up till the previous hour were not used as a covariate in the first half of the day (12 a.m. to 12 p.m.) as the proportion of cumulative step counts above 5000 steps was small (20.7% on weekdays and 22.6% on weekends; Supplementary Fig. S4). Furthermore, the cumulative step counts until noon were low, with a mean of 3420 and an SD of 3390.

Parameter estimation

All model parameters were given uninformative prior distributions within a Bayesian framework. We performed Markov Chain Monte Carlo to sample from the posterior distribution of the model using the RStan Software. Four chains were run in parallel for each hour and for weekdays and weekends, each with 5000 iterations burn-in and subsequently merged to obtain a posterior sample of size 20,000. Point estimates were obtained by the mean of the posterior sample, and 95% credible intervals (CIs) were obtained using the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles. The Gelman–Rubin diagnostic (Rhat) was used to assess convergence. Full details can be found in the Supplementary Method. All other analyses were done using R (version 3.6.3).

Gelman–Rubin diagnostic (Rhat)

The Gelman–Rubin diagnostic (Rhat) assesses quantitatively if the Markov Chains have converged. Suppose we have M independent Markov chains,

If the Markov Chains have converged, we should expect that the M SDs are similar and henceis close to 1. As a rule of thumb, < 1.01 is recommended as implying convergence. We used M = 4 as recommended for robust statistics.

### Smarter hospital communication: secure smartphone text messaging improves provider satisfaction and perception of efficacy, workflow [^530a2425]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

HCGM Adoption and Usage Patterns

Active use of HCGM was defined as using the application to send or receive an average of ≥ 1 text messages per day. Of HCGM participants, 67% self-reported ≥ 1 week of active use of the application, indicating a strong compliance rate. Among non-attendings, 70% reported sending 1 or more texts to other team members per day; this percentage increased to 86% among those whose attendings texted them at least once per day (47% of non-attendings). Respondents who text frequently in their personal lives (> 5 texts/day) were more likely to use the application; 90% of these respondents sent 1 or more HCGM texts per day.

Among 12 subjects who did not report sending or receiving ≥ 1 HCGM text/day, the top three reasons were: other team members were not using it (67%), no need to use it given the close proximity of other team members (67%), and "other" (33%). A Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare the ages of "active" versus "nonactive" users; no significant age difference was found (P = 0.200).

To provide an objective measure of application adoption, usage data for each HCGM participant were obtained from the application developers. Because much of the study's first week was spent onboarding and instructing participant, the first week was not included in the analysis. Of 43 individuals enrolled in the study for at least one of the seven remaining weeks, 56% sent a total of ≥ 5 texts, 44% sent ≥ 10 texts, and 28% sent ≥ 20 texts. HCGM users on three teams sent an aggregate mean of 123 texts/week. Data on number of messages received by each user were not available.

Perceived Effectiveness: Paging Versus HCGM

In post-study surveys, HCGM participants rated HCGM significantly higher (P < 0.05) than paging (Table 3) in terms of ability to communicate thoughts clearly (P = 0.010) and efficiently (P = 0.009). HCGM was also deemed more effective at integrating into workflow during rounds (P = 0.018) and patient discharge (P = 0.012). Overall satisfaction with HCGM was also significantly higher (P = 0.003).

### Effects of β-blockers on archery performance, body sway and aiming behaviour [^22cc5176]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Substances

Archers were given an oral dose of 5 mg bisoprolol, 40 mg propranolol and placebo in a randomised design. BBs were obtained from a university hospital dispensing pharmacy, and placebo capsules (containing starch) were provided by the Pharmacology Department of the School of Medicine. The reason to choose bisoprolol was for a couple of reasons. First, as the trial was a placebo-controlled study and to save the double-blind design, the tablets' size and shape had to be similar. Additionally, the pharmacokinetic parameters, especially Tmax values should be similar to propranolol. Finally, to exclude any bioavailability, bisoprolol was the only available trademark in the country. BB doses were defined from the literature considering several criteria; (1) the volunteers should not feel any clinical sign or symptom which may affect their blindness, (2) Should be therapeutically equivalent, (3) cardio-specific beta-1 blocker (bisoprolol 5 mg) should not exceed the selectivity for beta-1 receptors and (4) 40 mg single dose propranolol (off-label use of for performance anxiety symptoms). The result on HR measurement on both treatments showed that the doses for both drugs had achieved the systemic effect, without any clinical symptom or adverse event observed or reported by the volunteers.

HR measurements

HR was recorded before and during shooting with one-second intervals. RHR values were obtained from the average of last 1 min of a 20 min lying position. Afterwards, RHR values were continued to be recorded in a standing position for 4 min. Shooting HR (SHR) recording was initiated when archers stood on the force plate and continued until completing the shooting series. The average SHR after each three shots and the average of 10 sets of these three shots were used for analysis.

Shooting performance

Shootings were performed according to regular indoor competition standards. Official judging, 18 m distance shooting, and normal indoor competition rules were applied. Archers were asked to compete in pairs as in official matches. As two archers shot together to resemble a competition situation, shooting platforms were placed like in the field of competition (figure 1). Each competition lasted about 45 min.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Key economic concepts — scarcity and opportunity cost emphasize that the most fundamental concept is scarcity, that "societies do not have enough resources to satisfy all of their citizens' wants and needs", and therefore "trade-offs, must be made". This need for trade-offs underlies opportunity cost, the idea of cost as "that which must be sacrificed to obtain something else", and in medical care it is "whatever else we might desire that cannot be produced because of the decision to produce more health care", with the reminder that "deferring trade-offs does not eliminate the need to make them".

Circulation (2014). Medium credibility.

Limitations, challenges, and arguments against incorporating resource and value considerations — barriers and gaps are described, including variability in value across settings, integration of long-term costs, and lack of national consensus, while noting hopes for routine cost-effectiveness assessment and acknowledging system-level changes are not addressed. Barriers include "widespread unwillingness to acknowledge that resources are limited, distrust of government and other policy decision makers, and lack of confidence in the science of value determination (cost-effectiveness)". Value "is not constant; it may vary over time and from one location to another", and integrating "long-term costs" like infrastructure into per-treatment costs is challenging. "In the United States, no national consensus has emerged regarding the role of cost-effectiveness considerations in healthcare decision making", but "the writing committee… will encourage routine assessment of cost-effectiveness", and it "recognizes" that a focus on individual procedures "does not address system changes that may improve efficiency of cardiovascular care".

Initial and subsequent costs in economic evaluation — healthcare decisions may have long-term economic effects, so analyses should include both initial and subsequent costs, including downstream costs for monitoring, complications, and device repair or replacement. The overall net cost may be lower or even pay for itself if future clinical events are prevented; conversely, initially low-cost decisions can incur substantial overall costs. The time horizon must be sufficient to include all costs and health benefits; for chronic diseases, guidelines recommend a life-long time horizon, often requiring modeling beyond a clinical trial.

### Evidence-based guidelines – an introduction [^13b4ad34]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2008). Low credibility.

Recommendations in the form of clinical practice guidelines are increasingly common. Clinical guidelines are systematically developed statements designed to help administrators, practitioners and patients make decisions about appropriate health care for specific circumstances. In North America, guidelines developed by professional societies, government panels and cooperative groups are frequently used to measure quality, to allocate resources and to determine how health care dollars are spent. For clinicians, guidelines provide a summary of the relevant medical literature and offer assistance in deciding which diagnostic tests to order, which treatments to use for specific conditions, when to discharge patients from the hospital, and many other aspects of clinical practice.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Arguments in favor of incorporating resource and value considerations state that economic evaluations, including cost-effectiveness analyses, can help decision makers appreciate the implications of choices and clarify factors influencing relative benefits, and that economic analyses can guide those making coverage decisions and inform developers of practice guidelines to ensure that recommendations yield the greatest value from available healthcare resources. The document notes that currently algorithms for diagnosis or management of disease states, including appropriate use of clinical interventions, typically consider a broad spectrum of differential diagnoses and patient care approaches, which essentially assume that resources are unlimited, and emphasizes that the principal consideration is not cost awareness but a comprehensive, informed, and evidence-based approach in which incentives are balanced by the need to consume resources more wisely.

3. You may not have your period this month but this is expected. However, if you miss your period two months in a row, call your healthcare provider because you might be pregnant.

If you miss 3 or more light pink to pink pills in a row during any week:

1. **If you are a Day 1 Starter**:

Throw out the rest of the pill pack and start a new pack that same day.

If you are a Sunday Starter:

Keep taking 1 pill every day until Sunday. On Sunday, throw out the rest of the pack and start a new pack of pills that same day.

2. You could become pregnant if you have sex in the 7 days after you restart your pills. You must use another birth control method (such as condoms and spermicides) as a back-up for those 7 days.

3. Call your healthcare provider if you miss your period, because you might be pregnant.

 If you miss any of the 4 green pills in Week 4:

Throw away the pills you missed.

Keep taking one pill each day until the pack is empty.

You do not need a back-up method.

 Finally, if you are still not sure what to do about the pills you have missed: Use a back-up method (such as condoms and spermicides) anytime you have sex.

Physical activity intensity definitions for adults: Sedentary behavior is listed at 1–1.5 metabolic equivalents (METs) with examples including sitting, reclining, or lying and watching television; sedentary behavior is defined as any waking behavior characterized by an energy expenditure ≤ 1.5 METs while in a sitting, reclining, or lying posture. Light activity corresponds to 1.6–2.9 METs with examples such as walking slowly, cooking, and light housework. Moderate activity corresponds to 3.0–5.9 METs with examples including brisk walking (2.4–4 mph), biking (5–9 mph), ballroom dancing, active yoga, and recreational swimming. Vigorous activity is ≥ 6 METs with examples including jogging/running, biking (≥ 10 mph), singles tennis, and swimming laps.

Occupational lifting during pregnancy — recommended weight limit (RWL) algorithm: Begin by asking, "At work do you perform lifting tasks more than once every 5 minutes?" If no, use the A. Infrequent lifting graphic. If yes, ask, "Do you lift more than three times per minute?" If yes, "For guidance in determining weight limits when lifting is highly repetitive, see the article cited". If no, branch by duration with "Less than 1 continuous hour" (B. Repetitive short duration lifting) or "1 or more hours per day" (C. Repetitive long duration lifting). For gestational timing, "When less than 20 weeks pregnant, select the image on the left of the graphic; when pregnant for 20 weeks or more, select the image on the right". The output is that "The number circled in step 3 is the RWL (in pounds)… Repeat these steps when the gestation period or task conditions change". The "Less than 1 continuous hour" category "can encompass multiple hours of lifting in one work day provided that each continuous lifting period is less than 1 hour and followed by a minimum of 1 hour of nonlifting activity before lifting resumes".

### Retail demand for emergency contraception in United States following new year holiday: time series study [^1b20e189]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

The expectation of increased sales following the New Year holiday is based on multiple possible risk factors (increased sexual behavior, decreased use of contraception during intercourse, increased rates of sexual assault, and potentially limited access to contraception). To examine whether one of these population risk factors was most responsible for any observed increase in sales, we also examined holidays that share a subset of risk factors. To test whether decreased use of contraception during intercourse was the primary driver of the observed increase in emergency contraception sales following New Year's Eve, we included indicators for whether the week followed St Patrick's Day and US Independence Day, two holidays with similar patterns of alcohol consumption to the New Year holiday. To test whether sexual activity was the primary driver of any observed increase in emergency contraception sales following the New Year holiday, we included an indicator for whether the week followed Valentine's Day, the holiday for which Americans intend to make the most effort to be sexual with their partners. However, focusing on limited periods of time may be misleading when examining effects of holidays on health behavior, so we also included indicators for three negative controls (that is, holidays for which increases in emergency contraception sales would not be expected): Easter, Mother's Day, and Father's Day. As these holidays fall on Sundays (the day ending weekly sales collections), we used the week following these holidays. A full list of dates by classified holiday is available in supplementary table B.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^26b84148]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Hemodialysis adequacy (CPG 2.3) — dose expression and treatment frequency are handled by expressing clearance per dialysis and appending or converting for weekly frequency; the Work Group believed that doses per dialysis should include the number of weekly treatments. To account for variations, "dose expression must include factors for both duration and frequency", the clearance rate "can be expressed per dialysis instead of per unit of time", frequency can be handled by appending "the number of treatments per week (eg, 3 treatments per week) or" expressing dose per week, and "the dose for a single treatment typically is multiplied by the number of treatments per week". Because "a more frequent schedule also is more efficient", "doses expressed per dialysis should include an element for the number of treatments per week (eg, spKt/V[3] for 3 treatments per week)".

Randomization

Subjects who passed screening were randomized into 1 of 3 groups: a control group (group 1), a pedometer‐only intervention group (group 2), and a pedometer combined with interactive website intervention group (group 3). Due to technical issues with the website server, individuals enrolled in the first 4 months of the protocol were randomly selected to be in either group 1 or 2 if their designation by the initial randomization scheme was group 3. This accounts for the imbalance in numbers among groups. The control group was asked not to change their behavior during the study period. The pedometer‐only intervention group received a pedometer to wear on their belt during walking hours with a goal to increase their PA by 10% each week above baseline levels in order to reach an average of 10 000 steps/day. They received pedometer logs and 12 self‐addressed, stamped envelopes in which to return a 7‐day log each week to the study investigators. Group 3 received a pedometer and was additionally asked to log onto a secure website through the University of Wisconsin‐Milwaukee on at least a weekly basis throughout the intervention period. The interactive website employed key strategies proven to increase the adoption and retention of lifestyle‐integrated habitual physical activity in older adults. – These strategies included the use of frequent feedback, self‐regulation of activity, – education and practice in realistic behavioral change strategies and goal setting, and rewarding. At the end of each week, upon uploading pedometer information through a USB, graphical representations were provided of daily steps and how such corresponded with intrinsically set goals. At this stage of the program, each individual was either in compliance with set goals (defined as meeting walking step targets 5 out of 7 days), or they were not in compliance. If a participant was in compliance the user was guided through a series of congratulatory screens and a directive for setting the upcoming week's step goal. If the participant did not attain compliance, the user was guided through a series of interactive screens that were designed to collect barriers identified and then deliver motivational messages tagged and retrieved from a database library. The motivational messages were designed to offer strategies and tips for overcoming identified barriers to set goal attainment. Each week of the interactive program was also guided by an ongoing discussion forum, posing questions and solutions to increase PA, and access to "ask the expert" for points of clarification. Once a participant reached the 10 000 steps/day goal, the software encouraged the user to maintain this level of activity through continued tailored messaging.
