## Question

What is the appropriate workup for a healthy 28-year-old woman with several weeks of diarrhea and heartburn?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the appropriate workup is for a healthy 28-year-old woman with several weeks of diarrhea and heartburn. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial history and physical to clarify symptom phenotype and duration. Then, I should verify alarm features and risk stratify. Next, I will outline first-line noninvasive labs and stool tests, including targeted H. pylori assessment for heartburn. After that, I need to define decision pathways based on early results. Then, I will consider empiric therapy trials when appropriate. Finally, I should plan reassessment timelines and indicate advanced testing if symptoms persist or alarms emerge [^112fPPWa] [^113TrgZG] [^11263VbP].

> Let me first confirm the symptom framing and duration, because that anchors the pathway. She has several weeks of diarrhea and heartburn; wait, I initially labeled this as chronic diarrhea, but let me verify the definition because chronic diarrhea is typically ≥ 4 weeks, so if "several weeks" is less than four, this might be subacute rather than fully chronic, which modestly affects pretest probabilities and the urgency of evaluation, especially for infections and post-infectious IBS trajectories. I need to ensure the history captures stool frequency, form, nocturnal occurrence, urgency, visible blood or mucus, travel, sick contacts, medications including NSAIDs, metformin, PPIs and laxatives, prior GI surgery or radiation, systemic comorbidities like thyroid disease or diabetes, and family history of IBD, celiac disease, or GI malignancy, alongside detailed heartburn characterization with relation to meals, regurgitation, and any dysphagia or odynophagia [^112fPPWa] [^111sidCd]. On exam, I should check vitals, hydration, abdominal and rectal findings, and extraintestinal signs to triage acuity and guide tests, while remembering heartburn can coexist with dyspepsia but is not itself dyspepsia, which informs how I label upper GI symptoms moving forward [^114UTqsE].

> Next, I should review alarm features, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before I confirm which alarms truly change the pathway. I should double-check for unintentional weight loss, GI bleeding or iron deficiency anemia, nocturnal diarrhea that awakens from sleep, persistent vomiting, progressive dysphagia or odynophagia, fever, severe or rapidly worsening symptoms, and first-degree family history of IBD, celiac disease, or GI cancer, since their presence mandates expedited investigation rather than empiric trials in a young adult [^112tmtT6] [^11263VbP] [^1131ooS8]. Given she is 28 and described as healthy, the baseline risk of sinister organic disease is lower, so in the absence of alarm signs, a conservative initial approach is reasonable, while remaining vigilant for evolving red flags during follow-up [^11376o7Q] [^11263VbP].

> I will now examine the initial, noninvasive workup, and I need to ensure it is both high-yield and guideline-concordant. A prudent first-line panel includes complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, C-reactive protein or ESR, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and celiac serology with tTG-IgA plus total IgA to exclude common systemic and malabsorptive causes early, because these influence subsequent testing and management [^116UUwad] [^112fPPWa]. For stool testing, let me think about actionable, probability-shifting assays: fecal calprotectin or lactoferrin to screen for intestinal inflammation suggestive of IBD versus functional diarrhea, targeted Giardia antigen if risk factors or water exposures are present, C. difficile testing only with recent antibiotic or healthcare exposure, and O&P selectively with travel or immunocompromise, since overtesting in low-prevalence contexts yields false positives and unnecessary procedures [^116UUwad] [^111sidCd]. Wait, I almost recommended routine C. difficile testing up front, but I should confirm indications and restrict it to compatible exposures and clinical contexts to avoid low-yield testing in a healthy outpatient with short symptom duration [^116hUncV]. For heartburn, I should confirm noninvasive H. pylori testing with urea breath test or stool antigen, and if positive, plan eradication given its impact on dyspepsia-like upper GI symptoms and peptic disease risk [^notfound].

> Now I need to decide actions based on initial results, and I should verify each branch carefully. If inflammatory markers and fecal calprotectin are normal, celiac serology is negative, and there are no alarm features, then a functional diagnosis such as IBS-D and a GERD or functional dyspepsia overlap becomes most likely, and empiric management is appropriate with planned reassessment, rather than immediate invasive testing in a 28-year-old [^11263VbP] [^112fPPWa]. If fecal calprotectin is elevated or CRP is high, I should proceed to colonoscopy with biopsies to evaluate for IBD and microscopic colitis, as this materially changes management and prognosis [^112fPPWa]. If tTG-IgA is positive or there is selective IgA deficiency with suggestive serologies, I should confirm celiac disease with upper endoscopy and duodenal biopsies, aligning diagnosis with histology before dietary therapy [^112fPPWa]. If H. pylori is positive, eradication is indicated, with post-treatment confirmation depending on clinical course, while persistent or refractory heartburn despite an adequate PPI trial in the absence of alarms should prompt esophagogastroduodenoscopy and, when needed, ambulatory reflux testing to clarify GERD phenotypes and rule in alternative pathology [^113RzoTC] [^113TrgZG].

> For empiric therapy when no alarm features are present and initial tests are unrevealing, I need to ensure I match therapy to the likely disorders and monitor response. For heartburn or uninvestigated dyspepsia with negative H. pylori testing, a time-limited PPI trial, for example omeprazole at standard dosing for 4 to 8 weeks, is reasonable, while educating the patient that symptoms and endoscopic findings often do not correlate and that most young patients have no serious organic disease; moreover, routine gastric emptying testing is not recommended in typical functional dyspepsia presentations, which helps avoid low-yield investigations early [^113TrgZG] [^11376o7Q]. For diarrhea consistent with IBS-D, I should consider diet and symptom-directed agents, such as careful dietary triggers reduction and antidiarrheals like loperamide for urgency and frequency, reserving further testing for nonresponders or those who develop alarms, in keeping with an evidence-based, step-up paradigm for low-risk presentations [^11263VbP] [^112tmtT6]. But wait, I should confirm that any pharmacologic trial is coupled with safety advice and a clear reassessment window so we do not miss evolving organic disease masked by symptomatic therapy [^11263VbP].

> Reassessment is essential, and I should double-check timelines and triggers for escalation. A practical interval is 4 to 6 weeks to gauge response to PPI and IBS-D measures; if symptoms resolve, that supports functional diagnoses and continued conservative management with periodic review, whereas persistent or worsening symptoms, or the emergence of alarms, should prompt targeted advanced testing tailored to the dominant symptom [^11263VbP] [^112fPPWa]. For refractory heartburn or dysphagia, I should proceed with upper endoscopy with biopsies, considering eosinophilic esophagitis or other esophageal inflammatory conditions if histology is abnormal, especially in the context of atopy or peripheral eosinophilia, and use ambulatory reflux monitoring when GERD remains uncertain after endoscopy and PPI trials [^113RzoTC] [^112pk8m8]. For persistent diarrhea, I should consider colonoscopy with random colonic biopsies to assess for microscopic colitis and other colitides, bile acid diarrhea evaluation when available, and selective carbohydrate malabsorption breath testing, while recognizing the limited and context-dependent utility of SIBO breath testing in the absence of suggestive features or risk states [^112fPPWa] [^113BKtg2].

> Hold on, I should verify that I am not overlooking motility and other mimics, but I also need to ensure structural disease is excluded before invoking dysmotility. Motility testing has a secondary role here and should be reserved for severe, nutrition-impacting symptoms after mucosal and structural diseases are ruled out, given the limited concordance of symptoms with motor dysfunction and the invasive nature and availability constraints of these tests, which reinforces why earlier steps focus on inflammatory, malabsorptive, and reflux phenotypes first [^115ktsvE] [^112QzyJT]. Similarly, in the dyspepsia pathway, I must remember that heartburn alone is not diagnostic of dyspepsia even though overlap is common, and I should be cautious to avoid overtesting in young adults where the diagnostic yield of early endoscopy for malignancy is extremely low, aligning with a judicious, symptom-driven strategy and patient education about the benign natural history in most cases [^114UTqsE] [^11376o7Q].

> Finally, I need to ensure patient counseling, safety netting, and documentation reflect this stepwise plan. I should confirm understanding of alarm features that warrant prompt contact, reinforce the plan for timed reassessment, and document the rationale for deferring invasive testing in the absence of red flags, citing that guidelines endorse an empiric-first strategy in low-risk patients with suspected functional overlap of IBS-D and GERD or functional dyspepsia, while outlining the exact criteria that would trigger colonoscopy, endoscopy, or physiologic testing if the clinical picture changes or fails to respond as expected [^11263VbP] [^112fPPWa] [^113TrgZG].

For a healthy 28-year-old woman with several weeks of diarrhea and heartburn, begin with a focused history and exam to identify **alarm features** (weight loss, bleeding, anemia, nocturnal symptoms, fever, family history of IBD/colon cancer) [^112tmtT6]. If no alarm features, obtain CBC, CMP, TSH, celiac serology, and **stool studies** (fecal calprotectin, C. difficile, Giardia [^116hUncV], ova/parasites, fecal fat) [^112fPPWa] [^116UUwad]. Test for H. pylori [^114guarj] and initiate a **PPI trial** [^113RzoTC] for heartburn. If alarms are present or initial tests are abnormal, proceed to **colonoscopy with biopsies and upper endoscopy** [^117Kv6jL], and obtain abdominal imaging when indicated [^115ktsvE]. Most cases are **functional** — IBS or GERD [^116ZGCfU] — but this approach ensures organic disease is not missed.

---

## Clinical history and physical examination

A detailed history and physical examination are **essential** [^1128BuMZ] to guide the diagnostic approach:

- **Symptom characterization**: Onset, duration, frequency, severity, and associated symptoms (e.g. abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, fever, nocturnal symptoms) [^114HA7ey].

- **Alarm features**: Unintentional weight loss, gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, nocturnal symptoms, family history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or colorectal cancer [^112fPPWa] [^112tmtT6].

- **Dietary and medication history**: Recent dietary changes, medication use (including antibiotics, NSAIDs, laxatives), and travel history [^111sidCd] [^112fbfUi].

- **Physical examination**: Vital signs, abdominal examination (tenderness, masses, organomegaly), and signs of dehydration or malnutrition [^112fPPWa].

---

## Initial laboratory investigations

Order **initial laboratory tests** to exclude common causes of chronic diarrhea and heartburn:

| **Test** | **Indication** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Complete blood count (CBC) | Routine initial test | Detect anemia, infection, or inflammation [^112fPPWa] |
| Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) | Routine initial test | Assess electrolyte imbalance, renal, and hepatic function [^112fPPWa] |
| Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) | Routine initial test | Exclude hyperthyroidism as a cause of diarrhea [^112fPPWa] |
| Celiac serology (tTG-IgA, total IgA) | Routine initial test | Screen for celiac disease [^112fPPWa] |
| Stool studies (fecal calprotectin, C. difficile toxin, Giardia antigen, ova and parasites, fecal fat) | Routine initial test | Exclude infectious, inflammatory, and malabsorptive causes [^112fPPWa] [^116UUwad] [^116hUncV] |

## Diagnostic approach to heartburn

In a young, healthy patient, heartburn is most often due to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) [^113RzoTC]. Begin with a 4–8 week **empiric PPI trial** to help confirm the diagnosis. Perform noninvasive **Helicobacter pylori testing** (urea breath test or stool antigen) and provide eradication therapy if positive [^114guarj]. Reserve **upper endoscopy** for alarm symptoms (dysphagia, odynophagia, weight loss, gastrointestinal bleeding) or if symptoms persist despite PPI therapy [^113RzoTC].

---

## Indications for further diagnostic testing

If the initial evaluation is inconclusive or alarm features are present, proceed with **targeted testing**. Perform **colonoscopy with biopsies** [^112fPPWa] when fecal calprotectin is elevated, anemia is present, or there is suspicion of inflammatory bowel disease or microscopic colitis. Use **upper endoscopy** (esophagogastroduodenoscopy, EGD) for alarm symptoms or GERD symptoms that persist despite PPI therapy [^113RzoTC]. Obtain **abdominal imaging** (ultrasound, CT, MRI) when structural abnormalities, pancreatic or biliary disease, or malignancy are suspected [^115ktsvE].

---

## Common diagnoses in this patient population

In young, healthy women presenting with chronic diarrhea and heartburn, the **most common diagnoses** include:

- **Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)**: Characterized by chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, and bloating, often associated with stress or dietary triggers [^112fbfUi] [^11263VbP].

- **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**: Characterized by heartburn, regurgitation, and dyspeptic symptoms [^113RzoTC].

- **Functional dyspepsia**: Characterized by upper abdominal discomfort, bloating, and early satiety, often overlapping with GERD and IBS [^113TrgZG].

- **Celiac disease**: Gluten-sensitive enteropathy presenting with chronic diarrhea, malabsorption, and nutritional deficiencies [^112fPPWa].

- **Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)**: Less common but important to exclude, especially if alarm features are present [^1128BuMZ].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying diagnosis**:

- **IBS**: Dietary modifications (low FODMAP diet), antidiarrheal agents, antispasmodics, and psychological therapies [^11263VbP].

- **GERD**: Lifestyle modifications (weight loss, dietary changes, head-of-bed elevation), PPI therapy, and H. pylori eradication if positive [^113RzoTC].

- **Functional dyspepsia**: Dietary modifications, PPIs, prokinetic agents, and psychological therapies [^113TrgZG].

- **Celiac disease**: Strict gluten-free diet [^112fPPWa].

- **IBD**: Anti-inflammatory medications, immunosuppressants, biologic therapies, and dietary modifications [^1128BuMZ].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular **follow-up** is essential to monitor symptom progression, treatment response, and the emergence of alarm features. Educate patients about their condition, potential triggers, and the importance of adherence to treatment and dietary recommendations [^116nR6N1].

---

A healthy 28-year-old woman with chronic diarrhea and heartburn should have a **focused history, physical exam, and initial labs** [^112fPPWa]. If no alarm features are present, initiate an empiric PPI trial [^113RzoTC] and test for H. pylori [^114guarj]; if alarm features or abnormal tests are present, perform colonoscopy, upper endoscopy, and imaging [^115ktsvE]. Most cases are **functional**, but this approach ensures organic disease is not missed [^111bMMXz].

- **Step 2: Identify risk factors, iatrogenic factors, and previous diagnoses**: To rule out extrinsic risk factors as the cause of chronic diarrhea, it is important to establish if the patient has recently traveled (to regions with specific diarrhea-related pathogens, such as Giardia), undergone gastrointestinal surgery (e.g. gall bladder removal, ileocecal resection, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass), received radiation treatment, or is taking medication that may induce diarrhea. In addition, the presence of mucosal (e.g. celiac disease), hepatic, pancreaticobiliary, neoplastic, or systemic (endocrine, vascular, or immunologic) disease may indicate an increased risk for diarrhea development.

- **Step 3: Rule out alarm features**: Several clinical features suggest the presence of a more serious disease, making it important to rule out any of the following: recent onset, especially among older patients; nocturnal diarrhea; severe or progressively worsening symptoms; unexplained weight loss; a family history of gastroenterological or systemic disease, such as celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or colorectal cancer; the presence of blood in the stool; and unexplained iron deficiency.

- **Step 4: Initial laboratory workup**: The history and physical examination should guide the diagnostic strategy. If alarm signs or symptoms are present, testing should be based on the most likely etiologic causes. For example, in individuals presenting with chronic meal-related fatty–greasy diarrhea in association with weight loss and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies, a workup for further diagnosis is recommended.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of functional dyspepsia [^11473sMX]. Gut (2022). Low credibility.

Although from a scientific and research perspective, the Rome IV process may have improved the specificity of diagnostic criteria for FD, the Rome Foundation has recently acknowledged that the restrictive symptom duration required limits the applicability of the Rome IV criteria for FD in routine clinical practice and could potentially delay its diagnosis and subsequent treatment. This issue has also been highlighted by global epidemiological studies that have demonstrated a much lower prevalence of FD using the Rome IV criteria compared with previous iterations. In this context, the Rome Foundation has therefore developed less restrictive 'clinical criteria' for use in routine clinical practice. These clinical criteria for FD only require the cardinal symptoms to have been present for eight weeks but are otherwise unchanged.

- **Emerging evidence**: There is emerging evidence that the future classification of FD may benefit from incorporating clinical features beyond upper gastrointestinal symptoms. Recent data using latent class analysis have identified discrete patient phenotypes based on the relative extent of coexisting extraintestinal and psychological symptoms. However, the clinical utility of this novel approach requires further validation.

- **Overlap with gastroparesis**: Of particular importance, FD and gastroparesis are symptom-based constructs with significant overlapping features, which cannot be fully distinguished on the basis of either symptoms or gastric emptying studies. The gastroparesis construct may over-emphasize motor deficits to the detriment of a more holistic approach.

### An approach to the patient with chronic undiagnosed abdominal pain [^114HA7ey]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common reason for referral to a gastroenterologist. The workup of patients with chronic abdominal pain can be extremely challenging, as clinicians are responsible for determining whether the patient can be observed or treated symptomatically, or if this abdominal pain heralds a more systemic disease. The differential is typically wide, and given the innervation of the abdomen, localization of abdominal pain does not always provide clear insight into the etiology.

This review attempts to help the gastroenterologist narrow down that broad differential and focus on key elements of the patient visit. We emphasize the importance of a detailed history from the patient, along with review-specific details of their history and physical examination that can provide clues about the etiology of the abdominal pain.

- **Causes of diffuse abdominal pain**: We review the causes of diffuse abdominal pain that may not first be considered, along with uncommon causes of localized abdominal pain.
- **Functional causes of abdominal pain**: We also review the functional causes of abdominal pain and the importance of identifying these disorders to avoid unnecessary testing that commonly occurs with these patients.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of functional dyspepsia [^11376o7Q]. Gut (2022). Low credibility.

The management of dyspepsia in primary care involves an empirical approach based on the knowledge of the patient, their circumstances, and the requirement to manage symptoms. General practitioners (GPs) must also consider the need to avoid overwhelming secondary care services and balance any requirement for referral with patient-related factors. A key first step in the initial management is the exclusion of the possibility of upper gastrointestinal cancer by judicious application of alarm symptoms and signs. However, the performance of these in predicting malignancy as a cause of dyspepsia is modest, possibly due to the absence of a clear definition of each (e.g. the amount of weight that needs to be lost to qualify as an alarm symptom).

As symptoms alone do not discriminate functional dyspepsia (FD) from organic conditions, historically, prompt endoscopy was considered mandatory to exclude gastro-oesophageal malignancy in all patients with dyspepsia. However, the yield of this approach to detect cancer is low. A previous systematic review and meta-analysis of studies performing endoscopy in individuals with dyspepsia in the community demonstrated that 13% had erosive oesophagitis, 8% peptic ulcer, and less than 0.5% gastro-oesophageal malignancy. The remaining 80% of individuals had a normal endoscopy and were therefore likely to have FD. Given this meta-analysis included several studies conducted over 20 years ago, prior to the widespread use of H. pylori eradication therapy and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), this suggests that the prevelance of organic pathology has changed over time.

### Digestive symptoms in COVID-19 patients with mild disease severity: Clinical presentation, stool viral RNA testing, and outcomes [^113wYdiK]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) most commonly presents with respiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, and sore throat. However, digestive symptoms also occur in patients with COVID-19 and are often described in outpatients with less severe disease. In this study, we sought to describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms and mild disease severity.

- **Methods**: We identified COVID-19 patients with mild disease and one or more digestive symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting), with or without respiratory symptoms, and compared them with a group presenting solely with respiratory symptoms. We followed up with patients clinically until they tested negative for COVID-19 on at least two sequential respiratory tract specimens collected ≥ 24 hours apart. We then compared the clinical features between those with digestive symptoms and those with respiratory symptoms.

- **Results**: There were 206 patients with low severity COVID-19, including 48 presenting with a digestive symptom alone, 69 with both digestive and respiratory symptoms, and 89 with respiratory symptoms alone. Among the two groups with digestive symptoms, 67 presented with diarrhea, of whom 19.4% experienced diarrhea as the first symptom in their illness course. The diarrhea lasted from 1 to 14 days, with an average duration of 5.4 ± 3.1 days and a frequency of 4.3 ± 2.2 bowel movements per day. Fever was found in 62.4% of patients with a digestive symptom. Patients with digestive symptoms presented for care later than those with respiratory symptoms.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of functional dyspepsia [^114UTqsE]. Gut (2022). Low credibility.

Over the last 35 years, definitions of dyspepsia have evolved from a broad one, which included any symptom felt to be attributable to the stomach and duodenum, such as heartburn, nausea, or vomiting, to one that includes only the cardinal symptoms of epigastric pain or burning, postprandial fullness, or early satiation. Early satiation is the feeling of fullness during ingestion of a meal, which acts as a terminating factor. Recent definitions recognize that belching, nausea, or upper abdominal bloating can also be present, but heartburn alone is not a symptom of dyspepsia, although it can coexist. Vomiting is atypical and, if present, should prompt consideration of another disorder. Functional dyspepsia (FD) is diagnosed in the absence of a structural abnormality to explain the symptoms. Therefore, to make a diagnosis, by definition, patients need to have been investigated to exclude evidence of organic, systemic, or metabolic disease.

Symptoms alone are not reliable in distinguishing functional from organic causes of dyspepsia. Nevertheless, 80% of people with dyspepsia will be diagnosed with FD following endoscopy. FD is defined according to symptom-based diagnostic criteria developed by the Rome Foundation and is classified into two distinct subtypes: postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) and epigastric pain syndrome (EPS). Clinically, the EPS subtype separates those with epigastric pain or burning that is often present regardless of meals, from those with PDS who report early satiation and postprandial fullness, mainly triggered by meals.

### Insights into the evaluation and management of dyspepsia: Recent developments and new guidelines [^113qea4V]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

If symptoms were a good discriminator for the likelihood of a patient with dyspepsia having an underlying organic pathology, this would greatly aid the physician in their clinical assessment; however, this is not the case. A previous systematic review of diagnostic test studies demonstrated convincingly that a physician's opinion, based on symptoms reported by the patient, had limited diagnostic ability to discriminate between organic causes of dyspepsia and functional dyspepsia (FD).

Historically, FD was referred to as nonulcer dyspepsia, creating the impression that the diagnosis was based on the absence of specific underlying organic pathology and thus encouraging investigations in all patients. Although the terminology has changed more recently, FD remains a diagnosis of exclusion. The Rome Foundation, the expert group responsible for classifying all functional gastrointestinal disorders, defines FD using the Rome IV criteria as bothersome postprandial fullness, early satiety, epigastric pain, or epigastric burning, in the absence of structural disease, including at upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, which would explain the symptoms. According to these criteria, the condition is subgrouped into two separate syndromes:

- **Epigastric pain syndrome (EPS)**: Consists of intermittent pain or burning in the epigastrium, occurring at least once per week. The pain may be either induced or relieved by eating but may also occur while fasting. However, it should not fulfill biliary pain criteria.

- **Postprandial distress syndrome (PDS)**: Defined by postprandial epigastric discomfort.

### Insights into the evaluation and management of dyspepsia: recent developments and new guidelines [^116vXvgx]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Dyspepsia refers to a range of upper GI symptoms, including epigastric pain or burning, early satiety, and postprandial fullness. Patients presenting with these symptoms can be broadly thought of as belonging to one of three groups: those with uninvestigated dyspepsia, in whom investigation has yet to be performed in order to reveal the underlying diagnosis; those in whom investigation has revealed a specific organic or structural cause for their symptoms; and those where no organic cause is found, who are deemed to have functional dyspepsia (FD).

Organic or structural causes of dyspeptic symptoms include chronic Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and peptic ulcer disease, upper GI cancer, biliary and gallstone disease, and pancreatic disease, including pancreatic cancer. In such cases, patient management is disease-specific. The difficulty lies in identifying which patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia need to undergo further tests, as well as managing those patients where investigation fails to reveal an underlying organic diagnosis, and who are therefore labeled as having FD.

### Double trouble: Ten-year-old girl with chronic diarrhea and acute abdominal pain [^112zC76t]. Clinical Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Cryptosporidium parvum is a zoonotic protozoal infection commonly transmitted to humans via water contaminated with feces containing oocysts. In the United States, cows are a common reservoir. Studies have shown high rates of colonization of Cryptosporidium in pre-weaned calves, such as the Holstein calves for which our patient was caring prior to admission. In developing countries, parasitic infections, particularly Ascaris lumbricoides, have been associated with intussusceptions.

The typical presentation of cryptosporidiosis includes nonbloody, watery diarrhea, poor appetite, and crampy abdominal pain; systemic symptoms such as fevers, myalgias, and chills are not typically present. In immunocompetent patients, the symptoms normally last several weeks at most. If the patient is immunocompromised, symptoms can progress to extraintestinal manifestations such as hepatitis, pancreatitis, and cholangitis. Diagnosis involves polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies on stool samples; older methods included microscopy with a modified acid-base fast stain. Treatment is usually not required unless a patient is immunocompromised, as the symptoms are self-limiting. For an immunosuppressed patient or a prolonged duration of symptoms, a 3-day course of nitazoxanide is first-line therapy. In addition, it is imperative to counsel the patient to limit further exposure to the reservoir if identified, as well as to practice good hand hygiene.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic management of post-gastric bypass chronic diarrhea: A systematic review [^115325sS]. Obesity Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

There is a lack of recommendations regarding the exploration and treatment of chronic diarrhea following gastric bypass, although it is a common side effect of this surgery. The electronic databases MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched until July 2018. Of the 553 articles identified, 35 articles were included. Intestinal bacterial overgrowth and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency are the main etiologies of diarrhea following gastric bypass.

- **Diagnostic approach**: The diagnostic approach must begin by eliminating infectious causes of diarrhea. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency can be diagnosed with fecal fat quantification or fecal elastase 1 level evaluation. A positive lactulose breath test confirms suspicion of small intestine bacterial overgrowth.

In conclusion, we propose sequential exploration and treatment of the possible etiologies of diarrhea depending on clinical symptoms.

### Current management strategies and emerging treatments for functional dyspepsia [^112rWXy9]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Functional dyspepsia refers to painful and nonpainful symptoms that are perceived to arise in the upper digestive tract but are not secondary to organic, systemic, or metabolic diseases. The symptoms of this syndrome often overlap with those of GERD and IBS, making its management far from simple. If Helicobacter pylori infection is diagnosed in patients with functional dyspepsia, it should be treated. In patients with mild or intermittent symptoms, reassurance and lifestyle advice might be sufficient; in patients not responding to these measures, or in those with more severe symptoms, drug therapy should be considered.

- **Initial pharmacotherapy**: Both PPIs and prokinetics can be used based on symptom patterns — a PPI is more likely to be effective in the presence of retrosternal or epigastric burning or epigastric pain, whereas a prokinetic is more effective in dyspepsia with early satiation or postprandial fullness. Although combinations of PPIs and prokinetics might have additive symptomatic effects, single-drug therapy is initially preferable.

- **Treatment considerations for nonresponders**: Antidepressants or referral to a psychiatrist or psychotherapist can be considered in nonresponders and in those whose symptoms have a marked effect on daily functioning.

Despite extensive research, functional dyspepsia treatment often remains unsatisfactory. Better characterization of dyspeptic subgroups and understanding underlying mechanisms will enable treatment advances to be made in the future.

### Insights into the evaluation and management of dyspepsia: Recent developments and new guidelines [^113LA7E4]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

In the case of both EPS and PDS, although heartburn is not a dyspeptic symptom, it may often coexist. Symptoms that are relieved by the passage of gas or feces should generally not be considered part of dyspepsia. Persistent vomiting should prompt consideration of an alternative diagnosis. Patients may have both EPS and PDS, and studies in secondary care have demonstrated overlap between the two disorders in up to one-third of patients with FD.

Patients may struggle to interpret what is meant by verbal descriptions of dyspepsia symptoms. There is some evidence that representing symptoms using pictograms, as shown in Figure 2, can improve the concordance of symptom evaluation between patients and physicians, and may therefore be a useful tool in the assessment of the dyspeptic patient.

- **Figure 2**: Pictograms showing the cardinal symptoms of functional dyspepsia (adapted from Tack and colleagues).

In a large validation study of the previous iteration, the Rome III criteria, 1452 consecutive adult patients with undifferentiated GI symptoms in secondary care underwent a complete upper GI endoscopy. The reference standard used to define the presence of true FD was epigastric pain, early satiety, or postprandial fullness, with no organic disease at endoscopy. Overall, 50% of patients met the Rome III criteria for FD, of whom 24% were found to have organic pathology detected at endoscopy. The Rome criteria therefore demonstrated disappointing performance in their ability to identify patients with FD prior to performing an upper GI endoscopy and, consequently, avoid unnecessary investigations.

### Involvement of digestive system in COVID-19: Manifestations, pathology, management and challenges [^1132VZhr]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

The pandemic of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has developed as a tremendous threat to global health. Although most COVID-19 patients present with respiratory symptoms, some present with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms like diarrhea, loss of appetite, nausea/vomiting, and abdominal pain as the major complaints. These features may be attributable to the following facts: (a) COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), was found to be highly expressed in GI epithelial cells, providing a prerequisite for SARS-CoV-2 infection; (b) SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA has been found in stool specimens of infected patients, and 20% of patients showed prolonged presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fecal samples after the virus converted to negative in the respiratory system. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be able to actively infect and replicate in the GI tract. Moreover, GI infection could be the first manifestation antedating respiratory symptoms; patients suffering only digestive symptoms but no respiratory symptoms as clinical manifestations have also been reported. Thus, the implications of digestive symptoms in patients with COVID-19 are of great importance.

In this review, we summarize recent findings on the epidemiology of GI tract involvement, potential mechanisms of fecal-oral transmission, GI and liver manifestations, pathological/histological features in patients with COVID-19, and the diagnosis and management of patients with pre-existing GI and liver diseases.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for esophageal dysphagia, specifically in relation to differential diagnosis, the AGA 2024 guidelines recommend evaluating for non-eosinophilic esophagitis, eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease, hypereosinophilic syndrome, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. This is particularly important for patients presenting with esophageal symptoms in the context of hypereosinophilia (absolute eosinophil count > 1,500 cells/mcL).

### Insights into the evaluation and management of dyspepsia: recent developments and new guidelines [^114guarj]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Dyspepsia is a very common gastrointestinal (GI) condition worldwide. We critically examine the recommendations of recently published guidelines for the management of dyspepsia, including those produced jointly by the American College of Gastroenterology and the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology, and those published by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.

Dyspepsia is a symptom complex, characterized by a range of upper GI symptoms including epigastric pain or burning, early satiety, and post-prandial fullness. Although alarm features are used to help prioritize access to upper GI endoscopy, they are of limited utility in predicting endoscopic findings, and the majority of patients with dyspepsia will have no organic pathology identified at upper GI endoscopy. These patients are labeled as having functional dyspepsia (FD).

The Rome IV criteria, which are used to define FD, further subclassify patients with FD as having either epigastric pain syndrome or post-prandial distress syndrome, depending on their predominant symptoms. Unfortunately, the Rome criteria perform poorly at identifying FD without the need for upper GI endoscopy. This has led to the investigation of alternative diagnostic approaches, including whether a capsaicin pill or combined serum biomarkers can accurately identify patients with FD. However, there is insufficient evidence to support either of these approaches at present.

Patients with FD should be tested for H. pylori infection and be prescribed eradication therapy if they test positive.

### Expert consensus document: Advances in the diagnosis and classification of gastric and intestinal motility disorders [^112QzyJT]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Disturbances of gastric, intestinal, and colonic motor and sensory functions affect a large proportion of the population worldwide, impair quality of life, and cause considerable health-care costs. Assessment of gastrointestinal motility in these patients can serve to establish diagnosis and to guide therapy. Major advances in diagnostic techniques during the past 5–10 years have led to this update about indications for, selection, and performance of currently available tests.

As symptoms have poor concordance with gastrointestinal motor dysfunction, clinical motility testing is indicated in patients in whom there is no evidence of causative mucosal or structural diseases, such as inflammatory or malignant disease. Transit tests using radiopaque markers, scintigraphy, breath tests, and wireless motility capsules are noninvasive. Other tests of gastrointestinal contractility or sensation usually require intubation and typically represent second-line investigations limited to patients with severe symptoms, performed only at specialized centers.

This consensus statement details recommended tests as well as useful clinical alternatives for investigation of gastric, small bowel, and colonic motility. The article provides recommendations on how to classify gastrointestinal motor disorders based on test results and describes how these results guide treatment decisions.

### Dyspepsia and gastric emptying in end-stage renal disease patients on hemodialysis [^111nzV1A]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

The most common non-renal complaints in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are gastrointestinal symptoms such as heartburn, constipation, diarrhea, and dyspepsia. Dyspepsia is highly prevalent and characterized by upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, upper abdominal bloating, and early satiety. The prevalence of dyspepsia among HD patients varies between 48% and 70%. In the general population, dyspepsia has been shown to impair quality of life. Nevertheless, dyspeptic symptoms are not widely investigated among patients treated by HD, as is usually the case in relation to cardiovascular disease, osteodystrophy, and nutritional status.

Dyspepsia may have organic and functional causes. Like in the general population, functional dyspepsia is the most frequent among ESRD patients. There are reports of the possible role of gastric emptying delay as a cause of dyspeptic symptoms in HD patients. Gastroparesis is better recognized in diabetics; however, its presence is also high in all-cause ESRD, varying between 36% to 62% among patients undergoing chronic HD. In these patients, delay in gastric emptying can be related to malnutrition and hormonal and electrolytic disturbances.

Dyspepsia can be easily evaluated through a questionnaire about characteristic symptoms, although gastric emptying time is not so easily assessed. The tools available to estimate gastric emptying time are technetium-99 m scintigraphy (gold standard); time of appearance of acetaminophen in blood after its ingestion; imaging studies using 3D ultrasonography and nuclear resonance.

### Dyspepsia [^111wArcH]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

A variety of organic diseases can cause dyspepsia, but most patients with epigastric pain have functional dyspepsia. As dyspepsia is common and usually has a benign cause, it is not possible to fully investigate everyone with epigastric pain. Recommendations suggest that young patients without alarm symptoms can be treated empirically with a Helicobacter pylori test and treated with proton pump inhibitor therapy for those who test negative or remain symptomatic despite treatment for their H. pylori. Patients who remain symptomatic with this strategy may be further investigated with endoscopy, although most will have functional dyspepsia.

- **Recent findings**: There are a large number of trials for prokinetic therapy in functional dyspepsia, but treatment efficacy is uncertain, as there is evidence of publication bias. There are very limited data on the effectiveness of tricyclic antidepressants in functional dyspepsia. There has been recent interest in the observation that patients with functional dyspepsia have increased eosinophils in the duodenum, which may be accompanied by other subtle manifestations of upregulated mucosal immunity. It is possible that this is being driven by a dietary substance or by a change in the upper gut microbiome.

- **Summary**: The initial management of dyspepsia is well established, but how to manage those who do not respond is a challenge. Future studies evaluating diet and altering the gut microbiome may provide clinicians with more therapeutic options.

### Abdominal pain in a 5-year-old boy [^117Y27Ar]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

A 5-year-old male presented with a 1-day history of vomiting, epigastric pain, loose stools, and poor oral intake. The child had experienced intermittent symptoms of abdominal pain and vomiting for the past 2 years, and there was a strong family history of chronic hereditary pancreatitis. A random serum amylase was elevated at 2320 IU/l. An abdominal ultrasound scan revealed no abnormalities. Based on the family history, positive symptoms, and elevated amylase, a diagnosis of hereditary pancreatitis was made. The child received symptomatic management and treatment for his acute illness. He is currently awaiting results from molecular testing.

### Double trouble: Ten-year-old girl with chronic diarrhea and acute abdominal pain [^113Xdkk7]. Clinical Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

It is important to distinguish that there are two related but distinct pathological conditions in our patient described above. Failure to realize this could yield an inaccurate or incomplete diagnosis and a poor patient outcome. Therefore, it was important to generate two separate differential diagnoses in this case, one for acute abdominal pain and one for chronic secretory diarrhea.

- **Abdominal pain diagnoses**: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was less likely with a stable weight, normal ESR (of 3), normal albumin, normal hemoglobin, and no inflammatory cells in the stool. Transglutaminase IgA and IgG were both negative, reducing the likelihood of celiac disease. Appendicitis, pyelonephritis, and cholecystitis were ruled out with MRI on admission. Ovarian torsion was also unlikely as her ovaries were visualized and normal on the MRI. Urinalysis on admission was negative for hemoglobin and microscopy showed only 5 to 10 RBCs, making nephrolithiasis possible but less likely than other entities. Urine culture grew 10,000 colonies of E. coli, but the patient denied dysuria, urinary frequency, urgency, or flank pain, so it was unlikely to be a urinary tract infection (UTI) or pyelonephritis. An abdominal X-ray was negative for small bowel obstruction. Peptic ulcer disease was less likely due to the location and episodic nature of her abdominal pain, which was unrelated to the timing of meals. Malignancy was less likely due to the acute nature of the pain and lack of weight changes, fevers, or mass/lymphadenopathy on MRI. Lipase and MRI were negative for acute pancreatitis.

A 46-year-old previously healthy woman presented with dyspnea, fatigue, and diarrhea. She had been experiencing these symptoms for over a year, but they had worsened in the few weeks prior to presentation. She had become progressively dyspneic on exertion and at rest and had increased the number of pillows she was sleeping on at night. She reported having episodes of nonbloody, watery diarrhea five to six times a day; these episodes were not associated with abdominal pain or recent travel and occurred even with fasting. A review of systems was positive for intermittent hot flashes, heart palpitations, and myalgias. She was premenopausal.

She denied fever, weight loss, cough, hemoptysis, chest pain, or new edema. She had a pertinent medical history of gastritis, a nonspecific murmur since childhood, tobacco use with a five pack-year history, and a family history of non-first-degree relatives having lung, breast, and colon cancer. She had not received medical care since moving from Brazil to the United States four years earlier.

### Psychological illness is commonly associated with functional gastrointestinal disorders and is important to consider during patient consultation: A population-based study [^116ZGCfU]. BMC Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are common and are reported within three months by almost every other adult in Western countries, such as the UK, Sweden, the United States, and Australia. The most common symptoms are gastroesophageal reflux symptoms/disease (GERS) and dyspepsia originating from the upper GI tract, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) from the lower GI tract. Prevalence rates are reported to be 25% for both GERS and dyspepsia and about 12% for IBS. Although intermittent, these disorders may linger in many sufferers. The total cost of dyspepsia to society, considering both with and without peptic ulcer disease, GERS, and IBS, is considerable. Thus, these disorders constitute a significant public health problem.

Dyspepsia without peptic ulcer disease (PUD) or any other organic GI disease is referred to as functional dyspepsia. In a Swedish population-based upper endoscopy study, the prevalence of dyspepsia was 38% and the prevalence of PUD was 4%, with about a quarter of the PUD subjects having no GI symptoms. Thus, the vast majority of those reporting dyspepsia in the population can be expected to have functional dyspepsia. IBS is classified as a functional gastrointestinal disorder. Although functional dyspepsia and IBS are considered separate disorders, many individuals report concomitant symptoms thought to originate from both the upper and lower GI tract. Additionally, sufferers may experience a change in predominant symptom profile over time between dyspepsia and IBS, but much less frequently towards GERS. This indicates that dyspepsia and IBS sufferers…

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^114TeDKQ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Typical of complex, ambiguous cases in the early stage, the clinician appropriately considers a very broad differential diagnosis. Three categories — infection, autoimmune conditions, and malignancy — provide structure for thinking through this case. The clinician uses the patient's age, gender, and significant travel history to help focus the extensive differential diagnosis in each category. The problem representation is now: a 43-year-old woman with acute, unremitting left upper quadrant (LUQ) pain and a subacute history of night sweats, weight loss, and recent travel to Mexico.

She was in moderate distress due to abdominal pain. Her temperature was 38.1°C, blood pressure 96/43 mmHg, heart rate 125 beats per minute, and respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. She had scleral icterus. Lung and heart exams were normal except for tachycardia. The abdomen was nondistended with normal bowel sounds but diffusely tender, particularly in the LUQ. Liver span was 15 cm to percussion, and the spleen was not palpable. She had no peritoneal signs or costovertebral angle tenderness, and a pelvic examination was normal. Her neurological and skin examinations were normal.

Her appearance and vital signs suggest the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which requires prompt evaluation, stabilization, and usually empiric antibiotic treatment. Jaundice, fever, and abdominal pain prioritize acute bacterial cholangitis as an immediate concern, despite the uncertainty surrounding the nature of the subacute underlying illness. Hepatomegaly is typically explained by liver inflammation, infiltration, or congestion.

Our patient originally presented to our hospital with acute abdominal pain secondary to an acute small bowel-to-small bowel intussusception. However, she also had underlying chronic (over 4 weeks' duration) secretory diarrhea, caused by the parasite Cryptosporidium parvum. This parasitic bowel infection likely caused small bowel edema, which was the impetus for her to develop an intussusception of her bowel. The electrolyte and metabolic derangements were a result of chronic diarrhea and acute anorexia.

### Alarm symptoms and identification of non-cancer diagnoses in primary care: Cohort study [^1131ooS8]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

The interpretation of our findings depends significantly on the clinical context in which the alarm symptom is presented, particularly concerning the presence of other symptoms or signs that may affect the diagnostic probability of a serious organic problem. For example, patients with haemoptysis who are febrile and coughing up infected sputum are more likely to have an infective cause for their symptoms than someone experiencing haemoptysis in the context of acute onset pleuritic chest pain. Similarly, haematuria accompanied by dysuria and urinary frequency is more likely to relate to a urinary tract infection than when the symptom occurs without pain and bladder function disturbance. Dysphagia, particularly when progressive and absent of symptoms indicative of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, should be taken seriously. Our data suggest that dysphagia is an important alarm symptom for diagnosing cancer or oesophageal stricture.

Rectal bleeding remains problematic; determining whether the lower diagnostic rates at 90 days and three years warrant investigation involves clinical judgment. Due to the frequent co-existence of perianal and more serious large bowel lesions, the presence of perianal pain or local bleeding should not exclude colon cancer. It is likely that persistent, unexplained rectal bleeding merits urgent investigation. It remains unclear from our data whether rectal bleeding serves as a valuable alarm symptom for the presence of inflammatory bowel conditions.

### Challenging diagnosis of indolent systemic mastocytosis isolated to the GI tract [^117NEdb8]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Mastocytosis is a rare group of disorders that presents with heterogeneous phenotypes depending on the organ system involved. In the absence of cutaneous involvement — mast cell aggregates that may present as papules, nodules, or plaques — classically associated with indolent systemic mastocytosis (SM), the diagnosis of this rare condition is particularly challenging. When localized to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, symptoms of indolent SM are often non-specific and mimic common conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel syndrome. Diagnosis may be suspected by clinical presentation, but biopsy with histopathological analysis is necessary to confirm. We present a rare case of indolent SM without cutaneous features. In the absence of typical cutaneous features, indolent SM should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a patient with persistent GI symptoms refractory to medical treatment, as failure to do so can lead to a delay in the appropriate diagnosis and treatment.

### Expert consensus document: Advances in the diagnosis and classification of gastric and intestinal motility disorders [^115ktsvE]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

Clinical application of motility testing:

- Before investigation of gastrointestinal motor function, mucosal or structural diseases such as inflammatory or malignant disease should be excluded. Symptoms of gastrointestinal motor disorders are nonspecific: dysmotility cannot be differentiated from inflammatory or malignant disease on the basis of patient history alone. For example, epigastric pain, early satiety, and abdominal fullness are typical symptoms of gastroparesis but can also be due to gastroduodenal ulcers or gastric cancer. Moreover, inflammatory diseases of the small and large bowel are associated with delayed gastric emptying, which can be reversible after treatment of inflammation.

Thus, it is important to first exclude other aetiologies, in particular, mucosal and obstructive lesions, by appropriate investigations such as upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, imaging techniques, and laboratory investigation. Such tests are mandatory in patients with 'red flags' (that is, weight loss, low haemoglobin levels, and substantial episodes of vomiting) but should also be performed if the motility tests are invasive or symptoms are severe. In patients with moderate complaints and no alarm symptoms, noninvasive motility testing might be considered. The selection of tests will also be influenced by availability and the costs of diagnostic procedures in different healthcare systems.

In general, motility investigations are usually limited to patients with relevant complaints that can be related to dysmotility and that markedly affect quality of life and nutrition.

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease, functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome: Common overlapping gastrointestinal disorders [^111bMMXz]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

In 2011, a systematic literature review found that dyspeptic symptoms such as epigastric pain, early satiety, bloating, nausea, and vomiting were more common in patients with frequent GERD symptoms (range 21–63%) than in those with intermittent or no GERD symptoms. A Korean population-based study, using the Rome III criteria, noted an overlap between GERD and uninvestigated dyspepsia in 50% of GERD patients. However, it should be noted that uninvestigated dyspepsia includes patients with an organic, systemic, or metabolic cause for the symptoms that could have been identified by traditional diagnostic procedures, which were not carried out.

A nationwide study of 100,000 individuals investigated the prevalence and overlap of GERD, FD, and IBS in a Western general population by means of a web-based questionnaire survey. Among individuals fulfilling the criteria for GERD, FD, and IBS, 69.3% fulfilled the criteria for only one of the conditions, 22.9% for two, while 7.7% fulfilled the criteria for all three. In the group of individuals meeting the criteria for one or more of the conditions, 30.7% fulfilled the criteria for two or all three conditions.

Interestingly, a study by Pleyer et al. found evidence supporting a systematic bias away from diagnosing FD, favoring a GERD diagnosis. Indeed, the authors assessed survey-based upper gastrointestinal symptom reporting between 1988 and 2009 and, though the majority of subjects (63%) reporting GERD symptoms received a GERD diagnosis, only a minority (13%) of those reporting FD symptoms received a diagnosis.

### Diagnosing the patient with abdominal pain and altered bowel habits: Is it irritable bowel syndrome [^1116jvCm]? American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Diagnosing a patient who presents with abdominal pain and altered bowel habits can be challenging. Although serious organic illnesses can cause these symptoms, irritable bowel syndrome is commonly responsible. It can be difficult to properly evaluate these patients without overusing diagnostic tests and consultation. A practical approach for diagnosing irritable bowel syndrome is suggested, using the Rome II criteria and the presence of alarm symptoms such as weight loss, gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, fever, or frequent nocturnal symptoms as starting points. If there are no alarm symptoms and the Rome II criteria are not met, it is acceptable to reevaluate the patient at a later date. If there are no alarm symptoms and the Rome II criteria are met, the patient should be categorized on the basis of age: patients 50 years or younger can be evaluated on the basis of predominant symptoms — constipation, diarrhea, or abdominal pain. Patients older than 50 years should be fully evaluated and considered for gastroenterology referral. If alarm symptoms are present, a full evaluation should be performed (and gastroenterology referral considered), regardless of the patient's age.

### More, less or both [^116gkcpq]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A 67-year-old Caucasian woman presented to the emergency room of our hospital with complaints of generalised weakness, nausea, diarrhoea, and weight loss. The patient had visited her general practitioner several times in the previous months with complaints of fatigue and generalised weakness. During her recent trip through Africa, she was hospitalised in Morocco and treated for a presumed bacterial enterocolitis, for which she received intravenous fluids and a course of azithromycin. However, the symptoms recurred directly after discharge.

At presentation in our hospital, we saw a weakened but not acutely ill woman. The patient was well orientated in time, place, and person. She had a blood pressure of 85/49 mm Hg, pulse rate of 120 beats/min, and a temperature of 37.4°C. Examination of heart, lungs, and abdomen revealed no abnormalities. No hyperpigmentation of the skin or mucous membranes was found after thorough examination; there was no bulging of the eyes or lid lag. We did not detect any myxoedema. Neurological investigation was without abnormalities, and no signs of myopathy were observed.

### Differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea: An algorithm to distinguish irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea from other organic gastrointestinal diseases, with special focus on exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [^112Rbjc6]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome is the most common cause of diarrhea in the developed world, with an estimated prevalence in the United States of 4% to 9% based on Rome III/IV criteria. Although patients can present with IBS at any age, it is most common in women aged 20 to 40 years, with women being diagnosed about twice as often as men (14% vs. 8.9%).

According to Rome IV clinical criteria, IBS may be diagnosed if abdominal pain is present at least 1 day per week, is associated with changes in visceral perception with defecation and/or alterations in stool form/frequency, and the symptoms affect patients' quality of life or their abilities to carry out normal activities of daily living. While these clinical criteria do not require symptoms to be present for a specific period of time, the practitioner must be confident that other diagnoses have been appropriately excluded. The Rome IV research-based criteria are more stringent, requiring symptoms to be present for the previous 3 months with onset greater than 6 months before diagnosis.

Symptoms not included in the definition of IBS-D, but commonly identified at presentation, include abdominal bloating and/or distension, fecal urgency, sensations of incomplete evacuation, and the passage of mucus in stools. Stools are characteristically watery (Bristol Stool Form Scale 6–7) and passed during waking hours. Stress is a well-known mediator. Importantly, the development of symptoms in those older than 50 years, unintentional weight loss, acute unexplained symptom changes, and rectal bleeding and/or anemia necessitate further investigation.

### Chronic diarrhea: Diagnosis and management [^111sidCd]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic diarrhea, specifically with respect to initial evaluation, the CD-EG 2017 guidelines recommend conducting a careful review of medications because many drugs can cause diarrhea. It is also advised to elicit a history of radiation therapy, as radiation can cause chronic diarrhea, sometimes starting years after exposure.

### Chronic diarrhoea in adults: What not to miss [^1169dzYE]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Chronic diarrhoea remains a diagnostic challenge, with numerous causes and few effective symptomatic treatments. This review focuses on new methods for the diagnosis of common disorders and alerts readers to rarer causes through a systematic approach to the underlying mechanisms.

- **Recent findings**: New strategies are emerging to stratify the need for endoscopic investigation. Faecal immunochemical testing, combined with standard blood tests, shows promise in excluding colorectal cancers, adenoma, and inflammatory bowel disease, challenging the use of faecal calprotectin. Serum analysis for markers of bile acid synthesis has been refined, potentially streamlining diagnostic pathways of bile acid malabsorption for those who are unable to access nuclear medicine scans, but the positive predictive value of faecal elastase in low-prevalence populations has been questioned. Novel markers such as volatile organic compounds and stool DNA analyses continue to develop.

A systematic approach to the investigation of chronic diarrhoea will ensure all relevant causes are considered and minimize the chance of a missed diagnosis. The combination of clinical features with non-invasive testing supports a judicious approach to endoscopic investigations, but further innovation will be needed to resolve the diagnostic challenge that diarrhoea poses.

### A 32-year-old woman with chronic abdominal pain [^111fULgg]. JAMA (2008). Low credibility.

Functional dyspepsia is a highly prevalent disorder that accounts for 5% of visits to primary care clinicians. It frequently coexists with other gastrointestinal tract disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Symptoms of functional dyspepsia, such as epigastric pain, early satiety, and postprandial nausea, are nonspecific, making its diagnosis difficult.

Functional dyspepsia is a heterogeneous disorder involving various pathophysiologic processes, leading to both gastrointestinal sensory and motor dysfunction. Although functional dyspepsia does not impart any increased risks to long-term health, it significantly affects both individuals and society. The economic burden of evaluating and treating functional dyspepsia is estimated to be at least $1 billion per year, and patients with the disorder experience a markedly reduced quality of life. Using the case of Ms. C, an evidence-based approach is applied to highlight knowledge in the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of functional dyspepsia.

### Double trouble: Ten-year-old girl with chronic diarrhea and acute abdominal pain [^116PyqBc]. Clinical Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

We discussed the various diagnoses listed in Table 3 to determine the cause of our patient's diarrhea. She did not take any medications nor use drugs or alcohol. She had no prior surgeries. Given that she was 10 years old, congenital causes and microvillus inclusion disease were very unlikely. There was no family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes; she had no personal history of neuroendocrine tumors and no flushing with illness, all making neuroendocrine tumors unlikely. Hyperthyroidism was also unlikely as she had not experienced palpitations, persistent tachycardia, weight loss, or failure to gain adequate weight in the past. Addison's disease was unlikely given normal skin pigmentation and blood pressures that were normal for age, although she did have mild hyponatremia on admission.

Inflammatory bowel disease was ruled out for reasons mentioned above. Given the relatively short duration of symptoms and few systemic symptoms, infectious causes were at the top of the differential. Viral, bacterial, and parasitic causes of gastroenteritis were evaluated with stool studies starting on day 1 of admission. Her ova and parasite stool study finally established the diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis, which is an infection caused by the organism Cryptosporidium parvum.

### Dyspepsia: organic versus functional [^116Dy5W4]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Dyspepsia is the medical term for difficult digestion. It consists of various symptoms in the upper abdomen, such as fullness, discomfort, early satiation, bloating, heartburn, belching, nausea, vomiting, or pain. The prevalence of dyspepsia in the Western world is approximately 20% to 25%. Dyspepsia can be divided into two main categories: "organic" and "functional dyspepsia" (FD).

- **Organic causes of dyspepsia**: Peptic ulcer, gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastric or esophageal cancer, pancreatic or biliary disorders, intolerance to food or drugs, and other infectious or systemic diseases.

- **Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying FD**: Delayed gastric emptying, impaired gastric accommodation to a meal, hypersensitivity to gastric distension, altered duodenal sensitivity to lipids or acids, altered antroduodenojenunal motility and gastric electrical rhythm, unsuppressed postprandial phasic contractility in the proximal stomach, and autonomic nervous system-central nervous system dysregulation.

- **Pathogenetic factors in FD**: Genetic predisposition, infection from Helicobacter pylori or other organisms, inflammation, and psychosocial factors.

The diagnostic evaluation of dyspepsia includes upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, abdominal ultrasonography, gastric emptying testing (scintigraphy, breath test, ultrasonography, or magnetic resonance imaging), and gastric accommodation evaluation (magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, single-photon emission computed tomography, and barostat). Antroduodenal manometry can be used for the assessment of the myoelectrical activity of the stomach.

### When it is not inflammatory bowel disease: Differential diagnosis [^113aE3qf]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of differential diagnoses for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), which can be challenging to diagnose due to their heterogeneous nature. Classical differential diagnoses include enteric infections and infestations, as well as drug toxicity. Recently, more specific differential diagnoses have been identified, including monogenic causes of gastrointestinal tract inflammation, particularly in young children. This review focuses on differential diagnoses within specific clinical and demographic contexts, particularly for young children, elderly patients, and immunosuppressed patients.

Recent findings highlight the identification of monogenic diseases in young children, colitis associated with diverticular disease in elderly patients, and toxic colitis in patients receiving immunosuppressants such as mycophenolate mofetil or biologics like ipilimumab.

The summary emphasizes the importance for clinicians managing IBD to recognize specific diagnoses that may require different treatments from classical idiopathic IBD.

### Management of diarrhea in patients with carcinoid syndrome [^116qUL8F]. Pancreas (2019). Low credibility.

In assessing a patient with suspected carcinoid syndrome (CS) diarrhea, it is important to differentiate the gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) from diarrhea, abdominal pain, and dyspepsia related to other causes, such as irritable bowel syndrome. This differentiation is achieved by eliciting a thorough patient history that details age, sleep patterns, and nonspecific symptoms. Unfortunately, the literature on the differential diagnosis of CS diarrhea is limited.

Diarrhea in patients with NETs is secretory, typically causing large-volume stools with no osmotic gap between serum and stool, compared with malabsorptive diarrhea in other GI diseases. It may disturb sleep and is associated with bleeding, fever, weight loss, and persistent severe pain.

- **Diagnosis and considerations**: Other causes of secretory diarrhea, such as bile acid-induced diarrhea, medications, infections, and metabolic causes including diabetes mellitus, should be ruled out. Inquiry about ingested laxatives and osmotic agents, such as fructose and artificial sweeteners — common contributors to diarrhea in general — is important.

Diarrhea associated with CS tends to be watery after the first one or two movements, and the frequency of bowel movements can range from 2 to 5 per day to more than 20, which can be extremely debilitating and deleterious to the quality of life. The presence of watery diarrhea, in association with cutaneous facial flushing — especially when linked with evidence of elevated serotonin blood levels — and radiographic evidence of malignancy is almost always indicative of carcinoid syndrome.

### Guidelines for the investigation of chronic diarrhoea in adults: British Society of Gastroenterology, 3rd edition [^111FZHZu]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

These guidelines address the clinical assessment in both primary and secondary care settings for patients experiencing diarrhoea. They emphasize the exclusion of cancer or inflammation and the detection of common disorders such as bile acid diarrhoea, microscopic colitis, lactose malabsorption, or post-radiation diarrhoea. Additionally, they consider rarer causes of malabsorption and surgical disorders. The guideline does not cover therapy options as they are beyond its scope, nor does it address the cost-effectiveness of investigations due to limited available evidence.

- **Summary of all recommendations**: We recommend the following investigation algorithm based on the clinical differential diagnosis.

### Clinical guideline: Management of gastroparesis [^112zGywh]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for gastroparesis, particularly concerning differential diagnosis, the ACG 2013 guidelines recommend considering the presence of rumination syndrome, eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia, and/or cyclic vomiting syndrome, which is defined as episodic episodes of nausea and vomiting, when evaluating patients for gastroparesis. It is important to recognize that these disorders may be associated with delayed gastric emptying, and identifying these disorders may alter management.

### The role of endoscopy in the management of patients with diarrhea [^117Kv6jL]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2010). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic diarrhea, particularly in evaluating malabsorption, the ASGE 2010 guidelines recommend performing an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with a small bowel biopsy in patients with chronic diarrhea or suspected malabsorption. This is advised when the evaluation following a colonoscopy with biopsy remains inconclusive.

### Insights into the evaluation and management of dyspepsia: Recent developments and new guidelines [^116ZwbCe]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Dyspepsia is a very common gastrointestinal (GI) condition worldwide. We critically examine the recommendations of recently published guidelines for the management of dyspepsia, including those produced jointly by the American College of Gastroenterology and the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology, and those published by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.

Dyspepsia is a symptom complex, characterized by a range of upper GI symptoms including epigastric pain or burning, early satiety, and post-prandial fullness. Although alarm features are used to prioritize access to upper GI endoscopy, they have limited utility in predicting endoscopic findings. The majority of patients with dyspepsia will have no organic pathology identified at upper GI endoscopy. These patients are labeled as having functional dyspepsia (FD).

- **Rome IV criteria**: These are used to define FD and further subclassify patients with FD as having either epigastric pain syndrome or post-prandial distress syndrome, depending on their predominant symptoms. Unfortunately, the Rome criteria perform poorly at identifying FD without the need for upper GI endoscopy. This has led to the investigation of alternative diagnostic approaches, including whether a capsaicin pill or combined serum biomarkers can accurately identify patients with FD. However, there is insufficient evidence to support either of these approaches at present.

Patients with FD should be tested for H. pylori infection and be prescribed eradication therapy if they test positive.

### Diagnostic yield of alarm features in irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia [^1157AKFv]. Gut (2004). Low credibility.

The diagnostic value of the addition of alarm symptoms in distinguishing functional from organic gastrointestinal disease remains uncertain. We aimed to establish the value of alarm features in differentiating between organic disease, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and functional dyspepsia (FD).

A total of 568 consecutive patients (63% female; mean age 44.7 years) completed a detailed symptom questionnaire and then received a complete diagnostic workup as required. Questionnaire data were collected prospectively and audited retrospectively; the treating physician was blinded to the results of the questionnaires. Patients were coded and allocated to the following diagnostic groups: IBS, FD, organic diseases of the upper gastrointestinal tract, or organic diseases of the lower gastrointestinal tract. Logistic regression was used to identify the best subset of symptoms that discriminated organic disease from functional illness. Separate models compared IBS (n = 214) with diseases of the lower gastrointestinal tract (n = 66) and FD (n = 70) with diseases of the upper gastrointestinal tract (n = 250).

- **Results**: Age (50 years at symptom onset: odds ratio (OR) 2.65 (95% confidence interval 1.4–5.0); p = 0.002) and blood on the toilet paper (OR 2.7 (1.4–5.1); p = 0.002) emerged as alarm features that discriminated IBS from lower gastrointestinal illness. A diagnosis of IBS was typically associated with female sex (OR 2.5 (1.3–4.6); p = 0.004) and pain on six or more occasions in the previous year (OR 5.0 (2.2–11.1); p < 0.001).

### Multiple balloon-like lesions in the small intestine of an adult with chronic diarrhoea [^113nfeXh]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

A 28-year-old woman presented with a three-year history of chronic watery diarrhoea, along with abdominal pain and bloating, which could mostly be alleviated after defecation. Despite experiencing diarrhoea at least three times a day, her symptoms were not relieved by either probiotics or antidiarrhoeal agents. Over the last month, she experienced a weight loss of 5 kg. She denied any family history of similar conditions, poor vaccine responses, or significant infections in early childhood, except for a history of allergy to intravenous immunoglobulin (Ig), which caused immediate dyspnoea, palpitations, and hypotension.

Laboratory investigations indicated that stool specimens were negative for viruses, parasites, or bacteria. Evaluation revealed a low serum globulin level of 14.5 g/L (reference range, 20–30 g/L). Serum Ig levels were significantly abnormal: IgA < 0.27 g/L (reference range, 0.7–4 g/L), IgM 0.24 g/L (reference range, 0.4–2.3 g/L), and IgG 1.3 g/L (reference range, 7–16 g/L). The white cell count was 15.4 × 10⁹/L (reference range, 3.69–9.16 × 10⁹/L), and C-reactive protein (CRP) was 20.5 mg/L (normal < 10 mg/L). The CD4+/CD8+ lymphocyte ratio was 1.09% (reference range, 1.5%-2%). Other laboratory findings, such as tumour markers, autoantibodies, and HIV tests, were unremarkable.

CT imaging showed mesenteric nodule-like images and thickening of the wall and mucosa in the small intestine. Both peroral and transanal enteroscopy revealed swelling mucosa and continuous granular lesions extending from the duodenum to the middle jejunum, and from the middle ileum to the terminal ileum. Endoscopic images indicated swelling mucosa and dense nodular lesions in the duodenum (Figure 1A), upper jejunum (Figure 1B), upper ileum (Figure 1C), and terminal ileum (Figure 1D).

### Insights into the evaluation and management of dyspepsia: recent developments and new guidelines [^116VMsmH]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The recent ACG/CAG guideline proposes a more pragmatic clinical definition of dyspepsia: predominant epigastric pain lasting at least one month, which may be associated with other upper GI symptoms such as epigastric fullness, nausea, vomiting, or heartburn, provided that epigastric pain is the patient's primary concern. However, this definition has not been validated in a clinical study, and it places the emphasis on the presence of epigastric pain, despite the extremely common reporting of postprandial symptoms by patients with dyspepsia.

- **The role of upper GI endoscopy**: Any uncertainty over whether a patient's dyspeptic symptoms have an organic or functional cause can, for the most part, be addressed by undertaking upper GI endoscopy, although in the case of suspected biliary or pancreatic disease, an abdominal ultrasound scan might also be necessary. However, a previous systematic review and meta-analysis has shown that more than 70% of people will be labeled as having functional dyspepsia following upper GI endoscopy. Recent guidelines recommend the targeted use of endoscopic investigation in patients with specific indications.
