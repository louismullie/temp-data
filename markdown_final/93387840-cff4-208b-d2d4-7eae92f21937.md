## Question

When does baby that passes meconium need a bill check

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when a baby who has passed meconium needs a bilirubin check. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether meconium passage itself changes the timing or need for bilirubin screening. Then, I should verify the universal bilirubin screening recommendations and the 24–48 hour window. Next, I will consider exceptions such as jaundice appearing before 24 hours, high-risk features, or prolonged meconium passage suggesting obstruction. Finally, I will integrate these into a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and confirm follow-up plans if discharge occurs earlier than 24 hours.

> Let me first confirm the core principle: passing meconium is a normal newborn process and, by itself, is not an indication to order a bilirubin test outside of standard screening protocols. I should double-check that no guideline lists meconium passage as a standalone trigger for bilirubin measurement, and indeed, the AAP hyperbilirubinemia guideline does not include meconium as a risk factor mandating earlier or additional bilirubin testing [^113cBcwh].

> Next, I should review the universal screening recommendation. The AAP recommends measuring transcutaneous or total serum bilirubin in all infants between 24 and 48 hours of age, or before discharge if that occurs earlier, and this applies regardless of whether the infant has passed meconium. I need to ensure I cite the correct key action statement, which is KAS 5 in the 2022 revision [^113cBcwh] [^113GHdac].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — if jaundice is visible before 24 hours, that is a different scenario. I should confirm that jaundice in the first 24 hours is considered pathologic and warrants immediate total serum bilirubin measurement, which the AAP explicitly recommends, and this remains true even if meconium has already been passed [^115NLkzy].

> I will now examine indirect associations where meconium might signal higher risk. Meconium-stained amniotic fluid correlates with conditions that increase hyperbilirubinemia risk, such as maternal intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, which raises fetal risk for meconium passage and neonatal jaundice; however, the screening timing still follows the 24–48 hour rule, with closer follow-up if risk factors are present, rather than an automatic early bilirubin check solely for meconium [^113cBcwh].

> But wait, what if the infant has not passed meconium by 48 hours or has delayed stooling with poor intake? I should consider that prolonged failure to pass meconium can reflect obstruction or inadequate feeding, both of which can worsen jaundice via increased enterohepatic circulation; in such cases, I need to check bilirubin promptly if jaundice is present and address the underlying cause, even though the timing still aligns with clinical judgment rather than a meconium-specific bilirubin rule [^113ztPLu] [^116H4vvb].

> Let me think about preterm infants, where meconium passage is often delayed. The AAP guideline scope is infants 35 weeks and older; for those under 35 weeks, care is typically in the NICU with different thresholds, but the principle remains that meconium passage alone does not dictate bilirubin timing — gestational age, age in hours, and clinical risk factors guide when to measure bilirubin and how closely to monitor [^113bTNbR] [^113ucFkm].

> I should confirm discharge planning details. If an infant is discharged before 24 hours, a follow-up bilirubin check is still recommended between 24 and 48 hours of life, and if reliable follow-up cannot be arranged, discharge should be delayed; again, this applies irrespective of meconium status, reinforcing that meconium passage does not alter the standard schedule [^113cBcwh] [^11474ux5].

> Putting this together, my practical, risk-stratified answer is: all infants should have bilirubin measured between 24 and 48 hours of age or before discharge if earlier, regardless of meconium passage. If jaundice is visible before 24 hours, obtain total serum bilirubin immediately. If meconium has not been passed by 48 hours or there are signs of poor intake, dehydration, or obstruction, assess and check bilirubin if jaundice is present or risk is high. Meconium passage alone neither accelerates nor delays the standard bilirubin screening timeline [^113cBcwh] [^113GHdac] [^115NLkzy] [^113ztPLu].

---

All babies who pass meconium should have **bilirubin checked at 24–48 hours of life** [^113cBcwh] or before discharge if earlier, because meconium passage is common and does not by itself indicate higher jaundice risk [^111Nwzs1]. If jaundice is visible **before 24 hours** [^115NLkzy], obtain a **total serum bilirubin (TSB)** immediately, as this is a red flag for pathologic jaundice. For infants discharged before 24 hours, arrange follow-up bilirubin testing within 48 hours [^113cBcwh]. Routine early bilirubin checks are not indicated solely for meconium passage; use standard risk-based screening and clinical judgment [^111Nwzs1].

---

## Clinical significance of meconium passage

Meconium passage is a normal process; **approximately 13% of live births** involve meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) [^111dCznN]. Historically, MSAF was linked to fetal distress and increased risk of meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) [^116XeGDm]; however, contemporary practice recognizes that meconium passage alone does not reliably predict neonatal morbidity or hyperbilirubinemia [^116YNS7T]. The presence of meconium may reflect normal gastrointestinal maturation or transient fetal hypoxia, but it is not an independent risk factor for severe hyperbilirubinemia [^116XeGDm].

---

## Current guidelines for bilirubin screening

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) provides clear guidance on **neonatal bilirubin screening**:

- **Universal screening**: All newborns should have bilirubin measured between 24 and 48 hours of life [^113cBcwh] or before discharge if earlier [^113GHdac].

- **Early jaundice**: If jaundice is observed before 24 hours, measure TSB immediately, as this is a red flag for pathologic jaundice [^115NLkzy].

- **Discharge before 24 hours**: If discharged before 24 hours, arrange follow-up bilirubin testing within 48 hours [^113cBcwh].

These recommendations apply to all infants, regardless of meconium passage, and are designed to detect significant hyperbilirubinemia early and prevent bilirubin encephalopathy [^111y5X1n].

---

## Specific considerations for infants passing meconium

While meconium passage itself does not mandate early bilirubin testing, clinicians should remain vigilant for **associated risk factors** that may increase the likelihood of hyperbilirubinemia:

- **Early jaundice**: Jaundice appearing within the first 24 hours of life [^115NLkzy] warrants immediate TSB measurement [^115NLkzy].

- **Poor feeding**: Inadequate intake or dehydration can exacerbate jaundice and may necessitate earlier bilirubin assessment [^113ztPLu].

- **Prolonged meconium passage**: Delayed transition from meconium to transitional stools may indicate underlying gastrointestinal issues, but it does not independently require early bilirubin testing [^113ztPLu].

---

## Clinical judgment and individualized care

Clinicians should integrate clinical judgment with **standardized guidelines** [^111Nwzs1]. If an infant passing meconium exhibits additional risk factors — such as prematurity, low birth weight, maternal diabetes, or hemolytic disease — earlier bilirubin testing may be warranted. Conversely, a healthy, term infant passing meconium without other risk factors should follow the standard screening schedule [^113cBcwh].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended action** |
|-|-|
| All infants | Bilirubin screening at 24–48 hours or before discharge if earlier [^113cBcwh] |
| Jaundice observed before 24 hours | Immediate TSB measurement [^115NLkzy] |
| Discharge before 24 hours | Follow-up bilirubin testing within 48 hours [^113cBcwh] |
| Meconium passage alone | No additional bilirubin testing required |

---

Infants who pass meconium should have **bilirubin checked at 24–48 hours of life** [^113cBcwh] or before discharge if earlier, consistent with universal screening guidelines. Early bilirubin testing is indicated only if jaundice appears before 24 hours [^115NLkzy] or if other risk factors are present. Meconium passage alone does not necessitate early or additional bilirubin testing.

It is reasonable to assume that an umbilical cord stained green is due to the baby having passed meconium in utero. We describe a newborn baby in whom there was a delay in diagnosing an imperforate anus because the baby's umbilical cord was stained green with bile and it was assumed that the baby had passed meconium in utero.

### A review of the current policies and guidance regarding APGAR scoring and the detection of jaundice and cyanosis concerning black, Asian and ethnic minority neonates [^115AhX3T]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

The policies for assessing jaundice predominantly rely on skin colour. Some guidance implies that ethnicity may pose a challenge in detecting jaundice. One specific guideline outlined the potential for transcutaneous bilirubinometer assessments to overestimate bilirubin levels in newborns with darker skin colours, although the existing evidence contradicts this.

Cyanosis or hypoxia

The identification of cyanosis and/or hypoxia was performed according to eight guidelines/policies and one training resource.

In cases where an infant is considered at higher risk (e.g. through passage of meconium in utero or prolonged rupture of membranes), the NICE intrapartum guidelines recommend monitoring for central cyanosis and advise "confirming by pulse oximetry if available". Similarly, a sign considered suggestive of congenital heart disease in neonates is "central cyanosis".

When monitoring for respiratory issues, it is recommended to observe "skin colour, pallor, mottling, cyanosis, and any traumatic petechiae around the eyelids, face, and neck". The training resource suggests that an infant displaying a "mottled", "blue", or "pale" colouration may indicate potential respiratory distress. Another guideline highlights " cyanosis " as an abnormal respiratory assessment criterion for a neonate.

One guideline specifically addressed the assessment of cyanosis in neonates. Skin colour assessment was also performed, prompting healthcare professionals to observe for the neonate "appearing pale, ashen, mottled, or blue". None of these guidelines explicitly describe how cyanosis or central cyanosis may manifest across different skin tones, phenotypes, or ethnic characteristics. However, online resources provide more explicit guidance, suggesting that "any change from the established centrally pink colour in a newborn is always abnormal" and that central colour change is most "reliably noted in the lips, gums, and tongue" and can present as "paleness or dusky blue".

Another guideline explicitly emphasised that the recognition of cyanosis should not rely solely on skin colour.

The training resource went one step further, proposing that "skin colour also varies according to genetic determinants and therefore is not a good means of assessing oxygenation". For this reason, they suggested that any baby with a "dusky appearance" should have their pulse oximetry checked.

### ABM clinical protocol # 3: supplementary feedings in the healthy term breastfed neonate, revised 2017 [^115XygdV]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Appendix — Table A1 (healthy newborn and mother) outlines inappropriate reasons for supplementation and provides responses and risks. For the perception that there is no milk or that colostrum is insufficient until milk comes in, mother and family should be educated about the benefits of colostrum including dispelling myths about the yellow color, and small amounts of colostrum are normal, physiologic, and appropriate for the term, healthy newborn. Risks of unnecessary supplementation are that it can alter infant bowel flora and microbiome, potentially sensitize the infant to foreign proteins, increase the risk of diarrhea and other infections (especially where hygiene is poor), and potentially disrupt the supply-demand cycle leading to inadequate milk supply and long-term supplementation. For the belief that supplementation is needed to prevent weight loss/dehydration, a certain amount of weight loss is normal in the first week of life and is due to diuresis of extracellular fluid and passage of meconium; supplementation in the first few days may interfere with the normal frequency of breastfeeding, and supplementation with water or glucose water, increases the risk of jaundice, excessive weight loss, and longer hospital stays. For concern about hypoglycemia, healthy, full-term infants do not develop symptomatic hypoglycemia as a result of suboptimal breastfeeding, and risks are the same as for weight loss/dehydration. For concern that breastfeeding is related to jaundice, the more frequent the breastfeeding, the lower the bilirubin level; bilirubin is a potent antioxidant and jaundice is normal in the newborn; colostrum acts as a natural laxative helping to eliminate meconium that contains bilirubin, with the same risks as for weight loss/dehydration.

Risk when below phototherapy threshold and when to stop checking: Among infants with TSB concentrations below the phototherapy threshold, the potential need for future phototherapy or escalation of care increases the closer the TSB is to the phototherapy threshold; however, once a spontaneous decline in TcB or TSB over at least 6 hours has been documented and absent other worrisome signs, additional bilirubin measurements are not necessary.

### ABM clinical protocol # 3: supplementary feedings in the healthy term breastfed neonate, revised 2017 [^113ztPLu]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #3 — possible indications for supplementation in healthy term infants include asymptomatic hypoglycemia documented by laboratory blood glucose measurement that is unresponsive to frequent breastfeeding; symptomatic infants or those with glucose < 1.4 mmol/L (< 25 mg/dL) in the first 4 hours or < 2.0 mmol/L (< 35 mg/dL) after 4 hours should be treated with intravenous glucose, and breastfeeding should continue during intravenous glucose therapy; 40% dextrose gel applied to the side of the infant's cheek is effective in increasing blood glucose and improves the rate of exclusive breastfeeding after discharge; signs of inadequate intake such as significant dehydration not improved after skilled assessment, weight loss of ≥ 8–10% (day 5 [120 hours] or later) or greater than the 75th percentile for age, delayed bowel movements with fewer than four stools on day 4 or continued meconium stools on day 5 (120 hours); and jaundice indications including suboptimal intake jaundice beginning at 2–5 days and breast milk jaundice when levels reach 340–425 μmol/L (20–25 mg/dL).

### ABM clinical protocol # 10: breastfeeding the late preterm (34–36 6 / 7 weeks of gestation) and early term infants (37–38 6 / 7 weeks of gestation), second revision 2016 [^114eQrnd]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Ongoing monitoring and support — late preterm and early term infants: Evaluate breastfeeding, preferably within 24 hours of birth, by a lactation consultant or other healthcare professional, and assess and document breastfeeding at least twice daily by two different healthcare professionals, preferably by using a standardized tool (e.g. LATCH Score, IBFAT, Mother/Baby Assessment Tool). Monitor vital signs every 6–8 hours, weight change, stool and urine output, and milk transfer. Late preterm and early term infants should be followed closely with a low threshold for checking bilirubin levels. Avoid excessive weight loss or dehydration, as losses greater than 3% of birth weight by 24 hours of age or greater than 7% by day 3 are excessive and may require further monitoring and adjustment of medical and breastfeeding support. Consider pre- and post-feeding test weights daily or after some (but not all) breastfeeds, and weigh on an electronic scale with accuracy at minimum ± 5 g.

### Bilirubin-IXbeta is a marker of meconium, like zinc coproporphyrin [^113gABXd]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Because meconium accumulates continuously in the fetal intestine, analysis of the postnatally excreted material could yield important information of intrauterine metabolism and maturation. Therefore, a study of the bilirubin pigments in meconium and in the first neonatal stools was carried out.

Methods

Meconium and stools from 37 neonates of various gestational ages were collected carefully, and stored at -20 degrees C, protected by aluminium foil. Samples were defrosted, vortex mixed with an equal amount of dimethyl sulfoxide, centrifuged, and submitted to analysis by high-pressure liquid chromatography using newly developed methods to identify and to quantitate the bilirubin-IXalpha, -IXbeta, -IXgamma, and -IXdelta isomers. In addition, samples were also submitted to diazo coupling with ethyl anthranilate. Total coproporphyrins and zinc coproporphyrin were assayed for comparison.

Results

Unconjugated bilirubin-IXalpha and -IXbeta were detected in meconium but not the -IXgamma or the -IXbeta isomer. Bilirubin-IXbeta was the predominant pigment and comprised 63% to 96% of the unconjugated bilirubins in the first sample of meconium excreted. Its amount decreased rapidly during the first 5 days in full-term newborns, but this occurred more slowly in preterm neonates, especially in those with a gestational age less than 30 weeks. The decrease of bilirubin-IXbeta over time correlated with that of coproporphyrin.

Conclusions

Bilirubin-IXbeta is the prevailing bile pigment in the first excreted sample of meconium. It gradually decreases after birth and can be considered a biochemical marker of meconium, like zinc coproporphyrin.

### Contemporary management of infants born through meconium stained amniotic fluid [^111SLTuB]. Seminars in Perinatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Delivery room management of infants delivered through meconium stained amniotic fluid has evolved over the past four decades. The burden of disease weighs more heavily in low- and middle-resource areas. Current information does not allow for precise prediction of infants that will require resuscitation at delivery versus those that need simple stabilization. Optimal care of newborns requires assessment of risk factors and obstetrical and pediatric team preparation to respond to the needs of the newborn.

### Delayed presentation of meconium ileus in an infant with cystic fibrosis [^111J9DCT]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Although infants with meconium ileus usually present with apparent symptoms shortly after birth, the diagnosis of meconium ileus and cystic fibrosis (CF) may be delayed, awaiting newborn screening (NBS) results. We present the case of an 11-day-old term girl with delayed passage of meconium at 48 hours who had 2 subsequent small meconium stools over the following week. There was a normal feeding history and no signs of abdominal distension or distress. She then presented with an acute abdomen, decompensated shock, bowel perforation, and peritonitis, requiring multiple intestinal surgeries. Her NBS for CF was positive, and CF was ultimately confirmed with mutation analysis. Her course was complicated by prolonged parenteral feedings and mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy. The infant was managed with soy oil, medium chain triglycerides, olive oil, fish oil lipids and experienced only transaminitis without cholestasis and no chronic liver sequelae, with subsequent normalization of her transaminases without treatment. Because her only symptom was decreased stool output and NBS results were unavailable, the CF diagnosis was delayed until she presented in extremis. Delayed meconium passage and decreased stool output during the first week of life should lead to suspicion and additional evaluation for CF while awaiting NBS results. Careful monitoring is indicated to prevent serious, life-threatening complications. The use of soy oil, medium chain triglycerides, olive oil, fish oil lipids for infants requiring prolonged parenteral nutrition may also be considered proactively to prevent cholestasis, particularly for high risk groups.

### Meconium stained fluid: approach to the mother and the baby [^111dCznN]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Meconium aspiration syndrome is a common problem that most pediatricians will encounter in the delivery room and normal newborn nursery. Approximately 13% of all live births are complicated by meconium-stained amniotic fluid. Like many aspects of the perinatal period, optimal care of an infant born through meconium-stained amniotic fluid involves collaboration between obstetrician and pediatrician, each with separate but important roles. As always, effective communication and advanced preparation and anticipation of potential problems form the cornerstone of this partnership. Together the health of infants may be improved.

ABM Clinical Protocol #3 — situations where supplementation is not indicated specifies that "There are common clinical situations where evaluation and breastfeeding management may be necessary, but SUPPLEMENTATION IS NOT INDICATED, including" the case of "The healthy, term, appropriate for gestational age infant when the infant is feeding well, urinating and stooling adequately, weight loss is in the expected range, and bilirubin levels are not of concern (depending on gestational age, time since birth, and any risk factors)", that "Newborns are normally sleepy after an initial alert period after birth (∼2 hours). They then have variable sleep–wake cycles, with an additional one or two wakeful periods in the next 10 hours whether fed or not", and that supportive care "may be more appropriate than automatic supplementation after 6, 8, 12, or even 24 hours".

### Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine consult series # 53: intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy: replaces consult # 13, April 2011 [^1138492m]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is a hepatic disorder characterized by pruritus and an elevation in serum bile acid levels. Although intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy poses little risk for women, this condition carries a significant risk for the fetus, including complications such as preterm delivery, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, and stillbirth. The purpose of this Consult is to review the current literature on intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and provide recommendations based on the available evidence. The recommendations by the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine are as follows: (1) we recommend measurement of serum bile acid and liver transaminase levels in patients with suspected intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (GRADE 1B); (2) we recommend that ursodeoxycholic acid be used as the first-line agent for the treatment of maternal symptoms of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (GRADE 1A); (3) we suggest that patients with a diagnosis of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy begin antenatal fetal surveillance at a gestational age when delivery would be performed in response to abnormal fetal testing results or at the time of diagnosis if the diagnosis is made later in gestation (GRADE 2C); (4) we recommend that patients with total bile acid levels of ≥ 100 μmol/L be offered delivery at 36 0/7 weeks of gestation, given that the risk of stillbirth increases substantially around this gestational age (GRADE 1B); (5) we recommend delivery between 36 0/7 and 39 0/7 weeks of gestation for patients with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and total bile acid levels of < 100 μmol/L (GRADE 1C); (6) we recommend administration of antenatal corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity for patients delivering before 37 0/7 weeks of gestation if not previously administered (GRADE 1A); (7) we recommend against preterm delivery at < 37 weeks of gestation in patients with a clinical diagnosis of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy without laboratory confirmation of elevated bile acid levels (GRADE 1B).

### Appropriate management of the nonvigorous meconium-stained newborn meconium [^111DXuEN]. NeoReviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Before 2015, major changes in Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) recommendations not supporting previously endorsed antepartum, intrapartum and postpartum interventions to prevent meconium aspiration syndrome were based on adequately powered multicenter randomized controlled trials. The 2015 and 2020 American Heart Association guidelines and 7th and 8th edition of NRP suggest not performing routine intubation and tracheal suctioning of nonvigorous meconium-stained newborns. However, this was given as a weak recommendation with low-certainty evidence. The purpose of this review is to summarize the evidence and explore the question of appropriate delivery room management for nonvigorous meconium-stained newborns.

### Technical report: diagnosis and management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^113bTNbR]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia ≥ 35 weeks' gestation — scope and risk context: The gestational age cutoff of ≥ 35 weeks was chosen because it includes most newborn infants cared for in mother-baby units and well-baby nurseries, and this guideline does not apply to preterm newborns born < 35 weeks' gestation who generally receive care in neonatal intensive care units. Although rare in high-resource settings, kernicterus is deadly and leads to severe, lifelong neurodevelopmental impairment in survivors, and at some patient-specific threshold severe bilirubinemia can lead to bilirubin encephalopathy and kernicterus. The current evidence base is insufficient to quantitatively derive the exact treatment threshold, but recent, large cohort investigations have provided reassurance that there are certain total serum bilirubin concentrations below which kernicterus or adverse effects are not observed.

Clinical definitions

Pathological jaundice was defined as any of the following features: clinical jaundice appearing within the first 24 h or after 14 days of life; increases in the levels of total bilirubin by > 8.5 μmol/L (0.5 mg/dL) per hour or (85 μmol/L) 5 mg/dL per 24 h; total bilirubin > 331.5 μmol/L (19.5 mg/dL); direct bilirubin > 34 μmol/L (2.0 mg/dL), which primarily referred to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline and Queensland Clinical Guidelines. Non-reassuring fetal status was defined as progressive fetal hypoxia and/or acidemia secondary to inadequate fetal oxygenation, and it was diagnosed when any one of the following conditions was met: II-III-degree amniotic fluid meconium-staining; a fetal heart rate > 160 beats per minute or < 120 beats per minute for > 10 min; an abnormal fetal heart rate (repetitive late decelerations, undulating baseline, bradycardia); or fetal movement < three times per hour or an increase or decrease of 50% compared to the previous frequency of fetal movements, with no recovery after repeated observations, which primarily referred to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) guidelines. Birth asphyxia was defined as failing to initiate and sustain breathing at birth. Moderate birth asphyxia was diagnostic when at least 2 of the following criteria were fulfilled: 5-min Apgar score ≤ 7; moderate acidosis during the first hour of life: pH < 7.15 (umbilical artery, umbilical veins, capillary or arterial blood sample); and mild-to-moderate encephalopathy (Sarnat stage I — II). The present study used the World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria in combination with local guideline criteria: 1, Apgar score ≤ 7 at 1 min or 5 min, without the establishment of effective spontaneous respiration; 2, umbilical arterial blood pH < 7.15; and 3, exclusion of other causes of low Apgar score, such as premature infants. Low birth weight was defined as a birth weight < 2500 g. Postpartum hemorrhage was defined as an amount of bleeding ≥ 500 mL for vaginal delivery or ≥ 1000 mL for cesarean delivery within 24 h after delivery based on the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) guideline. Premature rupture of the membrane was defined as prelabor rupture of membranes that occurred 3 or more hours before preterm delivery. Preterm birth was defined as delivery of a newborn whose gestational age was < 37 weeks. HCA was defined as dense polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration of the amnion, chorion and decidua. Puerperal infection was defined as any infection that occurred during the puerperium, such as infection of the urogenital tract, breast, and respiratory system. All pregnant women and children were followed up for 6 weeks. In-hospital or telephone follow-up every 7 days after delivery to ask about neonatal jaundice and weight gain, whether the mother had fever, mastitis, lochia, and recovery of the perineal wound. Complete blood counts of mother and newborn were performed at the six-week outpatient visit follow-up. Physical examination and bilirubin determination of newborns, and recovery of the uterus were also performed at six-week follow-up.

### Determinants of neonatal jaundice among neonates admitted to five referral hospitals in amhara region, Northern Ethiopia: an unmatched case-control study [^112s6Hov]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2020). High credibility.

Operational definitions

Neonatal jaundice: neonates diagnosed as jaundiced through history, clinical signs and symptoms and/or laboratory investigations (TB value more than 205 µmol/L in term babies and more than 257 µmol/L in preterm babies) by physicians (general practitioners, paediatricians and neonatologists).

Physiological jaundice: neonates in the presence of one more of the established Integrated Management of Newborn and Childhood Illness (IMNCI) criteria (only skin on the face or eyes yellow and infant aged 2–13 days old) along with TB value under 205 µmol/L in term babies and under 257 µmol/L in preterm babies.

Hyperthermia: an axillary temperature of > 37.5°C.

Hypothermia: an axillary temperature of less than 36.5°C.

Hyperglycaemia: blood glucose level greater than 125 mg/dL.

Hypoglycaemia: blood glucose level less than 40 mg/dL.

Neonatal sepsis: a clinical syndrome of bacteraemia with systemic signs and symptoms of infection in the first 4 weeks of life.

Meconium aspiration syndrome: is a breathing problem that a newborn baby may have due to the aspiration of stained amniotic fluid, which can occur before, during or immediately after birth.

Traditional medicine: taking any herbal traditional medicine during pregnancy to treat nausea and vomiting, reduce the risk of preeclampsia, shorten labour and treat the common cold and urinary tract infections.

Sample size determination and sampling procedures

The sample size was calculated using Open EPI INFO V.7 software with double population formula by assuming; CI: 95%, power: 80%, case to control ratio: 1:2, P1: per cent of outcome with an exposed group (neonates with jaundice) = 80.6%, P2: per cent of outcome in the unexposed group (neonates without jaundice) = 14.5%. In consideration of 10% of the non-response rate, the final sample was adjusted to 453 (151 cases and 302 controls).

Data collection tool and procedures

The data were collected after admission by diploma nurses and midwives working in the labour ward and NICU ward under the supervision of BSc holder neonatal nurses. Data were collected by interview with the mothers and review of case records of neonates in the hospital. A checklist consisting of demographic, neonatal, and maternal information were used for data collection. The questions are both open and close ended. The questionnaire addressed the women's sociodemographic characteristics, obstetrics and health-related characteristics and neonatal related characteristics.

### Planned early delivery versus expectant management of the term suspected compromised baby for improving outcomes [^1135dCsx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Fetal compromise in the term pregnancy is suspected when the following clinical indicators are present: intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), decreased fetal movement (DFM), or when investigations such as cardiotocography (CTG) and ultrasound reveal results inconsistent with standard measurements. Pathological results would necessitate the need for immediate delivery, but the management for 'suspicious' results remains unclear and varies widely across clinical centres. There is clinical uncertainty as to how to best manage women presenting with a suspected term compromised baby in an otherwise healthy pregnancy.

Objectives

To assess, using the best available evidence, the effects of immediate delivery versus expectant management of the term suspected compromised baby on neonatal, maternal and long-term outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing expectant management versus planned early delivery for women with a suspected compromised fetus from 37 weeks' gestation or more.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and assessed trial quality. Two review authors independently extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Of the 20 reports identified by the search strategy, we included three trials (546 participants: 269 to early delivery and 277 to expectant management), which met our inclusion criteria. Two of the trials compared outcomes in 492 pregnancies with IUGR of the fetus, and one in 54 pregnancies with oligohydramnios. All three trials were of reasonable quality and at low risk of bias. The level of evidence was graded moderate, low or very low, downgrading mostly for imprecision and for some indirectness. Overall, there was no difference in the primary neonatal outcomes of perinatal mortality (no deaths in either group, one trial, 459 women, evidence graded moderate), major neonatal morbidity (risk ratio (RR) 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 2.81, one trial, 459 women, evidence graded low), or neurodevelopmental disability/impairment at two years of age (RR 2.04, 95% CI 0.62 to 6.69, one trial, 459 women, evidence graded low). There was no difference in the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (one trial, 333 infants) or meconium aspiration (one trial, 459 infants), There was also no difference in the reported primary maternal outcomes: maternal mortality (RR 3.07, 95% CI 0.13 to 74.87, one trial, 459 women, evidence graded low), and significant maternal morbidity (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.22, one trial, 459 women, evidence graded low). The gestational age at birth was on average 10 days earlier in women randomised to early delivery (mean difference (MD) -9.50, 95% CI -10.82 to -8.18, one trial, 459 women) and women in the early delivery group were significantly less likely to have a baby beyond 40 weeks' gestation (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.67, one trial, 33 women). Significantly more infants in the planned early delivery group were admitted to intermediate care nursery (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.61, two trials, 491 infants). There was no difference in the risk of respiratory distress syndrome, (one trial, 333 infants), Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (three trials, 546 infants), resuscitation required (one trial, 459 infants), mechanical ventilation (one trial, 337 infants), admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.23, three trials, 545 infants, evidence graded very low), length of stay in NICU/SCN (one trial, 459 infants), and sepsis (two trials, 366 infants). Babies in the expectant management group were more likely to be < 2.3rd centile for birthweight (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.73, two trials, 491 infants), however there was no difference in the proportion of babies with birthweight < 10th centile (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.10). There was no difference in any of the reported maternal secondary outcomes including: caesarean section rates (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.59, three trials, 546 women, evidence graded low), placental abruption (one trial, 459 women), pre-eclampsia (one trial, 459 women), vaginal birth (three trials 546 women), assisted vaginal birth (three trials 546 women), breastfeeding rates (one trial, 218 women), and number of weeks of breastfeeding after delivery one trial, 124 women). There was an expected increase in induction in the early delivery group (RR 2.05, 95% CI 1.78 to 2.37, one trial, 459 women). No data were reported for the pre-specified secondary neonatal outcomes of the number of days of mechanical ventilation, moderate-severe hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy or need for therapeutic hypothermia. Likewise, no data were reported for secondary maternal outcomes of postnatal infection, maternal satisfaction or views of care.

Authors' Conclusions

A policy for planned early delivery versus expectant management for a suspected compromised fetus at term does not demonstrate any differences in major outcomes of perinatal mortality, significant neonatal or maternal morbidity or neurodevelopmental disability. In women randomised to planned early delivery, the gestational age at birth was on average 10 days earlier, women were less likely to have a baby beyond 40 weeks' gestation, they were more likely to be induced and infants were more likely to be admitted to intermediate care nursery. There was also a significant difference in the proportion of babies with a birthweight centile < 2.3rd, however this did not translate into a reduction in morbidity. The review is informed by only one large trial and two smaller trials assessing fetuses with IUGR or oligohydramnios and therefore cannot be generalised to all term pregnancies with suspected fetal compromise. There are other indications for suspecting compromise in a fetus at or near term such as maternal perception of DFM, and ultrasound and/or CTG abnormalities. Future randomised trials need to assess effectiveness of timing of delivery for these indications.

### Capillary blood reference intervals for platelet parameters in healthy full-term neonates in China [^112HMm2q]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study populations

The study commenced after obtaining Institutional Ethical Committee approval (TJ-IRB20190308). The subjects were prospectively enrolled into this study, and all of them were healthy full-term (259 to 293 days (37 to 41 weeks) of gestation) neonates born at two hospitals from November 2018 to April 2019. Major inclusion/exclusion criteria are listed as follows. As listed in Chang et al. for mothers, maternal age ranged from 20 to 40 years old and they had a normal health check-up without unfavourable past history during pregnancy, such as smoking, infectious diseases (hepatitis B/C, HIV, syphilis infections), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, malignancies and chronic diseases (diabetes mellitus, autoimmune disease, immunodeficiencies and thrombotic disorders); mothers did not receive aspirin during pregnancy; a vaginal delivery or caesarean section was event-free. Professional obstetricians were responsible for the data of this part. As listed in Chang et al. and Wasiluk for neonates, they fitted all clinical state criteria for full-term neonates; they were born with normal birth weight (2500–4000 g) appropriate for gestational age and normal Apgar score (8–10 points at 1–5 min of life); physical examinations of the subjects were normal without any signs of infection or congenital anomalies at the time of sampling. And we excluded all neonates with an unfavourable perinatal history of premature rupture of membrane more than 24 h, abnormal placenta, placenta abruption, chorioamnionitis or meconium stain, or with a medical history of hospitalizing in the neonatal intensive care unit. All subjects are Han ethnicity.

Blood sampling

After written informed consent was obtained from a parent or guardian for all subjects, we collected about 70 μL capillary whole blood of the subjects during the first 4 days of life (12 to 84 h old), by heel prick with the automated incision device into BD Microtainer tubes (spec, 0.5 mL; Becton Dickinson and Company, USA) containing K2-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as an anticoagulant. Samples were obtained by experienced technicians at the same time of blood sampling for the screening of congenital hypothyroidism and phenylketonuria or the routine serum bilirubin in morning hours (1–2 h later after last food intake). The first-second drop of blood was discarded and each collection time was less than 1 min. Samples were stored at ambient temperature for a maximum of 4 h before the assay was performed.

### Prenatal exposure to methamphetamine presenting as neonatal cholestasis [^115Ywg7z]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Methamphetamine has been recognized as a common cause of acute toxic hepatitis in adults with clinical and histologic features indistinguishable from acute viral hepatitis. Clinical presentation of methamphetamine hepatotoxicity ranges from mild acute hepatitis with prompt recovery to fulminant hepatic failure. The pathophysiology of this hepatotoxicity is not well elucidated. Prenatal exposure to methamphetamine has been linked to intrauterine growth retardation and variety of withdrawal symptoms. Neonatal cholestasis is rare but serious problem that indicates hepatobiliary dysfunction and has several categories of etiologies. These include infectious, metabolic, endocrine, toxic, structural, familial, and autoimmune disorders. Cholestatic hepatitis is a recognized complication of exposure to some drugs including carbamazepine and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

Case

A 35-week preterm, appropriate for gestational age, white girl was born to a 39-year-old mother who had no prenatal care. The mother's urine drug screen revealed methamphetamine. The baby passed pale meconium and her subsequent stools were hypo-pigmented. A detailed work up was done and was unremarkable except for hepatobiliary scintigraphy, with no activity noted in the small bowel on delayed imaging. An operative cholangiogram and liver biopsy were performed. The cholangiogram revealed patent bile ducts. Liver biopsy was consistent with acute viral or toxic hepatitis. Gradual drop of bilirubin was noted. With negative extensive work up for other etiology, known hepatotoxicity of methamphetamine, early onset of cholestasis that improved without specific therapy, it is strongly suspected that prenatal exposure to methamphetamine is the most likely culprit in this patient.

Discussion

This is the first recorded case of neonatal cholestasis related to prenatal exposure to methamphetamine. Methamphetamine is considered the fastest-growing illicit drug in United States. Hence, prenatal exposure to methamphetamine is expected to rise. Healthcare providers should become aware of the possibility of methamphetamine effect on the fetal liver. Raising awareness of the expectant mothers through the healthcare profession may reduce the risk of this condition.

### Lactate: creatinine ratio in babies with thin meconium staining of amniotic fluid [^116XeGDm]. BMC Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

12%–22% of all pregnancies are complicated by meconium, but 50% of those who develop HIE had been born through meconium stained amniotic fluid (MSAF). Meconium in labor may indicate fetal distress or asphyxia. There are at least three theories explaining meconium passage: in-utero relaxation of the anal sphincter vagal stimulation and postmaturity. Numerous investigators have concluded that presence of meconium in the amniotic fluid is a sign of fetal hypoxia or acidosis.

Recent studies have reported much higher levels of fetal erythropoetin, and lower fetal oxygen saturation in pregnancies complicated by meconium and concluded that in-utero passage of meconium reflects chronic asphyxia. In summary, it is understood that, (though not and independent predictor of poor neurodevelopmental outcome), intrauterine passage of meconium may reflect an asphyxial event.

Some babies pass meconium due to intrauterine infections, chorioamnionitis, and premature rupture of membranes and up to35% of postmature babies (born after 42 weeks of gestation) may pass meconium. Clearly, asphyxia cannot alone be implicated for in-utero meconium passage especially in post-mature babies and in the presence of intrauterine infections.

When freshly passed, meconium is a thick, viscous, green liquid except perhaps in cases of fetal diarrhea due to Listeriosis. Meconium stains the amniotic fluid and presents as thick meconium. The consistency is altered over time by dilution and fetal movement resulting in thin meconium. Arguably, thinner and more uniformly mixed meconium has been retained in the amniotic fluid for a longer duration (hours to days), than meconium that appears thick. The exact time interval between passage of meconium to its complete dilution is not available in literature.

### Transcutaneous bilirubinometry for detecting jaundice in term or late preterm neonates [^114fwWNR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Canadian Paediatric Society both advise that all newborns should undergo bilirubin screening before leaving the hospital, and this has become the standard practice in both countries. However, the US Preventive Task Force has found no strong evidence to suggest that this practice of universal screening for bilirubin reduces the occurrence of significant outcomes such as bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction or kernicterus.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of transcutaneous screening compared to visual inspection for hyperbilirubinemia to prevent the readmission of newborns (infants greater than 35 weeks' gestation) for phototherapy.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP, and ISRCTN in June 2023. We also searched conference proceedings, and the reference lists of included studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomized, cluster-randomized, or prospective cohort studies with control arm that evaluated the use of transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) screening for hyperbilirubinemia in newborns before hospital discharge.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodologic procedures expected by Cochrane. We evaluated treatment effects using a fixed-effect model with risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for categorical data and mean, standard deviation (SD), and mean difference (MD) for continuous data. We used the GRADE approach to evaluate the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

We identified one RCT that met our inclusion criteria. The study included 1858 African newborns at 35 weeks' gestation or greater who were receiving routine care at a well-baby nursery, and were randomly recruited prior to discharge to undergo TcB screening. The study had good methodologic quality. TcB screening versus visual assessment of hyperbilirubinemia in newborns: - probably reduces readmission to the hospital for hyperbilirubinemia (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.46; P < 0.0001; moderate-certainty evidence); - may have little or no effect on the rate of exchange transfusion (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 14.16; low-certainty evidence); - probably increases the number of newborns who require phototherapy prior to discharge (RR 2.67, 95% CI 1.56 to 4.55; moderate-certainty evidence). - may have little or no effect on the rate of acute bilirubin encephalopathy (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.18; low-certainty evidence). The study did not evaluate or report cost of care.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that TcB screening probably reduces hospital readmission for hyperbilirubinemia compared to visual inspection. Low-certainty evidence also suggests that TcB screening may have little or no effect on the rate of exchange transfusion compared to visual inspection. However, moderate-certainty evidence suggests that TcB screening probably increases the number of newborns that require phototherapy before discharge compared to visual inspection. Low-certainty evidence suggests that TcB screening may have little or no effect on the rate of acute bilirubin encephalopathy compared to visual inspection. Given that we have only identified one RCT, further studies are necessary to determine whether TcB screening can help to reduce readmission and complications related to neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. In settings with limited newborn follow-up after hospital discharge, identifying newborns at risk of severe hyperbilirubinemia before hospital discharge will be important to plan targeted follow-up of these infants.

### Parental detection of neonatal jaundice using a low-cost colour card: a multicentre prospective study [^115kAwNV]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC

Bilirubin concentrations in term infants with physiological jaundice peak around the third and fifth day of life, when most affected babies would have been discharged from the hospital. Parents may be the first to observe the onset of severe hyperbilirubinaemia.
Visual assessment alone is not a reliable method for determining the degree of bilirubin.

### Host-derived protein profiles of human neonatal meconium across gestational ages [^115YG4ba]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Meconium is a viscid, odourless, greenish-black material present in the foetal intestine from approximately the 12th week of gestation. In full-term neonates, the initial meconium is typically passed within 48 h after birth. Thus, it can be collected noninvasively after birth, making it an ideal clinical sample for investigating the gastrointestinal pathophysiological condition of newborn babies –.

Because meconium is minimally excreted by the foetus during gestation but is defaecated after birth, its components accumulate exclusively during intrauterine life. The composition of the meconium may vary depending on the time of its formation in the foetal intestine. Therefore, it is believed that the composition of the initial meconium differs from that of the subsequent stool passed during the postnatal period. In addition, recent research indicates that in cases where a foetus develops without any abnormal maternal conditions, the meconium does not harbour the gut microbiome prior to birth. Therefore, early meconium seems to be minimally influenced by microbial interactions. Protein profile analysis of the early meconium has the potential to elucidate the gastrointestinal environment of newborns and may provide information on laboratory parameters that describe the intrauterine environment –.

We hypothesized that employing proteomic analysis of meconium could offer a novel approach to both identify stool biomarkers and uncover previously unknown aetiologies linked to neonatal diseases. In this study, we aimed to establish human-derived protein profiles of the initial meconium across varied gestational ages, identify meconium biomarkers, and uncover the underlying causes of disease in newborns through deep proteome analyses.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^114gTqHs]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, more specifically with respect to bilirubin measurement, AAP 2022 guidelines recommend to consider using the rate of increase to identify infants at higher risk of subsequent hyperbilirubinemia if > 1 transcutaneous bilirubin or total serum bilirubin measure is available. Suspect hemolysis in case of a rapid rate of increase (≥ 0.3 mg/dL/hour in the first 24 hours or ≥ 0.2 mg/dL/hour thereafter). Obtain a direct antiglobulin test in this case if not previously done.

### Bilious vomiting in the newborn: rapid diagnosis of intestinal… [^1143Skjj]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

During embryonic life, the colon and small bowel grow rapidly and extrude from the abdominal cavity. During the seventh week of gestation, the midgut starts being reduced back into the abdominal cavity. The bowel then settles into the abdominal cavity and rotates in a counterclockwise direction, with the cecum coming to rest in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. This process is completed by the 12th week of gestation. The involved bowel is distended by meconium retention during fetal life. After a few hours of postnatal life, bowel distention becomes remarkable because of swallowed air and causes bilious vomiting. In some cases, meconium retention may cause dystociaproducing abdominal distention. On physical examination, the thickened bowel loops are often visible and palpable through the abdominal wall. Remarkable abdominal distention, tenderness and/or erythema of the abdominal skin indicates perforation, which requires immediate surgery.

Rectal examination is often difficult, the small caliber of the rectum not allowing the examiner's finger to enter. Mucus plugs may be evacuated after withdrawal of the examination finger. The plain abdominal films show distended loops of intestine with thickened bowel walls. A large amount of meconium mixed with swallowed air produces the so-called "ground-glass" sign, which is typical of meconium ileus. Calcification, free air or very large air-fluid levels suggest bowel perforation, which requires urgent surgery. A contrast enema demonstrates a microcolon. 21 This treatment is successful in 16 to 50 percent of patients. When a Gastrografin enema is unsuccessful, laparotomy is indicated to evacuate the obstructing meconium by enterotomy irrigation. Immediate surgery is indicated in patients with complicated meconium ileus. Bowel resection for perforation and/or obstruction related to kinking of the bowel is indicated, usually requiring a temporary enterostomy.

22 Prematurity and pulmonary disorders are common predisposing factors. 23, 24 The usual onset is 10 to 12 days of age, with presenting symptoms of gastric retention, bilious vomiting, ileus, abdominal distention and bloody stools. Bradycardia, hypothermia, apneic spells and hypotension are later signs of progressive deterioration. Abnormal hemorrhage, hyperbilirubinemia and oliguria are late findings.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^1167q8U6]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Figure 7 — flow diagram for infants during the birth hospitalization to determine postdischarge follow-up for infants who have not received phototherapy begins at a transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) or total serum bilirubin (TSB) measure in an infant ≥ 12 hours old and directs that clinicians determine hour-specific phototherapy thresholds and measure TSB if TcB exceeds numeric triggers; if the TSB is at or above the phototherapy threshold, begin phototherapy, otherwise follow discharge recommendations by how far the bilirubin is below the threshold. Determine hour-specific phototherapy threshold based on gestational age and presence of a known hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factor; measure TSB if TcB exceeds 3.0 mg/dL below the phototherapy treatment threshold or if the TcB is ≥ 15 mg/dL. For phototherapy threshold minus TcB or TSB of 0.1–1.9 mg/dL, if age < 24 hours, delay discharge, consider phototherapy, and measure TSB in 4 to 8 hours; if age ≥ 24 hours, measure TSB in 4 to 24 hours, with options to delay discharge and consider phototherapy, discharge with home phototherapy if all considerations in the guideline are met, or discharge without phototherapy but with close follow-up. For 2.0–3.4 mg/dL (regardless of age or discharge time), obtain TSB or TcB in 4 to 24 hours. For 3.5–5.4 mg/dL (regardless of age or discharge time), obtain TSB or TcB in 1 to 2 days. For 5.5–6.9 mg/dL, if discharging < 72 hours, follow-up within 2 days with TcB or TSB according to clinical judgment; if discharging ≥ 72 hours, use clinical judgment. For ≥ 7.0 mg/dL, if discharging < 72 hours, follow-up within 3 days with TcB or TSB according to clinical judgment; if discharging ≥ 72 hours, use clinical judgment. The difference between the bilirubin concentration measured closest to discharge and the phototherapy threshold at the time of the bilirubin measurement should be calculated and used to guide follow-up, and Figure 7 is only applicable for infants at least 12 hours after birth who have not received phototherapy before discharge; any infant discharged before 12 hours of age should have a follow-up bilirubin measure between 24 and 48 hours of age.

### Meconium ileus-it is time to act now! [^116SEUte]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2010). Low credibility.

Meconium ileus is a life-threatening presentation of neonates with cystic fibrosis (CF). Notwithstanding, today the long-term prognosis of such patients is comparable to that of CF patients not diagnosed in screening programs and not suffering from this insult,1–3 as confirmed by the article of Johnson et al. in this issue of Pediatric Pulmonology. Good news then for CF patients and CF caretakers, working with the modern interdisciplinary setting of neonatal intensive care, including radiology, anesthesiology, and pediatric surgery experts. State of the art management of life-threatening neonatal ileus during this fragile early phase of life obviously balances all disadvantages associated with neonatal ileus and provides an outcome not different from that in CF patients without meconium ileus, but diagnosed later during early childhood.

### Meconium passed in labor: how reassuring is clear amniotic fluid? [^116YNQtq]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Clear amniotic fluid is frequently considered a reassuring sign during labor. Our aim was to examine the incidence of meconium that can only have been passed intrapartum and to determine its neonatal associations and whether its absence is a useful sign.

Methods

This was a prospective cohort study of 8394 "low risk" laboring women at term with clear amniotic fluid at early amniotomy.

Results

Meconium was passed in 5.2% of labors but was not detected until delivery of the fetal head in 51.5% of these. It was associated with moderate-severe acidosis (odds ratio [OR] 4.40; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.21, 6.03), low Apgar score at 5 minutes (OR 6.49; 95% CI 2.73, 15.44), and neonatal seizures (OR 4.33; 95% CI 3.17, 5.93). However, the sensitivity for these outcomes of the intrapartum passage of meconium and, particularly, its detection before delivery was very poor.

Conclusion

Although correlated with adverse neonatal outcomes, most affected infants had clear amniotic fluid throughout labor. The presence of clear amniotic fluid is an unreliable sign of fetal well-being.

### Host-derived protein profiles of human neonatal meconium across gestational ages [^113pe1CT]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Estimating the anticipated delivery date

Determining the anticipated delivery date involves employing various methods outlined in the "Guideline for Obstetrical Practice in Japan 2023". These methods consider factors such as the embryo transfer date and identifiable ovulation date, normal menstrual cycle and last menstrual period, or crown-rump length (CRL) at specific stages of pregnancy. Typically, the calculation involves measuring the biparietal diameter (BPD) after one week, with the expected delivery date typically pinpointed around the 13th week and 6th day of pregnancy. In the Japanese obstetric care scenario, pregnant individuals promptly seek consultation at obstetric and gynaecology departments upon confirming pregnancy. Therefore, GA determination often relies on CRL measurements rather than solely on estimates derived from the last menstrual period. This paper adopts an optimized approach integrating both the last menstrual period and US measurements to accurately establish GA.

### Reproductive health and liver disease: practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^116KXwjm]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy — maternal risks, management, and postpartum follow-up indicate that maternal complications are minimal and serum aminotransferase elevations do not appear to influence maternal symptoms or fetal outcomes; although symptomatic pruritus can reduce quality of life, this typically resolves within days to weeks postpartum; management includes lifestyle measures and UDCA as first-line therapy; the main risks are to the fetus, with increased risk of preterm birth, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, neonatal respiratory depression and asphyxia, and IUFD, with proposed mechanisms including toxicity of bile acids on cardiomyocytes and vasoconstrictive effects on placental chorionic veins, reduced lung surfactant and altered macrophage activity leading to respiratory distress syndrome, and higher rates of intrauterine meconium passage due to bile acid–induced increase in fetal gut motility; follow-up of women with ICP postpartum is recommended to confirm resolution of liver test abnormalities, with further evaluation reserved for those with persistent symptoms or liver test abnormalities.

### Toxic effects of different meconium fractions on lung function: new therapeutic strategies for meconium aspiration syndrome? [^1119ri8A]. Journal of Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

To review and summarize experimental data examining the effects of different fractions of meconium, and to test the effect of albumin on meconium aspiration both as prophylactic and rescue treatment. Newborn piglets 2 to 5 days of age were made hypoxic and then instilled meconium or fractions of meconium intratracheally. Meconium-added albumin and albumin instilled after meconium were also tested. Lung function and inflammatory cytokines were measured. Both the lipid- and water-soluble fractions induce inflammation in the lungs with elevation of inflammatory cytokines. When meconium was mixed with albumin, the inflammatory effects of meconium were significantly ameliorated. Rescue therapy with intratracheal albumin 5 min after the meconium aspiration syndrome was induced also improved lung function. These results indicate that at least part of the symptoms seen in the meconium aspiration syndrome could be prevented by blocking the active substances of meconium such as bile acids and free fatty acids.

### Association of severe intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy with adverse pregnancy outcomes: a prospective population-based case-control study [^112akCPa]. Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Table 4
Maternal and Perinatal Outcomes of Severe ICP and Healthy Pregnancies

In our unadjusted analysis, there were significantly higher rates of stillbirth in the ICP population (1.5%, 10/664 versus 0.5%, 11/2,205) (OR 3.05; 95% CI 1.29 to 7.21) (Table 4). There was also an increased risk of admission to the neonatal unit (OR 2.34; 95% CI 1.74 to 3.15). These differences remained significant following adjustment for potential confounding factors, and when compared to national data. The main reasons given for admission to the neonatal unit were preterm delivery (45%, 36 babies) and respiratory problems (30%, 24 babies). There were no cases of meconium aspiration syndrome. The median duration of stay on the neonatal unit was 7 days (IQR 2.25 to 13.75). Meconium-stained amniotic fluid was observed in 16% (106 women) of ICP cases, and occurred at lower gestational weeks than in the control population (Fig. 3). The odds ratio for meconium staining of the amniotic fluid in women with severe ICP compared to published controlswas significantly greater at each week of gestational age up to and including 38 weeks' gestation. Of those who had a cord blood sample taken, cord artery pH ≤ 7.1 was present in 8.5% (24/283) and pH ≤ 7.0 in 3.5% (10/283). For the purposes of this study a reassuring cord artery pH was considered to be > 7.1, as decreasing cord arterial pH levels below 7.1 and particularly below 7.0 are associated with worsening perinatal and long-term infant outcomes. Cardiotocography abnormalities were recorded in 28% (163 cases). The most common abnormalities reported were variable decelerations/prelabor decelerations (80 cases, 49.1%), early decelerations (14 cases, 10.3%), bradycardia (< 110 beats per minute; 14 cases, 8.6%), and tachycardia (> 160 beats per minute; 11 cases, 6.7%) (Supporting Table 5).

### Hirschsprung's disease in the UK and Ireland: incidence and anomalies [^11694E6c]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

The estimated incidence of Hirschsprung's disease (HD) is approximately 1 in 5000 live births and more than 90% of cases present in the neonatal period.
Most information on the epidemiology and early management of HD comes from retrospective case series, voluntary reporting surveys and surveys of intended practice.
There is little published information on interactions between infants with HD and healthcare services prior to a diagnosis of HD being established.

What this study adds?

A quarter of infants with Hirschsprung's disease (HD) pass meconium within 24 hours of birth and nearly half within 48 hours of birth, limiting the validity of 'timing of first meconium' as a screening question for HD.
One in three infants with HD is discharged home after birth, prior to diagnosis, placing a heavy burden on primary care to ensure timely referral.
More than a third of infants with HD receive a stoma prior to definitive surgery — a higher rate than reported internationally and in contrast to surgeons reported intent.

### An approach to the management of hyperbilirubinemia in the preterm infant less than 35 weeks of gestation [^113ucFkm]. Journal of Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

We provide an approach to the use of phototherapy and exchange transfusion in the management of hyperbilirubinemia in preterm infants of < 35 weeks of gestation. Because there are limited data for evidence-based recommendations, these recommendations are, of necessity, consensus-based. The recommended treatment levels are based on operational thresholds for bilirubin levels and represent those levels beyond which it is assumed that treatment will likely do more good than harm. Long-term follow-up of a large population will be needed to evaluate whether or not these recommendations should be modified.

### Lactate: creatinine ratio in babies with thin meconium staining of amniotic fluid [^1139Hnc2]. BMC Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Thin meconium is a common event in obstetric practice and is generally considered innocuous. We have not looked at the issue of brain damage in this paper and we do not offer any suggestion to the contrary. In our sample of babies with thin meconium, it is those who have L:C ratio 100 times larger than the cut-off of 0.64 who develop HIE. A suitable cutoff of L: C ratio for babies with thin meconium can be evolved by larger studies.

Our study has two important limitations. Firstly, babies were followed only up to discharge from the nursery, and no long-term follow-up for HIE is available. It limits the study from commenting on the issue of brain damage. Secondly we used a 6-hour cutoff for urine collection. It is not unusual for normal babies not to pass urine in up to 24 or even 48 hours. The most severely asphyxiated newborns are oliguric and may not pass urine for even longer. The L:C ratio was not studied in them. Studies on ischemia – reperfusion induced cell damage suggest that the damage is complete by six hours. The "window of opportunity" for rescue medications thus, is only a few hours and in no case more than six hours. Therefore it would perhaps be futile to know about asphyxia outside of this window of six hours, where interventions may not be useful.

In this study we used conventional enzymatic methods to assay lactate and creatinine. Zuppi et al have shown earlier that lactate levels in urine by conventional enzymatic methods are comparable to levels by proton NMR spectroscopy of urine and that two methods can be used interchangeably.

In conclusion, we report that babies with thin meconium normally have much higher L: C ratios and HIE occurs at much higher levels in this group. Larger studies are needed to evolve a cut-off that performs with acceptable sensitivity and specificity in babies with thin meconium.

### Bilious vomiting in the newborn: how often is it pathologic? [^114CzB5V]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Background/Purpose

Intestinal obstruction is one of the most common reasons for admission to a neonatal surgical unit and frequently is manifest by bilious vomiting. Not all cases of neonatal bilious vomiting are caused by intestinal obstruction. This study aimed to investigate the outcome of neonates with bilious vomiting.

Methods

A prospective audit was undertaken of all neonates with a history of bilious vomiting referred to a regional pediatric surgical unit during a 2-year period (1998 to 2000). Infants with bilious nasogastric aspirates but no vomiting were not included. Demographic details, symptomatology, investigations, and final diagnoses were recorded. Subsequent clinical progress was ascertained by out-patient review or telephone interview.

Results

Sixty-three consecutive neonates (35 boys, 28 girls) were identified with a median gestational age of 40 (range 31 to 42) weeks and median birth weight of 3.5 kg (range 1.67 to 4.64). Median age at presentation was 26 hours (range, 9 hr to 28 days). A surgical cause of bilious vomiting was identified in 24 (38%): Hirschsprung's disease (n = 9), small bowel atresia (n = 5), intestinal malrotation (n = 4), meconium ileus (n = 3), meconium plug (n = 1), colonic atresia (n = 1), and milk inspissation (n = 1). Nineteen of these had both abdominal signs and an abnormal plain abdominal radiograph, and 4 had an abnormal abdominal radiograph only. In one infant with intestinal malrotation, clinical examination and plain radiography were unremarkable. After definitive surgery, all 24 infants were well at a median age of 14 (7 to 28) months. No surgical cause for bilious vomiting was found in 39 (62%) neonates whose symptoms resolved with conservative management.

Conclusions

These data emphasize the maxim that bilious vomiting in the newborn should be attributed to intestinal obstruction until proved otherwise. However, in this prospective audit, bilious vomiting was not caused by intestinal obstruction in 62% of cases, and most of these infants suffered no further sequelae.

### Meconium-related obstruction and clinical outcomes in term and preterm infants [^111z1es7]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How often does meconium-related obstruction (MRO) occur without predisposing cystic fibrosis or Hirschsprung disease, and are these obstructions associated with clinical outcomes?

Findings

In this cohort study of 3 550 796 live-born infants, 94.5% of MRO cases occurred in the absence of cystic fibrosis or Hirschsprung disease, with the highest incidence among preterm infants. Among preterm infants, MRO was associated with more frequent abdominal surgery and longer and more costly hospitalization compared with unaffected infants.

Meaning

Findings from this cohort study suggest that MRO is most likely to occur in preterm infants without cystic fibrosis or Hirschsprung disease and that dedicated prevention, diagnostic, and treatment pathways are needed.

Regarding patient education for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, more specifically with respect to counseling before discharge, AAP 2022 guidelines recommend to provide written and verbal education about neonatal jaundice to all families before discharge. Provide written information to facilitate postdischarge care, including the date, time, and place of the follow-up appointment and, when necessary, a prescription and appointment for a follow-up transcutaneous bilirubin or total serum bilirubin. Transmit birth hospitalization information, including the last transcutaneous bilirubin or total serum bilirubin and the age at which it was measured, and direct antiglobulin test results (if any) to the primary care provider who will see the infant at follow-up. Provide this information to families if there is uncertainty about who will provide the follow-up care.

### Meconium obstruction of prematurity [^113sDiqt]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2012). Low credibility.

Meconium obstruction of prematurity is an entity primarily affecting very low birthweight or extremely low birthweight babies causing low intestinal obstruction. Its presence may at best delay establishment of enteral feeding and compromise nutrition and at worst lead to mechanical obstruction requiring surgery or to intestinal perforation. There are considerable challenges in the recognition, diagnosis and management of this condition. Awareness of the disease and understanding of its pathogenesis may lead to early detection of affected babies and allow proactive measures to decrease the associated morbidity and mortality.

### Duration of meconium passage in preterm and term infants [^1115BkHX]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2008). Low credibility.

Background

First passage of stool after birth, meconium, is delayed in preterm infants compared to term infants. The difference in duration of meconium passage until transition to normal stools has however never been assessed in preterm and term infants.

Hypothesis

Preterm infants have prolonged duration of passage of meconium (PoM) compared to term infants.

Methods

Between August and November 2006, all infants born in an academic and non-academic hospital with gestational age (GA) 25–42 weeks and without metabolical, congenital diseases or gastrointestinal disorders, were included. Infants were divided into four groups: (A) GA ≤ 30 weeks; (B) GA between 31 and 34 weeks; (C) GA between 35 and 36 weeks; (D) GA ≥ 37 weeks (term born).

Results

A total of 198 infants (102 males); 32, 62, 33 and 71 infants in groups A, B, C and D, respectively, were included. With decreasing gestation a trend was found for delayed first PoM (p < 0.001). Compared to term infants 79% (56/71), less preterm infants passed their first stool within 24 h after birth — group A: 44% (14/32); group B: 68% (42/62); and group C: 73% (24/33). With decreasing gestation a trend for prolonged PoM was found (p < 0.001). The mean (SD) PoM duration was prolonged in group A: 7.8 days (2.5); group B: 4.3 days (2.4); and group C: 2.9 days (1.3) compared to term infants. Furthermore, PoM was associated with birth weights ≤ 2500 g (p = 0.03) and morphine therapy (p = 0.03). Duration of PoM was not associated with type of feeding, small for gestational age, large for gestational age or need for respiratory support.

Conclusion

PoM was not only delayed but also prolonged in preterm infants. Duration of PoM was associated with GA, birth weight and morphine therapy.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^111y5X1n]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

AAP hyperbilirubinemia guideline — scope and updates since 2004 emphasize universal predischarge screening and refined treatment thresholds: The 2004 guideline focused on infants ≥ 35 weeks' gestation and clarified distinctions between "hyperbilirubinemia risk factors" and "hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factors", adding universal predischarge bilirubin screening with measures of total serum bilirubin (TSB) or transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) linked to specific follow-up. Hazardous hyperbilirubinemia was defined as TSB ≥ 30 mg/dL, and its incidence decreased in at least 3 large US health systems after adoption of universal predischarge bilirubin screening with closer postdischarge follow-up. Because newer evidence was insufficient to set fully new thresholds, the committee began with the previous AAP guidelines, raised the phototherapy thresholds by a narrow range considered to be safe, revised the risk-assessment approach based on the hour-specific bilirubin concentration, and defined rapid response to elevated bilirubin concentrations as "escalation of care".

### Is cord blood bilirubin level a reliable predictor for developing significant hyperbilirubinemia? [^116ujAxQ]. American Journal of Perinatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

We aimed to investigate whether cord blood bilirubin (CBB) level could be used to identify the newborns at a high risk of developing hyperbilirubinemia.

Study Design

Total and direct serum bilirubin level were evaluated from umbilical cord blood of newborns. We checked blood groups and Rh status of all mothers and determined blood groups and direct Coombs test (DC) of newborns born to mothers whose blood group was O type or Rh negative to determine the maternal-fetal blood group or Rh incompatibility.

Results

A total of 418 newborns were included, and phototherapy (PT) was required in 17 newborns. The cutoff value of CBB for predicting the occurrence of significant hyperbilirubinemia requiring PT was 1.67 mg/dL, with a sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 99%. The mean CBB level in babies receiving PT was 2.4 ± 0.9 mg/dL. When blood group, CBB level, DC, gender, and mode of delivery were assigned as possible risk factors, multıvariate analysis showed ABO, Rh incompatibility, and CBB level increased the risk of PT requirement.

Conclusion

CBB could be useful to determine newborns at a risk of developing hyperbilirubinemia and prevent developing severe complications due to delay in diagnosis.

### Neonatal bowel obstruction [^116H4vvb]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Newborn intestinal obstructions are a common reason for admission to neonatal ICUs. The incidence is estimated to be approximately 1 in 2000 live births. There are 4 cardinal signs of intestinal obstruction in newborns: (1) maternal polyhydramnios, (2) bilious emesis, (3) failure to pass meconium in the first day of life, and (4) abdominal distention. The presentation may vary from subtle and easily overlooked findings on physical examination to massive abdominal distention with respiratory distress and cardiovascular collapse. A careful history and physical examination often identify the diagnosis. Concomitant resuscitation (volume, gastric decompression, and ventilatory support) may be necessary.

### Meconium is not enough: look for the hole! [^114wJRY2]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Anorectal malformations are usually diagnosed at birth, and the diagnosis is usually readily apparent in boys and girls by direct inspection of the perineal region. However, some of the less complex lesions, often referred to as 'low lesions', such as rectovestibular fistula in girls, may not be diagnosed at birth. These children are able to pass meconium, and it is only when the narrow fistula fails to pass formed stool later in infancy or childhood does the child become symptomatic. It is important to emphasise that the diagnosis of these defects should be made during neonatal predischarge examination. Such a delayed diagnosis may change their management, complicate surgical repair and may contribute to both functional and psychological problems for the patient and family.

Neonatal jaundice evaluation — bilirubin testing and communication practices: Clinicians should consider adding direct or conjugated bilirubin testing when serum total bilirubin testing is performed, and these levels can be measured from the same heel stick or venipuncture sample without an additional blood draw; accurate reference ranges help ensure high direct or conjugated bilirubin levels are recognized, and newborn inpatient providers could help outpatient PCPs by clearly documenting high levels and/or directly informing them about abnormal results.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 379: management of delivery of a newborn with meconium-stained amniotic fluid [^1122dhFL]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

In accordance with the new guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Heart Association, all infants with meconium-stained amniotic fluid should no longer routinely receive intrapartum suctioning. If meconium is present and the newborn is depressed, the clinician should intubate the trachea and suction meconium and other aspirated material from beneath the glottis.

### Case report: cholecystoduodenostomy for cholestatic liver disease in a premature infant with cystic fibrosis and short gut syndrome [^111SGh9E]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 2.28 kg female infant born at 33 weeks gestational age with antenatally diagnosed bowel obstruction and Cystic Fibrosis (F508Del/F508Del), underwent laparotomy with small bowel resection (82 cm residual small bowel and intact ileocaecal valve) and ileostomy formation on day 1 of life. Severe meconium peritonitis was present secondary to a small bowel perforation caused by meconium ileus and midgut volvulus. The ileostomy was reversed at 2 months of age. During this time she was dependent on parenteral nutrition as minimal enteral feeds were tolerated. Worsening jaundice (conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia) and acholic stools developed after the first month of age. These peaked at 2–3 months of age (total bilirubin 111 μmol/L, conjugated bilirubin 104 μmol/L, GGT U/L 660 U/L, ALT 167 U/L) despite treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid, cycling of parenteral nutrition and efforts to optimise enteral feeding. Hepatobiliary (HIDA) scans demonstrated no biliary drainage. During an open cholangiogram via the gallbladder (Fig. 1), contrast did not pass beyond the cystic duct. Liver biopsy taken at this time demonstrated fibrous expansion of portal tracts, cholestasis and bile duct proliferation. Differential diagnoses included inspissated bile due to CF, parenteral nutrition-related liver disease and biliary atresia. Daily flushing with normal saline and N-acetylcysteine via cholecystostomy and subsequent percutaneous cholangiograms were unsuccessful. Glucagon therapy was trialled following review of a case report, it was ceased due to adverse side effects. Following extensive discussion between the patients' parents, her CF team and surgeons, at 3 months of age, the patient underwent a cholecystoduodenostomy (Fig. 2) in order to bypass the extrahepatic biliary tract whilst preserving the infant's biliary tract and her remaining small bowel. At the time of surgery, cannulation of the cystic duct was attempted. The cystic duct was punctured and the cannula flushed with saline but there was leakage. An intraoperative cholangiogram demonstrated ongoing leakage outside of the duct with subperitoneal tracking of contrast. A cholecystoduodenostomy was then performed as well as a repeat liver biopsy. The biopsy showed liver disease with minimal early nodular fibrotic changes. Her stool became formed and pigmented within 5 days. Bilirubin levels normalised post-operatively and her jaundice resolved within 1 month of surgery (Fig. 3). She was discharged home on full enteral feeds at 6 months of age. At 11 months of age the patient was admitted electively for insertion of gastrostomy due to ongoing requirement for overnight enteral feeds. She has introduced solids to her diet and her weight has continued to improve. At 18 months of age her BMI is now on the 37th centile. She has had no episodes of acute cholangitis and no elevated bilirubin levels. The patient continues on Trimethoprim/Sulphamethoxazole for Staphylococcus aureus prophylaxis (s.aureus prophlyaxis is standard care for CF patients under 2 years at SCH).

### When pneumonia does not respond to antibiotics: a challenging neonatal diagnosis [^117B2CMX]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2014). Low credibility.

Routine pulse oximetry screening can detect cases of critical CHD missed by antenatal ultrasonography and newborn examination, and thus by preventing circulatory collapse has potential benefits for neonatal mortality and long-term morbidity. As of now there is no national protocol for pulse oximetry screening of newborns, but one possible method is suggested here (box 1).

Box 1
Proposed method of routine saturation measurement, based on American Academy of Paediatrics algorithm: Screening for Critical Congenital Heart Defects

Screening should be performed at the time of the routine newborn examination. Variation in the length of inpatient stay for mother and baby will necessitate a pragmatic approach to the time of screening.
Probe should be placed sequentially on either foot (postductal), and on the right hand (preductal). There is data to suggest that measuring preductal and postductal saturations can increase detection of congenital heart disease. A preductal and postductal difference of > 3% should be considered abnormal.
Baby should be awake but not struggling, and have regular breathing
Record for at least 2 min
Oxygen saturations should be ≥ 95%
Saturations of 90–94% should prompt a paediatric assessment and a repeat measurement in 4–6 h.
Saturations below 90% should prompt a paediatric assessment and admission for further investigation, including echocardiography.

On the postnatal ward at 14 h of age, the midwife called the paediatrician to review the baby due to poor feeding. The mother reported the baby had not fed well since birth and did not want to suckle at the breast or bottle, though she had passed urine and meconium.

On examination, the baby was grunting and had intercostal recession with nasal flaring. Observations revealed a temperature of 37.5°C with a heart rate of 140 bpm and respiratory rate of 70 breaths per minute. No murmur was heard and the femoral pulses were easily palpable. Abdominal examination was unremarkable with no hepatomegaly. Tone was normal and the anterior fontanelle soft.

### Fetal meconium does not have a detectable microbiota before birth [^112BQGzB]. Nature Microbiology (2021). High credibility.

Microbial colonization of the human intestine impacts host metabolism and immunity; however, exactly when colonization occurs is unclear. Although many studies have reported bacterial DNA in first-pass meconium samples, these samples are typically collected hours to days after birth. Here, we investigated whether bacteria could be detected in meconium before birth. Fetal meconium (n = 20) was collected by rectal swab during elective breech caesarean deliveries without labour and before antibiotics and compared to technical and procedural controls (n = 5), first-pass meconium (neonatal meconium; n = 14) and infant stool (n = 25). Unlike first-pass meconium, no microbial signal distinct from negative controls was detected in fetal meconium by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Additionally, positive aerobic (n = 10 of 20) and anaerobic (n = 12 of 20) clinical cultures of fetal meconium (13 of 20 samples positive in at least one culture) were identified as likely skin contaminants, most frequently Staphylococcus epidermidis, and not detected by sequencing in most samples (same genera detected by culture and sequencing in 2 of 13 samples with positive culture). We conclude that fetal gut colonization of healthy term infants does not occur before birth and that microbial profiles of neonatal meconium reflect populations acquired during and after birth.

### Meconium aspiration syndrome: historical aspects [^113ySeAY]. Journal of Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

The meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) is a common problem that continues to concern perinatologists and neonatologists. MAS is defined as respiratory distress in an infant born through meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) whose symptoms cannot be otherwise explained. This disorder may be life threatening, complicated by respiratory failure, pulmonary air leaks and persistent pulmonary hypertension. Approaches to the prevention of MAS have changed over time with collaboration between obstetricians and pediatricians forming the foundations for care. This report details the management of babies delivered with associated MSAF before the accumulation of evidence for best practice through appropriately powered, prospective randomized controlled trials.

### Lactate: creatinine ratio in babies with thin meconium staining of amniotic fluid [^114vUjVJ]. BMC Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

After excluding postmature babies and those who are likely to be infected, we assume for purposes of this study that all babies who pass meconium have asphyxia. Those who pass thick meconium are assumed to have intrapartum asphyxia and those with thin meconium to have antepartum asphyxia. We tested the premise with Lactate: Creatinine ratio (L: C ratio)- a proven marker of asphyxia.

Combining lactate- a product of anaerobic metabolism resulting from hypoxia, and creatinine-a measure of renal function whose excretion is reduced in renal compromise caused by ischaemia, L: C ratio in urine has been shown to predict HIE and future neurodevelopmental outcome. Huang et al studied a group of severely asphyxiated newborns, identified by well-established criteria of perinatal asphyxia (thick meconium among others) and reported that L: C ratio of 0.64 or higher in first passed urine was highly specific for HIE.

We used L: C ratio as a marker to study antepartum and intrapartum asphyxia. We tested L: C ratio in a group of term babies, born to mothers without a history of intrauterine infection, through thin and thick meconium, and for comparison in a group of normal babies without meconium.

### Neonatal jaundice [^117TVxhe]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 50% of term and 80% of preterm babies develop jaundice, which usually appears 2 to 4 days after birth, and resolves spontaneously after 1 to 2 weeks. Jaundice is caused by bilirubin deposition in the skin. Most jaundice in newborn infants is a result of increased red cell breakdown and decreased bilirubin excretion.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia in term and preterm infants? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to February 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 42 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: albumin infusion, exchange transfusion, home phototherapy, immunoglobulin, hospital phototherapy, and tin-mesoporphyrin.

### ACOG committee opinion number 346, October 2006: amnioninfusion does not prevent meconium aspiration syndrome [^113TnNWE]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Amnioinfusion has been advocated as a technique to reduce the incidence of meconium aspiration and to improve neonatal outcome. However, a large proportion of women with meconium-stained amniotic fluid have infants who have taken in meconium within the trachea or bronchioles before meconium passage has been noted and before amnioinfusion can be performed by the obstetrician; meconium passage may predate labor. Based on current literature, routine prophylactic amnioinfusion for the dilution of amnioinfusion for meconium-stained amniotic fluid should be done only in the setting of additional clinical trials. However, amnioinfusion remains a reasonable approach in the treatment of repetitive variable decelerations, regardless of amniotic fluid meconium status.

### Antibiotics for neonates born through meconium-stained amniotic fluid [^111FYmC4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Approximately 1 in 10 pregnancies is affected by meconium passage at delivery, which can result in meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). MAS can cause respiratory complications and, very rarely, death. Antibiotics have been prescribed for neonates exposed to meconium in amniotic fluid, with the intention of preventing infection due to potential bacterial contaminants.

Objectives

We conducted this review to assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotics for:1. prevention of infection, morbidity, and mortality among infants born through meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) who are asymptomatic at birth; and2. prevention of infection, morbidity, and mortality among infants born through MSAF who have signs and symptoms compatible with meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS).

Search Methods

We performed a literature search using the following databases: MEDLINE (1966 to July 2016); Embase (1980 to July 2016); the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to July 2016); and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 7) in the Cochrane Library. We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of retrieved articles.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared antibiotics administered via any route versus placebo or no treatment for prevention of infection among neonates exposed to MSAF, or who developed MAS. We excluded cohort, case control, and any other non-randomised studies and applied no language restrictions. We included studies of term and preterm infants, and we included studies examining use of any antibacterial antibiotics. We included studies that reported on any outcomes of interest.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed the methodological quality of included trials by reviewing information provided in study reports and obtained by personal communication with study authors. We extracted data on relevant outcomes, estimated effect size, and reported values as risk ratios (RRs), risk differences (RDs), and mean differences (MDs), as appropriate. We conducted subgroup analyses for treatment of MAS and for prophylaxis (asymptomatic neonates exposed to meconium).

Main Results

Four randomised controlled studies including a total of 695 participants were eligible for inclusion. Three studies evaluated neonates with MAS, and one study assessed asymptomatic neonates exposed to meconium in amniotic fluid. These studies exhibited varying degrees of methodological rigour: Two studies were at low risk of bias, and two were at unclear risk. We graded evidence derived from these studies as low quality. We downgraded overall evidence owing to the large number of participants lost to follow-up in one trial, the small sample sizes of all trials, and unclear methodological details provided for two trials. The primary outcome was risk of early- and late-onset neonatal sepsis. Antibiotics did not decrease the risk of sepsis in neonates with a diagnosis of MAS (RR 1.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 8.96; RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.03; 445 participants, three studies; I² = 0%) nor in asymptomatic neonates exposed to meconium in amniotic fluid (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.34; RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.04; 250 participants, one study; I² = 0%). Results show no significant differences in mortality or duration of stay in hospital between groups given antibiotics and control groups of symptomatic and asymptomatic neonates. One study in asymptomatic neonates reported a significant reduction in duration of mechanical ventilation for the control group compared with the antibiotic group (MD 0.26, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.37; 250 participants, one study; I² = 0%).

Authors' Conclusions

Upon review of available evidence, we found no differences in infection rates following antibiotic treatment among neonates born through meconium-stained fluid and those with meconium aspiration syndrome. The overall quality of evidence is low owing to the small number of included studies. Well-controlled studies of adequate power are needed.

### Lactate: creatinine ratio in babies with thin meconium staining of amniotic fluid [^114VKck7]. BMC Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Methods

The study was conducted at St Stephen's Hospital, Delhi India. It is a 600 bedded tertiary level postgraduate teaching hospital, conducting 5000 deliveries annually, equipped with a 75 bedded nursery and level III neonatal intensive care unit.

Of 1415 deliveries between January to March 2000 at our hospital, 212 babies were born through MSAF. Some of these mothers were referred from other centers in labor and antenatal records were not available. These mothers were excluded. The number of eligible mothers was thus 112. From among these, post term mothers and mothers with a history suggestive of infection were excluded. 86 consecutive newborns of 36–42 weeks of gestation with meconium staining of amniotic fluid, without evidence of maternal infection (indicated by fever, premature rupture of membranes, or foul smelling vaginal discharge), were thus subjects of the study. None of the babies had any renal abnormality, or other congenital anomalies detected at antenatal ultrasonographic examination. 28 babies did not pass urine within six hours. Urine from 6 babies could not be analyzed as volume available, after centrifugation (to remove the heavy precipitates in neonatal urine), storage, and transportation to the laboratory was found inadequate. Finally more than 1 mL of clear supernatant urine passed within six hours of birth was available for testing from 52 babies and this group of samples was analyzed. Figure 1 shows a flow diagram of how the cases were recruited.

### Breast milk enema and meconium evacuation among preterm infants: a randomized clinical trial [^116AERm1]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Outcomes

Two primary outcomes were assessed. The first was the time to achieve complete meconium evacuation, defined as the time until the occurrence of yellow stool for 1 day, encompassing both the complete evacuation of meconium and the transitional stool phase. The second primary outcome was time to complete enteral feeding, defined as the number of days from birth to full enteral feeding. More specifically, regarding full enteral feeding, criteria included the feeding volume of 180 mL/kg/d and weight gain exceeding 20 to 25 g/d within a 24-hour time frame. We accurately recorded the time to the hour and subsequently converted it into days by dividing it by 24 hours. The secondary outcomes were duration of hospitalization (in days), weight at the time of discharge, and duration of TPN. Safety outcomes included the incidence of AEs, including retinopathy of prematurity (any stage), intraventricular hemorrhage (grade 2), NEC, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, late-onset sepsis, and colorectal and anal injuries, as well as death.

Data Collection, Management, and Quality Control

Trained researchers collected data using standardized questionnaires and measurements to ensure accuracy. At baseline, the following information regarding the premature infants and their mothers was collected: gestational age, birth weight, demographic information, history of disease, and medications used during pregnancy. The following major aspects of outcome information were collected during the follow-up: meconium evacuation, feeding, laboratory test results, and AEs. The data were securely managed throughout the trial and reviewed by quality control experts. Reasons were provided when data was modified. EpiData, version 3.1 (EpiData Association) statistical software was used to build the database.
