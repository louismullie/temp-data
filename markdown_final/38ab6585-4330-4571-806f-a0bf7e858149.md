## Question

is it normal to have Micrococcus species in urine culture

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Micrococcus species in a urine culture are normal. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what Micrococcus is and its usual role in the microbiology lab. Then, I should verify how urine culture protocols and quantitative thresholds influence interpretation. Next, I will examine the clinical context, including symptoms, collection method, and whether there is polymicrobial growth. After that, I should review guideline positions on contaminants and asymptomatic bacteriuria. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stewardship-aligned interpretation and action plan, making sure I double-check edge cases like immunocompromised hosts or special populations.

> Let me first confirm the organism profile. Micrococcus species are Gram-positive aerobic cocci commonly found on human skin and mucosal surfaces; they are generally considered low-virulence commensals and are frequently categorized as contaminants when recovered from clinical specimens, including urine and blood, unless there is compelling evidence otherwise [^114XQYVB] [^111bLBQV] [^1137ApGj].

> Wait, let me verify the culture methodology before jumping to conclusions. Standard urine culture uses small inocula and short aerobic incubation, which can miss fastidious organisms and may detect low-level skin and periurethral contaminants; the lower limit of detection with a 1 µL inoculum is about 1,000 CFU/mL, so growth below this threshold may reflect contamination rather than true infection, especially in voided specimens [^112sG6yq] [^1136QGZc]. I should also confirm that polymicrobial growth, particularly three or more species, is a red flag for contamination and should prompt careful interpretation or repeat collection if clinically indicated [^115U41GU] [^112X9ECx].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "normal". I initially thought "normal" might mean expected urinary microbiota, but I need to check that nuance. The adult urinary tract is not sterile and harbors a urinary microbiome, yet Micrococcus is not a recognized member of the core urobiome in healthy individuals; its appearance in culture usually reflects periurethral or collection-related contamination rather than resident bladder flora, so calling it "normal" would be misleading in most clinical contexts [^116SCaSd] [^1137ApGj] [^113iL4uM].

> Next, I should review quantitative thresholds and specimen source. In asymptomatic patients, ≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL of a single uropathogen defines asymptomatic bacteriuria, but for low-virulence skin organisms like Micrococcus, even growth at ≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL is generally not considered clinically significant unless the patient is symptomatic and other pathogens are absent; in symptomatic patients, some guidelines accept ≥ 10³ CFU/mL for uropathogens, but this lower threshold does not convert Micrococcus into a pathogen by default [^1172Rvx7] [^114vh2Xz] [^1137ApGj]. I should double-check that catheterized specimens reduce contamination and improve specificity; indeed, invasive sampling lowers the diagnostic threshold and improves interpretability when symptoms persist and contamination is suspected [^114vh2Xz] [^115U41GU].

> I will now examine the clinical context. If the patient is asymptomatic, Micrococcus in the urine — especially at low counts or in mixed growth — should be treated as contamination or colonization, and antibiotics should be withheld to avoid harm and resistance; screening for and treating asymptomatic bacteriuria is not recommended except in pregnancy or prior to urologic procedures breaching mucosa [^115cn9bG] [^111s8y5Z] [^1137PKjR]. If the patient has urinary symptoms, I need to ensure there is pyuria and a compatible uropathogen before attributing infection; Micrococcus alone, particularly in low numbers or mixed growth, is insufficient to diagnose UTI and should prompt reconsideration of contamination or an alternative diagnosis [^112KNEot] [^112X9ECx].

> But wait, what if the host is immunocompromised or the specimen is from a catheterized patient? I should confirm that even in higher-risk hosts, Micrococcus remains an uncommon uropathogen; in such cases, if symptoms are present and no better pathogen is identified, a repeat culture from a freshly placed catheter or a more specific diagnostic approach may be warranted, but routine treatment of Micrococcus-positive cultures without supportive clinical evidence is still discouraged [^115U41GU] [^116gHYk5] [^116pgCbY].

> Let me consider special diagnostic frameworks. In children, strict collection methods and quantitative thresholds are emphasized, and contaminants like Micrococcus are typically excluded from UTI definitions; in pregnancy, screening and treatment are reserved for recognized uropathogens meeting ASB criteria, not skin flora such as Micrococcus; in older adults, overtreatment of ASB is a recognized problem, reinforcing a conservative stance toward Micrococcus isolates [^114HmEsm] [^117CjqAr] [^111s8y5Z].

> I should double-check the stewardship angle. Diagnostic stewardship guidance highlights avoiding unnecessary urine cultures, optimizing collection and transport, and using interpretive comments to flag likely contaminants; reporting Micrococcus with a comment such as "likely skin contaminant; correlate with symptoms and pyuria" aligns with best practices and reduces inappropriate antibiotics [^112yvqFv] [^115U41GU].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure my bottom line is precise. Micrococcus species in urine culture are not considered normal urinary flora and are most often contaminants from periurethral skin or collection; they are not considered uropathogens in standard practice and should not be treated unless there is a highly atypical scenario with strong clinical and microbiologic evidence supporting a pathogenic role, in which case expert consultation and repeat, high-quality sampling are advised [^1137ApGj] [^115U41GU].

---

Micrococcus species are **common skin and environmental contaminants** in urine cultures and are not considered uropathogens in healthy individuals [^1137ApGj]. Their presence in a urine culture usually reflects **contamination during collection** [^115U41GU] rather than true infection, especially when growth is low and mixed with other skin flora [^113iL4uM]. Micrococcus is not part of the normal urinary microbiome, and isolation should prompt careful review of collection technique and clinical context before any treatment is considered [^113jgBXL].

---

## Microbiological characteristics of Micrococcus species

Micrococcus species are **Gram-positive, aerobic cocci** commonly found on human skin and in the environment. They are **non-motile and catalase-positive**, distinguishing them from other cocci such as Staphylococcus species. Historically, they have been considered **non-pathogenic commensals**, rarely causing infections in immunocompetent individuals.

---

## Clinical significance of Micrococcus species in urine cultures

Micrococcus species are **generally regarded as contaminants** when isolated from urine cultures [^notfound]. Their presence is typically attributed to **improper collection** or handling of urine specimens, leading to contamination from skin or environmental sources [^115U41GU]. The clinical significance of Micrococcus species in urine cultures is minimal, and they are not considered part of the normal urinary microbiota [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing the presence of Micrococcus species in urine cultures

Several factors influence the presence of Micrococcus species in urine cultures, including:

- **Specimen collection method**: Improper collection techniques, such as not using a midstream clean-catch method, significantly increase the risk of contamination [^114vh2Xz].

- **Patient-specific factors**: Immunocompromised patients or those with indwelling urinary catheters may have a higher risk of colonization or infection by atypical organisms, including Micrococcus species [^notfound].

- **Laboratory processing**: Delays in processing urine specimens or inadequate storage conditions can lead to contamination and false-positive results [^112sG6yq].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of **accurate specimen collection** and **interpretation of urine culture results** [^112yvqFv]. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) recommend:

- **Proper specimen collection**: Use of midstream clean-catch techniques to minimize contamination [^112sG6yq].

- **Clinical correlation**: Interpretation of urine culture results should always be correlated with clinical symptoms and patient history [^112KNEot].

- **Avoidance of unnecessary treatment**: Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria, including cases involving Micrococcus species, is generally discouraged unless specific clinical indications are present [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring further evaluation

While Micrococcus species are generally considered contaminants, certain clinical scenarios may warrant further evaluation:

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Patients with compromised immune systems may be at risk for infections caused by atypical organisms, including Micrococcus species [^112sf2Lo].

- **Indwelling urinary catheters**: Patients with long-term indwelling catheters may develop colonization or infection by unusual organisms, necessitating careful clinical assessment [^116FLZgR].

- **Persistent isolation**: Repeated isolation of Micrococcus species from properly collected specimens may indicate colonization or infection, particularly in patients with underlying urinary tract abnormalities [^114XQYVB].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Micrococcus species are **generally considered contaminants** in urine cultures and are not part of the normal urinary microbiota [^notfound]. Their presence in urine cultures typically reflects contamination during specimen collection or handling [^notfound]. Clinicians should interpret positive results cautiously, correlate with clinical symptoms, and avoid unnecessary antibiotic treatment. Further evaluation is warranted only in specific clinical scenarios, such as immunocompromised patients or those with indwelling urinary catheters [^notfound].

From a microbial perspective, each uropathogenic species may carry its own infection dynamics, such that employing universal thresholds across all species to define infection (e.g. ≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL) is likely an oversimplification. Some patients may experience symptomatic infections with bacterial counts as low as 10² CFU/mL. Not only are these levels below the limit of detection of a standard 1 µL inoculum, but they overlap with potential levels of contamination. Unfortunately, in deciphering low-level pathogens from prominent contaminants, a laboratory cannot directly control for the variable quality of specimen collection, and a traditional culture cannot differentiate the active pathological process of a UTI from colonization/ASB.

### The urinary microbiome and its contribution to lower urinary tract symptoms; ICI-RS 2015 [^115JAaRr]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

The microbiome is the term used for the symbiotic microbial colonisation of healthy organs. Studies have found bacterial identifiers within voided urine which is apparently sterile on conventional laboratory culture, and accordingly there may be health and disease implications.

Methods

The International Consultation on Incontinence Research Society (ICI-RS) established a literature review and expert consensus discussion focussed on the increasing awareness of the urinary microbiome, and potential research priorities.

Results

The consensus considered the discrepancy between findings of conventional clinical microbiology methods, which generally rely on culture parameters predisposed towards certain "expected" organisms. Discrepancy between selective culture and RNA sequencing to study species-specific 16S ribosomal RNA is increasingly clear, and highlights the possibility that protective or harmful bacteria may be overlooked where microbiological methods are selective. There are now strong signals of the existence of a "core" urinary microbiome for the human urinary tract, particularly emerging with ageing. The consensus reviewed the potential relationship between a patient's microbiome and lower urinary tract dysfunction, whether low-count bacteriuria may be clinically significant and mechanisms which could associate micro-organisms with lower urinary tract symptoms.

Conclusions

Key research priorities identified include the need to establish the scope of microbiome across the range of normality and clinical presentations, and gain consensus on testing protocols. Proteomics to study enzymatic and other functions may be necessary, since different bacteria may have overlapping phenotype. Longitudinal studies into risk factors for exposure, cumulative risk, and emergence of disease need to undertaken. Neurourol. Urodynam. 36:850–853, 2017. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Urinary tract infections — key laboratory diagnosis points state that in the absence of signs and symptoms consistent with urinary tract infection, a urine culture is typically not recommended, and urine collected for culture should not be kept at room temperature for more than 30 minutes, with specimens held at refrigerator temperatures or in a preservative tube if not processed within 30 minutes. Reflex to culture based on a positive pyuria screen may be considered, but if a reflex algorithm is implemented, it should be a locally approved policy guided by clinicians and laboratorians. Three or more species of bacteria in a urine specimen usually indicates contamination at the time of collection and interpretation remains challenging.

In this first episode of the Microbiologist in the Clinic series, clinicians and laboratory scientists share their perspectives about a 30 y/o woman, who is seeking specialty consultation for frequent episodes of urinary urgency, frequency, and dysuria, which respond to short courses of antibiotics. Although her home dipsticks suggest that she has a UTI, and her urinalysis typically has a moderate number of white blood cells, her urine cultures are always negative. The challenges of this clinical presentation are discussed with evidence for evaluation and treatment.

### Approach to a positive urine culture in a patient without urinary symptoms [^116EoXQ4]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is a condition in which bacteria are present in a noncontaminated urine sample collected from a patient without signs or symptoms related to the urinary tract. ASB must be distinguished from symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) by the absence of signs and symptoms compatible with UTI or by clinical determination that a nonurinary cause accounts for the patient's symptoms. The overall purpose of this review is to promote an awareness of ASB as a distinct condition from UTI and to empower clinicians to withhold antibiotics in situations in which antimicrobial treatment of bacteriuria is not indicated.

Along with abundance and purity, additional factors also dictate how each colonial morphotype is characterized by the laboratory. These include the method of collection (invasive versus non-invasive), characteristics of the patient (pediatric versus adult, etc.), as well as the identity of the organisms themselves. Species generally considered urogenital flora (e.g. viridans Streptococcus and coagulase-negative staphylococci other than S. saprophyticus) are infrequently pursued. Various guidelines synthesize these parameters as a framework for working up isolates, including whether to perform definitive taxonomic ID and phenotypic AST. Typically, complete ID/AST is performed for each of one or two cultured urinary isolates. For voided urine, isolation of a uropathogen at > 10⁵ CFU/mL is interpreted as the highest evidence of clinical significance, a threshold that shifts down by 1 log for invasively collected specimens. With properly collected specimens, diagnostic cultures from healthy individuals typically generate no colonies (cases of ASB notwithstanding), yielding a reference value of No Growth Observed.

Although guidelines help ensure intra-laboratory standardization, traditional culture protocols are beset by key shortcomings. First and foremost, one must recognize the workflow limitations of culture in relation to diagnostic turnaround and clinical impact. Initial culture data are not available the same day as specimen collection, and traditional phenotypic AST adds at least 1 more day to final reporting. By the time definitive laboratory results can guide care, a patient may have already received several days of empiric therapy. Timeframe aside, the practice of inferring clinical significance from cultured bacterial concentrations stems from historical studies with circumscribed scope. A threshold of 10⁵ CFU/mL derives from work focusing on the reproducibility of semi-quantitative data in the context of ASB, as well as the progression of patients to pyelonephritis. Nevertheless, this same approach is now applied to virtually every patient population for whom a culture is desired. A urine culture is now even employed for motivations outside the diagnosis of UTI proper, including evaluation of patients for bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis. As many laboratories attest, the broad application of a method that was initially developed around a narrow focus can led to poor sensitivity/specificity in many scenarios.

### Reassessment of routine midstream culture in diagnosis of urinary tract infection [^115CWj9W]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

This study underlines the potential weaknesses of the MSU culture for diagnosing UTI in patients affected by LUTS, which should now be assessed further in a larger, multicenter study. These patients appear to harbor chronic infection, missed by quantitative cultures and most effectively demonstrated by nonculture techniques. These methods shed light on the complexity of the bacterial communities within these patients, whose symptoms and urinary white blood cell count may be the best indicators of infection until the disease landscape is better understood. In the meantime, those responsible for UTI detection, diagnosis, and patient care, including clinicians and microbiologists, may wish to use caution when interpreting a negative or mixed-growth MSU culture result in symptomatic patients, as well as reassess reporting and treatment guidelines to arrive at a solution most appropriate for patients in a way that also preserves antibiotic stewardship efforts. Ultimately, a point-of-care test based on a sound understanding of the relevant microbiomes using emerging portable genomic technology would revolutionize the diagnostic landscape for this common affliction.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^1126FRvn]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Pediatric urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnosis — urine culture thresholds and organism relevance: In infants and children, an appropriate threshold to consider bacteriuria significant is at least 50 000 CFUs per mL of a single urinary pathogen, and reducing the threshold from 100 000 CFUs per mL to 50 000 CFUs per mL may increase sensitivity but decrease specificity; laboratories that report categorical results (0 to 1000, 1000 to 10 000, 10 000 to 100 000, and more than 100 000 CFUs per mL) require contextual interpretation for results in the 10 000 to 100 000 CFUs per mL range, and organisms such as Lactobacillus spp, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Corynebacterium spp are not considered clinically relevant urine isolates for otherwise healthy, 2- to 24-month-old children; infants with positive culture alone are recognized as having asymptomatic bacteriuria rather than a true UTI when pyuria is absent.

### Polymicrobial interactions in the urinary tract: is the enemy of my enemy my friend? [^115qTE9Q]. Infection and Immunity (2021). Medium credibility.

The vast majority of research pertaining to urinary tract infection has focused on a single pathogen in isolation, and predominantly Escherichia coli. However, polymicrobial urine colonization and infection are prevalent in several patient populations, including individuals with urinary catheters. The progression from asymptomatic colonization to symptomatic infection and severe disease is likely shaped by interactions between traditional pathogens as well as constituents of the normal urinary microbiota. Recent studies have begun to experimentally dissect the contribution of polymicrobial interactions to disease outcomes in the urinary tract, including their role in development of antimicrobial-resistant biofilm communities, modulating the innate immune response, tissue damage, and sepsis. This review aims to summarize the epidemiology of polymicrobial urine colonization, provide an overview of common urinary tract pathogens, and present key microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions that influence infection progression, persistence, and severity.

URINARY DIAGNOSTICS IN THE MICROBIOME AGE

More fundamentally, interpretations of diagnostic urine culture are predicated on the laboratory conditions under which they are performed, that is, aerobically and with brief incubation times. In fact, these protocols long created the notion that urine is physiologically sterile, as a reference result of No Growth Observed assumes that bacteria are absent from a healthy bladder. Recent recognition of the human urobiome, even outside the context of ASB, has turned this assumption around. By applying extended culture conditions to urine — including larger inocula, microaerobic/anerobic/CO 2 -enhanced atmospheres, additional media, and longer incubation times — urine cultures frequently reveal more fastidious commensals that otherwise go unrecognized diagnostically. These same microbial populations can be observed/assessed by molecular metagenomics, most notably 16S-based techniques. Enhanced techniques are better suited to identify certain uncommon, or potentially underrecognized, bacterial agents of UTI. With variable supporting evidence — from individual case reports to larger bodies of literature — these atypical uropathogens include Aerococcus urinae, Actinotignum schaalii, Alloscardovia omnicolens, lipophilic Corynebacterium spp. (in particular, Corynebacterium urealyticum), Gardnerella vaginalis, Bordetella hinzii, among others.

### Targeted screening for third-generation cephalosporin-resistant enterobacteriaceae carriage among patients admitted to intensive care units: a quasi-experimental study [^114XQYVB]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection was defined by the following criteria:
Fever (> 38°C), feeling of urinary urgency, frequent urination, dysuria, burning sensation, suprapubic pain in the absence of any other cause, infectious or noninfectious; and
With current catheterization or catheterization in the preceding 7 days: positive urine culture (≥ 10⁵ cfu/ml) and, at the most, two different microorganisms; and
Without catheterization: leucocyturia (≥ 10⁴ cells/mL) and positive urine culture (≥ 10³ cfu/mL) and, at the most, two different microorganisms.

Bacteraemia was defined as an association of clinical signs and at least one positive blood culture isolate. Two positive blood cultures with the same microorganism were needed for the following microorganisms: coagulase-negative staphylococci, Bacillus spp. (except Bacillus anthracis), Corynebacterium spp. Propionibacterium spp. Micrococcus spp. or other saprophytic or commensal microorganisms with comparable pathogenic potential. Blood cultures should be collected from different sites and at different times (maximum of 48 hours is usual).

### Rapid detection of urinary tract infections via bacterial nuclease activity [^113TS6Pi]. Molecular Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Rapid and accurate bacterial detection methods are needed for clinical diagnostic, water, and food testing applications. The wide diversity of bacterial nucleases provides a rich source of enzymes that could be exploited as signal amplifying biomarkers to enable rapid, selective detection of bacterial species. With the exception of the use of micrococcal nuclease activity to detect Staphylococcus aureus, rapid methods that detect bacterial pathogens via their nuclease activities have not been developed. Here, we identify endonuclease I as a robust biomarker for E. coli and develop a rapid ultrasensitive assay that detects its activity. Comparison of nuclease activities of wild-type and nuclease-knockout E. coli clones revealed that endonuclease I is the predominant DNase in E. coli lysates. Endonuclease I is detectable by immunoblot and activity assays in uropathogenic E. coli strains. A rapid assay that detects endonuclease I activity in patient urine with an oligonucleotide probe exhibited substantially higher sensitivity for urinary tract infections than that reported for rapid urinalysis methods. The 3 hr turnaround time is much shorter than that of culture-based methods, thereby providing a means for expedited administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy. We suggest this approach could address various unmet needs for rapid detection of E. coli.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^111xbJLf]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Urine Culture

There are differing definitions of positive urine culture. The American Academy of Pediatrics defines the quantity of bacteria for a UTI as > 50,000 colony-forming units/mL. In young infants (≤ 90 days) with frequent urination, 1000–10,000 CFU/mL in catheter specimens may indicate UTI. Clinically relevant uropathogens include Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. Proteus spp. Enterobacter spp. Citrobacter spp. P. aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Enterococcus spp. Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Streptococcus agalactiae. In general, growth of ≥ 2 different bacterial species suggests contamination. Lactobacillus spp. coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and Corynebacterium spp. are generally not relevant, including in the context of indwelling catheters. However, CoNS may be relevant in immunocompromised children or preterm infants (see below).

Urine culture alone should not be used to diagnose UTI (bacterial presence may just reflect bacteriuria) but should always be considered in the context of the clinical situation.

To determine whether a UTI is complicated, which subgroup a child belongs to, and which investigations are needed, elements of the medical history and clinical review should include:

primary (first) or secondary (recurring) infection, including type (febrile or non-febrile UTIs)
abnormalities of the urinary tract [on pre- or postnatal ultrasound scan (USS)]
previous medical/surgical history
voiding habits
bowel habits, including history of constipation
family history or nephrological/urological problems
neonates and infants with urosepsis may present with nonspecific symptoms (fever without source, failure to thrive, jaundice, vomiting, hyperexcitability, lethargy, hypothermia and sometimes without fever)
in older children upper urinary tract symptoms include fever, flank pain and vomiting
in older children, lower urinary tract symptoms include dysuria, frequency, urgency, incontinence, hematuria and suprapubic pain
malodorous urine may be a symptom of UTI, but it is nonspecific as other factors such as diet, hydration and medication may also cause this.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^113b4o2G]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — urine culture diagnostic thresholds and reporting: A positive urine culture is typically characterized by bacteriuria of at least 10⁵ colony-forming units (CFU)/mL, although according to the European Association of Urology guidelines, a count of 10² CFU/mL in symptomatic patients is sufficient for diagnosis; Canadian guidelines state that even 10² CFU is sufficient in the setting of UTI symptoms, and certain laboratories may report 10⁴ or less as "no growth".

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^112X9ECx]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — urine culture contamination is common and clinically consequential. Standard urine culture is susceptible to contamination with an average contamination rate of 15% across institutions; contamination is likely when there is low bacterial growth and/or growth of several species typical of urethral and vaginal commensals such as Lactobacilli, Corynebacteria, Gardnerella, alpha-hemolytic Streptococci, and aerobes. Contamination often arises in the pre-analytic phase (urine collection, storage, and transport), and false positives can lead to suboptimal or unnecessary treatment and added healthcare costs.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1172Rvx7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) diagnostic definitions and specimen requirements — In patients without indwelling catheters, ASB is defined as ≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units (CFU)/mL in a voided urine specimen without signs or symptoms attributable to urinary tract infection (UTI). For women, 2 consecutive specimens obtained preferably within 2 weeks are used to confirm persistence, and between 10% and 60% of women do not have persistent bacteriuria on repeat screening after an initial positive specimen. For men, a single urine specimen meeting these quantitative criteria is sufficient for diagnosis. In patients with indwelling devices, ≥ 10³ CFU/mL remains the most appropriate diagnostic criteria for bladder bacteriuria, while lower quantitative counts (≥ 10² to < 10⁵ CFU/mL) from "in and out" catheterization or after insertion of a new indwelling catheter suggest true bacteriuria, although the clinical significance of these lower counts in asymptomatic people has not been evaluated.

### Reassessment of routine midstream culture in diagnosis of urinary tract infection [^111sPosx]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Extended culture-based analysis.

Urine samples were stored at 4°C for 0.5 to 4.0 h before transportation to the research laboratory (University College London, London, UK), where they were processed immediately. An identical MSU culture was performed on an aliquot of the same urine specimen. Simultaneously with this culture, 50 µl of uncentrifuged urine was plated on chromogenic agar. From the remaining aliquots of each specimen, 30 mL was centrifuged at 1,400 × g for 10 min. The sediment was resuspended in 400 µl of sterilized phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution (Life Technologies, UK). Tenfold serial dilutions were performed using PBS to reveal the presence of morphologically small-sized colonies where the growth of other organisms dominated. All cultures were incubated aerobically at 37°C for 18 to 24 h.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^112KNEot]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Urinalysis with reflex-to-culture algorithms — pyuria thresholds and exceptions indicate there is no single laboratory parameter or combination of parameters that can sufficiently predict whether the patient has a urinary tract infection or if bacteria will be recovered in culture, and that pyuria alone is likely the best marker in terms of negative predictive value, with leukocyte esterase or white blood cells (WBCs) increasing the likelihood of a positive culture, although detection methods have not been standardized. Although > 10 WBCs per low power field is a commonly adopted threshold for a urinalysis with reflex to culture (UARC) algorithm, this threshold cannot be effectively applied to all patient groups, and exceptions are recommended for patients who are pregnant and for patients with urologic abnormalities or undergoing urologic procedures. Laboratory algorithms should take into account local patient populations and should be guided by both clinicians and laboratorians, and in older adults with mental status changes or other signs classically localizing UTI symptoms, bacteriuria may be unrelated and a thoughtful approach should be taken before interpretations are made.

### EAU guidelines on urological infections [^117ARgks]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute cystitis, more specifically with respect to urine culture, EAU 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain urine culture in the following situations:

- suspected acute pyelonephritis

- symptoms not resolving or recurring within 4 weeks after completion of treatment

- females presenting with atypical symptoms

- pregnant patients.

### An implementation guide to reducing overtreatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria [^115ggoQL]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on asymptomatic bacteriuria:

- **Definition**: ASB is defined as the presence of bacteria in an uncontamined urine sample at a microbial load of ≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL, without any associated signs or symptoms of UTI.
- **Pathophysiology**: ASB is most frequently caused by E. coli, followed by P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae, Enterobacter species, P. aeruginosa, Enterococcus species, S. aureus, S. saprophyticus, and Streptococcus agalactiae.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of ASB is 1–2% in healthy men, 1–9% in healthy women, 2–15% in pregnant women, 1–30% in diabetic adults, 2–50% in community-dwelling adults, 14–75% in institutionalized adults, and 9–100% in patients with indwelling catheters.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for ASB include female sex, advancing age, the use of indwelling catheters, pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, glucosuria, a history of UTIs, prostatic obstruction, neurological disorders, inadequate peri-anal hygiene, insufficient fluid intake, and overactive bladder syndrome.
- **Disease course**: In patients with ASB, symptoms of UTI are absent for a variety of reasons, including attenuated host immune response, as well as reduced microbial virulence, growth rates, and cell densities.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Treatment of ASB should be avoided in low-risk populations given the absence of demonstrated benefit, potential for adverse drug reactions, and risk of promoting antibiotic-resistance. Select patients who may derive benefit from treatment include pregnant women and patients undergoing certain invasive procedures.

URINE CULTURE AS A STANDARD OF CARE

Bacterial cultures have been the cornerstone to the diagnosis of UTIs since the 1950s. It is therefore important to understand the basis of these culture-based techniques, against which any new technologies are compared. Even before a urine specimen arrives in the lab, culture protocols are defined by pre-analytic steps that begin with collection. Into the early 1950s, urine specimens were more frequently collected via catheterization to reduce contamination, although the practice as conducted at the time not infrequently led to iatrogenic UTIs. Voided specimens have since become the norm, with a midstream clean catch required to minimize periurethral contamination. While first-morning specimens yield higher bacterial concentrations than samples collected later in the day, the impact on collection practices is likely minimal. If not processed within 30 minutes to 2 hours, urine must be kept refrigerated at 4°C to minimize changes in bacterial composition. Boric acid (20 g/L) is commonly used as a bacteriostatic agent to stabilize specimens for up to 48 hours.

Semi-quantitative urine culture is performed by most laboratories. For voided specimens, 1 µL of urine is plated onto a non-selective and Gram-negative-selective media which are incubated aerobically for a minimum of 12–18 hours, leading to growth of non-fastidious aerobes and facultative anaerobes. Over the years, various additional selective/differential media have been developed to aid in presumptive identification. Catheterized, cystoscopic, and aspirated suprapubic collections may be inoculated with 10 µL of specimen and plates held for up to 48 hours. The inoculation volume defines the lower limit of detection: 1,000 CFU/mL for 1 µL, 100 CFU/mL for 10 µL. Furthermore, the 1 µL–10 µL inoculum helps reduce potential co-isolation of periurethral contaminants, which rarely exceed 1,000 CFU/mL under proper clean-catch conditions. Plates are observed for the quantity and purity of microbial growth, which are both summarized in the reported result. Higher-abundance growth is more strongly associated with clinical significance, while multiple colony morphotypes (typically ≥ 3) are considered evidence of periurethral contaminant. At the same time, the latter phenomenon must be weighed alongside the possibility of polymicrobial UTIs in at-risk patients.

### Urine trouble: should we think differently about UTI? [^115iUiqd]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is clinically important, given that it is one of the most common bacterial infections in adult women. However, the current understanding of UTI remains based on a now disproven concept that the urinary bladder is sterile. Thus, current standards for UTI diagnosis have significant limitations that may reduce the opportunity to improve patient care. Using data from our work and numerous other peer-reviewed studies, we identified four major limitations to the contemporary UTI description: the language of UTI, UTI diagnostic testing, the Escherichia coli-centric view of UTI, and the colony-forming units (CFU) threshold-based diagnosis. Contemporary methods and technology, combined with continued rigorous clinical research can be used to correct these limitations.

### Antibiotic overuse in a contemporary cohort of children hospitalized with influenza, RSV, or SARS-CoV-2: a retrospective cohort study [^1137ApGj]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Data collection

Medical records were reviewed to identify patients with positive tests for influenza, RSV, or COVID-19 within 48 h of hospitalization and to collect demographic and clinical characteristics including age, sex, race, microbiology results, hospital length of stay, laboratory results, and antibiotic administration in the Emergency Department or any inpatient hospital unit. We did not include antibiotics received at other hospitals or in the outpatient setting prior to admission. Race and ethnicity were both self-reported. Culture-confirmed bacterial infection was defined as growth of clinically significant bacteria (non-commensal species) indicative of bacterial co-infection from any specimen source including blood, urine, pleural fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, and respiratory secretions (sputum, tracheal aspirates) throughout the hospitalization. Time of infection detection was defined as time bacterial growth from clinical specimens was reported in the electronic medical record. We also used a second, more stringent definition of culture-confirmed bacterial infection that excluded cultures of respiratory specimens. We did not collect information on presence of white blood cells (WBC) in respiratory cultures. Cultures from any specimen type with growth of common commensals, including diphtheroids, Micrococcus species, S. viridans, and coagulase-negative Staphylococci were considered colonizers and not bacterial infection. Patients with multiple viruses were excluded from multivariable logistic regression models. Comorbidities, symptomatic respiratory tract infection, and concurrent non-respiratory infections were assigned if an appropriate ICD-10 code was associated as primary or other diagnosis during a hospital encounter (Supplemental Table).

Data analysis

After excluding patients with detection of multiple viruses, two different multivariable logistic regression models were developed a priori to identify predictors of (1) at least one dose of antibiotic treatment and (2) greater than 3 days of antibiotic treatment. The model included variables that were deemed clinically significant based on clinical judgement. The logistic regression models included the type of virus, age, presence of elevated inflammatory markers [procalcitonin, PCT, (≥ 0.5 ug/mL) or C-reactive protein, CRP (≥ 50 mg/L)], intensive care unit (ICU) status, comorbidities, concurrent non-respiratory infection and whether the patient received mechanical ventilation. In the final multivariable models, patients who did not have inflammatory markers measured were assumed to have normal inflammatory markers; results did not differ when we ran the models including only patients with PCT or CRP results. Bacterial co-infection and antibiotic utilization percentages were determined by type of virus. Analyses were done using Stata 17 (Stata Corp BE).

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^117CjqAr]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Screening tests and intervals — pregnancy urine culture thresholds: Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy is done with urine culture at 12 to 16 weeks of gestation or at the first prenatal visit; urine culture is currently recommended for screening in pregnancy and is the established method for diagnosis. A culture obtained using a midstream, clean-catch urine sample with greater than 100 000 colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter of a single uropathogen is considered a positive test result, and greater than 10 000 CFU/mL of group B Streptococcus is an indicator of vaginal colonization and is commonly used as the threshold for treatment of infection in pregnancy. There is little evidence on the optimal timing and frequency of screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^114vh2Xz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Cystitis and pyelonephritis — quantitative urine culture thresholds and test utilization specify that the standardized threshold in symptomatic patients is > 100 000 CFU/mL for organisms identified as common pathogens, though many sites now use either 10 000 CFU/mL or 1000 CFU/mL based on the method of collection or patient population as a baseline for culture workup and clinical significance. Laboratories typically provide antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) for potential pathogens recovered in significant gram numbers as part of standard laboratory protocol. The Gram stain is not routinely utilized for the diagnosis of uncomplicated urinary tract infection, but it may have limited utility in patients with febrile urinary tract infection (pyelonephritis, prostatitis, urosepsis) where high numbers of gram-negative bacilli may be present in urine screen. Because urine may be readily contaminated with urogenital microbiota, proper specimen collection is essential for urine culture and should be performed using a process that minimizes contamination from the perineal and superficial mucosal microbiota.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115cn9bG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) 2019 asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) guideline — definition and scope: ASB is defined as the presence of 1 or more species of bacteria in urine at specified counts (≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units [CFU]/mL or ≥ 10⁸ CFU/L), irrespective of pyuria, and without signs or symptoms attributable to urinary tract infection (UTI). The 2005 IDSA guideline recommended that ASB should be screened for and treated only in pregnant women or in an individual prior to undergoing invasive urologic procedures, and treatment was not recommended for healthy women; older women or men; or persons with diabetes, indwelling catheters, or spinal cord injury. The current guideline reviews and updates the 2005 guideline, and the recommendations also consider populations not addressed previously, such as children and patients with solid organ transplants or neutropenia, noting that antimicrobial stewardship programs have identified management of ASB as an important opportunity for decreasing inappropriate antimicrobial use.

Clinician summary for screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults — For pregnant persons, Grade B: Screen persons who are pregnant for asymptomatic bacteriuria with a urine culture, and for nonpregnant adults, Grade D: Do not screen adults who are not pregnant for asymptomatic bacteriuria. Screening in pregnancy is implemented using a midstream, clean-catch urine culture at the first prenatal visit or at 12 to 16 weeks of gestation, whichever is earlier; a urine culture showing > 100 000 CFU/mL of a single uropathogen or > 10 000 CFU/mL if the pathogen is group B Streptococcus indicates treatment. This applies to adults 18 years and older and pregnant persons of any age without signs and symptoms of a urinary tract infection. It does not apply to persons who have chronic medical or urinary tract conditions or are hospitalized or living in institutions such as nursing homes.

Human as habitat model — lower urinary tract microbiome and asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) reframe culture interpretation and clinical outcomes. Sensitive culture-dependent and -independent techniques reveal that the lower urinary tract, even in asymptomatic, healthy individuals, hosts a complex microbial community, challenging the prior view that urine is sterile and redefining UTI as microbial infiltration of an otherwise sterile tract; in this view all individuals are likely "bacteriuric", these commensal communities are generally symbiotic, and ASB communities may protect patients with recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) from additional symptomatic episodes. Among 673 young women with ASB, those treated with antibiotics experienced higher rates of subsequent symptomatic UTI, intentional bladder colonization with a nonpathogenic E. coli (HU2117) has been shown to safely reduce symptomatic UTI risk in patients with spinal cord injury, and large epidemiologic studies document a high prevalence (> 75%) of chronic or fluctuating lower urinary tract symptoms in the general population.

### Reassessment of routine midstream culture in diagnosis of urinary tract infection [^113PjzaN]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Of note, some UTI-associated organisms were shared at the culture level by symptomatic and asymptomatic patients: Corynebacterium, Enterococcus, Escherichia, Klebsiella, Proteus, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus. The presence of uropathogenic species in controls could reflect a lack of the appropriate virulence factor expression or immune differences in the host (e.g. see reference). However, similar community profiles in the bladder have been seen by others, which makes it likely that the ability to be pathogenic is highly context dependent and could therefore be influenced by the presence of other species. Such pathobiont relationships are common in the microbial world and in the case of UTI have been reported in mixed infections withand Enterococcus. Furthermore, voided urine passes through the urethra as well as the bladder; the microbial ecology of the urethra is poorly understood in the case of UTI, and further studies are needed to understand what role such urethral communities might play.

Further afield, microbial community inhabitants in adjacent niches, such as the vagina and perianal region, may also influence what species induce UTI pathophysiology. For example, recent work by Gilbert et al. showed that transient exposure to the vaginal organismcould induce dysbiosis, reactivating dormantin previously infected mouse bladders. Other interactions could be protective; for example, the vaginal commensal, which is known to make the vagina less hospitable to certain Gram-negative perianal uropathogens, may decrease the instance of recurrent UTI. Indeed, our results showing that Lactobacillus is a dominant organism among the control samples, consistent with reports from other groups comparing the urine of patients with LUTS with that of asymptomatic controls, support this notion. Further research, including detailed sequence comparisons, is required to understand the mobility and interspecies effects of the various microbial inhabitants in the perianal region and the urethra region. This could further our understanding of the significance of polymicrobial communities in UTI.

### Novel technologies for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^114mcwdi]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conversely, PCR-based technologies may provide some value to patients with complex and recurrent true UTI, as they are better able to detect fastidious microorganisms, such as Actinotignum schaalii, Mycoplasma hominis, or Ureaplasma spp. if these are included among the targets of the panel. These targets may be important for some populations, particularly post-menopausal patients with recurrent UTI. However, differentiation of these as pathogens vs normal urinary microbiota complicates use of PCR in these instances. One study showed PCR was better able to detect low-level infections caused by typical organisms, including E. coli.

To date, no clear studies have defined the best population for which these technologies might be applied. This is largely due to the variability in assay design, which makes comparison across studies complex. Unsurprisingly, molecular assays with a larger breadth of targets are associated with increased detection of pathogens and species diversity, although no studies evaluated impact of these on patient management.

Next-generation sequencing methods

Multiple companies are developing next-generation sequencing approaches for the assessment of microorganisms in urine and other specimens. The majority of these are offered only as reference laboratory models, as described further below. However, Illumina (San Diego, CA) has a urine-specific research use-only test available, the Urinary Pathogen ID/AMR (UPIP) enrichment kit. This test applies target-capture enriched next-generation sequencing to detect 121 bacterial species, 3,728 antimicrobial resistance genes, 14 fungi, 4 parasites, and 35 viruses within 24 hours.

Many studies exist in the literature that demonstrate application of NGS to urine specimens to aid with diagnosis of UTI. The substantial variability across the methodologies, subjects, syndromes, and study design across these studies makes drawing conclusions challenging. A recent meta-analyses was conducted that evaluated studies with similar design for the evaluation of NGS technologies in the diagnosis of UTI. This analysis included seven studies with 274 urine specimens from 262 patients. As expected, 78.1% of the 82 culture-negative specimens were positive by NGS. The species diversity was significantly higher in specimens when tested by NGS than by routine culture, with 170 bacterial taxa detected by NGS, only 38 of which were cultivable by standard culture. Only two studies in this analysis included AST predictions, which were concordant for 84.6% of 52 specimens analyzed.

Many of these specimens will show no evidence of infection and several methods can be used to screen out negative samples. Those that grow bacteria need to be carefully assessed to quantify the degree of bacteriuria and hence clinical relevance. To influence treatment, a final report should be produced within 24 hours of specimen receipt, with turnaround times continuously monitored. Much work needs to be done to determine the cost effectiveness involved in processing urine specimens and the evidence base for the final report provided.

INTRODUCTION

Animal models have a longstanding track record in the study of microbial pathogens, including the fulfillment of Koch's third postulate [that is, the cultured microorganism should cause disease when introduced into a healthy organism]. Although an excellent in vivo model is indispensable for virulence studies, such models may be difficult to establish for fastidious or host-restricted pathogens. Furthermore, even when models exist, complex disease progression can confound experimental interpretation. For example, in the urinary tract, infecting microbes exhibit planktonic growth in urine, adhere or invade the bladder epithelium, ascend into the kidneys, and disseminate into the bloodstream. Microbes compete with the host immune response and with established bladder microbiota. Each of these challenges can manifest as a chokepoint, or physiological bottleneck, where only a limited number of microbes become established. These bottlenecks have a profound effect on experimental design, particularly in modern large-scale studies, where the number of mutants that can be feasibly studied without random loss is limited due to such founder effects.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common infections worldwide, affecting most women at least once in their lifetime. These infections are even more common in patients with urinary catheters, where a more diverse mix of bacterial species is likely to be the causative agent. In particular, Proteus mirabilis is especially problematic in patients with long-term (> 30 days) indwelling urinary catheters. This species produces urease, which cleaves urea, abundantly present in urine, into ammonia and carbon dioxide. The resulting pH increase causes precipitation of calcium and magnesium ions naturally present in urine, to form struvite and hydroxyapatite crystals that can block catheter flow and directly damage urinary tract tissue via stone formation (urolithiasis).

Previous studies on P. mirabilis virulence have relied on a well-established murine model of UTI. Most often, this model involves instillation of bacteria directly into the bladder via a catheter, which can either be removed to study UTI progression in the absence of a foreign body or fully pushed into the bladder to model long-term catheterization. In either case, P. mirabilis readily establishes infection and, similar to human UTI, may cause pyelonephritis and urolithiasis. In addition to challenging mice with one or two strains at a time, the mouse model has been used to screen pools of mutants from uropathogenic species of bacteria.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults: the most fragile women are prone to long-term colonization [^116KXkdL]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Because of these ambiguities, understanding which residents are prone to develop ABU is important and can help physicians to guide antibiotic treatment. While urine cultures from subjects with a high risk of having ABU should be interpreted with care, urine cultures from low-risk groups have a higher diagnostic value. Older studies identified age, incontinence, functional disability, mental status and mobility as risk factors that are associated with an increased chance of having ABU. Although there are discrepancies between these studies, in general, more frail subjects have a higher risk of ABU. Longitudinal studies in the older adults report that the overall prevalence of ABU is rather static, but with high turnover rates, and conclude that ABU is a rather transient phenomenon with only a minority of people presenting with persistent colonization.

In this study, we identified prevalence rates, causal species and risk factors associated with ABU and long-term ABU in a LTCF. In addition, we recorded UTI episodes of all participants during the study period and 6 months following the last sample collection to investigate a possible preventive effect of ABU on UTI occurrences. A policy of the LTCF to avoid the prophylactic use of antibiotics allowed to evaluate the occurrence of asymptomatic bacteriuria with only few participants excluded due to antibiotic interference.

Outcome Definitions

HAIs were defined according to the timing and microbiology of positive cultures from blood, respiratory, and urine specimens across the 3 study hospitals, with each specimen source considered separately. The culture collection date and time was used to determine whether the infection was a community-associated infection, defined as a positive culture obtained less than 48 hours after admission, or an HAI, defined as a positive culture obtained 48 hours or more after admission. Using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention standards, as we have done previously, repeat infections were defined as a positive culture from the same specimen source more than 14 days from the original positive culture. Therefore, a patient with a community-associated infection could develop an HAI at the same site during the same admission according to this repeat infection timeline, but repeat positive cultures from the same site within 14 days were considered a single infection episode. For blood cultures, we excluded common contaminants (eg, diphtheroids and Micrococcus species) and excluded coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species unless the coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species was identified on more than 1 culture date. For HAIs, a positive blood culture 3 days before or after a positive respiratory or urine culture with a matching organism was considered a secondary infection rather than a blood stream HAI. Adverse outcomes of HAIs during the admission included ICU admission on or after the HAI date and in-hospital death.

Covariates

Baseline covariates during the admission included 2 additional SDOH of interest: Medicaid insurance and quartile of national household income (lowest income quartile vs other 3 income quartiles). We used patient home zip code to determine the US Census Bureau median household incomeand referenced national income thresholdsto determine whether the patient resided in an area corresponding to the lowest national income quartile. Admissions missing a zip code or without a household income data match (0.4% of the cohort) were assigned the median income of the overall cohort.

Additional covariates included patient sex, age group, year of admission, study hospital, comorbidities, body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) category, and modified Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score quartile. Comorbidities were defined using International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes and the Elixhauser classification. A modified APACHE score was calculated using laboratory results and vital sign measurements in the first 24 hours of the admission including all items except for Glasgow Coma Scale score.

SIFT-seq enables to screen for UTI and to characterize the urine microbiome

The healthy urinary tract was long believed to be sterile, but this picture was challenged with recent advances in urine culture techniques that have identified bacteria in the urinary tract of both males and females. Yet many microbes are difficult to cultivate in vitro, and bacterial culture can also be sensitive to contamination. Therefore, comprehensive and accurate characterization of species colonizing the urinary microbiome is still lacking.

We reasoned that SIFT-seq could provide insight into the composition of the urine microbiome with both high sensitivity and specificity. We first applied SIFT-seq to 26 urine samples from 23 kidney transplant patients with and without infection of the urinary tract as determined by conventional urine culture (16 positive urine culture [Enterococcus faecalis: n = 3; Enterococcus faecium: n = 1; E. coli: n = 10; Klebsiella pneumoniae: n = 1; Pseudomonas aeruginosa: n = 1] and 10 negative urine culture). SIFT-seq consistently identified microbial cfDNA from species reported by urine culture (16/16 urine culture positive samples; Fig. 3a). SIFT-seq also identified two Corynebacterium species (Corynebacterium jeikeium and Corynebaterium urealyticum) in one sample from a urine culture positive patient (E. coli) with culture confirmed Corynebacterium co-infection. In addition, we found that samples from positive urine culture patients had a significantly higher burden of total microbial DNA compared to samples from negative urine culture patients (1451.8 ± 3024.7 MPM and 12.8 ± 17.6 MPM, respectively in the filtered samples; p value = 7.1 × 10⁻⁴, two tailed, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Fig. 3b). Conventional metagenomic sequencing (without SIFT-seq filtering) detected uropathogens with equal sensitivity but was not robust against environmental contamination: DNA from common uropathogens not identified by culture was detected in many samples, albeit with low abundance, including in samples from patients without urine culture-confirmed UTIs. We conclude that the improved specificity of SIFT-seq allows for more accurate characterization of co-infection networks in the scope of UTIs, and more accurate characterization of the normal urine microbiome in the absence of UTIs. It is important to note that two common skin microbes, C. acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis, were found in most samples (23/26 samples). While these two species have been shown to cause UTIs, they may also have been introduced as contaminants at the time of urine collection, which underscores an important limitation of SIFT-seq: SIFT-seq is not robust against contamination that occurs before the tagging step.

Urine culture and microbial identification strategy in recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — When clinical presentation and urinalysis suggest possible infection, examination for urinary bacteria using standard urine culture should be performed to inform antibiotic selection; in a propensity-matched cohort study of 48,283 women with localized UTIs, having a urine culture > 50% of the time was associated with fewer UTI-related hospitalizations and lower rates of intravenous antibiotic usage compared with not having cultures > 50% of the time; nonetheless, standard urine culture has significant limitations with contamination, mishandling, and false negatives affecting up to 40% of clinically apparent UTIs, and no current test reliably distinguishes infection from colonization across all patients, so the Guideline emphasizes individualized interpretation and serial evaluation; the Panel recognizes that, in select rUTI recurrences, presumptive treatment with antibiotics can be initiated prior to finalization of testing results based on prior speciation, susceptibilities, and local antibiogram, and for reliable patients the Panel recommends a process of shared decision-making regarding deferring therapy prior to obtaining urine culture results.

### Intracellular bacterial communities: a potential etiology for chronic lower urinary tract symptoms [^111hfoFD]. Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with persistent lower urinary tract symptoms and negative urine cultures are often difficult to treat. Infection may go undetected in these patients because the concentrations of bacteria in their urine are beneath the threshold of standard urine culture techniques. Empiric treatment may result in temporary relief, followed by recurrent symptoms. Occult and recurrent urinary tract infection may be due to both invasion of the bladder wall by uropathogenic Escherichia coli and the formation of biofilm-like intracellular bacterial communities. This review examines emerging evidence for a role of intracellular bacterial communities in human infection.

AUA/SUFU NLUTD catheter urine sampling — In patients with long-term indwelling catheters, sampling site and catheter age affect quantitative cultures and diagnostic performance. Bladder specimens were more likely to have CFU/mL < 10⁵, with < 10⁵ in 7 of 45 catheter strains versus 16 of 45 bladder strains (p < 0.05). There were 17 instances where catheter CFU exceeded bladder by at least tenfold, and using a CFU/mL > 10⁵ threshold yielded 90% sensitivity but 43% specificity. Older catheters produced more species (246 versus 157; p < 0.001) and a tenfold higher mean concentration, and indwelling duration > 3 weeks was associated with bacterial counts > 10⁵ (p < 0.05).

Expanded quantitative urine culture (EQUC) — capabilities, trial findings, and practical constraints — EQUC uses more inoculum, varied media and atmospheric conditions, and extended culture times to enhance bacterial recovery and can detect anaerobic, microaerophilic, and fastidious organisms beyond standard culture, although growth of E. coli is similar on catheterized specimens. In a randomized controlled trial, treatment guided by standard culture versus EQUC produced similar symptom resolution and no statistically significant difference in symptomatic improvement for non–E. coli strains; specimens were obtained by catheterization, and voided samples analyzed by EQUC in women with rUTI yielded high false positives. While EQUC allows antimicrobial susceptibility determination, it remains vulnerable to handling issues, contamination, and delays, and the lack of demonstrable clinical outcome advantages plus limited availability, labor/time demands, and catheterization requirements limit its utility for routine diagnosis of localized UTI.

Definition and prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria — Asymptomatic bacteriuria is defined as the presence of bacteria in the urine of a person without signs or symptoms of a urinary tract infection. The reported prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria ranges from 1% to 6% among premenopausal women to 22% among women older than 90 years; it is present in an estimated 2% to 10% of pregnant women. The condition is rare in men.

Endourologic procedures and asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) — For endoscopic urologic procedures associated with mucosal trauma, we recommend screening for and treating ASB prior to surgery (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). We suggest obtaining a urine culture prior to the procedure and prescribing targeted antimicrobial therapy rather than empiric therapy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). In patients with ASB who will undergo a urologic procedure, we suggest a short course (1 or 2 doses) rather than more prolonged antimicrobial therapy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence), and antimicrobial therapy should be initiated 30–60 minutes before the procedure.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in neutropenia — no recommendation for high-risk neutropenia; low-risk patients have very small infection risk. In patients with high-risk neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 100 cells/mm3), ≥ 7 days' duration following chemotherapy), we make no recommendation for or against screening for or treatment of ASB (knowledge gap). For patients with high-risk neutropenia managed with current standards of care, it is unclear how frequently ASB occurs and how often it progresses to symptomatic UTI. Patients with low-risk neutropenia (> 100 cells/mm3, ≤ 7 days, clinically stable) have only a very small risk of infection.

### Novel technologies for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^115fihMp]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

UTIs are opportunistic infections, whereby pathogens ascend from colonizing niches (the gut, perineum, and/or vagina) into the urinary tract. Escherichia coli is the most common agent of UTIs, causing 65%–75% of infections overall. Beyond E. coli, the taxonomic landscape of UTIs is incredibly diverse. For uncomplicated infections, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Klebsiella pneumoniae are also commonly observed. In the setting of cUTIs, when host comorbidities present added opportunities for infection, a broad array of bacteria are observed including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other Enterobacterales (Proteus, Serratia, and Enterobacter spp.), and Enterococcus spp. For some microorganisms, the diagnostic significance in urine is not always clear and may be context dependent, including Staphylococcus aureus and Candida spp. The diagnostic status quo is likewise complicated by several rare, but well-established, uropathogens with more fastidious growth characteristics, and a growing list of species whose status as commensal-versus-pathogen is not always clear. The diagnostic challenge posed by such emerging uropathogens is detailed further below.

Against this complex background, traditional diagnostic cultures — together with urinalysis — represent staples of care. At the same time, there is a growing desire for UTI diagnostics that leverage new technology for more sensitive, specific, or rapid results. Of particular interest are tools that reduce the latency between initial, empiric UTI management and targeted therapy, based on species identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST). Various new platforms for UTI diagnosis are under development. The ultimate clinical impact of these tools will be a function of the method, interpretation, cost, regulatory status, population tested, and even the rapidly growing knowledge on urinary tract microbiology. To these ends, we provide a technical overview of these emerging technologies.

### Urine is not sterile: use of enhanced urine culture techniques to detect resident bacterial flora in the adult female bladder [^113iL4uM]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

Our previous study showed that bacterial genomes can be identified using 16S rRNA sequencing in urine specimens of both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients who are culture negative according to standard urine culture protocols. In the present study, we used a modified culture protocol that included plating larger volumes of urine, incubation under varied atmospheric conditions, and prolonged incubation times to demonstrate that many of the organisms identified in urine by 16S rRNA gene sequencing are, in fact, cultivable using an expanded quantitative urine culture (EQUC) protocol. Sixty-five urine specimens (from 41 patients with overactive bladder and 24 controls) were examined using both the standard and EQUC culture techniques. Fifty-two of the 65 urine samples (80%) grew bacterial species using EQUC, while the majority of these (48/52 [92%]) were reported as no growth at 10³ CFU/mL by the clinical microbiology laboratory using the standard urine culture protocol. Thirty-five different genera and 85 different species were identified by EQUC. The most prevalent genera isolated were Lactobacillus (15%), followed by Corynebacterium (14.2%), Streptococcus (11.9%), Actinomyces (6.9%), and Staphylococcus (6.9%). Other genera commonly isolated include Aerococcus, Gardnerella, Bifidobacterium, and Actinobaculum. Our current study demonstrates that urine contains communities of living bacteria that comprise a resident female urine microbiota.

### Urinalysis: a comprehensive review [^117XeZs7]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

A complete urinalysis includes physical, chemical, and microscopic examinations. Midstream clean collection is acceptable in most situations, but the specimen should be examined within two hours of collection. Cloudy urine often is a result of precipitated phosphate crystals in alkaline urine, but pyuria also can be the cause. A strong odor may be the result of a concentrated specimen rather than a urinary tract infection. Dipstick urinalysis is convenient, but false-positive and false-negative results can occur. Specific gravity provides a reliable assessment of the patient's hydration status. Microhematuria has a range of causes, from benign to life threatening. Glomerular, renal, and urologic causes of microhematuria often can be differentiated by other elements of the urinalysis. Although transient proteinuria typically is a benign condition, persistent proteinuria requires further work-up. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections diagnosed by positive leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests can be treated without culture.

### A multicenter evaluation of viral bloodstream detections in children presenting to the emergency department with suspected systemic infection [^112sf2Lo]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Once enrolled, chart review was performed to abstract subject data including age, sex, hospitalization status, date of specimen collection, ED discharge diagnoses, and standard-of-care laboratory test results, including blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and urine cultures. For this study, an SBI was defined as a bacterial bloodstream infection, meningitis, or a urinary tract infection (UTI). A bacterial bloodstream infection was defined as growth of a pathogenic organism in one or more blood cultures. We excluded detection of presumed contaminating organisms, including coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CoNS), viridans streptococcus (other than Streptococcus anginosus group), Micrococcus sp. and Corynebacterium sp. Although these organisms can represent true pathogens in immunocompromised hosts, none were isolated on more than one repeated culture, and thus they were considered unlikely to be true pathogens. Bacterial meningitis was defined as growth of a pathogenic organism from the cerebrospinal fluid. Urinary tract infection was defined as having growth of a single pathogen at ≥ 50,000 colony forming units (CFU/mL), or if multiple potential pathogenic organisms were present, growth of a predominant pathogen at ≥ 50,000 CFU/mL. We excluded cultures with other polymicrobial growth, growth < 50,000 CFU/mL, growth of non-bacterial organisms (e.g. Candida albicans), growth of organisms which were not identified to the genus level (e.g. Gram-positive cocci), and growth of presumed contaminating organisms, such as CoNS and Bacillus sp.

### Development of disk diffusion susceptibility test methods forspp. and updates to clinical and laboratory standards institute MIC breakpoints [^112yT3aX]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Data from a large retrospective study conducted in Sweden found aerococci were isolated in 0.4% of urine cultures. Retrospective review of these cases found 20%–25% were associated with asymptomatic bacteriuria. The remaining 75%–80% were associated with symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTI), including pyelonephritis in 8% of cases where A. sanguinicola was isolated and 18% of cases where A. urinae was isolated. These data reflect other reports in the literature on rates of recovery and pathogenicity. Aerococcal bacteriuria generally occurs in older patients, with median patient age across cases reported globally being 78–82 years of age. However, aerococci may be associated with UTI outside the elderly, with a recent report documenting cases of aerococcal UTI in pediatric patients, most of whom had a pre-existing urogenital disorder. Based on these data, Aerococcus spp. were added to the list of micro-organisms recognized as uropathogens by the European Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine. Specifically, Aerococcus spp. were defined as a secondary uropathogen species, i.e. a rare, but real, cause of primary infection in patients with a normal urinary tract. The European guidelines recommend performing both full identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of aerococci if isolated at ≥ 10³ CFU/mL in pure culture from urine specimens with white blood cell counts > 30 × 10⁶ /L and suggest optional AST if aerococci are recovered as part of a mixed culture. In contrast, the Clinical Microbiology Procedures Handbook highlights A. urinae as an emerging pathogen that requires species-level identification when isolated in significant quantities based on the urine source but does not advocate for AST to be performed.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria: when the treatment is worse than the disease [^117HooRT]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2011). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU) is a condition in which bacteria are present in a noncontaminated urine sample collected from a patient without signs or symptoms related to the urinary tract. ABU must be distinguished from symptomatic UTI by the absence of signs and symptoms compatible with UTI or by clinical determination that a nonurinary etiology accounts for the patient's symptoms. Interactions between the organism, the host, and the bladder environment determine whether bacteriuria leads to ABU or to UTI. ABU is a very common condition that is often treated unnecessarily with antibiotics-it should be detected and treated in pregnant women and patients undergoing urologic surgery, but in most other patient groups, treatment does not confer benefit and can be harmful. A change in prescribing behavior for ABU has been achieved through several fairly high-intensity interventions, such as interactive educational sessions for physicians, but whether these improvements persist beyond the study period is not known. Further research is needed to determine whether screening for and treatment of ABU is beneficial in patients with renal transplants, patients with orthotopic neobladders, patients undergoing prosthetic joint implantation, and patients with neutropenia.

### Human bacterial repertoire of the urinary tract: a potential paradigm shift [^114zESe1]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

The aim of this article is to review the human repertoire of bacteria in urine already described by culture and metagenomic techniques and published in the literature. Our study led us to compare this repertoire with other available human repertoires. We followed automatic and manual bibliographical methods and found 562 bacterial species reported in the literature as part of the human urinary microbiota. Of the 562 species, 322 were described only by culture, 101 by both culture and metagenomics, and 139 only by metagenomics. A total of 352 species (62.6%) have been associated with at least one case report of human infection, of which 225 (40.0%) have been described as causative agents of urinary tract infection. The urinary tract bacterial repertoire contains 21.4% of the known prokaryotic diversity associated with human beings (464 species in common), and it shares 23.6% species with the human gut microbiota (350 species in common, 62.3% of the urine species). The urinary repertoire shares a significant difference in aerointolerant species compared with those of the gut microbiota (100/562 [17.8%] and 505/1,484 [34.0%], respectively; P < 0.001; odds ratio [OR] = 9.0 [7.0 to 11.4]). Studies using high-throughput sequencing show a higher proportion of aerointolerant bacteria in urine (74/240 [30.8%]) than studies using culture techniques (40/423 [9.5%]). Most pathogenic bacteria are part of the commensal human urinary tract bacteria, and their pathogenicity may occur following any imbalance of this microbiota. The restoration of urinary tract health can occur following a fecal transplantation. The potential gut origin of the human bacterial microbiota has to be explored.

### A multicenter evaluation of viral bloodstream detections in children presenting to the emergency department with suspected systemic infection [^113r1Tvb]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary of standard of care test results

Sixty-three subjects (63/1114, 5.7%) were found to have serious bacterial infections, which consisted of 29 bloodstream infections, 37 urinary tract infections, and one case of bacterial meningitis (Table 1). Four of these subjects had concurrent blood and urine cultures positive for the same organism.

Table 1
Standard-of-care (SOC) culture results with respect to viral pathogen detections by the emvPCR test

a Denominator represents the number of subjects who had urine cultures performed

b Denominator represents the number of subjects who had CSF cultures performed

c Total number of SBIs may be less than sum of individual SBIs if individual subjects had multiple types of SBIs

Among the subjects with bacterial bloodstream infections, six had Staphylococcus aureus and five had Escherichia coli bacteremia. One subject each had Salmonella Typhi, Samonella non- Typhi, Bacteroides fragilis, Enterococcus faecalis, S. anginosus group, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The remainder had Gram-negative rod bacteremia, with the exception of one subject who had both Candida parapsilosis and Staphylococcus simulans and was classified as having an SBI with diagnosis of a central-line associated tunnel infection. Thirty-five additional subjects had positive blood cultures growing presumed contaminants which were not isolated on subsequent blood cultures. These organisms were CoNS, viridans streptococcus (other than S. anginosus group), Micrococcus sp. and Corynebacterium sp. Thus, the majority of positive blood cultures in children presenting to the ED with suspected bloodstream infection (35/64, 54.7%) represented presumed contaminating organisms.

Of the 383 subjects who had urine cultures performed, 37 (9.7%) had a UTI defined as a urine culture growing a predominant uropathogen at ≥ 50,000 CFU/ mL. Thirty-four of these (34/37, 91.9%) screened positive by leukocyte esterase on urinalysis, whereas only 12 (12/37, 32.4%) had positive nitrites. All patients with UTIs with nitrites detected on their urinalyses were also positive for leukocyte esterase. An additional 38 (9.9%) of subjects grew contaminating organisms or pathogens at a concentration less than the defined threshold for the diagnosis of UTI. The single subject with bacterial meningitis grew Neisseria meningitidis from his CSF culture.

### Oxytetracycline hydrochloride, sulfamethizole and phenazopyridine hydrochloride (urobiotic) [^111mA4rQ]. FDA (2005). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS

Based on a review of this drug by the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council and/or other information, FDA has classified the indications as follows:

"Lacking substantial evidence of effectiveness as a fixed combination":

Urobiotic-250 is indicated in the therapy of a number of genitourinary infections caused by susceptible organisms. These infections include the following: pyelonephritis, pyelitis, ureteritis, cystitis, prostatitis, and urethritis.

Since both Terramycin and sulfamethizole provide effective levels in blood, tissue, and urine, Urobiotic-250 provides a multiple antimicrobial approach at the site of infection. Both antibacterial components are active against the most common urinary pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aerobacter aerogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus hemolyticus, and Micrococcus pyogenes. Urobiotic-250 is particularly useful in the treatment of infections caused by bacteria more sensitive to the combination than to either component alone. The combination is also of value in those cases with mixed infections, and in those instances where the causative organism is unknown pending laboratory isolation.

Final classification of the less than effective indications requires further investigation. Clinical studies to substantiate the efficacy of Urobiotic 250 are ongoing. Completion of these ongoing studies will provide data for final classification of these indications.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria, to screen or not to screen-and when to treat? [^111D5ira]. Current Opinion in Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU) is a common clinical condition that often leads to unnecessary treatment. The purpose of this review is to outline and evaluate the most recent literature on the management of ABU.

Recent Findings

The role of ABU management has been evaluated in several patient subgroups: healthy patients without identified risk factors, pregnant women, postmenopausal women, women with recurrent UTI, patients with diabetes, elderly institutionalized patients, patients with renal transplants, patients with indwelling catheters and prior to surgery. Available evidence only supports the need for screening and treatment of ABU in pregnant women and prior to urological procedures breaching the mucosa. In all the other conditions the treatment of ABU is not only useless but also harmful. A short course treatment in pregnant women is recommended; in patients with ABU prior to urological procedures breaching the mucosa the treatment should be given in line with antibiogram and in line with the recommendations of European Association of Urology guidelines.

Summary

The approach to patients with ABU has changed completely during recent years. Today, screening and treatment of ABU is recommended only in pregnant women and in all patients who are candidates for urological procedures breaching the mucosa.

### A highly accurate nanopore-based sequencing workflow for culture and PCR-free microbial metagenomic profiling of urogenital samples [^112HXZHr]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition the quantitative nature of our method allows us to demonstrate that average female urobiomes have two orders of magnitude more biomass/mL than males and that, of the 27 species identified to be common to urobiomes from both sexes, most were present at comparable cells/ml titres. Given the marked difference in total biomass between the sexes this highlights the majority contribution made by a subset of species that are heavily enriched or unique to female urogenital microbiomes including Gardnerella spp. Fanyhessea vaginae and six species of the genus Lactobacillus. In comparison, Lactobacillus species were almost completely absent in male urine samples that, in agreement with previous observations, are populated by low biomass of Streptococci; S. gwangjuense, S. mitis, S. pneumonia and S. pseudopneumoniae and members of the Serratia genus; S. urielytica, S. marcescens and S. nematodiphila. In line with previous reports, half of our input asymptomatic male urine samples returned no detectable organisms other than those compatible with contribution from the process kit-ome. Hence, they may be considered practically sterile as assayed by our technique. The high frequency of this finding in our male samples raises the possibility that, in stark contrast to females, this may represent the normal status of asymptomatic male urine. It also displays the dynamic range of our method that is able to report across 6 log units between the highest (1.3 × 10⁸ cells/swab, Lactobacillus iners, Female vaginal swab 54, Fig. 3) and lowest (1 × 10² cells/mL, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Male sample 14, Fig. 7) recorded individual values.

### Staphylococcus epidermidis in urine is not always benign: a case report of pyelonephritis in a child [^112Ri7TT]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Staphylococcus epidermidis in urine cultures from previously healthy children is usually considered to be a contaminant. The goal of this study was to identify cases in which S. epidermidis was an infectious cause of urinary tract infection (UTI) in children.

Methods

A literature search identified 7 cases, 6 of which were previously published and 1 which was unpublished, described herein.

Results

S. epidermidis was identified as the causative organism of UTIs in children with underlying urinary tract abnormalities.

Conclusion

UTIs caused by S. epidermidis in a previously healthy child should not be disregarded as a contaminant and further workup for urinary tract abnormality is indicated.

2.3.1 Clinical and microbiological considerations

Following the EAU guidelines on urological infections, the diagnosis of AC was made by the treating physician based on the clinical history and the typical clinical symptoms of patients referred to the clinic. All patients with a clinical diagnosis of AC underwent urinalysis and urine culture, obtaining a urine sample collected in the middle of urination. UTI–AC is defined microbiologically, according to the recommendations of the Infectious Disease Society of America, by the presence of ≥ 10⁵ CFU (colony‐forming units)/mL of a bacterial species isolated in a urine culture. In patients with the typical symptoms of UTI, a cut‐off point of ≥ 10³ CFU/mL was also accepted. Women clinically diagnosed with AC based on symptoms and with a positive urine leukocyte esterase test but without significant bacteriuria of ≥ 10³ CFU/mL in urine culture were not excluded from the study, as there is evidence that AC can occur with a low bacterial count. The results of urine analysis were usually evaluated in the midstream as the number of cells in a chamber's cell (high power field [HPF]). Dipstick urinalysis is convenient, but false‐positive and false‐negative results can occur. According to publications, the normal reference value for women is 0–5 white blood cells/HPF. However, it can vary depending on regulatory issues, equipment, local guidelines, clinical protocols.

### Evaluation of WASPLab software to automatically read chromID CPS elite agar for reporting of urine cultures [^113KQArF]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

An unexpected finding during this study was the software's detection of microcolonies not detected by the technologists. Unfortunately, analysis was performed after testing was completed, so there were no specimens or plates to go back to for identification of these microcolonies. Growth of these slow-growing organisms is likely due to the enhanced recovery of microorganisms using smart incubators. A recent study in 2018 evaluated recovery of organisms from urine culture pre- and postautomation. Interestingly, the use of smart incubators allowed for routine detection offrom blood agar plates more often than did standard incubation. Others have found similar results, demonstrating increased recovery of Gram-positive rods, such asspp. and. It is possible that these microcolonies may include pathogens, so further study is warranted.

Comparisons between technologist and software reporting were performed based on specimens being positive when 10 or more colonies are identified; however, the software could differentiate between 9 different growth characteristics and was highly accurate in colony counts. Laboratory workflow could be improved by developing software rules that incorporate the laboratory's standard-of-care practices. For instance, significant growth could be defined as one or two colony types being ≥ 10 colonies to remove the need for interpretation of plates that do not contain significant growth of a single colony (i.e. 5 Gram-negative rods [GNR] and 7 Gram-positive cocci [GPC]). In addition, any growth could be reported when source is defined as a catheter to follow IDSA guidelines. Poor collection could be identified by automation and segregated from positive cultures when 3 or more colony types are detected at ≥ 10 CFU/ml. Of the 1,581 specimens tested during this study, 401 (25.4%) specimens could have been determined to contain multiple organisms present using these additional rules. If validated along with reporting significantand negative cultures, these data suggest that 58.8% of all urine cultures could be reported at as early as 18 h postinoculation, which could greatly reduce the workload on a laboratory and allow physicians to make informed treatment decisions earlier.

Antimicrobial stewardship considerations in asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) emphasize limiting unnecessary cultures and therapy; a positive urine culture often encourages antimicrobial use, and obtaining urine cultures when not clinically indicated promotes inappropriate antimicrobial use. Given the potential negative societal consequence of antimicrobial resistance, screening for bacteriuria and treatment of ASB should be discouraged unless there is evidence to support a benefit of treatment for a given population. Randomized studies across multiple groups found no benefit of antimicrobial treatment, while antimicrobials increased risks including antimicrobial resistance, Clostridioides difficile infection, and in some cases increased urinary tract infection shortly after therapy.

KAS 1 Clinicians Should Obtain Urine Specimen by Catheterization or SPA — clinicians should obtain a urine specimen by catheterization or suprapubic aspiration (SPA) for urinalysis and, if the urinalysis result is positive, for culture; this is a Strong Recommendation with Evidence Quality A. For 1000 infants, approximately 94 to 98 infants with urinary tract infections will be detected by a positive urinalysis result, and 2 to 6 may be missed; if the urinalysis result is negative, an estimated 200 to 500 catheterizations or SPAs followed by cultures would be required to detect 1 additional infant with bacteriuria. The American Academy of Pediatrics guideline basis used pyuria and at least 50 000 colony-forming units (cfu) per mL in appropriately collected urine, whereas 10 000 colony-forming units/mL is now an acceptable threshold for diagnosing urinary tract infection from catheterized urine specimens when pyuria and fever are also present, and this addresses laboratories not reporting graduations from 10 000 to 100 000. Culture of urine specimens not collected by catheterization or SPA is not recommended because of an unacceptable rate of false-positive results attributable to contamination, and positive urine culture results without an abnormal urinalysis indicating inflammation are likely to represent asymptomatic bacteriuria or contamination; SPA is effective and complications are rare.

### Reassessment of routine midstream culture in diagnosis of urinary tract infection [^112vZpwA]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Midstream urine (MSU) culture remains the gold standard diagnostic test for confirming urinary tract infection (UTI). We previously showed that patients with chronic lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) below the diagnostic cutoff on MSU culture may still harbor bacterial infection and that their antibiotic treatment was associated with symptom resolution. Here, we evaluated the results of the United Kingdom's MSU culture in symptomatic patients and controls. Next, we compared the bacterial enrichment capabilities of the MSU culture with those of a 50-µl uncentrifuged culture, a 30-ml centrifuged sediment culture, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. This study was conducted on urine specimens from 33 LUTS patients attending their first clinical appointment (mean age, 48.7years; standard deviation [SD], 16.5years), 30 LUTS patients on treatment (mean age, 47.8years; SD, 16.5years) whose symptoms had relapsed, and 29 asymptomatic controls (mean age, 40.7years, SD, 15.7years). We showed that the routine MSU culture, adopting the UK interpretation criteria tailored to acute UTI, failed to detect a variety of bacterial species, including recognized uropathogens. Moreover, the diagnostic MSU culture was unable to discriminate between patients and controls. In contrast, genomic analysis of urine enriched by centrifugation discriminated between the groups, generating a more accurate understanding of species richness. In conclusion, the United Kingdom's MSU protocol misses a significant proportion of bacteria, which include recognized uropathogens, and may be unsuitable for excluding UTI in patients with LUTS.

### Principles of diagnostic stewardship: a practical guide from the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America diagnostic stewardship task force [^112yvqFv]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). High credibility.

Diagnostic stewardship — test ordering through clinician interpretation — includes interventions in the electronic health record for test ordering, optimization of specimen collection and transport, laboratory processing strategies, postanalytic reporting optimization, and clinician test interpretation requirements. Test ordering in the electronic health record allows informational alerts, required indications, and limiting orders based on clinical data. Specimen collection and transport affect accuracy, and hospitals can optimize by providing instructions and training. Within the laboratory, activities include implementing new diagnostic methods to improve time to therapy or sensitivity and using sequential, conditional, or reflexive testing (for example, only performing urine cultures when the urinalysis is abnormal); selective susceptibility testing is applied in inappropriate situations, and contamination policies may mean "no further work-up is routinely provided (eg, 1 of 2 blood-culture sets with coagulase-negative staphylococci)". Test reporting — the postanalytic phase — can be optimized with comments, selective species reporting (for example, reporting yeast rather than "Candida" in respiratory cultures), interpretive statements, and antimicrobial stewardship team guidance such as dosing recommendations based on susceptibility breakpoints. Clinician interpretation requires assessing how tests identify those with and without disease, recognizing that test characteristics can vary by patient population, and using online diagnosis calculators such as QxMD and MDcalc.com to estimate posttest probabilities and disease risk.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in functionally impaired older adults in the community or long-term care — do not screen or treat. In older, community-dwelling persons who are functionally impaired, we recommend against screening for or treating ASB (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). In older persons resident in long-term care facilities, we recommend against screening for or treating ASB (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Urinary cell-free DNA is a versatile analyte for monitoring infections of the urinary tract [^114ozBvP]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

We quantified bacterial urinary cfDNA in 43 urine samples from 31 subjects who had a corresponding positive urine culture obtained on the same day (see Methods for definition). For 41 of the 43 positive urine specimens, a bacterial organism was reported to the species level by conventional culture. In 40 of these 41 samples, sequencing of urinary cfDNA detected the clinically reported organisms to the species level (Fig. 2b). For a single sample, urinary cfDNA did not match with the bacterial culture: Raoultella ornithinolytica was isolated in culture but not detected by cfDNA sequencing (see Methods for a detailed discussion of this discordant readout). For 2 of the 43 clinically positive samples, the suspected etiologic agent was identified to the genus level (Staphylococcus, reported as coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species [CoNS], and Streptococcus, reported as viridans group streptococci) by culture. In both these cases, the reported organism was detected as the most prevalent within the sample. From the 43 cultures, we examined 6 with polymicrobial bacterial infection (defined as 2 individual bacterial taxon detected at the genus or species level). For five out of six of these cases, we observed both species among the ten most abundant species by cfDNA sequencing. In one sample, the secondary bacterial agent, CoNS (< 10,000 colony-forming units [cfu]/mL), was not detected.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115cj212]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Catheter-associated bacteriuria — evidence with short-term indwelling catheters: Biofilm formation along the indwelling catheter means all patients ultimately develop bacteriuria if the catheter remains in situ, with acquisition of bacteriuria 3%–5% per catheter day; antimicrobial therapy may delay but not prevent onset. Many individuals with short-term catheters (in place for < 30 days) do not develop bacteriuria because the catheter is removed prior to acquisition. In newly catheterized patients, 235 of 1497 (14.9%) developed bacteriuria (defined as ≥ 10² CFU/mL) at a mean of 6.4 ± 6.1 days; only 194 (7.7%) reported subjective symptoms and only 1 episode of bacteremia was considered probably attributable to bacteriuria. In a prospective randomized trial comparing silver coated with uncoated silicone catheters, 3036 patients with catheters in situ for ≥ 48 hours were enrolled; there were 334 (11%) UTIs, 16 with bacteremia (0.5% of catheters; 4.8% of bacteriuric patients). In a retrospective cohort of 444 episodes in 308 patients, 128 (41.6%) had catheter-associated UTI and 180 (58.4%) had ASB; only 3 episodes of bacteremia (0.7% of bacteriuric subjects) were directly attributable to bacteriuria, and > 90% of patients received antimicrobials within 30 days of the urine culture.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for catheter-associated urinary tract infection, more specifically with respect to clinical history, IDSA 2010 guidelines recommend to do not use the presence or absence of odorous or cloudy urine alone in catheterized patients to differentiate CA-ASB from CA-UTI or as an indication for urine culture or antimicrobial therapy.

Patient-specific risk factors for resistant uropathogens — prior urine culture results: In patients with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis), we suggest avoiding antibiotics to which the patient has had a resistant pathogen isolated from the urine previously (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Remarks indicate that more recent urine cultures may be a better guide than more distant cultures and that the time frame for paired cultures varied, but the median was 3–6 months.

### A blinded observational cohort study of the microbiological ecology associated with pyuria and overactive bladder symptoms [^116kUu2b]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Most spun sediment cultures from patients and some from controls demonstrated polymicrobial growth. Whilst mixed-growth cultures historically have been blamed on contamination from poor sampling, this has been strongly challenged. Wolcott et al. suggested that coexistence of certain species of bacteria, resulting in polymicrobial cultures, may offer microbes a survival advantage. Our study did not address this hypothesis.

Urothelial clue-cell shedding has been described as an immune response to infection, with murine and human studies showing increased cell shedding in response to infection. This study found that the patient group showed increased proportions of urinary clue cells, which are urothelial cells manifesting adherent or intracellular microbes. The increased clue-cell proportions imply increased microbial colonisation of urothelial cells in OAB patients. This observation is in line with other reports.

In considering sources of error, the measurement of bacterial in spun urothelial cells deposits could have been affected by the sampling method. Bacteria from the lower genital tract could have contributed to this. However, the immediate refrigeration of urine and the processing of these samples within 1 h of collection reduced this risk. Whilst one could argue that the MSU sampling method could contribute to contamination, this would appear to be nominal given the low pyuria counts and urothelial cell counts in the control population.

We did not use a quantitative threshold to define significance in a spun sediment culture or apply the criterion of a single species. There are no data to guide such thresholds, so we report data without categorisation. There are quantitative differences in microbial isolates, but we are in no position to state what those mean. Analysis of urothelial and clue cells is novel, as is sediment culture, but these methods have been well validated and have a strong pathophysiological foundation. Fresh urine microscopy is not commonly adopted in clinical practice nowadays, nevertheless, it has been well validated in studies dating back to 1928 and is still unsurpassed as a surrogate marker of infection. DNA sequencing may be an alternative, although it still lacks quantitative specificity.

### FAQs: urinary tract infection (UTI) events | NHSN… [^115saG8A]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Mixed flora No, this urine culture is not eligible for use in an NHSN UTI determination. The medical definition of flora is a group of organisms. Any type of mixed flora makes a positive urine culture ineligible for use to meet NHSN UTI criteria, because "mixed flora" implies that at least 2 organisms are present in addition to the identified organism. The urine culture does not meet the criteria for a positive urine culture with 2 organisms or less and cannot be used to meet the NHSN UTI criteria. Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus species is as far as you can get for reporting purposes. The E. coli #1 and E. coli #2 is considered one organism, and then S. aureus would be considered the second organism. Antimicrobial susceptibility results and colony morphology difference do not equate to a report of separate organisms. This urine culture result is not > 2 organisms, and therefore, is an eligible specimen.

Multiple colony counts for the same organism Yes. When organisms found in urine are identified to the same genus and species level but there is an indication of different colony morphology or a different antibiogram, for purposes of NHSN UTI surveillance the organisms should be considered the same and if the sum total of the colony counts is ≥ 100, 000 CFU/ml the culture result is eligible for use in meeting a UTI definition. 40, 000–50, 000 CFU/ml Klebsiella oxytoca > 100, 000 CFU/ml Pseudomonas aeruginosa < 10, 000 CFU/ml Candida, not albicans No, the urine culture would be ineligible for use to meet NHSN UTI criteria, because there would be a total of three organisms present, including the candida. An excluded organism, such as candida, can be in a positive urine culture, however, there can only be one other organism present that has. Urine specimen source No.

Any urine specimen submitted for culture is eligible for review to see if that urine specimen meets NHSN UTI criteria.

### Urinalysis: a comprehensive review… [^111pL38E]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Persistent proteinuria is divided into three general categories: glomerular, tubular, and overflow. In glomerular proteinuria, the most common type, albumin is the primary urinary protein. Tubular proteinuria results when malfunctioning tubule cells no longer metabolize or reabsorb normally filtered protein. In this condition, low–molecular-weight proteins predominate over albumin and rarely exceed 2 g per day. In overflow proteinuria, low–molecular-weight proteins overwhelm the ability of the tubules to reabsorb filtered proteins. NITRITES Nitrites normally are not found in urine but result when bacteria reduce urinary nitrates to nitrites. Many gram-negative and some gram-positive organisms are capable of this conversion, and a positive dipstick nitrite test indicates that these organisms are present in significant numbers. This test is specific but not highly sensitive.

Thus, a positive result is helpful, but a negative result does not rule out UTI. Normal urine contains only small amounts of urobilinogen, the end product of conjugated bilirubin after it has passed through the bile ducts and been metabolized in the intestine. Urobilinogen is reabsorbed into the portal circulation, and a small amount eventually is filtered by the glomerulus. Hemolysis and hepatocellular disease can elevate urobilinogen levels, and antibiotic use and bile duct obstruction can decrease urobilinogen levels. Epithelial cells often are present in the urinary sediment. Squamous epithelial cells are large and irregularly shaped, with a small nucleus and fine granular cytoplasm; their presence suggests contamination. The presence of transitional epithelial cells is normal. These cells are smaller and rounder than squamous cells, and they have larger nuclei. The presence of renal tubule cells indicates significant renal pathology.

Gram staining can help guide antibiotic therapy, but it is not indicated in routine outpatient practice. Clean-catch specimens from female patients frequently are contaminated by vaginal flora. In these patients, five bacteria per HPF represents roughly 100, 000 colony-forming units per mL, the classic diagnostic criterion for asymptomatic bacteriuria and certainly compatible with a UTI. In symptomatic patients, a colony count as low as 100 CFU per mL suggests UTI, and antibiotics should be considered. The presence of bacteria in a properly collected male urine specimen is suggestive of infection, and a culture should be obtained.
