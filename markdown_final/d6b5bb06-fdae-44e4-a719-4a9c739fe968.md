## Question

For subclinical hypothyroidism with TSH 4.77 and T4 1.1, when should we recheck, and how should it be managed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to recheck thyroid labs and how to manage subclinical hypothyroidism in a patient with TSH about 4.77 mIU/L and a normal free T4 around 1.1 ng/dL. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the biochemical pattern and excluding assay or contextual confounders. Then, I should assess the risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism and how thyroid autoimmunity modifies that risk. Next, I will weigh indications for starting levothyroxine versus observation, integrating guideline differences and trial data. Finally, I need to define a monitoring plan and special considerations such as pregnancy, cardiovascular comorbidity, and patient‑reported symptoms, making sure to verify assumptions at each step.

> Let me first confirm the laboratory pattern. A TSH modestly above the assay upper limit of normal with a normal free T4 defines subclinical hypothyroidism, provided the reference intervals are method‑ and population‑appropriate and the pattern is persistent on repeat testing, which fits the reported TSH 4.77 mIU/L and free T4 1.1 ng/dL, but I should verify the lab's specific reference ranges and repeat the panel before labeling this as SCH [^1147cuNh] [^114Mf3dw].

> Wait, let me verify potential pitfalls before I commit to the diagnosis. Assay interference, nonthyroidal illness, and recent medication changes can artifactually shift TSH or free T4, so I need to check for factors like biotin, heterophile antibodies, acute illness, or drugs that alter the hypothalamic‑pituitary‑thyroid axis and, if anything is suspect, confirm on a repeat draw using the same or a different platform with attention to preanalytic conditions [^111sz82J] [^115MVPFW].

> I should confirm risk stratification next. The long‑term progression risk from SCH to overt hypothyroidism rises with higher baseline TSH and thyroid autoimmunity; in a 10‑year cohort, TSH 4–6 mIU/L carried essentially negligible progression compared with substantially higher risk above 6 and 12 mIU/L, and positive thyroid antibodies further increased progression, so with TSH 4.77 mIU/L the baseline 10‑year risk appears low unless anti‑TPO is positive, which I should check to refine risk [^113LCNsk] [^111yYVBa].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment. Guidelines generally converge on treating when TSH is 10 mIU/L or higher, while for TSH between the upper limit and 10 mIU/L, treatment is individualized based on symptoms, positive anti‑TPO, goiter, or cardiovascular disease and heart failure risk; however, high‑quality randomized evidence shows little to no benefit of levothyroxine on quality of life or thyroid‑related symptoms in most adults with SCH, so with TSH 4.77 mIU/L and normal free T4, observation is typically preferred unless compelling modifiers exist [^1147cuNh] [^114LBMH9].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought I should start a low‑dose trial because of the mild TSH elevation, but I should double‑check the evidence base; the BMJ guideline issues a strong recommendation against thyroid hormones for adults with SCH given no clinically meaningful benefit on symptoms or quality of life across 21 trials, which nudges me back toward careful monitoring rather than immediate therapy here, barring special circumstances such as pregnancy planning or marked symptomatology with positive anti‑TPO [^114LBMH9] [^1147cuNh].

> Next, I should review what to do now. I need to ensure this is persistent SCH by repeating TSH and free T4 in about 2–3 months, add anti‑TPO to refine progression risk, and review medications and comorbidities; given biologic and analytic variability in thyroid assays, the interval and assay choice can influence categorization over time, so confirming stability before acting is prudent [^1147cuNh] [^113AzMBq].

> I will now examine symptom context and comorbid risk. If the patient has significant hypothyroid‑compatible symptoms, a goiter, positive anti‑TPO, or established ASCVD or heart failure, that shifts the calculus modestly toward considering therapy despite the low TSH level, but I need to counsel that symptomatic benefit is uncertain and to avoid overtreatment risks such as atrial fibrillation and bone loss, especially in older adults where age‑specific TSH ranges and a tendency toward higher normative TSH argue for caution [^1147cuNh] [^113bqae9].

> Let me think about a management plan if we do not treat now. I would plan to recheck TSH and free T4 in approximately 3 months to confirm persistence, then, if stable and asymptomatic with negative antibodies, extend to 6–12 month intervals, adjusting frequency if symptoms evolve or TSH drifts upward; this cadence balances assay variability and the low short‑term risk at TSH below 6 mIU/L [^1147cuNh] [^113LCNsk].

> But wait, what if we decide to trial levothyroxine after shared decision‑making because of symptoms and positive antibodies. I should start a low dose tailored to weight and comorbidity, for example 25–50 μg daily in most adults without cardiac disease and lower in those with cardiac disease, and recheck TSH and free T4 in about 6–8 weeks to titrate toward a normal TSH, while emphasizing that discontinuation is reasonable if no symptomatic benefit is seen and labs normalize, given the neutral RCT data in SCH [^1147cuNh] [^114LBMH9].

> Hold on, I should verify special situations. If the patient is pregnant or trying to conceive, threshold and goals change, and many guidelines favor treatment at lower TSH cutoffs in the presence of positive thyroid antibodies; in that context I would follow pregnancy‑specific targets and closer monitoring rather than the general adult SCH approach laid out above [^114SqyRa] [^115hDrrB].

> I should double‑check that the laboratory context is stable over time. Between‑method differences and standardization gaps for TSH and free T4 can reclassify results across platforms, so I will aim to use the same assay where possible and interpret results against method‑specific reference intervals, keeping the lab informed if clinical context changes and confirming unexpected shifts with repeat testing [^114Mf3dw] [^113AzMBq].

> In summary, after verifying persistence and excluding assay or clinical confounders, a patient with TSH around 4.77 mIU/L and normal free T4 most often warrants observation, risk refinement with anti‑TPO, and periodic reassessment rather than immediate levothyroxine; therapy is reserved for rising TSH toward or above 10 mIU/L, symptomatic patients with positive antibodies or high cardiovascular risk after shared decision‑making, or pregnancy‑related indications, all while acknowledging the limited symptomatic benefit shown in trials and the need to avoid overtreatment [^1147cuNh] [^113LCNsk] [^114LBMH9].

For TSH 4.77 mIU/L with normal free T4, **confirm persistent subclinical hypothyroidism** by repeating TSH and free T4 in 6–8 weeks, and measure anti-TPO antibodies to assess risk of progression [^1147cuNh] [^111WRZXa] [^113LCNsk]. Do not start **levothyroxine** unless the patient is symptomatic; is pregnant or planning pregnancy; has positive anti-TPO antibodies; or has cardiovascular risk factors [^111yYVBa] [^1147cuNh]. If untreated, monitor TSH and free T4 every 6–12 months, and initiate treatment if TSH rises to ≥ 10 mIU/L, symptoms develop, or pregnancy is planned [^113AzMBq] [^1147cuNh] [^114LBMH9].

---

## Diagnostic confirmation and initial evaluation

- **Repeat testing**: Confirm persistent elevation by repeating TSH and free T4 in 6–8 weeks to exclude transient causes (illness, medications, assay variability) [^111Wrp1V] [^114Mf3dw].

- **Thyroid antibodies**: Measure anti-TPO antibodies to assess autoimmune risk and progression likelihood [^113LCNsk] [^111yYVBa].

- **Clinical assessment**: Evaluate for hypothyroid symptoms, cardiovascular risk factors, and pregnancy intentions [^1147cuNh].

---

## Indications for treatment

Levothyroxine is **not routinely indicated** at TSH 4.77 mIU/L with normal free T4; **consider treatment** if:

- **Symptoms**: Fatigue, weight gain, or other hypothyroid symptoms [^1147cuNh].

- **Pregnancy**: Current or planned pregnancy [^1147cuNh] [^115hDrrB].

- **Autoimmunity**: Positive anti-TPO antibodies [^113LCNsk].

- **Cardiovascular risk**: Existing cardiovascular disease or risk factors [^1147cuNh] [^111yYVBa].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

If untreated, monitor TSH and free T4 every 6–12 months, and **initiate treatment** if TSH reaches ≥ 10 mIU/L, symptoms develop, or pregnancy is planned [^113AzMBq] [^1147cuNh].

---

## Summary table: management of subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH 4.77 mIU/L, normal free T4)

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| Confirm diagnosis | Repeat TSH and free T4 in 6–8 weeks [^111Wrp1V] |
| Assess risk | Measure anti-TPO antibodies; evaluate symptoms and pregnancy plans [^113LCNsk] |
| Treatment indication | Treat if symptomatic, pregnant/planning pregnancy, positive anti-TPO, or cardiovascular risk factors [^1147cuNh] |
| Monitoring | If untreated, recheck TSH and free T4 every 6–12 months [^113AzMBq] |
| Initiate treatment | If TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L, symptoms develop, or pregnancy is planned [^1147cuNh] |

---

For TSH 4.77 mIU/L with normal free T4, confirm persistence and assess risk; **treat only if** symptoms, pregnancy, autoimmunity, or cardiovascular risk factors are present; otherwise, **monitor every 6–12 months** [^113LCNsk] [^1147cuNh] [^113AzMBq].

Regarding the medical management of hypothyroidism, particularly in relation to levothyroxine therapy (indications, abnormal TSH), the AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend considering treatment initiation based on individual factors. This is especially pertinent for patients with TSH levels between the upper limit of a given laboratory's reference range and 10 mIU/L. Initiation is advised if patients exhibit symptoms indicative of hypothyroidism, have positive anti-TPO antibodies, or show evidence of ASCVD or HF, or have associated risk factors for these conditions.

### Thyroid hormones treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism: A clinical practice guideline [^114LBMH9]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

What are the benefits and harms of thyroid hormones for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH)? This guideline was triggered by a recent systematic review of randomized controlled trials, which could alter practice.

- **Practice**: Guidelines tend to recommend thyroid hormones for adults with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels > 10 mIU/L and for people with lower TSH values who are young, symptomatic, or have specific indications for prescribing.

- **Recommendation**: The guideline panel issues a strong recommendation against thyroid hormones in adults with SCH (elevated TSH levels and normal free T4 (thyroxine) levels). It does not apply to women who are trying to become pregnant or patients with TSH > 20 mIU/L. It may not apply to patients with severe symptoms or young adults (such as those ≤ 30 years old).

- **How this guideline was created**: A guideline panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach.

- **The evidence**: The systematic review included 21 trials with 2192 participants. For adults with SCH, thyroid hormones consistently demonstrate no clinically relevant benefits for quality of life or thyroid-related symptoms, including depressive symptoms, fatigue, and body mass index (moderate to high-quality evidence). Thyroid hormones may have little or no effect on cardiovascular events or mortality (low-quality evidence), but harms were measured in only one trial with few events at two years' follow-up.

Subclinical hypothyroidism is a frequent syndrome affecting about 10 million people in the United States. The management of such patients is open to debate. In a long-term prospective study, we analyzed the spontaneous course and the value of predictive factors in the development of overt thyroid failure. We studied 82 female patients with subclinical hypothyroidism prospectively over a mean observation period of 9.2 years. TSH, thyroid hormones, thyroid reserve after TRH administration, thyroid antibodies, and clinical parameters were assessed at yearly intervals.

The cumulative incidence of overt hypothyroidism was calculated using life-table analysis and Kaplan-Meier curves. According to the initial serum TSH concentrations (TSH, 4–6/ > 6–12/ > 12 mU/liter), Kaplan-Meier estimates of the incidence of overt hypothyroidism were 0%, 42.8%, and 76.9%, respectively, after 10 years (P < 0.0001). When only patients with TSH levels greater than 6 mU/liter were analyzed, the cumulative incidence was 55.3%. The incidence of overt hypothyroidism increased in patients with impaired thyroid reserve (52.6% vs. 38.1%; P = 0.05) and positive microsomal antibodies (58.5% vs. 23.2%; P = 0.03).

This prospective long-term study demonstrates that only a part of the cohort of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism develops overt hypothyroidism over time, while a major group remains in the subclinical state after 10 years. The measurement of TSH, microsomal (thyroperoxidase) antibodies, and thyroid reserve allows initial risk stratification for the development of overt thyroid failure.

- **Recommendations**:
	- **Monitoring of L-T4 treatment**: This should be based on periodic measurements of serum or plasma FT4 (or TT4) and TSH concentrations. Blood samples for laboratory evaluation should be collected at least 4 hours after the last L-T4 administration. It is recommended to maintain TSH within the age-specific reference range, avoiding undetectable TSH levels below 0.05 mU/L, and keep serum concentrations of TT4 or FT4 in the upper half of the age-specific reference range. If necessary, the treatment should be adjusted according to the hormone concentrations measured, but decreases in L-T4 dose should not be based on a single high FT4 concentration during treatment. Clinicians should be familiar with the reference ranges utilized by the laboratory conducting the tests.

	- **Follow-up examination**: The first follow-up examination is recommended 1 to 2 weeks after the commencement of L-T4 treatment, with intense follow-up throughout the first year of life. This includes every 2 weeks until TSH levels are fully normalized, and every 1 to 3 months thereafter, until reaching the age of 12 months. Between the ages of 1 and 3 years, children should be subject to frequent clinical and laboratory evaluations (every 2 to 4 months), with regular evaluations every 3 to 12 months until growth is completed. Measurements should be more frequent if compliance is questioned or abnormal values are obtained, and 4 to 6 weeks after any change in L-T4 dose or L-T4 formulation (e.g. switch from brand to generic L-T4).

Regarding medical management for thyroid disease in pregnancy, specifically with respect to the management of postpartum thyroiditis, the RCOG 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining serial thyroid function testing every 6 weeks, along with symptom assessment. This approach confirms the diagnosis of postpartum thyroiditis in the presence of an abnormal thyroid function test and excludes other causes. It is advised to measure thyroid receptor antibodies and consider obtaining isotope scans to distinguish between Graves' disease and postpartum thyroiditis if thyroid function tests indicate thyrotoxicosis.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): An American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^114Mf3dw]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Over the past five decades, testing for TSH and the thyroid hormones (T4 and T3) has evolved from manual radioisotopic immunoassays performed in individual assay tubes to nonisotopic IMA tests made on highly automated immunoassay systems that provide substantial clinical utility. Analytes of interest can be quantified if appropriate reference measurement systems and certified standard materials are used. Within- and between-laboratory proficiency testing methods can provide insight into the performance of a particular method provided commutable samples are used. Unfortunately, these basic prerequisites are not yet implemented or regularly used.

Physicians and laboratorians must understand the limitations of thyroid hormone measurement to properly order and interpret thyroid tests. There is a need for a stronger laboratory–clinician interface. In most geographic areas, the laboratory receives a test request containing information relating to the patient identification that is missing clinical and pharmacological information and the circumstances prompting the test request. It can be critical for the laboratory to have this missing information given the various idiosyncratic analytical interferences that affect thyroid test reliability, as discussed in this review. For their part, the laboratory should educate physicians regarding test limitations and interferences.

Furthermore, given the persistence of between-method differences, the laboratory should notify physicians before changing methods and reference ranges. The strengths and limitations of the major thyroid tests demand careful consideration to ensure accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): An American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^114yH4KX]. Thyroid (2023). Low credibility.

Despite being the most performed laboratory endocrine investigation, the optimum use of thyroid tests, including thyrotropin (TSH) and thyroid hormone (TH) measurement, is open to question; the interpretation of the results from these tests can be ambiguous. The American Thyroid Association (ATA), with its expertise, supports the endeavor of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) to improve and maintain standardization and harmonization of thyroid testing. The ATA mandated an international interdisciplinary working group panel to survey the status of thyroid testing by reviewing recent literature to revise or update the criteria as needed in mutual agreement and to inform clinical care.

- **Summary**: This review represents the conclusions on the clinical use of routine TSH and TH (thyroxine [T4] and triiodothyronine [T3]) assays, taking into account geographic differences in disease prevalence and clinical and laboratory practice among writing members. The interaction between physiological, pathophysiological, and pharmacological factors and thyroid assays can affect their measurements and confound result interpretation. These factors need to be considered in the clinical context of the patient for appropriate test ordering and result interpretation. Despite significant advances in laboratory methods over the past 50 years, routine thyroid assays remain susceptible to idiosyncratic analytical interference that may produce spurious results. Improved standardization needs to be developed.

### What should be done when thyroid function tests do not make sense [^111sz82J]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Interpretation of thyroid function tests (TFTs) is generally straightforward. However, in a minority of contexts, the results of thyroid hormone and thyrotropin measurements either conflict with the clinical picture or form an unusual pattern. In many such cases, reassessment of the clinical context provides an explanation for the discrepant TFTs. In other instances, interference in one or more laboratory assays can account for divergent results. Uncommonly, genetic defects in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis are associated with anomalous TFTs.

Failure to recognize these potential 'pitfalls' can lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate management. Here, focusing particularly on the combination of hyperthyroxinaemia with nonsuppressed thyrotropin, we show how a structured approach to investigation can help make sense of atypical TFTs.

Regarding the medical management of hyperthyroidism, particularly concerning the management of subclinical hyperthyroidism, the ATA 2016 guidelines recommend treating subclinical hyperthyroidism when TSH is persistently < 0.1 mU/L in the following clinical settings:

- **Patients ≥ 65 years of age**: Treatment is advised for this age group.
- **Patients with cardiac risk factors, heart disease, or osteoporosis**: It is crucial to manage these patients due to the elevated risk.
- **Postmenopausal women not on estrogens or bisphosphonates**: These individuals require attention as they may face additional health challenges.
- **Patients with symptoms**: Symptomatic individuals warrant treatment to alleviate clinical manifestations.

- **Monitoring of dose and follow-up**: Serum or plasma FT4 (or TT4) and TSH concentrations should be determined at least 4 hours after the last L-T4 administration. TSH concentration should be maintained in the age-specific reference range; TT4 or FT4 concentration should be maintained in the upper half of the age-specific reference range. Any reduction of L-T4 dose should not be based on a single increase in FT4 concentration during treatment. The first follow-up examination should take place 1–2 weeks after the start of L-T4 treatment.

	- Subsequent evaluation should take place every 2 weeks until a complete normalization of TSH concentration is reached; then every 1 to 3 months thereafter until the age of 12 months. Between the ages of one and three years, children should undergo frequent clinical and laboratory evaluations (every 2 to 4 months). Thereafter, evaluations should be carried out every 3 to 12 months until growth is completed.

	- More frequent evaluations should be carried out if compliance is questioned or abnormal values are obtained. Additional evaluations should be carried out 4–6 weeks after any change in L-T4 dose or formulation. Adequate treatment throughout childhood is essential and overtreatment should be avoided.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): An American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^116uLLpr]. Thyroid (2023). Low credibility.

Serum TSH concentration is the single best biomarker to confirm a diagnosis and also to assess the magnitude of primary thyroid disease, due to the log-linear TSH–fT4 relationship. Although not necessary for diagnosing primary disease, T4 (and in specific constellations, T3) measurements are often added when TSH values fall outside the reference interval. This allows classification of thyroid disease into overt or subclinical categories and can guide therapeutic options accordingly (see "TSH and Thyroid Hormone Measurement: Clinical Algorithm" in Technical Supplementary Fig. S1).

TH measurement is also needed to complement TSH measurement in various clinical situations, such as pregnancy and inter-illness, where TSH can be suppressed (nonthyroidal illness syndrome). Additionally, during the initial treatment of hypo- or hyperthyroidism, the response of the pituitary-thyroid axis can be delayed following a change in thyroid status.

While the term "thyroid function test" is commonly used, it is only relevant to untreated patients. This term is widely applied to describe TSH and TH tests even though these determinations are often used to monitor hypothyroid patients on levo-T4 therapy who have no innate thyroid function, patients with hypothalamic or pituitary disease (secondary hypothyroidism), or patients taking medications that affect the pituitary-thyroid axis.

### Interpretation of thyroid function tests [^114Ub1fK]. Lancet (2001). Low credibility.

The introduction of sensitive thyrotropin assays and free thyroid hormone measurements has simplified the interpretation of thyroid function tests. However, important pitfalls and difficult cases still exist. In this review, thyroid function test results are grouped into six different patterns. We propose that if assays for thyrotropin, free T3, and free T4 are all done, knowledge of these patterns coupled with clinical details and simple additional tests allow a diagnosis to be made in almost all cases.

### Evaluation and follow-up of clinically euthyroid children with normal free T4 and suppressed TSH [^1156QMVU]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Although subnormal TSH levels between 0.1–0.4 mIU/L are fairly common and generally benign, suppression of TSH to < 0.1 mIU/L with normal free T4 is less common and more concerning. We conducted a retrospective chart review of such cases, summarizing their features and outcomes on follow-up.

- **Methods**: We studied 23 consecutive patients referred from 2005–2007 to our pediatric endocrine clinic. These patients presented with TSH levels < 0.1 mIU/L and free T4 within the range of 0.8–2 ng/dl. We collected historical, clinical, and laboratory data and analyzed the outcomes.

- **Results**: The natural evolution of these subjects was categorized into four groups:
	- **Group 1**: Fourteen subjects (61%) became euthyroid within a mean of 3.7 months.
	- **Group 2**: Four subjects (17%) became hypothyroid within a mean of 2.8 months.
	- **Group 3**: Two subjects (9%) progressed to overt hyperthyroidism.
	- **Group 4**: Three subjects (13%) had persistently suppressed TSH 8–14 months after initial testing. Among them, one had a multinodular goiter leading to a thyroidectomy. Elevated thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO) was observed in 54.5% of those tested.

- **Conclusion**: Only 2 of the 23 subjects in our series became overtly hyperthyroid. A substantial number of subjects experienced a brief period of transient TSH suppression that resolved spontaneously. Markers indicative of autoimmune thyroid disease were consistently observed in group 2 and less frequently in others. It is prudent to monitor such cases in the short term with serial follow-up of TSH, free T4, and T3 levels. Further testing and treatment should be reserved for those who become symptomatic or do not resolve.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for central hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to thyroid function tests, the ES 2016 guidelines recommend measuring serum free T4 and TSH for the evaluation of CeH. Consider confirming CeH in cases where the free T4 level is below the laboratory reference range, along with a low, normal, or mildly elevated TSH in the context of pituitary disease.

### Is annual surveillance of all treated hypothyroid patients necessary [^113sHxbB]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

- **Thyroxine dose changes**: The mean thyroxine dose at the time of registration was 131.2 (SD 42.4) μg per day (range 25–300), with around 80% of patients on 100–150 μg per day. At the final review, the mean thyroxine dose was 127.4 (SD 35.5) μg (median 125, range 25–300). During follow-up, 35.4% of patients had no change in their thyroxine dose, while 31% and 21% required a dose alteration of 25 μg and 50 μg respectively. Patients taking 100–150 μg at registration experienced fewer dose changes compared to others (40.5% vs 14.7%).

- **Thyroid function tests**: About 77% of patients had a normal test at the last follow-up. Older patients (age > 60 years) at registration were more likely to have an abnormal test during follow-up (odds ratio 1.36, 95% CI 1.07–1.73, P < 0.01). The group with an 18-month screening interval was less likely to have an abnormal test compared to the 12-month group (odds ratio 0.66, 95% CI 0.53–0.81, P < 0.01). There was no interaction between subgroup variables and the screening interval. Additionally, there was no difference in mortality between the groups.

### Risk factors for thyroid function test abnormalities during pregnancy: A systematic review of the literature to validate current risk factors and identify novel ones [^117HEJmo]. Thyroid (2025). Low credibility.

International guidelines recommend that the indication to perform thyroid function testing during pregnancy be based on the presence of risk factors for thyroid function test abnormalities. However, the discriminative ability of currently recommended risk factors is questionable.

To inform an update of the American Thyroid Association Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Thyroid Disease in Preconception, Pregnancy, and the Postpartum, we aimed to systematically review the literature to evaluate evidence for risk factors and potential novel ones for thyroid function test abnormalities in pregnancy.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature search was performed on Embase, Medline Ovid, and the Cochrane Library from inception to October 17, 2024, to identify articles on the associations of any candidate variables with thyroid function test abnormalities, thyroid antibody positivity, or results of continuous thyroid function tests in pregnancy.

### Is annual surveillance of all treated hypothyroid patients necessary [^116uCvh4]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Treated hypothyroid patients require regular clinical and biochemical surveillance. Although annual surveillance is currently recommended, there is no evidence to support this practice. Our study has shown that surveillance every 18 months may be adequate in the long-term follow-up of patients under 60 years of age on a stable thyroxine dose of 100–150 μg/day. Implementing this strategy has the potential for cost savings and a reduction in workload within health services.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists medical guidelines for clinical practice for the evaluation and treatment of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism [^113pqc6f]. Endocrine Practice (2002). Low credibility.

These clinical practice guidelines summarize the recommendations of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for the diagnostic evaluation of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and for treatment strategies in patients with these disorders. The sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) assay has become the single best screening test for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. In most outpatient clinical situations, the serum TSH is the most sensitive test for detecting mild thyroid hormone excess or deficiency.

Therapeutic options for patients with Graves' disease include thyroidectomy (rarely used now in the United States), antithyroid drugs (frequently associated with relapses), and radioactive iodine (currently the treatment of choice). In clinical hypothyroidism, the standard treatment is levothyroxine replacement, which must be tailored to the individual patient. Awareness of subclinical thyroid disease, which often remains undiagnosed, is emphasized, as is a system of care that incorporates regular follow-up surveillance by one physician as well as education and involvement of the patient.

### Is annual surveillance of all treated hypothyroid patients necessary [^115t2BvC]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Annual surveillance, incorporating thyroid function testing, is widely recommended for the long-term follow-up of treated hypothyroid patients. This recommendation is largely based on consensus opinion, with limited evidence supporting the frequency of monitoring. In our hospital's thyroid register, the majority of patients are on an 18-month follow-up schedule.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective analysis to evaluate whether more frequent testing is supported by evidence. A logistic regression model was employed to determine if baseline characteristics could predict abnormal test outcomes.

- **Results**: Our study involved 2,125 patients with at least 10 years of follow-up (89% female, 65% with autoimmune hypothyroidism, and a mean age at registration of 51 years). Two groups were identified: 1,182 patients (56%) were on an 18-month follow-up schedule, while the rest received annual surveillance. The groups were well matched at baseline. Throughout the follow-up, the annual surveillance group exhibited more abnormal tests necessitating dose adjustments. However, logistic regression analysis revealed that patients younger than 60 years, those taking less than 150 μg of thyroxine per day, and individuals on an 18-month follow-up schedule had fewer abnormal tests.

- **Conclusion**: An 18-month surveillance interval may be sufficient for the long-term follow-up of hypothyroid patients under 60 years of age who are on a stable thyroxine dose of 100–150 μg per day and have robust follow-up mechanisms in place. Implementing this strategy has the potential to yield cost savings.

### TSH and FT4 reference interval recommendations and prevalence of gestational thyroid dysfunction: Quantification of current diagnostic approaches [^112ZQpu1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

In this individual participant data meta-analysis, we aimed to quantify the performance of commonly used alternative diagnostic approaches to laboratory-specific and trimester-specific reference intervals. These alternatives include:

- **Use of a fixed upper limit for TSH**: Employing a threshold independent of trimester-specific variations.
- **Employing a modified upper limit of TSH**: Subtracting from the nonpregnant upper limit of TSH.
- **Utilizing unadjusted nonpregnancy reference intervals for TSH and FT4**: Used as a historical benchmark.

We focused on discerning the impact of these alternatives on clinically consequential decisions such as indications or considerations for treatment as per prevailing international guidelines.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): An American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^111WRZXa]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Thyroid function tests, like most laboratory results, are susceptible to inaccurate measurement. Laboratory measurements can be affected by two different types of analytical error: (1) systematic error (also known as analytical bias) and (2) random error (also known as analytical imprecision). The so-called total error of measurement is a combination of these two parameters. Analytical errors can contribute to erroneous laboratory results, which, in turn, can lead to inappropriate disease classification and clinical decision-making. To prevent inaccurate measurements affecting clinical decision-making, analytical performance specifications (APSs) have been established to safeguard assay performance.

APS can be used to optimize clinical utility in multiple aspects of laboratory testing, including the regulatory process for the approval of laboratory tests, proficiency testing of the individual laboratory, evaluation of laboratory methods, and monitoring the variability of lot-to-lot reagent changes. APS can be based on (1) clinical outcome studies and the impact on clinical decision-making (Models 1a and 1b, respectively); (2) biological variation (Model 2); or (3) state-of-the-art laboratory performance (Model 3). Of these, biological variation and state-of-the-art models are the mainstay of defining APS, as there are only limited studies that have examined the effects of APS on clinical outcomes or medical decisions.

Using biological variation data, the APS can be defined as minimum, desirable, and optimum for different contexts.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: Cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^117Kumyp]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism has multiple etiologies and manifestations. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions. This paper describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the clinical management of hypothyroidism in ambulatory patients.

- **Methods**: The development of these guidelines was commissioned by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) in association with the American Thyroid Association (ATA). AACE and ATA assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this article. The authors examined relevant literature and took an evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated their knowledge and experience to develop a series of specific recommendations and the rationale for these recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting each were rated according to the approach outlined in the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Protocol for Standardized Production of Clinical Guidelines-2010 update.

- **Results**: Topics addressed include the etiology, epidemiology, clinical and laboratory evaluation, management, and consequences of hypothyroidism. Screening, treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism, pregnancy, and areas for future research are also covered.

- **Conclusions**: Fifty-two evidence-based recommendations and subrecommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with hypothyroidism and to share what the authors believe is current, rational, and optimal medical practice for the diagnosis and care of hypothyroidism.

### 2018 European Thyroid Association (ETA) guidelines on the diagnosis and management of central hypothyroidism [^112HV1n7]. European Thyroid Journal (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for central hypothyroidism, specifically in relation to thyroid function tests, the ETA 2018 guidelines recommend confirming the diagnosis of CeH through the combined findings of serum free T4 concentrations below the lower limit of normal (LLN) and inappropriately low or normal TSH concentrations on at least two separate determinations, after excluding other conditions, including:

- **Non-thyroidal illness**

- **Isolated maternal hypothyroxinemia**: This should be interpreted in the context of trimester-specific free T4 reference ranges for pregnant patients.

- **Levothyroxine withdrawal syndrome**

- **Recovery from thyrotoxicosis**

- **Technical assay problems or interference, or defects in TBG**: These issues arise in the case of total T4 determination or calculation of free T4 index.

- **Drugs reducing TSH secretion**: Includes corticosteroids, dopamine, cocaine, anticonvulsants or antipsychotics, and metformin.

- **Premature birth**: A condition characterized by a delayed TSH rise in hypothyroid infants.

- **Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome**: Associated with MCT8 mutations.

- **THRA mutations**: Also known as RTHα.

- **TSHβ mutations**: Characterized by conserved bioactivity but lost immunoreactivity of circulating TSH.

### Follow-up of differentiated thyroid cancer - what should (and what should not) be done [^117QEP2H]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

The treatment paradigm for thyroid cancer has shifted from a one-size-fits-all approach to more personalized protocols that range from active surveillance to total thyroidectomy followed by radioiodine remnant ablation. Accurate surveillance tools are available, but follow-up protocols vary widely between centers and clinicians due to the lack of clear, straightforward recommendations on the instruments and assessment schedule that healthcare professionals should adopt.

For most patients — those who have had an excellent response to the initial treatment and have a low or intermediate risk of tumor recurrence — an infrequent assessment schedule is sufficient, such as a yearly determination of serum levels of TSH and thyroglobulin. Select patients will benefit from second-line imaging and more frequent assessments. This review discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the surveillance tools and follow-up strategies that clinicians use, considering the initial treatment and each patient's risk of recurrence.

### Time for a reassessment of the treatment of hypothyroidism [^113nGTgj]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Both the non-specific nature of complaints and inherent deficiencies in the diagnostic process raise an unsettling dilemma for patients and thyroid specialists alike. These issues are particularly pertinent to an etiological disease entity with similar outcomes: primary hypothyroidism due to total thyroidectomy in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer. Treatment requirements and dosing of the drug LT4 changed when guidelines relaxed the need for TSH-suppressive treatment targets for these patients. The reason for this shift was not primarily motivated by any improvement in the replacement strategy, but by a revision of the long-held tenet that TSH may act as a thyroid growth-stimulating hormone. Even when present at a low level in the circulation, it was believed to potentially stimulate the growth of remaining tumor cells and thereby promote the relapse of thyroid cancer in the long term. This view has recently been revised, and TSH suppression is now deemed unnecessary for many thyroid cancer patients.

However, this remarkable strategy change has presented a unique opportunity to study the implications for patient complaints resulting from the decision to abandon TSH-suppressive LT4 treatment in low-risk thyroid cancer. Although a prospective study could not be conducted, careful retrospective analysis revealed some interesting trends. Over the years when replacement therapy aimed at complete TSH suppression, a relatively low rate of persistent hypothyroid complaints was reported by patients.

### Standardization of free thyroxine and harmonization of thyrotropin measurements: A request for input from endocrinologists and other physicians [^1153v7mV]. Thyroid (2015). Low credibility.

For free thyroxine (fT4), the variability is substantial. Standardization may change results significantly — potentially by as much as 80% at the upper limit of the normal range for some assays. For thyrotropin (TSH), the alterations introduced by harmonization will be milder, approximately 20%. The committee, comprising laboratory professionals and manufacturers, has received a positive response for this approach from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), albeit with the caveat to investigate the risks associated with changes in the numerical results for some assays.

To this end, we are reaching out to stakeholders to seek views on the benefits and risks arising from fT4 standardization and TSH harmonization.

- **Benefits**: We wish to learn about the benefits you think would be achieved if all fT4 and TSH assays gave comparable results on patient samples.

- **Risks**: We wish to learn about the risks to patient safety and clinical outcomes that you think may arise as a consequence of a change in the numerical results for patients with thyroid disorders who are being followed, despite appropriate adjustments of the reference intervals. Particular attention should be paid to the question of whether standardization for uncomplicated hypo- and hyperthyroidism may detract from assay differences for important clinical populations such as those with nonthyroidal illness, elderly, and pregnant individuals.

- **Implementation**: We wish to hear your views on how clinical laboratories can minimize the identified risks from fT4 standardization and TSH harmonization.

- **Criteria for diagnosis**:

	- **Biochemical criteria for use in the decision to initiate treatment in an infant with high TSH and/or low FT4 concentration**.

		**Recommendations**:

		We recommend starting treatment immediately after baseline serum TSH and FT4 determination if DBS TSH concentration is ≥ 40 mU/L of whole blood. If DBS TSH concentration is 20 mU/L, even if serum FT4 concentration is normal.

		When venous TSH concentration is between 6 and 20 mU/L in a well baby with an FT4 concentration within the normal limits for age, we suggest diagnostic imaging to try to establish a definitive diagnosis. If TSH concentration remains high for more than 3 to 4 weeks, we suggest (in discussion with the family) either starting L-T4 supplementation immediately and retesting, off treatment, at a later stage; or retesting 2 weeks later without treatment.

		L-T4 treatment must be started immediately if venous FT4 or TT4 levels are low, given the known adverse effect of untreated decompensated CH on somatic growth and neurodevelopment. Previous work has shown that the likelihood of decompensated hypothyroidism is high if DBS TSH values are above 40 mU/L, justifying immediate treatment.

### Is annual surveillance of all treated hypothyroid patients necessary [^1179RhqF]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

During follow-up, thyroid function tests were undertaken at each review appointment, and 18-monthly follow-up was not associated with an increase in adverse outcomes. On the other hand, patients on annual surveillance were more likely to have an abnormal test. Both groups were well-matched at baseline in relation to age, sex distribution, thyroxine dose, and duration of follow-up. We cannot readily account for the difference in outcomes. One possible explanation could be physician bias at the time of registration. There were no set guidelines or criteria, and it is possible that there was physician bias when allocating individuals to annual screening, taking into account factors such as compliance. It is also likely that more frequent testing will find more abnormal results.

Another conclusion that can be drawn is that annual surveillance should be recommended as there was an increased chance of detecting an abnormal result. This approach may, however, lead to unnecessary tests in some individuals, as thyroxine dose remained unchanged in 35% of patients during long-term follow-up. On the other hand, although 18-monthly surveillance cannot be applied universally, it may be an option for individuals whose thyroxine requirement is less likely to change or who have fewer abnormal tests during follow-up. We undertook further subgroup analysis to identify individuals who may be suitable for less frequent testing.

Patients aged over 60 years at the time of registration were more likely to have an abnormal test during follow-up. This may be due to decreased thyroxine requirements.

### Thyroid and aging [^113bqae9]. Endocrine Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Review of physiologic thyroid function changes with aging highlights the importance of careful interpretation of thyroid tests in the aging population.

- **Methods**: Literature review.

- **Results**: Utilizing age-specific thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) reference ranges can help minimize or avoid unnecessary diagnoses of thyroid disease in elderly patients. Subclinical thyroid dysfunction and abnormal TSH with normal thyroid levels may improve over time; hence, careful monitoring of thyroid function is recommended. Overt thyroid disease should always be treated.

- **Conclusion**: Clinical judgment is crucial in determining how and when to treat subclinical thyroid disease in the elderly.

### Is annual surveillance of all treated hypothyroid patients necessary [^111bXEZT]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Annual surveillance, which includes thyroid function testing, is widely recommended for the long-term follow-up of treated hypothyroid patients. This recommendation is based largely on consensus opinion, with limited evidence supporting the monitoring frequency. Most patients in our hospital-based thyroid register undergo follow-up every 18 months.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective analysis to determine if more frequent testing is warranted. A logistic regression model was used to assess whether baseline characteristics could predict an abnormal test.

- **Results**: We identified 2,125 patients with at least 10 years of follow-up (89% were female, 65% had autoimmune hypothyroidism, and the mean age at registration was 51 years). There were two groups: 1,182 patients (56%) had 18-month follow-up intervals, and the rest had annual surveillance. The groups were well matched at baseline. Overall, during follow-up, the group with 12-month intervals had more abnormal tests requiring dose adjustment. However, logistic regression analysis showed that individuals under 60 years of age, those taking less than 150 µg of thyroxine daily, and those on 18-month follow-up had fewer abnormal tests.

- **Conclusion**: An 18-month surveillance interval may be sufficient for long-term follow-up of hypothyroid patients under 60 years of age who are on a stable thyroxine dose of 100–150 µg/day, especially when robust follow-up mechanisms are in place. Implementing this strategy could result in potential cost savings.

- **Comparability and quality assessment of fT4 and TSH assays**: The results of hormone assays must be reliable given the high clinical impact on diagnosis, therapy, and monitoring of patients' health and disease. Thus, a guarantee of their specificity, accuracy, and precision requires external reference points, standardized and certified reference materials, and regular documented proficiency testing. Compliance of the methods used in each laboratory with the International Guideline ISO 17511:2020 on harmonization should be sought, as this will guarantee that the result for the patient samples is traceable to the SI units or the highest available standards.

- **Comparability of results: The need for standardization/harmonization**: Thyroid hormone laboratory results ideally should be comparable over time, location, and independent of the method used. In 2017, the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine's Committee of Standardization of Thyroid Function Tests (IFCC C-STFT) documented the status of comparability of results for both fT4 and TSH assays from 13 of 15 assay manufacturers. Depending on the selected assay reagents and equipment, laboratory results may differ by up to 50% for both fT4 and TSH. If method-specific reference intervals are not employed, the classification of a numerical test result may be different depending on the assay used.

### Five-year follow-up for women with subclinical hypothyroidism in pregnancy [^111MJJFW]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Increasing numbers of clinicians and hospitals are testing thyroid function in pregnancy to detect and treat mild thyroid dysfunction. The use of trimester-specific reference ranges in routine clinical practice results in milder forms of thyroid dysfunction, such as subclinical hypothyroidism and isolated maternal hypothyroxinemia, being diagnosed in as many as 15% of pregnant women.

Mild thyroid dysfunction has been associated with impaired neuropsychological development of the offspring and adverse obstetric outcomes, including miscarriage, premature birth, gestational hypertension, and neonatal death. There is a general consensus that subclinical hypothyroidism detected during pregnancy should be treated with thyroxine, particularly in the presence of thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO-Abs). The recent guidelines from The Endocrine Society recommend thyroxine replacement for all pregnant women with subclinical hypothyroidism; the American Thyroid Association guidelines also recommend thyroxine for pregnant women with subclinical hypothyroidism and positive TPO-Abs results. Furthermore, contrary to the American Thyroid Association guidelines, a recent survey has shown that 40% of European endocrinologists also treat maternal hypothyroxinemia with thyroxine.

There are no data to indicate whether the treatment for these conditions should be limited to the duration of pregnancy or continued long-term, and no advice is provided in the guidelines. Physiological changes during pregnancy, such as increased renal excretion of thyroxine and transfer of thyroxine to the fetus, complicate this determination.

### Congenital hypothyroidism: A 2020–2021 consensus guidelines update — An ENDO-European reference network initiative endorsed by the European Society for Pediatric Endocrinology and the European Society for Endocrinology [^112u3Tis]. Thyroid (2021). High credibility.

When no definitive diagnosis of permanent congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is made in the first weeks or months of life, re-evaluation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis after the age of 2 to 3 years is indicated, especially in children with a goiter, and in those with presumed isolated central CH. For a precise diagnosis, levothyroxine (LT4) treatment should be phased out over a 4 to 6 week period or stopped, followed by a full re-evaluation after 4 weeks. This should include at least free thyroxine (fT4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement.

- **Sentence case**: If primary hypothyroidism is confirmed (TSH ≥ 10 mU/L), consider thyroid imaging and, if possible, genetic testing; if central CH is likely (fT4 below the lower limit of the reference interval with a low normal or only mildly elevated TSH), consider evaluating the other anterior pituitary functions and genetic testing. If TSH is above the upper limit of the reference interval but < 10 mU/L (primary CH) or fT4 just above the lower limit of the reference interval (central CH), then continue withdrawal and retest in another 3 to 4 weeks.

- **Sentence case**: If a child with no permanent CH diagnosis and a goiter requires an LT4 dose < 3 μg/kg per day at the age of 6 months, then re-evaluation can be done already at that time. We recommend avoiding iodine as an antiseptic during the peri-neonatal period, as it can cause transient CH.

### European society for paediatric endocrinology consensus guidelines on screening, diagnosis, and management of congenital hypothyroidism [^115KDSiz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

- **Recommendations**:
	3.3.6 If a precise diagnosis is sought, L-T 4 should be phased out over a 4 to 6-week period (depending on the size of the maintenance dose) and a full re-evaluation carried out at the end of this period, with biochemical testing and thyroid imaging if hypothyroidism is confirmed (2|⊕○○).

	3.3.7 If the clinician wishes to establish the presence or absence of primary hypothyroidism rather than to obtain an exact diagnosis, the L-T 4 dose may be decreased by 30% for 2 to 3 weeks. If an increase in TSH concentration to ≥ 10 mU/L is observed during this period, then continuing hypothyroidism can be assumed. By contrast, if thyroid function remains normal, the dose may be reduced further, followed by retesting (2|⊕⊕○).

- **Evidence for recommendations 3.3.6–3.3.7**:
	- By the age of 2 to 3 years, the severity of thyroid impairment may be evident from a lower dose requirement or, if compliance has been imperfect, high TSH levels despite treatment.

- **Treatment and monitoring in pregnant women with CH**:
	**Recommendations**:

	3.4.1 For women with CH who are planning a pregnancy, even greater efforts should be made to ensure that maternal thyroid hormones are optimal. In newly pregnant patients, we recommend an immediate increase in the L-T 4 dose by 25 to 30% following a missed menstrual cycle or positive home pregnancy test (1|⊕○○).

	3.4.2 TSH and FT4 (or TT 4) levels should be evaluated as soon as pregnancy is confirmed, every 4 to 6 weeks during the pregnancy, and 4 weeks after every change in dose (1|⊕⊕⊕).

	3.4.3 The goal of the treatment is to maintain TSH concentration below 2.5 mU/L in the first trimester.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): An American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^111Wrp1V]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Serum TSH is one of the most frequently measured analytes in the outpatient setting. Thyroid disease is common and can, in most cases, be easily diagnosed using TSH measurement. The availability of high-quality, sensitive, specific, and inexpensive TSH assays makes screening for thyroid disease cost-effective. Because of the log-linear relationship of TSH to fT4, deviations of TSH concentration from population-specific reference intervals represent the preferred initial test for the evaluation of thyroid function.

Understanding the indications for and limitations of TSH measurement, along with the interpretation of TSH results, is essential for the practice of high-quality, cost-effective medicine. TSH is used to screen newborns for primary congenital hypothyroidism and to screen adults at risk for thyroid disease. Primary congenital hypothyroidism is an endocrine emergency because delays in initiating treatment result in an irreversible loss of cognitive function. Accordingly, turn-around time from specimen collection to patient follow-up represents a major consideration in the implementation and quality assessment of newborn screening programs.

Interpreting the results for these apparently similar indications for TSH measurement is, however, very different. Patient age presents an important factor that must be considered when interpreting TSH results. For example, TSH concentrations in newborns less than 3 days of age are difficult to interpret due to the postnatal TSH surge.

### TSH and FT4 reference interval recommendations and prevalence of gestational thyroid dysfunction: Quantification of current diagnostic approaches [^113gSBLf]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend the use of population- and trimester-specific thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) reference intervals (RIs) during pregnancy. Since these are often unavailable, clinicians frequently rely on alternative diagnostic strategies. We sought to quantify the diagnostic consequences of these recommendations.

- **Methods**: We included cohorts participating in the Consortium on Thyroid and Pregnancy. Different approaches were used to define RIs: a TSH fixed upper limit of 4.0 mU/L (fixed limit approach), a fixed subtraction from the upper limit for TSH of 0.5 mU/L (subtraction approach), and using nonpregnancy RIs. Outcome measures were sensitivity and false discovery rate (FDR) of women for whom levothyroxine treatment was indicated and those for whom treatment would be considered according to international guidelines.

- **Results**: The study population comprised 52,496 participants from 18 cohorts. Compared with the use of trimester-specific RIs, alternative approaches had low sensitivity (0.63–0.82) and high FDR (0.11–0.35) to detect women with a treatment indication or consideration. Sensitivity and FDR to detect a treatment indication in the first trimester were similar between the fixed limit, subtraction, and nonpregnancy approach (0.77–0.11 vs. 0.74–0.16 vs. 0.60–0.11). The diagnostic performance in detecting overt hypothyroidism, isolated hypothyroxinemia, and (sub)clinical hyperthyroidism mainly varied with the FT4 RI approaches, while the diagnostic performance to detect subclinical hypothyroidism varied between the applied TSH RI approaches.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology position statement on thyroid dysfunction case finding [^113SKFsA]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can be readily diagnosed and treated in a safe, cost-effective manner. Professional organizations have provided guidance on how and when to employ thyroid-stimulating hormone testing for the detection of thyroid dysfunction. Most recently, the United States Preventive Services Task Force did not endorse screening for thyroid dysfunction due to a lack of proven benefit and potential harm from treating individuals with thyroid dysfunction, which is often subclinical disease. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) is concerned that this may discourage physicians from testing for thyroid dysfunction when clinically appropriate. Given the lack of specificity of thyroid-associated symptoms, the appropriate diagnosis of thyroid disease requires biochemical confirmation.

The Thyroid Scientific Committee of the AACE has produced this White Paper to highlight the important difference between screening and case-based testing in clinical medicine. We recommend that thyroid dysfunction should be frequently considered as a potential etiology for many of the nonspecific complaints that physicians encounter daily. The application and success of safe and effective interventions are dependent on an accurate diagnosis. Therefore, we advocate for an aggressive case-finding approach, based on identifying those persons most likely to have thyroid disease who will benefit from its treatment.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: Scientific review and guidelines for diagnosis and management [^111yYVBa]. JAMA (2004). Low credibility.

Patients with serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels outside the reference range, but with levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and triiodothyronine (T3) within the reference range, are commonly observed in clinical practice. The necessity for further evaluation, possible treatment, and the urgency of treatment have not been clearly established.

- **Objectives**: To define subclinical thyroid disease, review its epidemiology, recommend an appropriate evaluation, explore the risks and benefits of treatment and consequences of nontreatment, and determine whether population-based screening is warranted.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biosis, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, National Guideline Clearinghouse, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Controlled Trials Register, and several National Health Services (UK) databases were searched for articles on subclinical thyroid disease published between 1995 and 2002. Articles published before 1995 were recommended by expert consultants.

- **Study selection and data extraction**: A total of 195 English-language or translated papers were reviewed. Editorials, individual case studies, studies enrolling fewer than 10 patients, and nonsystematic reviews were excluded. Information related to authorship, year of publication, number of subjects, study design, and results was extracted and formed the basis for an evidence report, consisting of tables and summaries of each subject area.

- **Data synthesis**: The strength of the evidence that untreated subclinical thyroid disease is associated with clinical symptoms and adverse clinical outcomes was assessed.

### Long- versus short-interval follow-up of cytologically benign thyroid nodules: A prospective cohort study [^113PBzYZ]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

For the purpose of this study, we took advantage of the known variability in patient compliance with the above recommendation, specifically acknowledging that some patients return for repeat assessment in less than 1 year, while others were reassessed after much longer periods. We therefore identified all patients with cytologically benign thyroid nodules who pursued repeat sonographic evaluation at some point following the diagnosis of a cytologically benign thyroid nodule, regardless of the time interval. Each patient was analyzed as a single subject with a follow-up interval defined as the time between the first benign aspiration and their first repeat sonographic evaluation, regardless of whether subsequent ultrasounds were performed thereafter. This is because management decisions made at subsequent follow-up visits are likely influenced by previous visits, while our goal was to investigate the clinical outcomes as a function of various time intervals through the first follow-up visit. Patients whose first follow-up was less than 6 months after the initial benign aspiration were excluded, as such scenarios were deemed unique and likely influenced by separate factors.

Nodule measurements were documented at baseline and at the follow-up visit. Other follow-up variables were also collected, including whether a repeat fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or thyroidectomy was performed. We used our Electronic Medical Record system to identify whether each patient was presently living or deceased (and if so, the cause of death) to determine if the detection of a malignancy at a delayed follow-up period was associated with increased risk.

### Rationalizing thyroid function testing: Which TSH cutoffs are optimal for testing free T4 [^113KVT47]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Thyroid function testing often uses thyrotropin (TSH) measurement first, followed by reflex testing for free thyroxine (T4) if TSH is outside the reference range. The utility of different TSH cutoffs for reflex testing is unknown.

- **Objective**: To examine different TSH cutoffs for reflex free T4 testing.

- **Design, setting, and patients**: We analyzed TSH and free T4 results from 120,403 individuals from a single laboratory in Western Australia (clinical cohort) and 4568 Busselton Health Study participants (community cohort).

- **Results**: In the clinical cohort, restricting free T4 measurement to individuals with TSH > 5.0 mU/L resulted in a 22% reduction in free T4 testing compared to a TSH reference range of 0.4 to 4.0 mU/L; using TSH cutoffs of 0.2 and 6.0 mU/L resulted in a 34% reduction in free T4 testing. In the community cohort, the corresponding effect was less: a 3.3% and 4.8% reduction in free T4 testing. In the clinical cohort, using TSH cutoffs of 0.2 and 6.0 mU/L, elevated free T4 would go undetected in 4.2% of individuals with TSH levels of 0.2 to 0.4 mU/L. In most, free T4 was marginally elevated and unlikely to indicate clinically relevant hyperthyroidism. Low free T4 would go undetected in 2.5% of individuals with TSH levels of 4 to 6 mU/L; in 94%, free T4 was marginally reduced and unlikely to indicate clinically relevant hypothyroidism.

- **Conclusions**: Setting TSH cutoffs at 0.1 to 0.2 mU/L less than and 1 to 2 mU/L greater than the reference range for reflex testing of free T4 would reduce the need for free T4 testing with minimal effect.

### Congenital hypothyroidism: A 2020–2021 consensus guidelines update-an ENDO-European reference network initiative endorsed by the European Society for Pediatric Endocrinology and the European Society for Endocrinology [^117UgidG]. Thyroid (2021). Low credibility.

- **Monitoring treatment in primary CH**: We recommend the measurement of serum fT4 and TSH concentrations before or at least four hours after the last (daily) LT4 administration. We advocate evaluating fT4 and TSH according to age-specific reference intervals. The first treatment goal for neonates with primary CH is to rapidly increase the circulating amount of TH, as reflected by the normalization of serum TSH. Thereafter, TSH should be kept within the reference interval.

	- If TSH is within the age-specific reference interval, fT4 concentrations above the upper limit of the reference interval can be accepted, and the same LT4 dose should be maintained. Any reduction in the LT4 dose should not be based on a single higher-than-normal fT4 concentration unless TSH is suppressed (i.e. below the lower limit of the reference interval) or there are signs of overtreatment, such as jitteriness or tachycardia.

	- The first clinical and biochemical follow-up evaluation should occur one to two weeks after starting LT4 treatment, with a maximum of one week in the case of an initial dose of 50 μg per day or higher. Subsequent clinical and biochemical evaluations should occur every two weeks until complete normalization of serum TSH is achieved. Thereafter, the evaluation frequency can be reduced to once every one to three months until the age of 12 months.

	- Between the ages of 12 months and three years, the evaluation frequency can be lowered to every two to four months. Thereafter, evaluations should be carried out every three to six months until growth is complete.

- **Diagnostics and criteria for treatment**:

- **Biochemical criteria used in the decision to start treatment for CH**: A newborn with an abnormal neonatal screening result should be referred to an expert center (1/++0). An abnormal screening result should be followed by confirmatory testing consisting of the measurement of serum fT4 and TSH (1/++0). If the serum fT4 concentration is below and TSH clearly above the age-specific reference interval, then LT4 treatment should be started immediately (1/+++). If the serum TSH concentration is > 20 mU/L at confirmatory testing (approximately in the second week of life), treatment should be started, even if fT4 is normal (arbitrary threshold, expert opinion) (2/+00). If the serum TSH concentration is 6–20 mU/L beyond the age of 21 days in a healthy neonate with an fT4 concentration within the age-specific reference interval, it is suggested to either start LT4 treatment immediately and retest, off-treatment, at a later stage, or to withhold treatment but retest 1 to 2 weeks later and to re-evaluate the need for treatment (lack of evidence in favor or against treatment, this is an area of further investigation) (2/++0). In countries or regions where thyroid function tests are not readily available, LT4 treatment should be started if filter paper TSH concentration is > 40 mU/L (at the moment of neonatal screening; arbitrary threshold, expert opinion).

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): An American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^115MVPFW]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Despite being the most performed laboratory endocrine investigation, the optimum use of thyroid tests (thyrotropin [TSH] and thyroid hormone [TH] measurement) is open to question, and the interpretation of the results from these tests can be ambiguous. The American Thyroid Association (ATA), with its expertise, supports the endeavor of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) to improve and maintain standardization and harmonization of thyroid testing.

ATA mandated an international interdisciplinary working group panel to survey the status of thyroid testing by reviewing the recent literature to revise or update the criteria as needed in mutual agreement and to inform clinical care. This review represents the conclusions on the clinical use of routine TSH and TH (thyroxine [T4] and triiodothyronine [T3]) assays, taking into account geographic differences in disease prevalence and clinical and laboratory practice among writing members.

The interaction between physiological, pathophysiological, and pharmacological factors and thyroid assays can affect their measurements and confound result interpretation. These factors need to be considered in the clinical context of the patient for appropriate test ordering and result interpretation. Despite significant advances in laboratory methods over the past 50 years, routine thyroid assays remain susceptible to idiosyncratic analytical interference that may produce spurious results. Improved standardization needs to be demonstrated.

### Using a thyroid disease-free population to define the reference interval for TSH and free T4 on the Abbott Architect analyser [^1167d9MP]. Clinical Endocrinology (2017). Low credibility.

Thyroid disease can present subtly, and TSH reference intervals may be artificially increased by including individuals with subclinical thyroid disease. Therefore, a thyroid disease-free population was used to determine TSH and fT4 reference intervals.

- **Design**: Apparently, healthy subjects were assessed via health questionnaire, drug history, clinical assessment, and measurement of thyroid antibodies.

- **Patients**: Healthy subjects in a community setting.

- **Measurements**: TSH, free T4, antithyroglobulin, and anti-TPO were measured on the Abbott Architect analyser. Subjects with clinical abnormalities, consumption of thyroid-active medications, or thyroid antibodies above the reference intervals quoted by the manufacturer were excluded. TSH and fT4 data were log-transformed, and the central 95% was utilized to calculate reference intervals. The data were assessed for normal distribution, and samples spanning the reference intervals for both TSH and fT4 were compared across different assays to evaluate biases.

Results indicated that from a population of 1,606 subjects, 140 males (18%) and 284 females (34%) were excluded. The central 95% population range for TSH was 0.43–3.28 mU/l, and for fT4 it was 10.8–16.8 pmol/l. No age- or sex-related differences were observed. The distribution of both analytes was not significantly different from a Gaussian distribution (P > 0.05). For five commonly used assays for TSH, the maximum difference in the upper limit of the TSH reference interval was 0.48 mU/l, and for fT4, the maximum difference for the upper reference limit was 4.1 pmol/l.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: Cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^1154RQNc]. Endocrine Practice (2012). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for hypothyroidism, particularly concerning indications for specialist referral, the AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend that most patients with primary hypothyroidism should be managed by non-endocrinologist physicians familiar with the diagnosis and treatment of hypothyroidism. Patients with hypothyroidism meeting any of the following criteria should be referred for a consultation with an endocrinologist:

- **Infant and pediatric patients**: Given their developmental needs, specialized care can ensure optimal thyroid function.
- **Female patients planning conception**: Thyroid levels can significantly affect fertility and early pregnancy, necessitating expert management.
- **Pregnant patients**: Maintaining appropriate thyroid hormone levels is crucial for fetal development and maternal health.
- **Patients difficult to render and maintain in a euthyroid state**: These cases may require more sophisticated management strategies.
- **Cardiac disease**: Patients with existing heart conditions need careful monitoring due to the interactions between thyroid function and cardiac health.
- **Presence of goiter, nodule, or other structural changes in the thyroid gland**: These physical changes can indicate underlying complications requiring specialist assessment.
- **Presence of other endocrine diseases, such as adrenal or pituitary disorders**: Complex endocrine conditions may have interconnected effects necessitating specialized care.
- **Unusual constellation of thyroid function test results**: Aberrant test results can indicate atypical thyroid dysfunctions requiring detailed evaluation.
- **Unusual causes of hypothyroidism**: This includes instances induced by agents that interfere with levothyroxine absorption, impact hormone production or secretion, affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis (either directly or indirectly), increase clearance, or peripherally impact metabolism.

### 2018 European Thyroid Association (ETA) guidelines on the diagnosis and management of central hypothyroidism [^115GhaAE]. European Thyroid Journal (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for central hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to thyroid function tests, ETA 2018 guidelines recommend considering the diagnosis of mild CeH (borderline low free T4 with inappropriately low TSH) by a combination of several other findings, such as:

- **Evidence of CeH**: in first-degree relatives.

- **Signs of hypothyroidism**: delayed growth, macroorchidism, hearing loss, and other signs of hypothyroidism.

- **Causative mutations**: in CeH candidate genes.

- **Insufficiency**: of other pituitary hormone secretion.

- **TSH responses**: blunted (< 4 mU/L) or delayed (peak after 60 minutes) TSH responses to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (200 mcg IV).

- **Blunted nocturnal TSH surge**.

- **Low TSH index**.

- **Unexplained alterations**: otherwise unexplained alterations in variables of thyroid hormone action, such as high cholesterol, bradycardia, low body temperature, and echocardiographic findings.

### TSH and FT4 reference interval recommendations and prevalence of gestational thyroid dysfunction: Quantification of current diagnostic approaches [^114UrAad]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend the use of population- and trimester-specific thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) reference intervals (RIs) during pregnancy. Since these are often unavailable, clinicians frequently rely on alternative diagnostic strategies, prompting an investigation into the diagnostic consequences of these recommendations.

The study included cohorts from the Consortium on Thyroid and Pregnancy, utilizing different approaches to define RIs:

- **Fixed limit approach**: A TSH fixed upper limit of 4.0 mU/L
- **Subtraction approach**: A fixed subtraction from the upper limit for TSH of 0.5 mU/L
- **Nonpregnancy RIs**

The outcome measures focused on the sensitivity and false discovery rate (FDR) of women for whom levothyroxine treatment was indicated, and those for whom treatment would be considered according to international guidelines.

The study population consisted of 52,496 participants from 18 cohorts. Compared with trimester-specific RIs, alternative approaches exhibited low sensitivity (0.63–0.82) and high FDR (0.11–0.35) for detecting women with a treatment indication or consideration. Sensitivity and FDR for detecting a treatment indication in the first trimester were similar among the fixed limit, subtraction, and nonpregnancy approaches (0.77–0.11 vs 0.74–0.16 vs 0.60–0.11). The diagnostic performance for detecting overt hypothyroidism, isolated hypothyroxinemia, and (sub)clinical hyperthyroidism varied mainly between FT4 RI approaches, whereas the diagnostic performance for detecting subclinical hypothyroidism varied between the applied TSH RI approaches.

### Interval between tests and thyroxine estimation method influence outcome of monitoring of subclinical hypothyroidism [^113AzMBq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Most patients with subclinical hypothyroidism are regularly monitored when treatment is not initiated. We have studied how the interval between follow-up visits and different T(4) estimates influence the diagnostic outcome in a cohort of patients with untreated subclinical hypothyroidism. Additionally, we examined whether the assessment of clinical symptoms and signs aids in the evaluation of an individual with subclinical hypothyroidism.

- **Design/Patients**: During one year, monthly measurements of TSH and three different T(4) estimates were conducted, alongside recording hypothyroid symptoms and signs in 21 patients with subclinical hypothyroidism confirmed on two occasions three months apart.

- **Results**: One patient maintained euthyroid status at all visits, while another began treatment for profound overt hypothyroidism. The remaining patients presented as subclinical hypothyroidism in 74%, overtly hypothyroid in 22%, and exhibited normal thyroid function tests in 4% of visits. An increased frequency of visits was significantly associated with a decrease in the number of patients characterized as having subclinical hypothyroidism after one year (P = 0.016). The diagnosis of overt hypothyroidism varied between T(4) estimates (P = 0.005) and was highly dependent on T(4) reference limits. The hypothyroid clinical score showed no difference between biochemical diagnoses (P = 0.29).

- **Conclusions**: The monitoring procedure itself may influence the outcome of the control of subclinical hypothyroidism. Specifically, the interval between visits, the type of T(4) estimate used, and the lower T(4) reference limit impacted the outcome in untreated subclinical hypothyroidism.

### Laboratory testing in hyperthyroidism [^115vWkpj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The clinical diagnosis of hypo- or hyperthyroidism is challenging. Clinical symptoms and signs are often non-specific, and there is an incomplete correlation between structural and functional thyroid gland changes. Therefore, laboratory testing is indispensable in establishing the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis. Similar considerations apply to treatment monitoring. Laboratory testing also plays a crucial role in determining the most likely cause of a patient's hyperthyroidism. Finally, during pregnancy, when isotopic scanning is relatively contraindicated and ultrasound interpretations are more difficult, laboratory testing becomes even more important.

### Thyrotropin releasing hormone TRH [^115NAfEi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

Primary (thyroidal) hypothyroidism: The diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism is frequently supported by finding clearly elevated baseline TSH levels; 93% of patients tested had levels above 10 μU/mL. TRH administration to these patients generally would not be expected to yield additional useful information. Ninety-four percent of patients with primary hypothyroidism given TRH in clinical trials responded with a rise in TSH of 2.0 μU/mL or greater. Since this response is also found in normal subjects, TRH testing does not differentiate primary hypothyroidism from normal.

Secondary (pituitary) and tertiary (hypothalamic) hypothyroidism: In the presence of clinical and other laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism, the finding of a baseline TSH level less than 10 μU/mL should suggest secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism. In this situation, a response to TRH of less than 2 μU/mL suggests secondary hypothyroidism, since this response was observed in about 60% of patients with secondary hypothyroidism and only approximately 5% of patients with tertiary hypothyroidism. A TSH response to TRH greater than 2 μU/mL is not helpful in differentiating between secondary and tertiary hypothyroidism, since this response was noted in about 40% of the former and about 95% of the latter.

Establishing the diagnosis of secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism requires a careful history and physical examination along with appropriate tests of anterior pituitary and/or target gland function. The TRH test should not be used as the only laboratory determinant for establishing these diagnoses.
