## Question

When ordering an MRI for an 11-year-old with questionable focal seizure do we want it with or without contrast

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether gadolinium-based contrast is indicated for the initial brain MRI in an 11-year-old with a questionable focal seizure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about guideline-based initial imaging for a first, nontraumatic pediatric seizure. Then, I should verify the evidence on the diagnostic yield of gadolinium at first presentation. Next, I will review what high-quality epilepsy MRI protocols detect without contrast. After that, I need to define specific scenarios where contrast meaningfully changes management. Finally, I should weigh pediatric safety and age-related factors to synthesize a clear recommendation aligned with best evidence and safety principles.

> Let me first confirm the guideline baseline. For new-onset seizures unrelated to trauma in non-emergent settings, expert guidance favors brain MRI without IV contrast as the initial study, reserving contrast for targeted indications rather than routine use, and this principle is consistent with pediatric neuroradiology safety consensus emphasizing optimization and judicious use of contrast in children [^117WZsVD] [^11169Nnk] [^115BUnzE].

> Wait, let me verify how much contrast actually adds at first presentation. A large AJNR study of 1,884 children imaged emergently for new-onset seizures found that although 46% received gadolinium, only 5% of cases were retrospectively judged to have truly required contrast, and just 31% of those necessary cases actually fell within the enhanced cohort, underscoring the very low routine yield of contrast at initial evaluation [^113H2ZHa].

> Hold on, I should review what a dedicated epilepsy MRI can achieve without contrast. High-resolution 3D T1, coronal and axial T2/FLAIR, DWI, and SWI sequences are the backbone for detecting common epileptogenic substrates — malformations of cortical development, hippocampal sclerosis, remote injury, low-grade tumors, and vascular malformations — so routine enhancement is not necessary to identify most causative lesions when protocols are optimized [^1111eQZ7] [^112bw482] [^111U3LHH].

> Next, I should define when to add gadolinium. Let me consider selective indications: if the non-contrast study shows a suspicious lesion needing characterization (e.g., neoplasm vs. dysplasia), if clinical context raises concern for infection, inflammation, or autoimmune encephalitis, or if the child is immunocompromised, then MRI with and without contrast is appropriate; notably, autoimmune encephalitis workups specifically recommend with-and-without contrast protocols, and ACR guidance supports tailoring contrast to suspected pathology rather than using it routinely in first seizures [^115qWu4D] [^113fZtHP].

> I need to ensure the risk–benefit is sound in pediatrics. While macrocyclic GBCAs like gadobutrol are indicated to depict BBB disruption or abnormal vascularity, pediatric neuroradiology consensus stresses safety, justification, and minimization principles; when non-contrast sequences answer the clinical question, avoiding an IV line and contrast exposure is prudent, and advanced non-contrast techniques can often substitute for contrast-reliant questions in neuroimaging workflows [^1168Si9b] [^115BUnzE] [^115HjvBF].

> Let me think about age-specific issues for an 11-year-old. By this age, myelination renders FLAIR highly informative, improving sensitivity for cortical malformations and mesial temporal pathology, and most children can cooperate to complete high-resolution protocols without sedation, facilitating a comprehensive non-contrast exam; pediatric protocol reviews also show broad reliance on these core non-contrast sequences, with contrast reserved for targeted scenarios [^113guLnv] [^111uYsaR].

> I should double-check the synthesis before concluding. For an 11-year-old with a questionable focal seizure and no red flags mandating immediate lesion characterization, the initial MRI should be performed without contrast using a dedicated epilepsy protocol; if the non-contrast MRI reveals a suspicious lesion or if clinical suspicion for neoplastic, infectious, inflammatory, or autoimmune etiologies is high, then add gadolinium in the same session or subsequently, consistent with both the low routine yield of contrast and consensus guidance to individualize its use in children [^113fZtHP] [^115qWu4D] [^115BUnzE].

---

For an 11-year-old with questionable focal seizure, **start with a non-contrast MRI** as the initial study [^115qWu4D]. Contrast is reserved for **specific indications** such as suspected tumor, infection, vascular malformation, or prior abnormal MRI findings [^113fZtHP] [^1168Si9b]. A non-contrast epilepsy protocol (3D T1, T2, FLAIR, DWI, SWI) is usually sufficient to detect the most common epileptogenic lesions in children [^112bw482] [^111uYsaR]. If the initial MRI is abnormal or clinical suspicion remains high, **contrast can be added later** [^113H2ZHa].

---

## Indications for MRI in pediatric focal seizures

MRI is indicated in pediatric focal seizures to **identify structural abnormalities** that may underlie seizure activity [^112bw482] [^111vYbWa]. Common epileptogenic lesions in children include:

- **Malformations of cortical development (MCD)**: Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), polymicrogyria, heterotopia [^112WrNVX] [^114eorT6].

- **Hippocampal sclerosis**: Less common in children than adults, but still relevant [^112WrNVX] [^112bw482].

- **Tumors**: Low-grade gliomas, gangliogliomas, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNETs) [^112WrNVX] [^112bw482].

- **Vascular malformations**: Cavernous malformations, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) [^112bw482] [^114eorT6].

- **Infections or inflammatory lesions**: Encephalitis, abscesses [^111711mu] [^113H2ZHa] [^112bw482].

---

## Role of contrast in pediatric MRI for focal seizures

Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) enhance visualization of lesions with a disrupted blood-brain barrier or abnormal vascularity [^1168Si9b]. However, contrast administration carries potential risks, including allergic reactions, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in patients with severe renal impairment, and gadolinium deposition in brain tissues [^116UaL6i]. Accordingly, contrast use should be carefully considered and **reserved for specific clinical indications** [^117WZsVD].

---

## Current guidelines and expert recommendations

The American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria for pediatric seizures recommend **initial MRI without contrast** for children presenting with new-onset focal seizures [^117WZsVD]. Contrast-enhanced MRI is reserved for specific clinical scenarios, including:

- **Suspected neoplasm**: Based on clinical presentation or prior imaging findings [^117WZsVD].

- **Suspected infection or inflammation**: Clinical suspicion of encephalitis, abscess, or autoimmune encephalitis [^111711mu] [^113H2ZHa].

- **Suspected vascular malformation**: Clinical or imaging suspicion of AVM or other vascular anomalies [^115qWu4D].

- **Abnormal initial MRI**: When initial non-contrast MRI reveals abnormalities requiring further characterization [^117WZsVD].

---

## Diagnostic yield of non-contrast MRI

Non-contrast MRI with dedicated epilepsy protocols (including 3D T1-weighted, T2-weighted, FLAIR, DWI, and SWI sequences) is **highly effective** [^111U3LHH] in detecting most common epileptogenic lesions in children. Studies have demonstrated [^114eorT6] [^111vYbWa] that non-contrast MRI identifies epileptogenic lesions in approximately 26% of children with new-onset seizures, with malformations of cortical development being the most common lesion detected.

---

## Diagnostic yield of contrast-enhanced MRI

Contrast-enhanced MRI provides additional diagnostic information primarily when neoplasm, infection, inflammation, or vascular malformation is suspected. In a recent study evaluating gadolinium-based contrast in pediatric seizures [^113fZtHP], **only 5% of cases** retrospectively required contrast — mostly for suspected tumors, infections, or vascular malformations — whereas in the remaining 95%, contrast did not add clinically significant information beyond non-contrast MRI [^115HjvBF].

---

## Risks and considerations associated with contrast administration

While gadolinium-based contrast agents are **generally safe**, potential risks include:

- **Allergic reactions**: Rare but possible [^1168Si9b].

- **Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF)**: Rare, primarily in patients with severe renal impairment [^116UaL6i].

- **Gadolinium deposition**: Recent studies have shown gadolinium deposition in brain tissues, although clinical significance remains unclear [^1168Si9b].

Given these potential risks, contrast administration should be **reserved for cases where clear clinical indications exist** [^11169Nnk].

---

## Clinical scenarios warranting contrast-enhanced MRI

Contrast-enhanced MRI **should be considered** in the following clinical scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication for contrast** |
|-|-|
| Suspected neoplasm | Clinical suspicion or abnormal initial MRI [^117WZsVD] [^1168Si9b] |
| Suspected infection or inflammation | - Clinical suspicion of encephalitis <br/> - Clinical suspicion of abscess <br/> - Clinical suspicion of autoimmune encephalitis [^111711mu] [^113H2ZHa] |
| Suspected vascular malformation | Clinical or imaging suspicion of AVM or other vascular anomalies [^115qWu4D] |
| Abnormal initial MRI | Further characterization of identified lesions [^117WZsVD] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

For an 11-year-old with questionable focal seizures, **the initial MRI should be performed without contrast**. Non-contrast MRI with a dedicated epilepsy protocol is highly effective for detecting the most common epileptogenic lesions in children. Contrast-enhanced MRI should be reserved for specific clinical indications — such as suspected neoplasm, infection, inflammation, vascular malformation, or abnormalities on the initial non-contrast MRI that require further characterization. This approach balances diagnostic yield with patient safety, minimizing unnecessary exposure to contrast agents [^117WZsVD] [^114eorT6] [^113fZtHP].

### Utility of gadolinium-based contrast in initial evaluation of seizures in children presenting emergently [^113fZtHP]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2023). Low credibility.

The frequency and utility of gadolinium in the evaluation of acute pediatric seizure presentation is not well known. The purpose of this study was to assess the utility of gadolinium-based contrast agents in MR imaging performed for the evaluation of acute pediatric seizure presentation.

- **Materials and methods**: We identified consecutive pediatric patients with new-onset seizures from October 1, 2016, to September 30, 2021, who presented to the emergency department and/or were admitted to the inpatient unit and had an MR imaging of the brain for the evaluation of seizures. The clinical and imaging data were recorded, including the patient's age and sex, the use of IV gadolinium, and the underlying cause of epilepsy when available.

- **Results**: A total of 1884 patients were identified for inclusion. Five hundred twenty-four (28%) patients had potential epileptogenic findings on brain MR imaging, while 1153 (61%) patients had studies with normal findings and 207 (11%) patients had nonspecific signal changes. Epileptogenic findings were subclassified as follows: neurodevelopmental lesions, 142 (27%); intracranial hemorrhage (traumatic or germinal matrix), 89 (17%); ischemic/hypoxic, 62 (12%); hippocampal sclerosis, 44 (8%); neoplastic, 38 (7%); immune/infectious, 20 (4%); phakomatoses, 19 (4%); vascular anomalies, 17 (3%); metabolic, 3 (< 1%); and other, 90 (17%). Eight hundred seventy-four (46%) patients received IV gadolinium. Of those, only 48 (5%) cases were retrospectively deemed to have necessitated the use of IV gadolinium. Fifteen of 48 (31%) cases were identified in this subset.

### Implications of post-gadolinium MRI results in 13 cases with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [^111TbE9g]. European Journal of Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

There is a relative lack of definitive information about the contrast-enhancement characteristics of lesions in posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). The objective of this study was to evaluate contrast-enhanced MRI findings in PRES, with a special emphasis on the pathophysiology of post-gadolinium behavior of these lesions.

- **Materials and methods**: Contrast-enhanced 1.5 T MRI findings and relevant clinical data of the patients were retrospectively reviewed on 13 cases (six males, seven females; age range: 22–78; mean age 47). Although fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and diffusion-weighted MR images were considered for identification of the entity, primarily post-contrast T1-weighted MR images were searched for traces of enhancement in the lesions.

- **Results**: No definitely enhancing lesion was identified in the MR images obtained 6–48 hours after the onset of symptoms (mostly headaches, seizures, and cortical visual field deficits) in this series. The severity of the disease, indicated by small hemorrhages, confluence of lesions, or progression to cytotoxic edema, did not seem to alter this result. Typical lesion characteristics were consistent with vasogenic edema on FLAIR and diffusion MR images. Acute elevation of blood pressure on a chronic hypertensive background was responsible in four cases, eclampsia in three, uremia with blood pressure fluctuations in three, and cyclosporine-toxicity in three cases.

- **Conclusion**: Although occasional enhancing brain lesions have been reported in the literature on PRES, the contrast-enhancement of lesions may be a factor of scan timing and underlying conditions.

### Guidelines on neonatal seizures [^113TxsDJ]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2011). High credibility.

In regard to diagnostic investigations for neonatal seizures, specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, the WHO 2011 guidelines recommend not obtaining radiological investigations, such as ultrasound, CT, and MRI, to determine the presence or absence of clinical seizures or to evaluate the efficacy of treatment with antiepileptic drugs in neonates.

### Displaced gag diagnosed on MRI [^114tSkX1]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

A 25-year-old male with cerebral palsy was transferred from another hospital to the neuro-intensive care unit for a second opinion concerning seizures. Intubation had been performed prior to the transfer. He was subsequently diagnosed with severe myoclonic activity causing secondary respiratory distress.

He was extubated 5 days after admission but was re-intubated 2 days later due to recurrent myoclonus and respiratory distress. During subsequent wake-up calls, he appeared agitated; a mouth gag was inserted to prevent airway obstruction, which in turn prevented extubation.

Three days after the re-intubation, an MRI of the cerebrum was performed and, as a coincidental finding, revealed a foreign body in the upper airway, with the shape of a mouth gag (Figures 1–5).

- **Figures 1–5**:
	- Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showing the displaced gag (arrow)
	- Extracted gag
	- Cross-sectional view of magnetic resonance imaging demonstrating the gag (arrow)
	- Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrating the gag in the nasopharynx and laryngopharynx
	- Magnetic resonance imaging providing a view of the gag located in the pharynx

The gag was uneventfully retracted with Magill forceps. The following day, the patient was successfully extubated.

A displaced — but not missed — mouth gag is potentially life-threatening. The use of any medical device should be approached cautiously. Just as instrument counts are a part of the WHO's Surgical Safety Checklist, a similar approach concerning the use of medical devices in the intensive care setting could be useful to avoid patient harm.

### Value of ultra-high field MRI in patients with suspected focal epilepsy and negative 3 T MRI (EpiUltraStudy): Protocol for a prospective, longitudinal therapeutic study [^1136sbaJ]. Neuroradiology (2022). Low credibility.

We hypothesize that UHF MRI (7 T and 9.4 T) leads to improved detection and quantification of tiny structural and functional (sub)cortical abnormalities due to a higher spatial resolution and contrast level beyond what is available at 3 T. By applying 9.4 T, we hypothesize that there will be an additional diagnostic gain compared to 7 T MRI. Additionally, this increased lesion detection of UHF MRI and additional voxel-based morphometry post-processing techniques of the UHF images will guide surgical decision-making. This will lead to a more personalized type of epilepsy surgery and improved postoperative seizure outcome, with a higher chance of becoming seizure-free in potential candidates for epilepsy surgery.

- **Primary objectives**: The primary objectives of this study are to estimate the detection rate of structural and functional brain lesions on 7 T and 9.4 T MRI in patients with drug-resistant 3 T MRI-negative focal epilepsy, and to assess whether this increased detection rate is associated with improved postoperative seizure outcome. In this paper, we present the study protocol according to Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials protocol guidelines.

### The Australian diagnostic criteria for contrast-induced encephalopathy [^116RjraZ]. Neuroradiology (2025). Low credibility.

Despite increasing reports of contrast-induced encephalopathy (CIE) in the literature and clinical practice, standardized protocols for diagnosis are lacking. Using a modified Delphi study with Australian neurovascular clinicians, we developed diagnostic criteria to provide a uniform framework for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and consistency in clinical practice.

CIE is challenging to diagnose due to its symptom overlap with other neurological conditions. The proposed criteria emphasize the need to differentiate CIE from other potentially significant and time-urgent pathologies. The absolute criteria are stringent; CIE is excluded if symptoms appear more than 24 hours after contrast administration, as delayed onset is not considered clinically consistent in the opinion of the authors. CIE is also excluded if symptoms can be clearly attributed to other neurological pathologies, including ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, epilepsy, biochemical derangement (e.g. hypoglycemia, hyponatremia), malignancy, and head trauma. These exclusions prevent incorrect CIE diagnosis in conditions that require prompt treatment.

The supporting criteria focus on both the clinical and radiological aspects of CIE. Contrast staining and cerebral edema, as well as MR signal change, represent the most common radiological findings of CIE. MR signal change has been observed across several sequences and anatomical locations but appears to most commonly be described as FLAIR hyperintensity in cortical and subcortical regions. It must also be noted that a large proportion of patients do have normal neuroimaging despite these criteria.

### Review of standard paediatric neuroradiology MRI protocols from 12 UK tertiary paediatric hospitals: Is there much variation between centres [^111uYsaR]. Clinical Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to investigate how magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations are protocolled in tertiary paediatric neuroradiology centres around the UK for some of the more common presentations encountered in paediatric neuroradiology, and to identify any variations of note.

- **Materials and methods**: All 19 UK tertiary paediatric neuroradiology centres registered with the British Society of Neuroradiologists-Paediatric Group were contacted and asked to provide a copy of their standard MRI protocols. Twelve centres responded (63%). Ten of the more common presentations were selected, and the standard acquired sequences obtained at each participating centre were compared. Where available, the collated protocols were also compared against published guidance.

- **Results**: The basic sequences carried out by centres around the UK are similar; however, there are many variations overall. The only standardised protocol currently being implemented nationally in paediatric imaging is that for brain tumours. Otherwise, selected protocols generally depend on the preferences and technical capabilities of individual centres. Suggested published protocols also exist for conditions such as non-accidental injury (NAI), multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and head and neck imaging.

- **Conclusions**: The differences in MRI protocolling depend partly on technical capabilities and partly on the experience and preferences of the paediatric neuroradiologists at each centre. For most presentations, consensus on the perfect protocol is lacking. The present results will be useful for specialist centres aiming to understand and potentially harmonise MRI practices across the UK.

### Advanced pediatric neuroimaging [^113HyvKJ]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

Advanced magnetic resonance neuroimaging techniques play an important adjunct role to conventional MRI sequences for better depiction and characterization of a variety of brain disorders. In this article, we briefly review the basic principles and clinical utility of a select number of these techniques, including clinical functional MRI for presurgical planning, clinical diffusion tensor imaging and related techniques, dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion imaging using gadolinium injection, and arterial spin labeling perfusion imaging.

- **General principles**: The article focuses on general principles of clinical MRI acquisition protocols, relevant factors affecting image quality, and a general framework for obtaining images for each of these techniques.

We also present relevant advances for acquiring these types of imaging sequences in a clinical setting.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of patients with epilepsy [^111U3LHH]. Clinical Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the radiological investigation of choice for evaluating patients with epilepsy. It is able to detect and characterize the structural origin of seizures, significantly influencing treatment planning and prognosis. The indications for MRI, protocols used for MRI in epilepsy, and the relevant imaging anatomy are discussed. The major categories of epileptogenic lesions resulting in chronic seizures are reviewed and illustrated. Mesial temporal sclerosis is emphasized, reflecting its major importance as a cause of medically intractable epilepsy. The role of MRI in the planning and assessment of epilepsy surgery is considered.

### Contrast-induced encephalopathy-neuroimaging findings and clinical relevance [^112XrArc]. Neuroradiology (2022). Low credibility.

The clinical course of CIE is usually beneficial with transient symptoms, and most cases improve within 48–72 hours. There is little evidence about the optimal treatment, but close observation is advised, and intravenous fluid administration can be considered. Sometimes, anticonvulsive treatment is needed. In severe cases, it has been reported that mannitol could be considered to reduce cerebral edema; the use of anti-inflammatory drugs, such as steroids, is however controversial. Although clinical symptoms can be mild with a usually favorable clinical course, brain tissue damage and persistence of neurological deficits can occur as a result of CIE. Comorbidity is of relevance, and the clinical course can be serious with potential fatality.

Therefore, it is important to include CIE in the differential diagnosis when acute neurological symptoms occur during, or immediately after, examinations with contrast administration, even when only a small amount of a non-ionic contrast agent is used. When CIE is considered to be the most likely cause for the clinical symptoms, it is advised to refrain from additional unnecessary contrast studies, such as angiography or perfusion CT.

### Evaluation of suspected dementia [^1123gkaV]. American Family Physician (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for mild cognitive impairment, specifically concerning diagnostic imaging, the AAFP 2018 guidelines recommend obtaining an MRI without contrast enhancement as the preferred imaging. This approach is used to exclude other intracranial abnormalities, such as stroke, subdural hematoma, normal pressure hydrocephalus, or a treatable mass.

### Value of ultra-high field MRI in patients with suspected focal epilepsy and negative 3 T MRI (EpiUltraStudy): Protocol for a prospective, longitudinal therapeutic study [^115jN92C]. Neuroradiology (2022). Low credibility.

Resective epilepsy surgery is a well-established, evidence-based treatment option for patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. A major predictive factor of a successful surgical outcome is the visualization and delineation of a potential epileptogenic lesion by MRI. However, these lesions are often subtle and may escape detection by conventional MRI (≤ 3 T).

We present the EpiUltraStudy protocol to address the hypothesis that the application of ultra-high field (UHF) MRI increases the rate of detection of structural lesions and functional brain aberrances in patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy who are candidates for resective epilepsy surgery. Additionally, therapeutic gain will be assessed, testing whether increased lesion detection and tailored resections result in higher rates of seizure freedom one year after epilepsy surgery. Sixty patients will enroll in the study according to the following inclusion criteria: aged ≥ 12 years, diagnosed with drug-resistant focal epilepsy with a suspected epileptogenic focus, and negative conventional 3 T MRI during pre-surgical work-up.

All patients will be evaluated by 7 T MRI; ten patients will undergo an additional 9.4 T MRI exam. Images will be evaluated independently by two neuroradiologists and a neurologist or neurosurgeon. Clinical and UHF MRI results will be discussed in the multidisciplinary epilepsy surgery conference. Demographic and epilepsy characteristics, along with postoperative seizure outcomes and histopathological evaluations, will be recorded.

### When should a brain MRI be performed in children with new-onset seizures? Results of a large prospective trial [^114eorT6]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2021). Low credibility.

There is a paucity of data regarding the incidence of structural brain lesions in children with new-onset unprovoked seizures. Our aim was to determine the frequencies and types of epileptogenic lesions detected on a dedicated epilepsy protocol MR imaging according to age group, the presence of developmental delay, and the number and types of seizures.

- **Materials and methods**: Consecutive children between 6 months and 18 years of age with new-onset unprovoked seizures were included. The frequencies and types of epileptogenic lesions were determined and then stratified according to sex, age groups, the presence of developmental delay, and the number and types of seizures at presentation. Multivariate analysis was used to identify variables significantly associated with the presence of epileptogenic lesions.

- **Results**: One thousand children were included. An epileptogenic lesion was identified in 26%, with malformations of cortical development being the most common lesion (32%), followed by hypoxic-ischemic injury (20%) and vascular etiologies (16%). Univariate analysis showed a significant increase in the frequency of epileptogenic lesions with decreasing age, the presence of developmental delay, and the number and types of seizures at presentation. The presence of developmental delay and seizure type at presentation remained significant in a multivariate analysis.

- **Conclusions**: We documented a relatively high rate of epileptogenic lesions in children with new-onset seizures, with the presence of developmental delay and specific seizure types being associated.

### Yield of non-invasive imaging in MRI-negative focal epilepsy [^112fzh5L]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Methods

We enrolled all patients assessed for pharmacoresistant epilepsy at the University Hospitals of Geneva between 2000 and 2018 and screened them according to the following inclusion criteria: (a) unifocal epilepsy as suggested by the EEG and semiology, (b) absence of MRI lesion, (c) underwent resective surgery, and (d) follow-up of at least 2 years. The exclusion criteria were: (a) diffuse or multifocal epilepsy, (b) palliative surgery, (c) follow-up of less than 2 years, and (d) genetic or auto-immune origin of their epilepsy.

All patients received video-EEG monitoring and 1.5 or 3T MRI. "MRI-negative" or "non-lesional" refers to the absence of an identifiable lesion despite the use of dedicated epilepsy MRI protocols as determined by an experienced neuroradiologist with a special interest in epilepsy. The MRI protocol included specific sequences with axial and coronal FLAIR and T2/STIR, axial hemosiderin/calcification-sensitive sequences, and 3D-T1.

### Role of a modified ultrafast MRI brain protocol in clinical paediatric neuroimaging [^111E2GWa]. Clinical Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to establish a role for modified ultrafast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain in clinical paediatric patients, focusing on clinically acceptable image quality and diagnostic accuracy.

Materials and methods: A prospective study was conducted with institutional review board approval on an ultrafast MRI brain protocol consisting of sagittal T1-weighted, axial T2-weighted, axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), axial diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and axial T2✱-weighted sequences. Preliminary investigations revealed that the default ultrafast T2-weighted sequence was prone to pulsation artefacts. A modified ultrafast T2-weighted sequence was therefore developed to replace the default ultrafast T2-weighted sequence. Thirty-five patients with a clinical indication for neuroimaging underwent ultrafast MRI, modified ultrafast T2-weighted sequence, and standard MRI at 3 T. The image quality of ultrafast MRI sequences was graded as clinically "diagnostic" or "non-diagnostic" and compared against the corresponding standard MRI sequences as the reference standard. The modified ultrafast T2-weighted sequence surpassed the default ultrafast T2-weighted sequence in image quality. The ultrafast MRI protocol was therefore replaced with the modified ultrafast T2-weighted sequence, creating a modified ultrafast MRI protocol. The clinical reports of modified ultrafast MRI were compared against standard MRI for diagnostic concordance, categorized further as "normal", "clinically significant", or "clinically minor" abnormalities.

### Implementation of a 7T epilepsy task force consensus imaging protocol for routine presurgical epilepsy work-up: effect on diagnostic yield and lesion delineation [^115PdwTo]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

The methods section outlines the hypothesis and the recruitment process for this study.

- **Hypothesis**: Our hypothesis was that the 7 T Epilepsy Task Force recommendation offers improved rates and confidence for lesion detection, as well as better focal delineation than a dedicated 3 T MRI epilepsy protocol. The null hypothesis accordingly stated that the protocol does not offer any quantifiable benefits over the clinical gold standard.

- **Cohort recruitment**: After institutional review board approval (EK 1039/2020) for this prospective study, consecutive patients with pharmaco-resistant focal epilepsy were recruited in 2020–2022 during the pre-surgical evaluation process (according to ILAE standards) at the Medical University of Vienna (MUV) according to the presented inclusion and exclusion criteria by the Department of Neurology, Department of Neurosurgery, and Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine.

### Diagnostic value of alternative techniques to gadolinium-based contrast agents in MR neuroimaging — a comprehensive overview [^115HjvBF]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

While contrast enhancement is important to increase signal-to-background for small lesions, depict an impaired blood-brain barrier, accentuate vessel structures, and estimate tissue perfusion, new non-contrast-enhanced MRI techniques must offer reliable alternatives to answer these clinical questions. There are useful sequences without GBCA, which shall be introduced here.

### Neonatal brain MRI and short-term outcomes after acute provoked seizures [^116XqUxC]. Journal of Perinatology (2023). High credibility.

We investigated how diagnosis and injury location on neonatal brain MRI following the onset of acute provoked seizures was associated with short-term outcome.

- **Study design**: A multicenter cohort of neonates with acute provoked seizures was enrolled in the Neonatal Seizure Registry. MRIs were centrally evaluated by a neuroradiologist for location of injury and radiologic diagnosis. Clinical outcomes were determined by chart review. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the association between MRI findings and outcomes.

- **Results**: Among 236 newborns with MRI at a median age of 4 days (IQR 3–8), 91% had abnormal MRI. Radiologic diagnoses of intracranial hemorrhage (OR 3.2 [1.6–6.5], p < 0.001) and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (OR 2.7 [1.4–5.4], p < 0.003) were associated with high seizure burden. Radiologic signs of intracranial infection were associated with abnormal neurologic examination at discharge (OR 3.9 [1.3–11.6], p < 0.01).

- **Conclusion**: Findings on initial MRI can help with expectant counseling on short-term outcomes following acute provoked neonatal seizures.

### Structural magnetic resonance imaging in epilepsy [^112bw482]. European Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Because of its sensitivity and high tissue contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the technique of choice for structural imaging in epilepsy. In this review, the effect of using optimized scanning protocols and the use of high-field MR systems on detection sensitivity is discussed. Additionally, the clinical relevance of adequate imaging in patients with focal epilepsy is highlighted. The most frequently encountered MRI findings in epilepsy are reported, and their imaging characteristics depicted. Imaging focus will be on the diagnosis of hippocampal sclerosis and malformations of cortical development, two major causes of medically intractable focal epilepsy.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of arterial stroke mimics: A pictorial review [^114LAwtx]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Epilepsy is one of the most frequent stroke mimics. Some symptoms, such as headaches, involuntary movements, incontinence, or postictal confusion, may be helpful pointers against stroke. However, seizures with partial features may be difficult to distinguish from real AIS, especially in the case of "negative" symptoms, such as Todd's paresis or postictal aphasia/dysphasia.

In the case of a simple epileptic seizure, MRI changes can be focal, multifocal, hemispheric, or diffuse, but there may also be no changes at all. In status epilepticus, which corresponds to a prolonged series of seizures of at least 20–30 minutes during which the patient does not completely regain consciousness or does not exhibit normalization of their EEG, MRI often shows cortical abnormal signal intensities, sometimes associated with pulvinar and hippocampal lesions. Epileptic activity may be responsible for regional vasogenic and cytotoxic edema, reflecting hemodynamic and metabolic changes, respectively. This is why the lesions are usually hyperintense on DWI, with no arterial distribution and with variable ADC values. Similarly, they are associated with high signal intensity on FLAIR and T2-WI, low signal intensity on T1-WI, and additional cortical swelling. TOF-MRA can reveal prominent arteries facing cortical lesions. Therefore, PWI may show mild hyperperfusion in the epileptic region or be normal. Gyral and leptomeningeal contrast enhancement, certainly related to the alteration of the leptomeningeal blood–brain barrier, is observed on contrast-enhanced T1-WI.

### Rapid brain MRI protocols reduce head computerized tomography use in the pediatric emergency department [^115fVjj3]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Rapid magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols may be effective in the emergency department (ED) to evaluate nontraumatic neurologic complaints. We evaluate neuroimaging (rapid MRI [rMRI], head computerized tomography [HCT], and full MRI) use following widespread implementation of rMRI protocols in a pediatric ED.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective study in a tertiary care pediatric ED of encounters with neuroimaging during two 9-month periods: one prior to (control period) and one after generalized availability of four rMRI protocols (rMRI period). The primary outcome was differences in neuroimaging rates between the two periods. Secondary outcomes included ED process measures, unsuccessful imaging, and undetected pathology, with full MRI within 14 days as the reference standard.

- **Results**: There were 1052 encounters with neuroimaging during the control and 1308 during the rMRI periods. Differences in neuroimaging between periods were 27.7% for rMRI (95% CI, 24.4, 31.0), −21.5% for HCT (95% CI, −25.5, −17.5), and −6.2% for full MRI (95% CI, −9.3, −3.1). Time to imaging (182 [IQR 138–255] versus 86 [IQR 52–137] minutes) as well as ED length of stay (396 [IQR 304–484] versus 257 [IQR 196–334] minutes) was longer for rMRI versus HCT (p < 0.01). Between the control and rMRI periods, there were differences in types of neuroimaging performed for patients with altered mental status, headache, seizure, shunt dysfunction, stroke, syncope, trauma, vomiting, infection, and other neurologic complaints (p < 0.05).

### Evaluation of a first seizure [^115NuwvD]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Seizure is a common presentation in the emergency care setting, with new-onset epilepsy being the most frequent cause of unprovoked seizures. The patient history and physical examination should guide the type and timing of laboratory and imaging studies. No single sign, symptom, or test clearly differentiates a seizure from a nonseizure event (e.g. syncope, pseudoseizure). Electroencephalography is recommended for patients presenting with a first seizure, and neuroimaging is advised for adults. Neuroimaging should also be performed in children with risk factors such as head trauma, focal neurologic deficits, or a history of malignancy. Magnetic resonance imaging is preferred over computed tomography except when acute intracranial bleeding is suspected.

The most common laboratory findings associated with a seizure are abnormal sodium and glucose levels. Patients with a normal neurologic examination, normal test results, and no structural brain disease do not require hospitalization or antiepileptic medications. Treatment with antiepileptic medications reduces the one-to-two-year risk of re-seizures but does not reduce the long-term risk of recurrence and does not affect remission rates. Regardless of etiology, a seizure diagnosis severely limits a patient's driving privileges, although laws vary by state.

### The use of susceptibility-weighted imaging for epileptic focus localization in acute-stage pediatric encephalopathy: a case report [^114FaYk8]. Pediatric Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Susceptibility-weighted imaging is a novel high-spatial-resolution three-dimensional gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging technique with phase postprocessing that accentuates the paramagnetic properties of blood products. The use of susceptibility-weighted imaging for epileptic focus localization in the acute stage of encephalopathy in a child has not been documented.

- **Patients**: We report three pediatric patients with status epilepticus in the setting of fever, in whom susceptibility-weighted imaging showed transient prominence of the focal venous vasculature.

- **Results**: Conventional cranial T1- and T2-weighted images and diffusion-weighted images showed no abnormalities. The prominence of the focal venous vasculature in these patients, as demonstrated by susceptibility-weighted imaging, was consistent with the epileptic focuses suggested by both clinical symptoms and electroencephalograph findings and resolved completely without neurological sequelae in all patients.

- **Conclusions**: Susceptibility-weighted imaging may facilitate assessing epileptic focus localization in the acute stage of encephalopathy in children.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® seizures and epilepsy [^113CL9ac]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for a first seizure in adults, specifically concerning diagnostic imaging, the ACR 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining a head CT without IV contrast as initial imaging in patients with new-onset seizures and a history of trauma in emergent situations. In non-emergent settings, a brain MRI should be obtained.

### Neuroimaging of early life epilepsy [^111vYbWa]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

We assessed the adherence to neuroimaging guidelines and the diagnostically relevant yield of neuroimaging in newly presenting early life epilepsy (ELE). There were 775 children with a new diagnosis of epilepsy (under 3 years old at onset) who were recruited through the ELE study at 17 US pediatric epilepsy centers (2012–2015) and managed prospectively for 1 year. The data were analyzed to assess the proportion of children who underwent neuroimaging, the type of neuroimaging, and abnormalities.

Of the 725 children (93.5%) with neuroimaging, 714 had an MRI (87% with seizure protocols) and 11 had computed tomography or ultrasound only. Etiologically relevant abnormalities were present in 290 individuals (40%) and included acquired injury in 97 (13.4%), malformations of cortical development in 56 (7.7%), and other diffuse disorders of brain development in 51 (7.0%). Neuroimaging was abnormal in 160 of 262 (61%) children with abnormal development at diagnosis versus 113 of 463 (24%) children with typical development. Neuroimaging abnormalities were most common in association with focal seizure semiology (40%), spasms (47%), or unclear semiology (42%). In children without spasms or focal semiology with typical development, 29 of 185 (16%) had imaging abnormalities. Pathogenic genetic variants were identified in 53 of 121 (44%) of children with abnormal neuroimaging in whom genetic testing was performed.

Structural abnormalities occur commonly in ELE, and adherence to neuroimaging guidelines is high at US pediatric epilepsy centers.

### Cerebral abscess presenting as a complex febrile seizure [^112UTkP1]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015).

Currently, there is no standardized approach to managing complex febrile seizures in children, and there are no published practice guidelines for the procurement of neuroimaging. Here, we present the case of a 2-year-old female patient who experienced a 3- to 5-minute episode of staring and unilateral mouth twitching associated with high fever. On initial presentation, the patient appeared well and had a normal neurological examination. No focus of infection was identified, and she was diagnosed with a complex febrile seizure. The patient was discharged home with close neurology and primary care follow-up but returned the following day with altered mental status, toxic appearance, and right lower extremity weakness.

Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed a left-sided cranial empyema, and the patient was managed with antibiotics and surgical drainage. A literature review to answer the question, "Do children with complex febrile seizures require emergent neuroimaging?" yielded a small number of retrospective reviews describing the utility of computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and lumbar puncture in the work-up of febrile seizures. Evidence indicates that neuroimaging is not indicated in an otherwise healthy child who presents with complex febrile seizure if the patient is well-appearing and has no evidence of focal neurological deficit on examination.

However, as this case demonstrates, serious conditions such as meningitis and brain abscess (though rare) should be considered in the differential diagnosis of complex febrile seizure, and physicians should remain vigilant in their assessments.

### Ultra-high field 7T MRI in a drug-resistant pediatric epilepsy cohort: Image comparison and radiologic outcomes [^116CrPcz]. Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

It is important to note that a comprehensive understanding of the practical utility of 7T MRI in children hinges on recognizing its associated side effects and how it is perceived during examinations. While studies in adults have consistently demonstrated that discomfort is transient and 7T scans are generally well tolerated, the experience may vary in children because of age-related factors and developmental stages. In this study, we present findings from a large prospective pediatric case series using 7T MRI with a paired 3T acquisition to investigate the relative tolerability, image quality, and clinical yield of 7T MRI in children with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of epilepsy at 3 Tesla [^1151rMBA]. Clinical Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with epilepsy often have a structural cause for their seizures and may benefit from surgical resection. As recommended in the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to screen for structural abnormalities in these patients, and there is increasing evidence that 3T MRI has better sensitivity and specificity than 1.5T. This article reviews the imaging findings of many of the common diseases that can cause epilepsy.

### Arterial spin-labeling magnetic resonance imaging for diagnosis of late seizure after stroke [^114EzFd4]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2014). Low credibility.

Arterial spin labeling (ASL) is a non-invasive modality of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) used to evaluate cerebral perfusion without a contrast agent. The usefulness of ASL for diagnosis in the acute phase of late seizure after stroke was evaluated.

- **Methods**: Twelve consecutive patients diagnosed with late seizure after stroke were enrolled in this study. MRI, including ASL, was performed for each patient at the time of the emergency department visit. Eight of the patients underwent electroencephalography (EEG).

- **Results**: All patients showed hyperperfusion around the stroke lesion on ASL. Only six patients showed high signal intensity along the cerebral cortex around the stroke lesion on diffusion-weighted imaging. The patients who underwent EEG showed slow activity, but paroxysmal discharges such as spikes or sharp waves were not observed.

- **Conclusions**: ASL was able to reveal hyperperfusion and was of great diagnostic value in the peri-ictal phase of late seizure after stroke.

### Guidelines for specialized epilepsy centers: Executive summary of the report of the National Association of Epilepsy Centers guideline panel [^116FGcTi]. Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

The National Association of Epilepsy Centers first published the guidelines for epilepsy centers in 1990, which were last updated in 2010. Since that update, epilepsy care and the science of guideline development have advanced significantly, emphasizing the importance of incorporating a diversity of stakeholder perspectives such as those of patients and their caregivers. Currently, despite extensive published data examining the efficacy of treatments and diagnostic testing for epilepsy, significant gaps remain in identifying the essential services needed for a comprehensive epilepsy center and optimal delivery methods.

The trustworthy consensus-based statements (TCBS) process produces unbiased, scientifically valid guidelines through a transparent procedure that incorporates available evidence and expert opinion. A systematic literature search returned 5,937 relevant studies, from which 197 articles were retained for data extraction. A panel of 41 stakeholders with diverse expertise evaluated this evidence and drafted recommendations following the TCBS process. The panel reached consensus on 52 recommendations covering services provided by specialized epilepsy centers in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Major topic areas include epilepsy monitoring unit care, surgery, neuroimaging, neuropsychology, genetics, and outpatient care. Recommendations were informed by the evidence review and reflect the consensus of a broad panel of expert opinions.

### Contrast-induced encephalopathy-neuroimaging findings and clinical relevance [^1118x38x]. Neuroradiology (2022). Low credibility.

Contrast-induced encephalopathy (CIE) is a rare encephalopathic condition that occurs after the administration of a contrast agent. Diagnosing CIE is challenging due to the heterogeneity and non-specificity of its clinical presentation. Nevertheless, the clinical course is usually favorable, with full recovery occurring within 48–72 hours in most patients. However, comorbidity plays a significant role and can influence the clinical outcome.

The incidence of CIE is expected to be on the rise, correlating with an increase in endovascular and diagnostic imaging procedures that utilize iodinated contrast agents. It is crucial to consider CIE in the differential diagnosis when patients experience deterioration during or immediately after contrast administration, even if only a small amount of non-ionic contrast agent has been used. If CIE is deemed the most likely explanation for the clinical symptoms, it is recommended to avoid additional unnecessary contrast studies, such as angiography or perfusion CT, to prevent exacerbation of the condition.

### Multihance [^116UaL6i]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The recommended dose of Multihance is 0.2 mL/kg (0.1 mmol/kg), administered as a rapid bolus intravenous injection for MRI of the CNS in pediatric patients below 2 years of age. The recommended dosage range is 0.1 to 0.2 mL/kg. To ensure complete injection of the contrast medium, follow the injection with a saline flush of at least 5 mL in MRI of the CNS and at least 20 mL in MRA.

- **Dosing and imaging instructions**:

	- **MRI of the CNS**: In adults and in pediatric patients over 2 years of age, the recommended dose of Multihance for MRI of the CNS is 0.2 mL/kg (0.1 mmol/kg), administered as a rapid bolus intravenous injection. In pediatric patients below 2 years of age, the recommended dosage range is 0.1 to 0.2 mL/kg, administered as a rapid bolus intravenous injection. To ensure complete injection of the contrast medium, follow the injection with a saline flush of at least 5 mL. Imaging of the CNS can be performed starting immediately after the bolus injection of Multihance.

	- **MRA of renal and aorto-ilio-femoral vessels**: For MRA examination, the recommended dose is 0.2 mL/kg (0.1 mmol/kg), administered as a rapid bolus intravenous injection followed by at least 20 mL saline flush, either manually or using an automatic injector system. Start imaging immediately after the administration of Multihance, with the scan delay calculated by test bolus or automatic bolus detection technique. If an automatic contrast detection pulse sequence is not used for bolus timing, a test bolus injection of 1–2 mL of Multihance should be used to calculate the timing.

### Emergent diagnostic testing for pediatric nonfebrile seizures [^111ieiDK]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology recommend laboratory studies or computed tomography (CT) for children who experience a nonfebrile seizure if anything in their history suggests a clinically significant abnormality.

- **Objective**: To ascertain if any patient or seizure characteristics are associated with a greater likelihood that laboratory studies or CT scan will yield clinically significant results.

- **Methods**: This retrospective case series reviewed 93 children with nonfebrile seizure who were evaluated in an urban pediatric emergency department (ED) between July 2007 and June 2011.

- **Results**: Laboratory studies were performed in 87% of the study group; 7% of those tests gave clinically significant results. Computed tomographic scans were obtained in 35% of our patients; 9% showed clinically significant findings. The presence of an active seizure in the ED or a first nonfebrile seizure had an 8% and 11% difference, respectively, for clinically significant laboratory abnormality. Children younger than 2 years showed a 7% difference of clinically significant laboratory abnormality.

- **Conclusion**: This study did not identify statistically significant predictors of laboratory or CT abnormalities for children with nonfebrile seizure presenting to the ED. Age less than 2 years, having an active seizure in the ED, and experiencing a first-time seizure showed a trend toward an increased yield of laboratory testing. In accordance with the American Academy of Neurology guidelines, we conclude that the history of a child's present illness preceding the nonfebrile seizure is crucial for recommending diagnostic testing.

### Seizure-induced brain lesions: A wide spectrum of variably reversible MRI abnormalities [^113ACCgS]. European Journal of Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

MRI abnormalities in the postictal period might represent the effect of the seizure activity, rather than its structural cause. A retrospective review of clinical and neuroimaging charts of 26 patients diagnosed with seizure-related MR-signal changes was conducted. All patients underwent brain MRI (1.5-Tesla, standard pre- and post-contrast brain imaging, including DWI-ADC in 19/26) within 7 days of a seizure and at least one follow-up MRI, showing partial or complete reversibility of the MR-signal changes. An extensive clinical work-up and follow-up, ranging from 3 months to 5 years, ruled out infection or other possible causes of brain damage. Seizure-induced brain MRI abnormalities remained a diagnosis of exclusion. The site, characteristics, and reversibility of MRI changes, as well as their association with characteristics of seizures, were determined.

- **Results**: MRI showed unilateral (13/26) and bilateral abnormalities, with high (24/26) and low (2/26) T2-signal, leptomeningeal contrast-enhancement (2/26), and restricted diffusion (9/19). The location of the abnormality included cortical/subcortical areas, basal ganglia, white matter, corpus callosum, and cerebellum, with the hippocampus involved in 10 of the 26 patients. Reversibility of MRI changes was complete in 15 patients, and with residual gliosis or focal atrophy in 11 patients. Reversibility was noted between 15 and 150 days, with an average of 62 days. Partial simple and complex seizures were associated with hippocampal involvement (p = 0.015), while status epilepticus was associated with incomplete reversibility of MRI abnormalities (p = 0.041).

In conclusion, seizure or epileptic status can induce MRI changes that may be partially or completely reversible, with varying characteristics and locations depending on the nature of the seizures.

### Focal seizure and cerebral contrast retention after cardiac catheterization [^111m47Ww]. Pediatric Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Although rare, ionic and nonionic contrast-induced seizures occur as a complication of enhanced cranial computed tomography for both adults and children. However, contrast-induced seizures after cardiac catheterization have only been reported in adults. This report describes an 18-month-old male who developed a new-onset focal seizure 12 hours after cardiac catheterization. Unenhanced cranial computed tomography 1 hour after the seizure demonstrated general cerebral edema and unilateral focal cerebral contrast retention with sparing of the area supplied by the middle cerebral artery. The contrast was reabsorbed from the subarachnoid space over a 48-hour period, the cerebral edema resolved over several days, and the child returned to his baseline state 4 days after the seizure episode. This study documents the evolution of computed tomographic findings after contrast-induced seizures in a child. Contrast toxicity should be considered in any case of a new-onset neurologic deficit arising after angiography or enhanced computed tomography.

### Rapid sequence MRI protocol in the evaluation of pediatric brain attacks [^1118N4UV]. Pediatric Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

The objective of our study was to evaluate the clinical utility of rapid sequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) utilizing diffusion-weighted imaging and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences in children with acute ischemic strokes and nonstroke brain attacks.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients aged one month to 25 years for whom a pediatric stroke clinical pathway was activated. Diffusion-weighted imaging and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery were obtained followed by a complete MRI. Imaging was interpreted by a pediatric radiologist and the study neurologist. We collected information regarding patient demographics, neuroimaging results, and final diagnosis.

- **Results**: The Pediatric Stroke Clinical Pathway was activated for 59 patients, of whom 52 were included for analysis. The majority of patients were female (n = 29, 55.8%) and African American (n = 32, 61.5%), with a median age of 12 years (interquartile range 9, 16). Six patients had an ischemic stroke. Seizures, migraines, and psychosomatic disorders (each with n = 7; 13.5%) were the most common nonstroke diagnoses. Diffusion-weighted imaging was more sensitive (100% [55.0% to 100%] versus 80% [32% to 99%]) and specific (73.9% [68% to 74%] versus 37.2% [32% to 39%]) compared with fluid-attenuated inversion recovery in identification of an ischemic stroke. However, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery was useful in the identification of inflammatory and metabolic disorders.

- **Conclusion**: Rapid sequence MRI can be utilized as a screening imaging modality in children with acute ischemic strokes and nonstroke brain attacks.

### Characteristic MRI findings in hyperglycaemia-induced seizures: Diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging [^11783CBL]. Clinical Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

The aim of the study is to describe characteristic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities in hyperglycaemia-induced seizures and evaluate the diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging. Possible underlying mechanisms of this condition are also discussed.

- **Materials and methods**: Eleven patients with hyperglycaemia-induced seizures and MRI abnormalities were retrospectively studied. Clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, MRI findings, and clinical outcomes were analyzed.

- **Results**: All patients, except one, presented with focal seizures, simple or complex partial seizures, or negative motor seizures. All patients had long-standing uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. The MRI abnormalities observed acutely were focal subcortical hypointensities on T2-weighted imaging and FLAIR imaging in all patients, with overlying cortical gyral T2 hyperintensities in five of them. Focal overlying cortical or leptomeningeal enhancement on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging or contrast-enhanced FLAIR imaging was observed in all patients. Contrast-enhanced FLAIR imaging was superior to contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging for detecting characteristic cortical or leptomeningeal enhancement. Diffusion-weighted imaging showed mildly restricted diffusion in four out of five patients with cortical gyral T2 hyperintensity. In nine patients, the lesions were localized in the parietal or parieto-occipital lobes. The other two patients showed localized precentral gyral lesions. After treatment, the neurological symptoms, including the seizures, improved in all patients.

The basic concept of neuroimaging in childhood epilepsy is centered around the MRI protocol. Many pathological processes and brain lesions can lead to symptomatic epilepsy in children. However, the most common lesions causing severe epilepsy include perinatal and post-infective encephalopathy, malformations of cortical development (MCD), phacomatoses, and hippocampal sclerosis (HS). Notably, HS may coexist with other lesions such as tumors, MCDs, ischemic, or post-infectious brain damage, highlighting the important entity known as double pathology.

Computed tomography (CT) should be avoided due to the risks associated with ionizing radiation, which are even more dangerous in children than in adults. CT also lacks sensitivity and specificity in these cases and should be reserved for very rare instances where the detection of calcification is crucial for differential diagnostics (DDG) and not demonstrated by MRI.

The unique neuroimaging tool for these cases is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Proper depiction of the common abnormalities described above and the exclusion of other lesions define the special epilepsy MRI protocol. This protocol is contingent on the child's age. For example, the FLAIR sequence is particularly useful after 2 years of age when cerebral white matter has attained the adult state of myelination; however, it is rather inaccurate earlier. The 3D gradient echo (GRE) T1-weighted sequence is an important tool, yet a T2-weighted sequence with thin slices and high resolution may better delineate small MCDs before myelination is complete.

- **Protocol under 2 years**: Axial turbo spin echo or fast spin echo T2-weighted sequence with high resolution (HR) and thin slices for an overview of the brain's structure.

### The Australian diagnostic criteria for contrast-induced encephalopathy [^111wVF19]. Neuroradiology (2025). High credibility.

Contrast-induced encephalopathy (CIE) is a recognized complication of contrast administration; however, diagnosis remains challenging due to its symptom overlap with other neurological conditions and the absence of formal diagnostic criteria.

- **Methods**: A modified Delphi study was performed. Consultant physicians with active clinical experience with CIE patients were invited from neurovascular centers in Australia. Initial diagnostic items were derived from an extensive literature review and analysis of local institutional cases across Australia. Three Delphi rounds were conducted. Consensus was defined as ≥ 75% agreement.

- **Results**: Seventeen neurovascular specialists from nine neurovascular centers participated (81.0% response rate) between May 2024 and July 2024. In round 1, 15 diagnostic items were presented to participants, which were revised and one additional criterion suggested. In round 2, 14 out of 16 diagnostic items achieved consensus. In round three, 14 out of 14 items achieved consensus. Ultimately, a 14-item diagnostic criterion was developed based on participant consensus. The absolute criteria exclude CIE if symptom onset is more than 24 hours after contrast administration, or if symptoms can be explained by vessel occlusion/territory ischemia, intracranial hemorrhage, epilepsy, metabolic derangement, intracranial malignancy, or head trauma. The supporting criteria indicate that CIE is more probable if symptoms are reversible, correspond with the distribution of contrast administration, or are associated with reversible contrast staining, cerebral edema, or cortical changes.

### Value of ultra-high field MRI in patients with suspected focal epilepsy and negative 3 T MRI (EpiUltraStudy): Protocol for a prospective, longitudinal therapeutic study [^115B8SMY]. Neuroradiology (2022). High credibility.

Resective epilepsy surgery is a well-established, evidence-based treatment option in patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. A major predictive factor of a good surgical outcome is the visualization and delineation of a potential epileptogenic lesion by MRI. However, frequently, these lesions are subtle and may escape detection by conventional MRI (≤ 3 T).

We present the EpiUltraStudy protocol to address the hypothesis that the application of ultra-high field (UHF) MRI increases the rate of detection of structural lesions and functional brain aberrances in patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy who are candidates for resective epilepsy surgery. Additionally, therapeutic gain will be addressed, testing whether increased lesion detection and tailored resections result in higher rates of seizure freedom one year after epilepsy surgery. Sixty patients will enroll in the study according to the following inclusion criteria: aged ≥ 12 years, diagnosed with drug-resistant focal epilepsy with a suspected epileptogenic focus, and negative conventional 3 T MRI during the pre-surgical work-up.

All patients will be evaluated by 7 T MRI. Ten patients will undergo an additional 9.4 T MRI exam. Images will be evaluated independently by two neuroradiologists and a neurologist or neurosurgeon. Clinical and UHF MRI findings will be discussed in the multidisciplinary epilepsy surgery conference. Demographic and epilepsy characteristics, along with postoperative seizure outcomes and histopathological evaluations, will be recorded.

### Neurological update: structural and functional imaging in epilepsy surgery [^1111eQZ7]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Low credibility.

Structural brain imaging:

- **Computed tomography (CT)**: In an emergency setting, when a patient has new onset seizures, a non-contrast CT of the head is appropriate to diagnose or rapidly exclude several life-threatening conditions such as an epidural haematoma or subarachnoid haemorrhage. MRI is more time-consuming and, therefore, less appropriate for these pathologies in the acute setting. In refractory epilepsy, CT scans can also be useful to identify calcifications associated with disorders such as neurocysticercosis, or to detect bone abnormalities related to temporal encephalocoeles, which are less well characterized on MRI. Even when an emergency department CT head scan is normal, an outpatient MRI head scan is required to clarify whether there is any underlying structural lesion that will predispose the person to further seizures in the future.

- **Structural MRI**: The presurgical workup of refractory epilepsy patients begins with structural imaging using MRI. This modality is more sensitive, more specific, and has a higher spatial resolution than CT for subtle structural abnormalities. MRI can be used to acquire several different sequences. The optimal epilepsy surgery protocol includes axial and coronal slices of volumetric T1-weighted sequences for improved grey-white matter differentiation and detection of cortical thickness and malformations of cortical development. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences are sensitive to pathologies such as hippocampal sclerosis (HS), focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), tumors, inflammation, and scars. Quantification of hippocampal changes can also be assessed.

- **Increased risk of seizures with intrathecal procedures**: Focal and generalized motor seizures have been reported after intrathecal use of iodinated contrast agents. In several of the cases, higher than recommended doses were administered.

Use of medications that may lower the seizure threshold (phenothiazine derivatives, including those used for their antihistaminic properties; tricyclic antidepressants; MAO inhibitors; CNS stimulants; analeptics; antipsychotic agents) should be carefully evaluated. Consider discontinuing these agents at least 48 hours before and for at least 24 hours following intrathecal administration of Omnipaque.

### Imaging of the epilepsies [^112WrNVX]. European Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Imaging of epilepsy patients is challenging since epileptogenic lesions, defined as structural lesions causally related to the epilepsy syndrome, may be small and often do not change during life. Prior clinical information about the epilepsy syndrome and the semiology of the seizures is needed to plan the examination properly. The effort to detect an epileptogenic lesion is directed toward partial (focal) epilepsy syndromes, whereas — by definition — no lesion is identified in idiopathic epilepsies.

Most patients with partial epilepsies suffer from mesial temporal lobe epilepsies. In these patients, 2- to 3-mm thick T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) fast spin echo slices along or perpendicular to the temporal lobe length axis have the highest diagnostic efficacy. In contrast, in patients with extratemporal lobe epilepsies, perpendicular FLAIR slices through the anatomic region, from which, due to clinical and EEG criteria, the seizures are likely to originate, are preferred.

The imaging features of common epileptogenic lesions, including hippocampal sclerosis, long-term epilepsy-associated tumors, focal cortical dysplasias, vascular malformations, encephalitis (including limbic and Rasmussen's encephalitis), and gyral scarring (including ulegyria), are detailed in the second section of this paper.

### Neurodiagnostic evaluation of the child with a simple febrile seizure [^1115Aha8]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

To formulate evidence-based recommendations for health care professionals about the diagnosis and evaluation of a simple febrile seizure in infants and young children 6 through 60 months of age and to revise the practice guideline published by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in 1996, a comprehensive approach was taken.

This review included the search and analysis of the medical literature published since the last version of the guideline. Physicians with expertise and experience in the fields of neurology and epilepsy, pediatrics, epidemiology, and research methodologies constituted a subcommittee of the AAP Steering Committee on Quality Improvement and Management. The steering committee and other groups within the AAP, as well as organizations outside the AAP, reviewed the guideline. The subcommittee member who reviewed the literature for the 1996 AAP practice guidelines searched for articles published since the last guideline through 2009, supplemented by articles submitted by other committee members. Results from the literature search were provided to the subcommittee members for review.

Interventions of direct interest included lumbar puncture, electroencephalography, blood studies, and neuroimaging. Multiple issues were raised and discussed iteratively until consensus was reached about the recommendations. The strength of evidence supporting each recommendation and the strength of the recommendation were assessed by the committee member most experienced in informatics and epidemiology, and graded according to AAP policy.

### Contrast-induced encephalopathy-neuroimaging findings and clinical relevance [^117QKfDR]. Neuroradiology (2022). Low credibility.

Contrast-induced encephalopathy (CIE) is a rare encephalopathic condition that occurs after the administration of a contrast agent. The diagnosis of CIE is challenging due to the heterogeneity and non-specificity of its clinical presentation. Despite these challenges, the clinical course is usually favorable, with full recovery occurring within 48–72 hours in most patients. Comorbidities can be significant and contribute to the clinical outcome.

The incidence of CIE is currently expected to be increasing due to a rise in endovascular and diagnostic imaging procedures that use iodinated contrast. It is important to include CIE in the differential diagnosis when patients deteriorate during or immediately after contrast administration, even when only a small amount of non-ionic contrast agent is used.

When CIE is considered the most likely explanation for the clinical symptoms, it is advised to refrain from unnecessary additional contrast studies, such as angiography or perfusion CT.

### Value of ultra-high field MRI in patients with suspected focal epilepsy and negative 3 T MRI (EpiUltraStudy): protocol for a prospective, longitudinal therapeutic study [^111S31fh]. Neuroradiology (2022). Low credibility.

About 30–40% of patients with epilepsy are drug-resistant, with higher rates noted in children. Resective epilepsy surgery is a well-established, evidence-based treatment option for 10–50% of drug-resistant patients, depending on the underlying etiology. A major predictive factor for a good surgical outcome, such as seizure freedom, is the detection of a potential epileptogenic lesion or zone on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Approximately 30% of adult and pediatric patients with focal epilepsy have no identifiable potential epileptogenic lesion on MRI, termed "MRI-negative". Consequently, many MRI-negative drug-resistant patients are not eligible for resective surgery, which leads to a continuation of disease burden and a lower quality of life.

Recent developments in the field of non-invasive preoperative examinations, like high-density electroencephalography (EEG), EEG-functional MRI (fMRI), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and ultra-high field (UHF) MRI, have improved localization of the epileptogenic zone. This progress has made surgical treatment possible for patients who were previously not considered candidates for epilepsy surgery. The detection rate of potential epileptogenic lesions on MRI is significantly dependent on technical factors, such as magnetic field strength (in tesla, T), the use of phased array head coils, and image post-processing and analyses. Currently, the clinical state-of-the-art imaging for lesion detection in epilepsy includes a 3-T MRI dedicated epilepsy protocol.

### European recommendations on practices in pediatric neuroradiology: Consensus document from the European Society of Neuroradiology (ESNR), European Society of Paediatric Radiology (ESPR) and European Union of Medical Specialists Division of Neuroradiology (UEMS) [^115BUnzE]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). High credibility.

A wide spectrum of imaging techniques is available for pediatric neuroradiology studies, including ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), conventional radiography, and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The choice of the optimal imaging technique depends on several factors, such as age, degree of cooperation, clinical conditions, indications, and available facilities.

Radiation protection comprises the principles of justification (i.e. a radiologic study should be performed only when the required relevant information cannot be obtained from existing charts or studies and should result in a net benefit to the patient) and optimization (the lowest possible radiation dose to obtain the relevant information should be administered). Since safety issues and radioprotection concerns are of the utmost importance in children, the choice of the imaging technique should, whenever feasible, favor modalities that do not use ionizing radiation (such as US and MRI) over those that do (such as radiographs and CT). Whenever ionizing radiation is used, the ALARA principle ("as low as reasonably achievable") should always be applied.

In fetuses, newborns, and infants, and until the fontanelles are closed, US of the brain coupled with color Doppler is the first-line imaging modality (except for trauma), followed by MRI when necessary. For trauma, CT is the method of choice. For the neonatal spinal canal, US is also the first-line examination offering not only morphological information but also real-time feedback.

### Autoimmune encephalitis: What the radiologist needs to know [^113H2ZHa]. Neuroradiology (2024). High credibility.

When clinical history and neurological and electrophysiologic (i.e. EEG) examination evoke suspicion of autoimmune encephalitis (AE), an extensive workup is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and exclude other pathological entities as reported in the previous chapters. Neuroimaging plays an important role in the workup. Brain CT is frequently the first imaging modality used, particularly with subacute presentations when patients are admitted to the ER. It must be stressed that CT is not sensitive for identifying brain abnormalities in AE, and MRI should always be acquired whenever possible. In fact, brain MRI is key in identifying brain abnormalities in AE and characterizing the anatomical pattern of involvement (i.e. limbic or extra-limbic). It is worth noting that in the acute phase, patients can be uncooperative, and MRI under sedation may be required.

MRI should be acquired with and without gadolinium-based contrast agents. The acquisition protocol should ideally include high-resolution 3D-T1, T2-FLAIR, TSE T2, DWI, SWI, and post-contrast T1. 3D T1-weighted images provide more anatomical detail to identify enhancing areas and are also helpful to monitor atrophic changes over time. 3D turbo spin-echo (TSE) is superior to 3D inversion-recovery gradient-recalled echo (IR-GRE) in identifying small foci of contrast-enhancement (higher lesion conspicuity), as proven in brain metastasis studies. If IR-GRE is used, it may be advisable to also obtain additional 2D spin-echo T1 images after contrast.

When conducting diagnostic investigations for a first seizure in adults, particularly during the initial assessment, the AAFP 2022 guidelines recommend evaluating the patient's history for medication or substance use. Such use can provoke seizures through normal use, withdrawal, overdose, drug-drug interaction, or impaired metabolism due to comorbidities.
