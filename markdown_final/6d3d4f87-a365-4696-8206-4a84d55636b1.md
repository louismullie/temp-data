## Question

what alternatives can we use to aid in delerium and sleep for older adults

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about alternatives to help manage delirium and improve sleep in older adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the target population and settings to scope the recommendation space. Then, I should verify the hierarchy of evidence and guideline concordance. Next, I will examine non-pharmacological, multicomponent delirium bundles and sleep-focused behavioral and environmental strategies. After that, I need to appraise pharmacologic options, emphasizing risks and when, if ever, they are justified. Finally, I will tailor suggestions by ICU, postoperative, general ward, and long-term care contexts and confirm monitoring and implementation considerations [^114rXdWh] [^116ECGtU] [^112kweSC] [^1119LTCD].

> Let me first confirm scope and evidence hierarchy so I don't overstate any single study's findings. Older adults in acute and long-term care experience both delirium and sleep disruption, and high-credibility guidance consistently prioritizes non-pharmacological, multicomponent prevention and management strategies, with pharmacologic measures reserved for specific indications or safety threats; limitations across trials include small samples, heterogeneity, and risk of bias, so I should weigh guideline syntheses (AAFP 2023, SIGN 2019, SCCM 2018/2025, APA 2025, Cochrane) over isolated trials, keeping those methodological caveats in mind [^114rXdWh] [^116qowXL] [^116ECGtU] [^112kweSC] [^1119LTCD] [^114Vg6dU] [^113HYmvi].

> I will now examine multicomponent non-pharmacological delirium bundles because these repeatedly show benefit and also tend to improve sleep; the Hospital Elder Life Program and ICU Liberation ABCDEF bundle reduce delirium incidence by roughly one-third to one-half in meta-analyses and guideline summaries, with core components including orientation, sensory optimization, early mobilization, pain control, hydration/nutrition, sleep hygiene, and family engagement, so I should confirm those elements are implemented reliably before turning to medications [^114rXdWh] [^111RGXB3] [^111riBNY] [^112XBQmC] [^116JQaJs] [^116ECGtU] [^115vYGeR] [^116qowXL].

> Next, I should review sleep-specific environmental strategies; earplugs and eye masks, designated quiet times, and noise/light reduction are low-risk steps with evidence of improved sleep and possible lower delirium risk, although several studies have high bias risk, so I need to set expectations accordingly; still, both SIGN and SCCM endorse sleep-promotion measures such as earplugs and nocturnal light/noise minimization, and an ICU design pilot with dynamic lighting showed delirium and melatonin rhythm benefits, though I must acknowledge its observational nature [^117E1jTo] [^117GHy7u] [^116ECGtU] [^115zRLET].

> Wait, let me verify one intuitive but controversial approach: bright light therapy; although circadian-entrainment logic suggests benefit, SCCM 2018 recommends against bright light therapy for delirium reduction and a meta-analysis found no significant effect on delirium in ICU settings, so I should not routinely recommend bright light for delirium prevention despite broader circadian benefits described in older adult sleep literature [^1135zand] [^113HYmvi] [^116Maifn].

> I need to check behavioral therapies that directly target sleep quality without adding medication risk; CBT-I reliably improves sleep outcomes in older adults, and mindfulness-based interventions also reduce sleep disturbance and daytime impairment, so these should be prioritized where feasible, including adapted delivery in hospital or post-acute settings; evidence in long-term care and dementia populations favors non-pharmacological sleep strategies, though trial heterogeneity necessitates individualized implementation and monitoring [^113KrdJL] [^117UAEAq] [^117NTnch] [^1152rbXk] [^116yQhoC].

> Hold on, I should verify pharmacologic strategies in the ICU where sedation choice intersects with delirium and sleep; benzodiazepines increase delirium risk and should be avoided for routine sedation, while dexmedetomidine probably reduces delirium compared with placebo and benzodiazepines and is favored when delirium reduction and light sedation are priorities, which aligns with SCCM 2025 recommendations; I need to emphasize that pharmacologic prevention of delirium per se is generally unsupported, and agents should be used to meet clear indications with close monitoring [^114MhgKe] [^112kweSC] [^115vYGeR].

> Now, let me consider melatonin and ramelteon, because this is an area where I could easily overgeneralize; the APA 2025 guidelines advise avoiding melatonin/ramelteon for delirium prevention and treatment, yet SCCM 2025 suggests considering melatonin for sleep in ICU patients, and a multicenter RCT reported improved perceived sleep quality with 10 mg melatonin without clear delirium reduction; some perioperative meta-analyses suggest lower delirium incidence, but heterogeneity and bias temper confidence, and a large retrospective cohort showed no delirium advantage for melatonin receptor agonists over zolpidem or temazepam postoperatively, so my clinical interpretation is to reserve melatonin for sleep enhancement rather than delirium prophylaxis, documenting goals and reassessing benefit [^1119LTCD] [^113Z3nxD] [^111wS3mz] [^1144qJVN] [^115jHgrc] [^112639Qh] [^115r1GTv] [^1138PUgR] [^114AaYkU] [^116rQ4fg].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should also clarify agents to avoid or limit; beyond eschewing benzodiazepines, antipsychotics should not be used for prevention and are reserved only for short-term control of severe hyperactive symptoms endangering safety, propofol should not be used with the intent to improve sleep, and physical restraints should be avoided except for imminent risk with frequent reassessment to minimize harm and bias in application [^115vYGeR] [^114iXZXL] [^113inEu8].

> I will now tailor by setting because translation matters; in the ICU, I should ensure ABCDEF implementation, minimize nighttime disruptions with earplugs and light reduction, promote early mobilization and family engagement, choose dexmedetomidine when sedation is necessary and delirium reduction is prioritized, and consider melatonin solely for sleep with clear documentation of intent; postoperatively, I should apply HELP principles, optimize multimodal analgesia, avoid deliriogenic drugs, and mobilize early; on general medical wards, orientation aids, sensory optimization, hydration, mobility, pain control, and structured sleep promotion are foundational; in long-term care, individualized physical activity, CBT-I, and environmental optimization are central, with attention to comorbid contributors such as OSA where CPAP may improve sleep and cognition even if delirium prevention data remain limited [^116ECGtU] [^114rXdWh] [^116qowXL] [^117GHy7u] [^112kweSC] [^116NrkjG] [^116yQhoC].

> Let me first confirm how we will monitor and adapt; routine delirium screening with validated tools and severity tracking, alongside sleep assessments, allows timely adjustment of the bundle components and medications; evidence reviews emphasize heterogeneity of outcomes and underpowered studies in LTC, so I need to standardize assessments and prioritize patient-centered endpoints as recommended by delirium research roadmaps [^1126VjxV] [^113qaZuU] [^116JQaJs].

> But wait, what if implementation falters despite good plans; real-world surveys show variable adoption of non-pharmacological elements like reorientation and family involvement, so I should embed education, workflow redesign, and leadership support to sustain bundles, start with high-yield components such as sensory aids, mobilization, hydration, pain control, and sleep hygiene, and escalate to fuller programs like HELP as capacity grows [^115vYGeR] [^115vhc9z] [^114rXdWh].

> In summary, I should emphasize multicomponent, non-pharmacological strategies as first-line for both delirium and sleep in older adults, deploy sleep-focused behavioral and environmental measures, avoid benzodiazepines and prophylactic antipsychotics, use dexmedetomidine preferentially when sedation is required, and consider melatonin only for sleep support rather than delirium prevention while aligning with APA and SCCM guidance, continuously verifying effectiveness with standardized monitoring and adjusting by setting to optimize safety and outcomes [^111riBNY] [^112XBQmC] [^116ECGtU] [^112kweSC] [^1119LTCD] [^117E1jTo].

---

Non-pharmacological interventions are the first-line alternatives for delirium and sleep issues in older adults, with **multicomponent bundles** (e.g. HELP, ABCDEF) reducing delirium incidence by 30–53% and improving sleep [^116JQaJs] [^111RGXB3] [^114rXdWh] [^113Pmrgt]. **CBT-I** and mindfulness meditation improve sleep quality and reduce daytime impairment [^117NTnch] [^1152rbXk]. Environmental strategies — **noise/light reduction, earplugs/eye masks, and consistent routines** — support sleep and lower delirium risk [^116ECGtU] [^117E1jTo].

Melatonin may help sleep but is **not recommended for delirium prevention or treatment** [^1119LTCD] [^113Z3nxD]. Dexmedetomidine is **preferred over benzodiazepines** for ICU sedation when delirium reduction is prioritized [^114MhgKe]. Avoid benzodiazepines and anticholinergics due to delirium risk; use antipsychotics only for severe agitation threatening safety [^115vYGeR].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

### Multicomponent interventions

- **Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP)**: Multidisciplinary program addressing sleep hygiene, cognitive impairment, immobility, sensory impairment, and dehydration; reduces delirium incidence and improves sleep quality [^114rXdWh] [^113Pmrgt].

- **ABCDEF bundle**: ICU-focused bundle (Assess pain, Both spontaneous awakening/breathing trials, Choice of sedation, Delirium monitoring, Early mobility, Family engagement) reduces delirium and improves sleep.

- **Environmental modifications**: Noise and light reduction, earplugs, eye masks, and consistent routines improve sleep and reduce delirium [^116ECGtU] [^117E1jTo].

---

### Cognitive and behavioral interventions

- **Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)**: Effective for sleep quality, duration, and efficiency in older adults.

- **Mindfulness meditation**: Improves sleep quality and reduces daytime impairment [^117NTnch].

- **Sleep hygiene education**: Regular sleep schedules, reduced caffeine/alcohol, and bedtime routines improve sleep [^1152rbXk].

---

### Physical activity and mobility

Regular physical activity **improves sleep quality and reduces delirium risk**, while **early mobilization** reduces delirium incidence and improves sleep among hospitalized older adults [^114rXdWh].

---

## Pharmacological alternatives

### Melatonin and melatonin receptor agonists

Melatonin may improve sleep quality in older adults, but evidence for delirium prevention or treatment is mixed; the APA 2025 **recommends against melatonin or ramelteon for delirium prevention or treatment** [^1119LTCD] [^113Z3nxD]. Ramelteon likewise shows **mixed evidence for delirium prevention** and is **not recommended for delirium treatment** [^1119LTCD].

---

### Sedative alternatives

Dexmedetomidine is **preferred over benzodiazepines** for ICU sedation when delirium reduction is prioritized. Clinicians should **avoid benzodiazepines and anticholinergics** because they increase delirium risk in older adults [^115vYGeR].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Outcome** | **Multicomponent non-pharmacological bundles** | **CBT-I** | **Mindfulness meditation** | **Melatonin** | **Dexmedetomidine** |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Delirium prevention | Strong evidence | Limited evidence | Limited evidence | Mixed evidence | Moderate evidence |
| Delirium treatment | Limited evidence | Limited evidence | Limited evidence | Not recommended | Limited evidence |
| Sleep improvement | Strong evidence | Strong evidence | Moderate evidence | Moderate evidence | Limited evidence |

---

Non-pharmacological interventions are the **preferred first-line approach** for delirium and sleep disturbances in older adults, with multicomponent bundles, CBT-I, mindfulness, and environmental modifications showing benefit. Melatonin may help sleep but is **not recommended for delirium**; dexmedetomidine is **preferred over benzodiazepines** when delirium reduction is a priority.

### Non-pharmacological interventions targeting sleep quality in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1152rbXk]. Aging & Mental Health (2023). Low credibility.

This review aimed to examine the available evidence about non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) aimed at improving sleep quality in older adults without insomnia or dementia.

- **Methods**: Studies on NPIs targeting older adults' sleep were searched in the PsycInfo, PubMed, and Scopus databases, with no restriction on publication year up to September 2021. Studies on NPIs for older adults with no diagnosed sleep disorders were included, while those on pharmacological therapies and/or concerning pathological samples were excluded. The risk of bias was assessed using tools based on Joanna Briggs' criteria. The data extracted were meta-analyzed using random effects models for subgroups of NPIs.

- **Results**: Of the 1,893 records identified, 31 studies on NPIs (N = 2,224; range of mean ages: 60–78 years) were analyzed. All NPIs improved self-reported sleep quality, albeit to a different extent (physical activity: d = .97; 95% CI = .62, 1.32; psychological/psychoeducational, or NPIs that combined more than one sleep-targeting activity: d range: .21 to .97). Only the NPIs based on physical activity improved objectively-measured sleep, d = .31 (.04, .57). The methodological quality of most studies was limited. The most often used NPIs targeting sleep rely on physical activity and sensory stimulation, with promising results on sleep quality for the former. More data are needed on psychological/psychoeducational NPIs and combined interventions in order to test their effectiveness. The methodological weaknesses of the available studies suggest that their findings should be interpreted cautiously.

### Pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to prevent delirium in critically ill patients: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114MhgKe]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

To compare the effects of prevention interventions on delirium occurrence in critically ill adults, a systematic review and network meta-analysis was conducted. Sources such as MEDLINE, Embase, PsychINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Prospero, and the WHO international clinical trial registry were searched from inception to April 8, 2021. Randomized controlled trials investigating pharmacological, sedation, non-pharmacological, and multi-component interventions in adult critically ill patients were considered.

Conventional pairwise meta-analyses and network meta-analyses (NMA) using Bayesian random effects modeling were performed. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve values and mean rank were determined. Reviewer pairs independently extracted data, assessed bias with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and evaluated evidence certainty using GRADE. The primary outcome was delirium occurrence, while secondary outcomes included the duration of delirium and mechanical ventilation, length of stay, mortality, and adverse effects.

Eighty trials met the eligibility criteria, comprising 67.5% pharmacological, 31.3% non-pharmacological, and 1.2% mixed interventions. In the evidence network concerning delirium occurrence, 11 pharmacological interventions (across 38 trials, N = 11,993) were identified. Compared to placebo, dexmedetomidine was found to probably reduce delirium occurrence (odds ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% Credible Interval (CrI) 0.21–0.85; moderate certainty). Compared to benzodiazepines, dexmedetomidine (OR 0.21, 95% CrI 0.08–0.51; low certainty) and sedation interruption (OR 0.21, 95% CrI 0.06–0.69; very low certainty) appeared to be more effective.

### The efficacy of earplugs as a sleep hygiene strategy for reducing delirium in the ICU: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117E1jTo]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to assess the efficacy of earplugs as an ICU strategy for reducing delirium.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched using the terms "intensive care", "critical care", "earplugs", "sleep", "sleep disorders", and "delirium".

- **Study selection**: Intervention studies (randomized or non-randomized) assessing the efficacy of earplugs as a sleep hygiene strategy in patients admitted to a critical care environment were included. Studies were excluded if they included only healthy volunteers, did not report any outcomes of interest, did not contain an intervention group of interest, were crossover studies, or were only published in abstract form.

- **Data extraction**: Nine studies published between 2009 and 2015, including 1,455 participants, fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included in the systematic review. The studies included earplugs as an isolated intervention (n = 3), as part of a bundle with eye shades (n = 2), or with earplugs, eye shades, and additional noise abatement strategies (n = 4). The risk of bias was high for all studies.

- **Data synthesis**: Five studies comprising 832 participants reported incident delirium. Earplug placement was associated with a relative risk of delirium of 0.59 (95% CI, 0.44–0.78) and no significant heterogeneity between the studies (I² = 39%; p = 0.16). Hospital mortality was reported in four studies (n = 481) and was associated with a relative risk of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.54–1.11; I² = 0%; p < 0.001). Compliance with the placement of earplugs was not reported.

### World delirium awareness and quality survey in 2023-a worldwide point prevalence study [^115vYGeR]. Age and ageing (2024). Low credibility.

Multicomponent, non-pharmacological, bundled interventions such as the ABCDEF bundle or the HELP program have repeatedly demonstrated effectiveness in the reduction or prevention of delirium. Yet, their adoption into practice is limited and often short-lived, dependent on individual champions of evidence. Pain management, mobilization, and adequate fluids were the top three reported non-pharmacological interventions to manage delirium. These are essential components of multicomponent, non-pharmacological, bundled interventions. It is revealing that other essential components, such as re-orientation, were reported less than 75% of the time. This finding informs future projects and studies implementing delirium prevention interventions into routine clinical practice. Existing resources and learnings from previous implementation studies could further the chances of successful practice change.

Use of pharmacologics to prevent delirium is not supported by evidence, specifically benzodiazepines, haloperidol, or quetiapine. Several studies have shown that benzodiazepines increase the risk of delirium, and their use to sedate or treat agitation should be avoided. A study in a palliative care population reported increased delirium symptom profiles in the intention-to-treat arms for haloperidol and risperidone. For pharmacological management, both haloperidol and quetiapine are recommended in some guidelines for the reduction of hyperactive delirium symptoms (i.e. agitation) to maintain patient safety. Other guidelines, such as the Australian Clinical Standards, strongly recommend the avoidance of these medications when not necessary.

### Mindfulness meditation and improvement in sleep quality and daytime impairment among older adults with sleep disturbances: A randomized clinical trial [^117NTnch]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2015). High credibility.

Sleep disturbances are most prevalent among older adults and often go untreated, highlighting the need for community-accessible programs that can improve sleep. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of a mind-body medicine intervention, called mindfulness meditation, to promote sleep quality in older adults with moderate sleep disturbances.

The research was designed as a randomized clinical trial with two parallel groups, conducted from January 1 to December 31, 2012, at a medical research center. The participants were an older adult sample with a mean (SD) age of 66.3 (7.4) years, all experiencing moderate sleep disturbances, as indicated by a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of greater than 5.

Participants were randomized to receive either a standardized mindful awareness practices (MAPs) intervention (n = 24) or a sleep hygiene education (SHE) intervention (n = 25). Both interventions lasted six weeks, with sessions lasting two hours per week and included assigned homework.

The study was powered to detect between-group differences in sleep disturbance, measured via the PSQI at post-intervention. Secondary outcomes related to sleep-related daytime impairment were also assessed. These included validated measures of insomnia symptoms, depression, anxiety, stress, fatigue, and inflammatory signaling via nuclear factor (NF)-κB.

Results from an intent-to-treat analysis indicated that participants in the MAPs group showed significant improvement compared to those in the SHE group on the PSQI. With the MAPs intervention, the mean (SD) PSQI scores were 10.2 (1.7) at baseline and 7.4 (1.9) at post-intervention.

### Effectiveness of multicomponent nonpharmacological delirium interventions: a meta-analysis [^111RGXB3]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Delirium, an acute disorder with high morbidity and mortality, is often preventable through multicomponent nonpharmacological strategies. The efficacy of these strategies for preventing subsequent adverse outcomes has been limited to small studies at the time of writing.

To evaluate the available evidence on multicomponent nonpharmacological delirium interventions, this study focuses on reducing incident delirium and preventing poor outcomes associated with delirium. Data were sourced from PubMed, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, covering the period from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2013.

- **Study selection**: Studies examining the outcomes of delirium incidence, falls, length of stay, rate of discharge to a long-term care institution (institutionalization), and changes in functional or cognitive status were included.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Two experienced physician reviewers independently and blindly abstracted data on outcome measures using a standardized approach. The reviewers conducted quality ratings based on the Cochrane risk-of-bias criteria for each study.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: We identified 14 interventional studies. The results for outcomes of delirium incidence, falls, length of stay, and institutionalization were pooled for the meta-analysis; however, heterogeneity limited our meta-analysis of the results for changes in functional or cognitive status. Overall, 11 studies demonstrated significant reductions in delirium incidence (odds ratio [OR], 0.47; 95% CI, 0.38–0.58). Four randomized or matched trials reduced delirium incidence by 44% (OR).

### A roadmap to advance delirium research: Recommendations from the NIDUS scientific think tank [^116JQaJs]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2020). Low credibility.

Given the complex, heterogeneous, and multifactorial causation of delirium, it is not surprising that single drug or non-pharmacologic intervention strategies have not demonstrated effectiveness for delirium prevention or treatment. Multicomponent, non-pharmacologic strategies, such as the Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP, hospitalelderlifeprogram.org) or the ICU Liberation ABCDEF bundle, have demonstrated at least partial effectiveness, with more than 50% reduction in delirium across multiple studies. These strategies should be further evaluated to determine minimum elements, doses required, and optimal implementation strategies.

Novel approaches worth evaluating include new non-pharmacologic strategies, with recent examples including prehabilitation prior to elective surgery and the use of decision-support technology to facilitate management. Regarding pharmacologic approaches, further evaluation of intriguing drugs should be advanced, including dexmedetomidine, caffeine, acetaminophen, melatonin and agonists, and other sleep enhancement approaches.

Future treatment targets will arise from pathophysiological research, and it is likely that treatments will need to be multicomponent. An evidence-based, multicomponent bundle that encompasses both non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions targeted to proven risk factors and pathophysiologic pathways should be considered. The consideration of sequential approaches targeting multiple biologic targets is also recommended.

### Can we improve delirium prevention and treatment in the emergency department? A systematic review [^116rQ4fg]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Low credibility.

- **Pharmacological**: Al-Alma et al. examined the impact of melatonin compared to placebo on the prevention of delirium among older adults admitted to the internal medicine unit from the emergency department. They provided patients with 0.5 mg melatonin at night and found that delirium was prevented with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 6. Notably, two patients (2/72 = 2.8%) who received melatonin reported side effects, specifically nightmares. However, the overall risk of bias was high.

- **Negative study**: Schrijver et al. evaluated the use of haloperidol compared to placebo for the prevention of delirium among high-risk older adults (age ≥ 70) hospitalized from the emergency department. They identified a high-risk population using the Veiligheidsmanagementsysteem (VMS) delirium risk assessment tool and randomized them to receive 1 mg prophylactic haloperidol or placebo. The study did not reach the target sample size, and the results did not show any significant reduction in incident delirium.

### Non-pharmacological interventions for sleep disturbances in people with dementia [^116yQhoC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Sleep disturbances occur frequently in people with dementia, with a reported prevalence of up to 40%. Common problems include an increased number and duration of awakenings and a higher percentage of light sleep. These disturbances are associated with several issues for individuals with dementia, their relatives, and carers. In those with dementia, sleep disturbances may lead to worsening cognitive symptoms and challenging behaviors such as restlessness or wandering. There are additional potential harms, such as accidental falls. Moreover, sleep disturbances contribute significantly to carer distress and have been reported as a factor leading to institutionalization of people with dementia. As pharmacological approaches have shown unsatisfactory results, there is a need to synthesize research evidence on non-pharmacological strategies to improve sleep in people with dementia. Interventions are often complex, consisting of multiple active components implemented in complex contexts, which makes identifying effective intervention components challenging.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of non-pharmacological interventions on sleep disturbances in people with dementia compared to usual care, no treatment, any other non-pharmacological intervention, or any drug treatment intended to improve sleep, and to describe the components and processes of any complex intervention included.

- **Search methods**: We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search was conducted on 13 January 2022.

### Delirium in older persons: Advances in diagnosis and treatment [^1126VjxV]. JAMA (2017). Low credibility.

Delirium is defined as an acute disorder of attention and cognition. It is a common, serious, and often fatal condition among older patients. Although often underrecognized, delirium has serious adverse effects on the individual's function and quality of life, as well as broad societal effects with substantial health care costs.

The objective of this research was to summarize the state of the art in diagnosis and treatment of delirium and to highlight critical areas for future research to advance the field.

The evidence review involved a search of Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for the past 6 years, from January 1, 2011, until March 16, 2017, using a combination of controlled vocabulary and keyword terms. Since delirium is more prevalent in older adults, the focus was on studies in elderly populations; studies based solely in the intensive care unit (ICU) and non-English-language articles were excluded.

Of 127 articles included, 25 were clinical trials, 42 cohort studies, 5 systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and 55 were other categories. A total of 11,616 patients were represented in the treatment studies. Advances in diagnosis have included the development of brief screening tools with high sensitivity and specificity, such as the 3-Minute Diagnostic Assessment, 4 A's Test, and proxy-based measures such as the Family Confusion Assessment Method. Measures of severity, such as the Confusion Assessment Method-Severity Score, can aid in monitoring response to treatment, risk stratification, and assessing prognosis. Nonpharmacologic approaches focused on risk factors and mitigation strategies continue to evolve.

### Low-dose melatonin for prevention of delirium in critically ill patients: A multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled feasibility trial [^111fgcjX]. Chest (2025). Low credibility.

Delirium is a common and serious syndrome of acute brain dysfunction associated with negative outcomes. Melatonin may have a role in delirium prevention for critically ill adults based on data from noncritically ill patient populations. Our objective was to assess the feasibility of a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial testing the hypothesis that low-dose melatonin prevents delirium in adults who are critically ill.

- **Research question**: Does low-dose melatonin prevent delirium in critically ill adults?

- **Study design and methods**: We conducted this 3-arm feasibility trial in 3 tertiary academic ICUs. Included participants were ≥ 18 years of age, confirmed free of delirium at enrollment, and anticipated to require a > 48-hour ICU stay. We randomized participants to nightly melatonin 0.5 mg, 2 mg, or placebo. Feasibility outcomes were protocol adherence and recruitment rates. Our primary feasibility target was ≥ 85% (± 5% margin of error) of drug doses administered as per protocol. Secondary objectives were to explore adverse drug effects, melatonin pharmacokinetics, and clinical outcomes.

- **Results**: We screened 2,259 patients and excluded 1,863 patients (82.5%), resulting in 396 eligible patients, of whom 71 provided consent, for a recruitment rate of 0.8 patients/mo/site. The median age was 60.5 years (interquartile range [IQR], 48–67 years), and the median admission Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was 7 (IQR, 3–10). Percentage drug administration protocol adherence per patient was a median of 100% (IQR, 92.3%-100%) or a mean of 88.7% (SD, 24.4%).

### SIGN 157: Risk reduction and management of delirium [^116qowXL]. SIGN (2019). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for ICU delirium, specifically with respect to nonpharmacological prevention, SIGN 2019 guidelines recommend considering the inclusion of the following components as part of the care for patients at risk of delirium:

- **Orientation and sensory aids**: Ensuring patients have their glasses and hearing aids.

- **Sleep hygiene**: Promoting good sleep practices.

- **Early mobilization**

- **Pain control**

- **Postoperative care**: Prevention, early identification, and treatment of postoperative complications.

- **Hydration and nutrition**: Maintaining optimal hydration and nutrition.

- **Bladder and bowel regulation**: Regulation of bladder and bowel function.

- **Supplementary oxygen**: Providing supplementary oxygen if appropriate.

### Melatonin for the prevention of postoperative delirium in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112639Qh]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). High credibility.

Delirium is characterized by an acute disturbance in attention with an altered level of consciousness or disorganized thinking that is not better explained by a pre-existing neurocognitive or medical condition, substance intoxication or withdrawal, or medication side effect. Patients who develop delirium in the hospital are at a significantly greater risk of other negative outcomes, including the development of dementia, institutionalization, and one-year mortality. One study in post-operative cardiac patients suggested that reduced cognition as a result of post-operative delirium had still not fully recovered, even a year following surgery.

While the incidence of delirium in the hospitalized, general medicine population is estimated to be 11–14%, older adults and post-surgical patients are at much greater risk, with an estimated incidence of 20–29% in geriatric medicine patients and 11–51% in surgical patients. Additionally, approximately 56% of hospitalized patients with a history of dementia will develop delirium.

Melatonin is a natural hormone produced by the pineal gland in the brain and is known to be involved in sleep-wake cycle regulation. It has been studied for a variety of uses, including but not limited to insomnia, jet lag, circadian rhythm disorders in the blind, shift work, and more recently, delirium prevention. Recent studies suggest that preoperative cerebrospinal fluid melatonin concentrations may be correlated with delirium risk following hip fracture surgery and that melatonin secretion rapidly declines with age.

### The American Psychiatric Association practice guideline for the prevention and treatment of delirium [^113inEu8]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for ICU delirium, specifically concerning physical restraints, the APA 2025 guidelines recommend avoiding the use of physical restraints in patients with delirium. This should only occur when there is an imminent risk of injury to the patient or others. They emphasize reviewing factors that may contribute to racial, ethnic, and other biases in decisions about restraint use. Additionally, the guidelines call for frequent monitoring and repeated reassessment of the ongoing risks and benefits of restraint use compared to less restrictive interventions.

### Non-pharmacological interventions for delirium in the pediatric population: A systematic review with narrative synthesis [^116gw51t]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Multicomponent non-pharmacological interventions have demonstrated positive outcomes in reducing the duration and occurrence of delirium in adult ICU and general ward settings. Similarly, non-pharmacological interventions have been attempted in the pediatric population. These include educational interventions for parents, children, and healthcare professionals, playing music and mothers' voices for children, and providing weighted blankets as an intervention. Furthermore, multicomponent interventions have been explored in children.

Given the need for a comprehensive analysis of delirium interventions in children, we aimed to summarize the effectiveness and limitations of non-pharmacological interventions for delirium in children in this systematic review. Moreover, we aimed to identify frequently measured outcome variables in non-pharmacological delirium intervention research. Herein, we present a narrative synthesis to build evidence for future delirium research in children.

### Modification in ICU design may affect delirium and circadian melatonin: A proof of concept pilot study [^115zRLET]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Nonpharmacologic delirium management is recommended by guidelines, but studies on the impact of ICU design are still limited. The study's primary purpose was to determine if a multicomponent change in room design prevents ICU delirium and assess the influence of lighting conditions on serum melatonin.

- **Design**: Prospective observational cohort pilot study.

- **Setting**: The new design concept was established in two two-bed ICU rooms of a university hospital. Besides modifications aimed at stress relief, it includes a new dynamic lighting system.

- **Patients**: Seventy-four adult critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation with an expected ICU length of stay of at least 48 hours, treated in modified or standard rooms.

- **Interventions**: None.

- **Measurements and main results**: The clinical examination included a prospective assessment for depth of sedation, delirium, and pain every 8 hours using validated scores. Blood samples for serum melatonin profiles were collected every 4 hours for a maximum of three 24-hour periods. Seventy-four patients were included in the analysis. Seventy-six percent (n = 28) of patients in the standard rooms developed delirium compared with 46% of patients (n = 17) in the modified rooms (p = 0.017). Patients in standard rooms had a 2.3-fold higher delirium severity (odds ratio = 2.292; 95% CI, 1.582–3.321; p < 0.0001). Light intensity, calculated using the measure of circadian effective irradiance, significantly influenced the course of serum melatonin (p < 0.0001).

### A focused update to the clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of pain, anxiety, agitation/sedation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption in adult patients in the ICU [^112kweSC]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for ICU delirium, particularly in relation to sedation, the SCCM 2025 guidelines recommend considering dexmedetomidine over propofol for sedation in mechanically ventilated adult patients admitted to the ICU. This approach is suggested where light sedation and/or a reduction in delirium are of the highest priorities.

### Melatonin for the prevention of postoperative delirium in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115r1GTv]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Older surgical patients are at high risk of developing postoperative delirium. Non-pharmacological strategies are recommended for delirium prevention, but no pharmacological agents have compelling evidence to decrease the incidence of delirium. The purpose of this study was to assess whether perioperative melatonin decreases the incidence of delirium in older adults undergoing surgical procedures.

- **Methods**: A systematic search using PubMed/Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and references of identified articles published in English between January 1990 and October 2017 was performed. Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts, and then extracted data following a full-text review of included articles with consensus generation and bias assessment. Studies reporting outcomes for melatonin or ramelteon use to prevent delirium in postoperative hospitalized patients (mean age ≥ 50 years) were eligible for inclusion. Data were pooled using a fixed-effects model to generate a forest plot and obtain a summary odds ratio for the outcome of interest (delirium incidence). Cochran's Q and I² values were used to investigate heterogeneity.

- **Results**: Of 335 records screened, 6 studies were selected for the qualitative analysis and 6 were included in the meta-analysis (n = 1155). The mean age of patients in included studies ranged from 59 to 84 years. Patients in intervention groups typically received melatonin or ramelteon at daily doses of two to eight milligrams around cardiothoracic, orthopedic, or hepatic surgeries for one to nine days, starting on the evening before surgery.

### Melatonin for the prevention of postoperative delirium in older adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1138PUgR]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Currently, there is a very small body of literature examining the use of melatonin for the prevention of postoperative delirium in older adults. In conjunction with clinician input, the exhaustive literature search was driven by a health sciences librarian who is highly experienced in systematic reviews. While the body of literature is small at this time, the findings of this meta-analysis suggest that perioperative melatonin administration may significantly reduce the incidence of delirium in older adults undergoing surgical procedures — a common, yet detrimental complication of surgery in this demographic.

The odds ratio was highly sensitive to the removal of one study that did not have results in favor of melatonin reducing the risk of delirium, resulting in a reduction of the odds ratio from 0.63 to 0.31, and heterogeneity to zero. One possible explanation for the negative results in this particular study may be due to discrepancies among the two study groups related to prior delirium. Although statistics were not reported for the baseline characteristics, the group receiving melatonin appeared to have a greater percentage of patients with a history of delirium (23.7% versus 17.2% in the placebo group), which is a well-established risk factor for developing delirium.

Additionally, the authors of the de Jonghe study noted an increased probability of type 2 error, as there were a large number of patients excluded post-randomization due to withdrawal of consent, delirium at admission, loss to follow-up, etc. Only 378 patient data were analyzed from an originally larger sample size.

### A systematic review of non-pharmacological interventions to improve nighttime sleep among residents of long-term care settings [^111fiXqA]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

The quality assessment of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and other quantitative studies is summarized without the aid of tables. For the 30 RCTs examined, most studies had either a low (n = 11) or unclear (n = 15) risk of selection bias. Furthermore, the majority (n = 28) exhibited a low risk of reporting bias due to clear reporting of pre-specified outcomes. Most studies also demonstrated a low risk for detection (n = 21) and attrition bias (n = 19). However, only 7 studies were considered at low risk for incomplete outcome data over periods exceeding 6 weeks because most studies only reported immediate post-intervention data. Regarding performance bias, 9 studies were at high risk due to the inability to blind participants to the intervention.

Of the 24 non-RCTs, the majority (n = 20) satisfied at least 12 of the 17 critical criteria for quality appraisal. Many studies did not describe the statistical power (n = 19), piloting of the intervention (n = 13), use valid or reliable measures (n = 8), nor did they appropriately state study conclusions (n = 13). Fewer studies disclosed the ethical considerations of the study procedures or interventions (n = 19).

### Postoperative use of sleep aids and delirium in older adults after major surgery: A retrospective cohort study [^114AaYkU]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2024). Low credibility.

Sleep aids are commonly prescribed to treat sleep disturbances, a modifiable risk factor for postoperative delirium in older patients. The use of melatonin receptor agonists in the postoperative period has been increasing. However, the comparative safety of melatonin receptor agonists, zolpidem, and temazepam remains uncertain.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study included 22,083 patients aged 65 years and older who initiated melatonin receptor agonists, zolpidem, or temazepam after major surgery in the Premier Healthcare Database from 2009 to 2018. We performed propensity score-based overlap weighting and estimated the risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) of postoperative delirium as the primary outcome, and a composite of delirium or new antipsychotic initiation, pneumonia, and in-hospital mortality as secondary outcomes.

- **Results**: The mean age of the study population was 78 years (SD, 7), and 50% were female. There was no significant difference in the risk of postoperative delirium among patients treated with melatonin receptor agonists (3.4%, reference group), zolpidem (2.9%; RR [95% CI], 0.9 [0.7–1.2]; RD [95% CI] per 100 persons, -0.3 [-1.1 to 0.6]), and temazepam (3.1%; RR [95% CI], 0.9 [0.7–1.1]; RD [95% CI] per 100 persons, -0.5 [-1.2 to 0.3]). The risks of delirium or new antipsychotic initiation, pneumonia, and in-hospital mortality were also similar among all groups.

- **Conclusions**: Melatonin receptor agonists were not associated with a lower risk of postoperative delirium and other adverse outcomes compared with zolpidem and temazepam in older adults after major surgery.

### Can we improve delirium prevention and treatment in the emergency department? A systematic review [^1128d7bQ]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). High credibility.

Delirium is a disturbance of attention, awareness, and a change in baseline cognition. It is common in the emergency department (ED), especially among older adults. Between 6% and 38% of older adults in the ED present with either incident delirium, which is the new development of delirium after arrival, or prevalent delirium, defined as those who arrive with delirium. Importantly, ED delirium is associated with increases in the length of hospital stay and mortality, and decreases in independence and cognitive function. Due to the prevalence of delirium in the ED setting and the associated morbidity and mortality, there is growing support for ED-based strategies to improve the identification, management, and prevention of delirium. Among accredited level 1 and level 2 geriatric EDs, 90% of level 1 and 40% of level 2 geriatric EDs reported having protocols for delirium screening. In addition, many have implemented strategies to decrease the incidence of delirium.

The authors previously synthesized seven Cochrane systematic reviews that summarized delirium prevention or treatment trials across various healthcare settings. Multifactorial interventions, including individualized care, an educational component, reorientation, and early mobilization, often effectively reduce the incidence of delirium in an inpatient setting. Since 2012, four Cochrane reviews have summarized pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic delirium interventions in both the hospital setting and long-term care. The generalizability of pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions to the ED setting remains a topic of continued research.

### The effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions in reducing the incidence and duration of delirium in critically ill patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113HYmvi]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

To evaluate the effect of non-pharmacological interventions versus standard care on the incidence and duration of delirium in critically ill patients, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted.

- **Methods**: Electronic and grey literature was searched for randomized clinical trials up to March 2018. Two reviewers independently screened, selected, and extracted data, and a meta-analysis was performed using random effects modeling.

- **Results**: A total of 15 trials involving 2812 participants were identified. Eleven trials reported on the incidence of delirium. Pooled data from four trials of bright light therapy showed no significant effect between groups (n = 829 participants, RR 0.45, 99% CI 0.10–2.13, P = 0.19, very low quality evidence). Seven trials of various individual interventions also failed to report any significant effects. A total of eight trials reported on the duration of delirium. Pooled data from two trials of multicomponent physical therapy showed no significant effect (n = 404 participants, MD [days] -0.65, 99% CI -2.73 to 1.44, P = 0.42, low quality of evidence). Four trials of various individual interventions also reported no significant effects. A trial of family voice reorientation showed a beneficial effect (n = 30, MD [days] -1.30, 99% CI -2.41 to -0.19, P = 0.003, very low quality evidence).

- **Conclusions**: The evidence does not support the use of non-pharmacological interventions in reducing the incidence and duration of delirium in critically ill patients. Future research should consider well-designed and well-described multicomponent interventions and include adequately defined outcome measures.

### The effects of melatonin supplementation on sleep quality and assessment of the serum melatonin in ICU patients: A randomized controlled trial [^115jHgrc]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

To evaluate whether the use of exogenous melatonin affects sleep, reduces the prevalence of delirium, and decreases the need for analgosedation and to assess whether serum melatonin indices correlate with exogenous administration in critically ill patients, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted in the multicenter ICUs of two tertiary hospitals.

A total of 203 adult patients who were admitted to the ICU and administered with analgesics and/or sedatives participated in the study. Oral melatonin (10mg) or a placebo was given for up to seven consecutive nights.

- **Measurements and main results**: The number of observed sleeping hours at night was assessed by the bedside nurse. Sleep quality was evaluated using the Richards Campbell Questionnaire Sleep (RCSQ). The prevalence of delirium, pain, anxiety, adverse reactions, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU and hospital stays, and doses of sedative and analgesic drugs administered were recorded. The use of analgesics and sedatives was assessed daily. Melatonin levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Based on the RCSQ results, sleep quality was assessed to be better in the melatonin group than in the placebo group with a mean (SD) of 69.7 (21.2) and 60.7 (26.3), respectively (p = 0.029). About 45.8% and 34.4% of participants in the melatonin and placebo groups had very good sleep (risk ratio, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.94–1.89), whereas 3.1% and 14.6% had very poor sleep (risk ratio, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.06–0.71), respectively. No significant difference was observed regarding the days.

### Sleep and delirium in adults who are critically ill: A contemporary review [^116JZvRc]. Chest (2020). Low credibility.

Sleep is important to health and well-being, and studies in healthy adults have demonstrated that sleep deprivation impacts respiratory, immune, and cognitive function. Historically, because of the nature of critical illness, sleep has not been considered a priority for patient care in the ICU. More recently, research has demonstrated that sleep is markedly abnormal in patients who are critically ill. In addition, there is often disruption of circadian rhythms.

Delirium is a syndrome of acute alteration in mental status that occurs in the setting of contributing factors such as serious illness, medication, and drug or alcohol intoxication or withdrawal. It is a frequent occurrence in critical illness, and research has demonstrated several adverse outcomes associated with delirium including persistent cognitive impairment and increased mortality.

- **Sleep deprivation and delirium symptoms**: Sleep deprivation and delirium share many common symptoms. The similarity has prompted experts to draw links between the two and question both the relationship and its direction. The inclusion of sleep disturbance in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition, in its constellation of symptoms used in diagnosing delirium has increased awareness of this link.

This paper will review the literature on sleep in critical illness and the potential mechanisms and pathways that may connect sleep and delirium.

### Can we improve delirium prevention and treatment in the emergency department? A systematic review [^117AqaNt]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Low credibility.

Non-pharmacological interventions, particularly multifactorial approaches, have shown promise in preventing delirium.

- **Positive studies**:
	- Naughton et al. evaluated a multifactorial intervention in their acute geriatric unit (AGU) compared to routine clinical care prior to the AGU's implementation. This intervention included the avoidance of antipsychotics, family support, and the addressing of medical factors. They assessed the prevalence of delirium on day 4 among older adults (age ≥ 75) admitted from the emergency department. The prevalence of delirium at baseline was compared to post-implementation, showing a decrease in incident delirium on day 4 from 41% to 19% in the AGU.

	- Björkelund et al. studied a multifactorial intervention in older patients (age ≥ 65) with hip fractures, compared to routine clinical care prior to intervention. The interventions included the use of oxygen, intravenous fluids, increased vital monitoring, pain relief, and daily screening for delirium. This intervention resulted in a reduction of incident delirium (relative risk 0.37, 95% confidence interval 0.22–0.61).

	- Sun et al. evaluated the EmpowerRing Elder Novel Interventions (ERNI) program, comparing its effects with routine care before program implementation on incident delirium in older adults admitted to the ICU, emergency department observation unit, or inpatient service. ERNI involved non-pharmacologic interactions with patients and cognitive stimulation activities, resulting in a decrease in incident delirium from 40.1% pre-intervention to 34.3% post-intervention.

	- Mok et al. also compared a multifactorial intervention with standard care to reduce incident delirium in hip fracture patients.

### Moderate dose melatonin for the abatement and treatment of delirium in elderly general medical inpatients: Study protocol of a placebo controlled, randomised, double blind trial [^113z6ZNf]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Delirium is a frequent, costly, and morbid problem. No agent has been shown to modify the natural history of the condition, and treatments have significant side effects. Prophylactic melatonin in low doses has been shown to prevent delirium from developing. This trial aims to determine the feasibility of a study to assess if melatonin at a moderate dose effectively treats the symptoms of delirium and modifies the natural history, including abating symptoms after treatment cessation.

- **Methods/design**: Elderly (≥ 70 years of age) patients admitted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with delirium, and not requiring surgery, will be identified from the practice of the investigators and through referral by other general medical unit staff. To facilitate this, other staff will be briefed on the project by investigators. Patients will be recruited with suitable informed and documented consent (person responsible) by the study investigators. They will receive orally either 5 mg melatonin (18 patients) or placebo (18 patients) nightly for 5 nights (or until discharged). During treatment, participants will be assessed by study staff using a validated scale of delirium severity (the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale) and a validated measure of delirium state (Confusion Assessment Method) to determine if melatonin decreases the severity or the duration of delirium. Assessment will continue for a further two days after treatment has ceased, to determine if the treatment causes persisting abatement of symptoms and to assess for adverse events.

Discussion on the outcomes and implications of the trial is expected to provide insight into the feasibility and potential benefits of moderate-dose melatonin for delirium treatment in elderly patients.

### Methodologic innovation in creating clinical practice guidelines: Insights from the 2018 Society of Critical Care Medicine pain, agitation/sedation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption guideline effort [^117Mytvg]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

To describe novel guideline development strategies created and implemented as part of the Society of Critical Care Medicine's 2018 clinical practice guidelines for pain, agitation (sedation), delirium, immobility (rehabilitation/mobility), and sleep (disruption) in critically ill adults, several objectives were pursued.

Thirty-two experts from five countries, along with critical illness survivors, were involved in the guideline development process from start to finish. The design of the guidelines used and expanded upon the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology for making recommendations, identified evidence gaps, and developed communication strategies to mitigate challenges. The setting included experts divided across five topic-specific sections, with four methodologists, two medical librarians, four critical illness survivors, and two Society of Critical Care Medicine support staff.

- **Interventions**: Unique approaches included the following: critical illness survivor involvement to help ensure patient-centered questions and recommendations; qualitative and semiquantitative approaches for developing descriptive statements; operationalizing a three-step approach to generating final recommendations; and systematic identification of evidence gaps.

- **Measurements and main results**: Critical illness survivors contributed significantly to prioritizing topics, questions, and outcomes, evidence interpretation, recommendation formulation, and article review to ensure that their values and preferences were considered in the guidelines. Qualitative and semiquantitative approaches supported formulating descriptive statements using comprehensive literature reviews.

### Moderate dose melatonin for the abatement and treatment of delirium in elderly general medical inpatients: Study protocol of a placebo controlled, randomised, double blind trial [^111THLkv]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

The hypothesis that melatonin might be useful for the prevention and treatment of delirium has been tested, with two trials being particularly relevant. Al-Aama et al. randomised 145 recently hospitalised participants in a medical service to melatonin 0.5 mg nocte or placebo for 14 nights or until discharge. Delirium diagnosis was assessed with the validated Confusion Assessment Method tool, and severity was measured by the validated Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS). Delirium was clinically and statistically significantly reduced in the active treatment group by approximately 61%, and by 81% when incident (pre-existing prior to enrolment) delirium was excluded, and when dementia and comorbidities were controlled for. By comparison, no medication has been shown to prevent delirium occurrence, and two trials of non-pharmacological treatments showed reductions in the order of 33%. Delirium severity (on MDAS) was not significantly different, and surrogate outcomes that would suggest efficacy in the treatment of delirium, such as length of stay, restraints, and use of sedatives, were also not significantly different.

A second trial examined melatonin 5 mg in the prevention of delirium in elderly patients undergoing hip arthroplasty and spinal anaesthesia. A total of 222 patients were randomised to standard treatment, midazolam prior to and post-surgery, or melatonin 5 mg prior to and post-surgery. Delirium was assessed based on the decline on the Abbreviated Mental Test from baseline. This methodology has been shown to be a sensitive but not specific method of delirium detection and is likely inferior to the CAM.

### Reporting of outcomes and measures in studies of interventions to prevent and/or treat delirium in older adults resident in long-term care: a systematic review [^113qaZuU]. Age and Ageing (2022). Low credibility.

To inform the development of a core outcome set, we evaluated outcomes, definitions, measures, and measurement time points in clinical trials of interventions to prevent and/or treat delirium in older adults resident in long-term care (LTC).

We searched electronic databases, systematic review repositories, and trial registries from 1980 to 10 December 2021.

We included randomized, quasi-randomized, and non-randomized intervention studies. Data were extracted on study characteristics, outcomes, and measurement features. Outcome reporting quality was assessed using the MOMENT study scoring system, and outcomes were categorized using the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials taxonomy.

We identified 18 studies recruiting 5,639 participants. All evaluated non-pharmacological interventions; most (16 studies, 89%) addressed delirium prevention. Twelve delirium-specific outcomes were identified, with a mean (SD) of 2.4 (1.5) per study. Delirium incidence (14 studies, 78%) and severity (6 studies, 33%) were the most common. We found heterogeneity in the description of outcomes and measurement time points. The Confusion Assessment Method (three versions) was the most common measure used to ascertain delirium incidence (7 of 14 studies, 50%). Twenty-five non-delirium specific outcomes were identified, with a mean (SD) of 4.0 (2.3) per study; hospital admission was the most commonly reported (9 studies, 50%).

Few studies of interventions for the prevention or treatment of delirium in older adults resident in LTC were identified, indicating the need for further research in this area.

### Environmental factors and risk of delirium in geriatric patients: An observational study [^115d8YqN]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

These associations between environmental factors and delirium are supported by studies showing that non-pharmacological, mainly environmental intervention programs, are effective in preventing delirium. Since delirium is common, has a poor prognosis, and substantial economic impact, there seems to be a large potential for both health-related and economic benefits through a focus on hospital environment and implementation of non-pharmacological delirium intervention programs. Such interventions also seem to have benefits beyond delirium prevention. In addition to a 44% reduction in delirium incidence, a meta-analysis from 2015 reports a 64% reduction in fall rates and a trend toward reduced length of stay and institutionalization rates in the intervention groups.

We found no association between ward transfers and incident delirium. A possible explanation is that all ward transfers are done in a predictable way during the daytime. Another explanation may be that the geriatric ward provides a multicomponent intervention program against delirium that may outweigh the potentially negative effect of ward transfers. If so, this effect could also have influenced the associations between the other exposure variables and incident delirium. The lack of association between time spent in the ED and incident delirium might reflect that the ED in our hospital emphasizes initial examination and short stay before transfer to a relevant ward, thereby providing less insult to vulnerable patients than the ED as described by Bo et al.

### Cognitive behavioural interventions for sleep problems in adults aged 60+ [^117UAEAq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

The prevalence of sleep problems in adulthood increases with age. While not all sleep changes are pathological in later life, severe disturbances may lead to depression, cognitive impairments, deterioration of quality of life, significant stresses for carers, and increased healthcare costs. The most common treatment for sleep disorders, particularly insomnia, is pharmacological. The efficacy of non-drug interventions has been suggested to be slower than pharmacological methods but poses no risk of drug-related tolerance or dependency. Cognitive and behavioural treatments for sleep problems aim to improve sleep by changing poor sleep habits, promoting better sleep hygiene practices, and challenging negative thoughts, attitudes, and beliefs about sleep.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy of cognitive-behavioural interventions in improving sleep quality, duration, and efficiency amongst older adults (aged 60 and above).

- **Search strategy**: The following databases were searched: MEDLINE (1966 - October 2001); EMBASE (1980 - January 2002); CINAHL (1982 - January 2002); PsychINFO (1887 to 2002); The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2002); National Research Register (NRR [2002]). Bibliographies of existing reviews in the area, as well as all trial reports obtained, were searched. Experts in the field were consulted.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials of cognitive behavioural treatments for primary insomnia where 80% or more of participants were over 60. Participants must have been screened to exclude those with dementia and/or depression.

### Non-pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised non-ICU patients [^114Vg6dU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

Delirium is an acute neuropsychological disorder that is common in hospitalised patients. It can be distressing to patients and carers and is associated with serious adverse outcomes. Treatment options for established delirium are limited, making the prevention of delirium desirable. Non-pharmacological interventions are considered important in delirium prevention.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions designed to prevent delirium in hospitalised patients outside intensive care units (ICU).

We searched ALOIS, the specialised register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, with additional searches conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization Portal/ICTRP up to 16 September 2020. There were no language or date restrictions applied to the electronic searches, and no methodological filters were used to restrict the search.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of single and multicomponent non-pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised adults cared for outside intensive care or high dependency settings. We only included non-pharmacological interventions which were designed and implemented to prevent delirium.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently examined the titles and abstracts identified by the search for eligibility and extracted data from full-text articles. Any disagreements on eligibility and inclusion were resolved.

### Moderate dose melatonin for the abatement and treatment of delirium in elderly general medical inpatients: Study protocol of a placebo controlled, randomised, double blind trial [^115qBD9S]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

- **Randomisation and blinding**: After enrolment, patients will be randomised into treatment groups by drawing a sealed, opaque envelope from a box containing an allocation code, randomised by an unrelated statistician. The box contains equal numbers of allocation codes to match the total number of expected participants. Once drawn, the envelope and code are discarded. Envelopes will be in permuted blocks of four (two placebo and two active). The results of this randomisation are not known to any of the investigators or intervention administration staff. A separate code interpretation sheet is kept locked in the trial pharmacy. After data collection is complete, the allocation codes will be matched to provide the requisite placebo versus intervention information.

- **Study medication and administration**: Study medication tablets appear identical and are packaged in HDPE containers of five capsules each.

### Non-pharmacological interventions for fatigue in older adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114164jG]. Age and Ageing (2020). Low credibility.

Non-pharmacological interventions are widely used to treat fatigue in clients with specific diseases; however, these findings may not be applicable to older adults experiencing fatigue, which also relates to the physiological changes of ageing. Notably, these interventions for fatigue alleviation in older adults have not been systematically reviewed and meta-analysed.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the immediate and long-term effects of non-pharmacological interventions on fatigue in community-dwelling older adults.

- **Methods**: Randomised controlled trials published from 2008 to May 2018 were searched in CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science databases. The reference lists of the publications, forward citation, and clinical trial registries were also reviewed. Relevant data were extracted, and a meta-analysis was conducted using Cochrane Review Manager 5.3.

- **Results**: Eight studies, with a total of 1,093 participants, were identified. Non-pharmacological interventions included mindfulness meditation, a behavioural lifestyle programme, muscle relaxation, pet insect-assisted therapy, yoga, Tai Chi, and cognitive behavioural therapy. These interventions elicited significant immediate positive effects on fatigue (SMD: -0.40, 95% CI -0.62 to -0.18), although there was no lasting effect. Both physical and cognitive/mental interventions effectively alleviated fatigue.

- **Conclusion**: Non-pharmacological interventions appear to be effective in alleviating fatigue at immediate post-intervention in community-dwelling older adults. More studies with robust designs are needed.

### Ocular light exposure interventions for sleep, circadian rhythms, rest-activity cycles, mood, and cognitive function in older adults: An overview of Cochrane and non-Cochrane systematic reviews [^116Maifn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

The global population is rapidly ageing, with the number of people over 60 years old projected to almost double from 12% to 22% between 2015 and 2050. Due to their predisposition to age-related pathologies, older adults are particularly vulnerable to sleep disturbances, mood disorders, and cognitive decline. These challenges are usually interconnected and can severely impact an ageing individual's daily functioning, quality of life (QoL), and health span. Addressing these challenges is essential for enhancing the well-being of older adults. Therefore, non-pharmacological interventions, including ocular light exposure interventions, have become a topic of growing academic and clinical interest as a therapeutic approach.

Over the last two decades, the importance of light for human health and well-being has become increasingly evident. Light exposure regulates circadian rhythms and sleep-wake cycles, which are crucial for maintaining overall health. In contrast, suboptimal light exposure has been linked to poor health outcomes, including mood disorders, cognitive decline, fatigue, and sleep disorders. Achieving optimal light exposure levels provides many benefits, including improved sleep quality, circadian rhythm, mood, and cognitive function.

The circadian rhythm is fundamental to nearly every cellular, physiological, and behavioural process in the human body. This makes circadian rhythms not just a peripheral concern, but central to maintaining health and preventing disease. The disruption of these daily rhythms has been implicated in various health conditions.

### Review of postoperative delirium in geriatric patients after hip fracture treatment [^1161fJ6X]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2022). Low credibility.

In 2015, the American Geriatrics Society published a best practice statement on postoperative delirium in older adults. This statement highlights three key non-pharmacologic components to prevent and treat postoperative delirium:

- **Formal education programs**: Implementing these for healthcare systems and hospitals.
- **Multicomponent non-pharmacologic interventions**: These should be implemented to prevent postoperative delirium in high-risk patients and should be overseen by an interdisciplinary team.
- **Interdisciplinary teams**: These are utilized to deliver multicomponent interventions once a patient has been diagnosed with postoperative delirium.

The statement also notes insufficient evidence regarding the use of delirium units for treatment. Multicomponent interventions, such as those listed in Table 2, target minimizing delirium risk by addressing various factors. These include minimizing time to surgery, sensory enhancements (e.g. visual aids, hearing aids), mobility enhancement, cognitive stimulation, nutritional and fluid repletion enhancement, sleep enhancement, and environmental familiarity.

Table 2. Non-Pharmacologic and Pharmacologic Approaches to Clinically Managing Post-Operative Delirium.

Non-pharmacologic interventions for prevention of delirium have been shown to reduce the incidence by 27–100%. Despite this decrease in incidence following the implementation of multicomponent interventions, one study found that other outcomes such as mortality, length of stay, functional status, and disposition remained similar in both the intervention and non-intervention groups. Other studies identified similar outcomes for those in both groups.

### Melatonin for the prevention of postoperative delirium in older adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115exWyN]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Older surgical patients are at high risk of developing postoperative delirium. Non-pharmacological strategies are recommended for delirium prevention, but no pharmacological agents have compelling evidence to decrease the incidence of delirium. The purpose of this study was to assess whether perioperative melatonin decreases the incidence of delirium in older adults undergoing surgical procedures.

- **Methods**: A systematic search using PubMed/Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and references of identified articles published in English between January 1990 and October 2017 was performed. Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts, then extracted data following a full-text review of included articles with consensus generation and bias assessment. Studies reporting outcomes for melatonin or ramelteon use to prevent delirium in postoperative hospitalized patients (mean age ≥ 50 years) were eligible for inclusion. Data were pooled using a fixed-effects model to generate a forest plot and obtain a summary odds ratio for the outcome of interest (delirium incidence). Cochran's Q and I² values were used to investigate heterogeneity.

- **Results**: Of 335 records screened, 6 studies were selected for the qualitative analysis and 6 were included in the meta-analysis (n = 1155). The mean age of patients in included studies ranged from 59 to 84 years. Patients in intervention groups typically received melatonin or ramelteon at daily doses of two to eight milligrams around cardiothoracic, orthopedic, or hepatic surgeries for one to nine days, starting on the evening.

### Cognitive behavioural interventions for sleep problems in adults aged 60+ [^113KrdJL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

The prevalence of sleep problems in adulthood increases with age. While not all sleep changes are pathological in later life, severe disturbances may lead to depression, cognitive impairments, deterioration of quality of life, significant stresses for carers, and increased healthcare costs. The most common treatment for sleep disorders, particularly insomnia, is pharmacological. The efficacy of non-drug interventions has been suggested to be slower than pharmacological methods, but they carry no risk of drug-related tolerance or dependency. Cognitive and behavioural treatments for sleep problems aim to improve sleep by changing poor sleep habits, promoting better sleep hygiene practices, and challenging negative thoughts, attitudes, and beliefs about sleep.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy of cognitive-behavioural interventions in improving sleep quality, duration, and efficiency among older adults (aged 60 and above).

- **Search strategy**: The following databases were searched: MEDLINE (1966 - October 2001), EMBASE (1980 - January 2002), CINAHL (1982 - January 2002), PsychINFO (1887 to 2002), The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2002), National Research Register (NRR [2002]). Bibliographies of existing reviews in the area, as well as all trial reports obtained, were searched. Experts in the field were consulted.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials of cognitive-behavioural treatments for primary insomnia where 80% or more of participants were over 60. Participants must have been screened to exclude those with dementia and/or depression.

### Preventing delirium: Should non-pharmacological, multicomponent interventions be used? A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature [^111riBNY]. Age and Ageing (2015). High credibility.

Delirium is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome common among elderly inpatients. It has been associated with increased mortality, longer hospital stays, cognitive and functional decline, and increased institutionalization rates. Multicomponent interventions, a series of non-pharmacological strategies frequently handled by nursing staff, might be useful for prevention.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy of multicomponent interventions in preventing incident delirium in the elderly.

- **Methods**: A systematic review of randomized trials was undertaken. Two independent reviewers performed iterative literature searches in seven databases without language restrictions. Grey literature repositories were considered as well. The quality of included trials was assessed using the criteria established by the Cochrane Collaboration. When possible, data were synthesized into a meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed using the χ2 and I2 tests.

- **Findings**: A total of 21,788 citations were screened, and seven studies of diverse quality were included in the review, comprising 1,691 participants. Multicomponent interventions significantly reduced incident delirium (relative risk [RR] 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63–0.85, P < 0.001) and accidental falls during hospitalization (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.21, 0.72, P = 0.003), without evidence of differential effectiveness according to ward type or dementia rates. Non-significant reductions in delirium duration, hospital stay, and mortality were found as well.

- **Interpretation**: Multicomponent interventions are effective in preventing delirium.

### The prevention of delirium in elderly surgical patients with obstructive sleep apnea (PODESA): A randomized controlled trial [^116NrkjG]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). High credibility.

Long-term adherence with CPAP was associated with maintenance of cognitive performance in older adults with severe OSA who were followed over three years. Treatment with CPAP for three months was linked to improvements in quality of life and some neurocognitive functions in adults aged 70 and above with severe OSA. Another study of older adults with mild cognitive impairment and OSA demonstrated a significant enhancement in cognition (improved psychomotor/cognitive processing speed), daytime sleepiness, and daily function in the CPAP adherent group (4 hours per night use) versus the CPAP non-adherent group a year after their OSA diagnosis.

In contrast, a recent observational study of over 1400 patients failed to show an independent association between OSA and postoperative delirium. However, this study included patients at high risk of OSA by STOP-Bang score rather than diagnosed by sleep study, and the actual adherence and number of hours of postoperative CPAP usage were not reported. Another recent retrospective study of non-neurosurgical patients admitted to ICU reported no association between OSA risk and postoperative delirium. Similar to Strutz et al.'s study, the OSA diagnosis was either self-reported or based on STOP-BANG questionnaire scores. Although questionnaires are helpful as screening tools to predict risk for OSA, they are not as accurate for diagnosis compared to sleep studies and may have higher false positive results.

Our incidence of delirium was lower than reported previously in the literature. Due to the low incidence of postoperative delirium, our study is underpowered to definitively determine the effects of CPAP adherence on delirium prevention in this population.

### Non-pharmacologic multicomponent interventions preventing delirium in hospitalized people [^112XBQmC]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2020). High credibility.

Delirium is a common neurobehavioral complication in hospitalized patients with a high prevalence in various clinical settings. Prevention of delirium is critical due to its common occurrence and associated poor outcomes. Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of multicomponent interventions in preventing incident delirium in hospitalized patients at risk.

- **Design**: Systematic review and meta-analysis.

- **Setting**: Hospital.

- **Participants**: We included a study if it was a randomized controlled trial and was evaluating effects of coordinated non-pharmacologic multicomponent interventions in the prevention of delirium.

- **Measurements**: We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed and CENTRAL (PROSPERO: CRD42019138981; last update May 24, 2019). We assessed the quality of included studies by using the criteria established by the Cochrane Collaboration. We extracted the measured outcomes for delirium incidence, duration of delirium, length of hospital stay, falls during hospital stay, discharge to institutional care, and inpatient mortality.

- **Results**: In total, we screened 1,027 eligible records and included eight studies with 2,105 patients in the review. We found evidence of an effect (i.e. reduction) of multicomponent interventions on the incidence of delirium (risk ratio = .53; 95% confidence interval = .41-.69; I^2 = 0). We detected no clear evidence of an effect for delirium duration, length of hospital stay, accidental falls, and mortality. Subgroup analyses did not result in findings of substantial effect modifiers, which can be explained by the high

The study highlights the importance of non-pharmacologic interventions in reducing the incidence of delirium in hospitalized patients, though impact on other factors such as delirium duration or hospital stay length remains unclear.

### New horizons in the pathogenesis, assessment and management of delirium [^115vhc9z]. Age and Ageing (2013). Low credibility.

Future research on delirium prevention should address several issues. It is still unclear if interventions are more efficacious in higher-risk patients. Related to this, tailored delirium prevention as advocated by the NICE guidelines requires further detailed evaluation. It is plausible that some highly vulnerable patients could benefit from more resource-intensive tailored prevention packages; stratification of risk would make the realization of such interventions in clinical practice more feasible.

More broadly, it is important to clarify if prevention and treatment are meaningfully distinct approaches, as incident and prevalent delirium may overlap in prodromal or subsyndromal forms. Another unresolved problem is how to translate existing research findings into routine care. Studies that consider low-cost, practical implementation in mainstream healthcare are still lacking. However, some elements of multicomponent programmes are easier and cheaper to implement than others, and healthcare providers should consider introducing these components into practice now, rather than adopting an all-or-none approach for a particular package of measures.

- **Examples**: Urging staff to provide hearing aids and glasses, involving family members in care, providing frequent orientation, ensuring adequate hydration and nutrition, detecting and treating pain and constipation, avoiding urinary catheterization, and avoiding deliriogenic drugs are readily achievable in many settings without additional staffing. Other elements, such as cognitive stimulation, may be more difficult and costly to implement.

### A systematic review of non-pharmacological interventions to improve nighttime sleep among residents of long-term care settings [^113oPVxR]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Both benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotics have been associated with an increased risk of falls and fractures in older adults. These challenges reinforce the need to consider non-pharmacological approaches in the unique physical environment and institutional milieu of long-term care facilities. The potential for sleep or circadian rhythm disturbance is linked to an increase in vulnerability to environmental challenges in these facilities.

For some residents, a non-stimulating environment may lead to excessive daytime and early evening napping, exacerbating sleep disturbances. Others may experience an over-stimulating nighttime environment due to light and noise or exposure to disruptive behaviors, including pain, discomfort, repetitive vocalizations, and wandering. Staff routines, such as nighttime incontinence care, are also disruptive to sleep maintenance.

The problems associated with existing pharmacological treatments, coupled with institutional environments that can further disrupt sleep, mean that non-pharmacological interventions should be considered to help prevent or manage sleep disturbances. Consistent with the recommendations of the American Geriatrics Society and the National Institute on Aging, the objective of this systematic review is to identify and evaluate the literature documenting the outcomes associated with non-pharmacological interventions to improve nighttime sleep among long-term care residents.

### Sleepless in the hospital: A systematic review of non-pharmacological sleep interventions [^117Jzhd9]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

Poor sleep is highly prevalent in inpatient medical settings and is associated with attenuated healing and worsened outcomes following hospitalization. Although non-pharmacological interventions are preferred, little is known about the best way to intervene in hospital settings.

A systematic review of published literature examined non-pharmacological sleep interventions among inpatients. This review included studies found in Embase, PsycINFO, and PubMed, following PRISMA guidelines.

Forty-three of the 1,529 originally identified manuscripts met inclusion criteria, encompassing 2,713 hospitalized participants from 18 countries. These participants included psychiatric and older adult patients living in hospital settings. The main outcomes measured were subjective and objective measures of sleep duration, quality, and insomnia.

Overall, the review was unable to recommend any specific intervention due to the state of the literature. The majority of the included research was limited in quality due to a lack of controls, lack of blinding, and reliance on self-reported outcomes. However, the literature suggests that melatonin and CBT-I likely hold the most promise for improving sleep in inpatient medical settings. Additionally, environmental modifications, such as designated quiet time and the use of earplugs and eye masks, could be easily adopted in care environments and may support sleep improvement. More rigorous research in non-pharmacological sleep interventions for hospitalized individuals is required to inform clinical recommendations.

### Non-pharmacological management of primary and secondary insomnia among older people: Review of assessment tools and treatments [^117H5CGa]. Age and Ageing (2003). Low credibility.

Primary and secondary insomnia, especially among older adults, is frequently encountered by family physicians. Pharmacological interventions, although effective in some circumstances, can be detrimental in others. Non-pharmacological management of insomnia may allow the patients to self-administer the treatment.

- **Objectives**: Review of published literature of assessment tools and treatments for primary and secondary insomnia.

- **Results**: Two frequently used self-reporting methods for obtaining sleep data are sleep diaries and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. A large amount of research supports the use of non-pharmacological treatments such as stimulus control, sleep restriction, sleep hygiene education, cognitive therapy, multi-component therapy, and paradoxical intention.

- **Conclusion**: Assessing the nature of insomnia by using an effective assessment tool and providing patients with a non-pharmacological treatment should be the first intervention for insomnia. It is shown that non-pharmacological treatments for primary and secondary insomnia are feasible and effective alternatives to the use of benzodiazepines, and family physicians should consider these when managing older patients with insomnia.
