## Question

hypercalcemia in patient with with history of prostate cancer, normal PTH

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate hypercalcemia in a patient with prostate cancer and a normal PTH. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true hypercalcemia and excluding pseudohypercalcemia. Then, I should verify the implications of a normal PTH in the context of malignancy. Next, I will consider the differential diagnosis, including PTHrP-mediated humoral hypercalcemia, osteolytic bone metastases, calcitriol-mediated disease, and non-malignant causes. After that, I need to outline the diagnostic workup, including PTHrP, vitamin D metabolites, renal function, and imaging. Finally, I will synthesize management principles, including acute therapy, antiresorptives, calcitonin, steroids for calcitriol-mediated disease, and special considerations for prostate cancer, while continuously checking for pitfalls and correcting any missteps along the way.

> Let me first confirm the presence of true hypercalcemia and exclude pseudohypercalcemia from high protein states; I need to ensure the total calcium is corrected for albumin or, ideally, measure ionized calcium, because only the ionized fraction is physiologically active and albumin binding can mislead total calcium results, especially in cancer patients with low albumin [^115WM4MR]. Wait, let me verify the correction formula and thresholds; a commonly used correction adds 0.8 mg/dL for each 1 g/dL that albumin is below 4.0 g/dL, and hypercalcemia is generally defined as corrected total calcium above about 10.2–10.5 mg/dL, though institutional ranges vary, so I should double-check the lab's reference interval and, when available, prefer ionized calcium to avoid misclassification [^115WM4MR] [^115vSeCo] [^112Ch4sB].

> Next, I should review the PTH result in context; in hypercalcemia, a normal PTH is inappropriately normal and therefore suspicious for a PTH-independent process, whereas primary hyperparathyroidism typically shows elevated or inappropriately normal PTH, so I need to ensure the assay is reliable and repeat PTH if the clinical picture is discordant [^115mxSJ5]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; a normal PTH in the setting of hypercalcemia does not absolutely exclude PHPT, but it makes malignancy-related mechanisms more likely, especially in a patient with known cancer, so I should proceed with a malignancy-focused workup while keeping a secondary check for non-malignant causes in reserve [^115mxSJ5].

> I will now examine the leading malignant mechanism, which is humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy mediated by PTHrP; PTHrP binds the PTH/PTHrP receptor, mimicking PTH effects on bone and kidney, and is the most common cause of cancer-associated hypercalcemia, with elevated circulating PTHrP reported in a majority of solid tumor cases with hypercalcemia, so I should order a PTHrP level promptly [^113KjJBk] [^116XRC2f] [^115vSeCo]. Wait, I should verify that PTHrP is not routinely elevated in prostate cancer; indeed, prostate cancer is classically osteoblastic and less often associated with hypercalcemia, but PTHrP expression can still occur and drive hypercalcemia in a subset, so a normal PTH with elevated PTHrP would strongly support HHM in this context [^111yASCK].

> Let me consider local osteolytic bone disease next; even in prostate cancer, which is predominantly osteoblastic, mixed osteolytic–osteoblastic lesions can occur, and osteoclast activation can release calcium locally, so I should review bone imaging and alkaline phosphatase to assess for lytic components and high bone turnover that could contribute to hypercalcemia [^1155Wr9W] [^1118VVmP]. Hold on, I should verify that the absence of extensive lytic disease does not exclude osteolytic mechanisms; hypercalcemia correlates poorly with the extent of bone metastases, and mixed humoral plus osteolytic processes are common, so I need to integrate labs and imaging rather than rely on a single modality [^111sDohJ].

> I need to check for calcitriol-mediated hypercalcemia as well; some tumors, including lymphomas and occasionally prostate cancer, can express 1-α-hydroxylase and increase 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, raising serum calcium via increased intestinal absorption, so measuring 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D helps distinguish this mechanism and guide steroid therapy if calcitriol-driven disease is present [^115WNjnZ] [^112PdwVw]. But wait, what if both PTHrP and calcitriol are elevated; mixed mechanisms do occur, so I should interpret vitamin D metabolites in the full biochemical context and not assume a single driver [^116YydmG].

> I should confirm that I am not missing non-malignant causes; primary hyperparathyroidism remains a key consideration when PTH is not suppressed, and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia should be suspected in younger patients or those with a family history and a low urinary calcium-to-creatinine clearance ratio, so I should calculate the ratio and, if indicated, pursue parathyroid imaging and genetics rather than assuming malignancy by default [^114DBWVe] [^111Q1kNX]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said "exclude PHPT if PTH is normal", but that is too strong; inappropriately normal PTH can still reflect PHPT, so I should use the urinary calcium ratio, clinical context, and, if needed, repeat PTH testing to adjudicate before committing to a malignant etiology [^115mxSJ5].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic workup in a structured sequence; I will obtain PTHrP, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D alongside creatinine and eGFR, because renal function influences calcium handling and the choice of antiresorptives, and I will add a bone scan or cross-sectional skeletal imaging to assess for lytic versus blastic disease and mixed patterns that could shift management [^116XRC2f] [^111sDohJ] [^113tvvV5]. I should double-check that imaging modality selection aligns with the clinical question; plain films or CT can help identify lytic foci, while bone scan or FDG-PET/CT can characterize disease burden and activity when appropriate, so I will tailor imaging to suspected mechanisms and prior studies [^113tvvV5].

> For acute management of severe hypercalcemia, I need to ensure prompt intravenous hydration with isotonic saline to restore intravascular volume and enhance calciuresis, while monitoring for fluid overload in heart failure, and I should add calcitonin for rapid, short-lived calcium lowering in symptomatic or marked hypercalcemia, recognizing its tachyphylaxis and the need for subsequent definitive therapy [^116YydmG] [^111f3qBb]. Hold on, I should verify dosing and expectations; calcitonin lowers calcium within hours but wanes in 48–72 hours, so it is a bridge while arranging antiresorptive therapy rather than monotherapy [^1118vdhg].

> For definitive control, I should initiate an antiresorptive agent; intravenous zoledronic acid is FDA-approved for hypercalcemia of malignancy and is a reasonable first-line choice, while denosumab is an alternative, particularly in renal insufficiency or bisphosphonate-refractory cases, though I must remember denosumab's higher hypocalcemia risk and plan calcium and vitamin D supplementation accordingly [^112Ch4sB] [^111qToPL] [^114nXbuv]. Wait, let me verify comparative efficacy; denosumab has shown superiority to zoledronic acid for preventing skeletal-related events in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, but both are acceptable for hypercalcemia control, so agent selection should integrate renal function, prior exposure, and hypocalcemia risk mitigation [^111uViKA] [^111f3qBb].

> If calcitriol-mediated hypercalcemia is identified, I should add glucocorticoids such as prednisone 40–60 mg daily, because steroids reduce extra-renal 1-α-hydroxylase activity and intestinal calcium absorption, and if hypercalcemia persists despite steroids, I should escalate to an IV bisphosphonate or denosumab as suggested by guidelines for refractory calcitriol-driven disease [^112PdwVw] [^116YydmG]. I need to ensure I do not conflate this with PTHrP-driven disease; steroids are less effective for PTHrP-mediated hypercalcemia, so mechanism-specific therapy prevents delays in effective treatment [^112PdwVw].

> Special considerations in prostate cancer deserve attention; although hypercalcemia is less common than in breast or lung cancers, it does occur and carries adverse prognostic implications, and emerging case-level evidence links certain genotypes, such as biallelic BRCA2 alterations, to lytic bone disease and severe hypercalcemia, so I should integrate molecular context and disease burden into counseling and surveillance plans [^112212qg] [^1149YxbP]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not overlooking osteoblastic "bone hunger" phenomena; prostate cancer more often causes hypocalcemia in the setting of antiresorptives, but mixed lesions and humoral factors can still produce hypercalcemia, so dynamic reassessment of bone turnover and calcium trends is essential [^1155Wr9W].

> I should confirm a monitoring cadence; after acute control, recheck calcium every 2–3 days initially, then space to weekly as stable, and monitor vitamin D to mitigate hypocalcemia risk during antiresorptive therapy, adjusting calcium and vitamin D supplementation proactively based on corrected calcium and renal function [^1142ghTs]. Let me reconsider duration; stabilization typically occurs over 1–2 weeks, but refractory cases may require repeated antiresorptive dosing or mechanism-directed escalation, so I will align follow-up with clinical trajectory and laboratory response rather than a fixed interval [^1118vdhg].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, stepwise approach: confirm true hypercalcemia, interpret PTH as inappropriately normal in this context, prioritize PTHrP-mediated humoral hypercalcemia while evaluating osteolytic and calcitriol mechanisms, exclude non-malignant causes when indicated, and treat acutely with hydration and calcitonin followed by definitive antiresorptive therapy tailored to mechanism and renal function, with vigilant monitoring and calcium-vitamin D stewardship to prevent hypocalcemia during therapy.

Hypercalcemia in a patient with prostate cancer and normal PTH most often reflects **humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy** (HHM) due to PTHrP [^115WNjnZ], with osteolytic bone metastases or vitamin D–mediated mechanisms as less common causes [^115WNjnZ]. A normal PTH indicates a **PTH-independent process**; confirm with PTHrP, 25(OH)D, and 1,25(OH)2D, and image for bone metastases [^notfound]. Management includes **IV hydration, calcitonin, and antiresorptives** (zoledronic acid or denosumab) [^111f3qBb] [^1118vdhg]; denosumab is preferred if renal impairment is present [^111qToPL]. Address the underlying malignancy and monitor calcium closely to prevent recurrence [^116YydmG].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several mechanisms can explain **hypercalcemia with normal PTH** in prostate cancer:

| **Mechanism** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM) | Tumor secretion of PTHrP mimics PTH, increasing bone resorption and renal calcium reabsorption; PTH is suppressed by feedback [^113KjJBk] [^1155Wr9W] |
| Osteolytic bone metastases | Tumor cells in bone release cytokines (e.g. IL-6, TNF-α) that stimulate osteoclasts, increasing calcium release; PTH remains normal due to feedback suppression [^1155Wr9W] |
| Vitamin D–mediated hypercalcemia | Tumor production of 1,25(OH)2D increases intestinal calcium absorption; PTH is suppressed [^115WNjnZ] |
| Ectopic PTH secretion | Rarely, tumors secrete true PTH; typically causes elevated PTH, but normal PTH has been reported in rare cases [^114DBWVe] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A **comprehensive diagnostic workup** is essential** to confirm the etiology of hypercalcemia**:

- **Confirm hypercalcemia**: Measure total and ionized calcium, correct for albumin, and assess renal function [^115mxSJ5].
- **PTH and PTHrP**: Normal PTH with elevated PTHrP supports HHM [^115vSeCo].
- **Vitamin D metabolites**: Measure 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D to assess vitamin D–mediated hypercalcemia [^111sDohJ].
- **Imaging**: Bone scan, CT, or MRI to evaluate metastases; PET/CT may help detect occult disease [^113tvvV5].
- **Other labs**: PSA, alkaline phosphatase, and renal function tests to assess disease burden and organ involvement [^113tvvV5].

---

## Clinical implications and prognosis

Hypercalcemia in prostate cancer signals **advanced disease** and is associated with poor prognosis, increased skeletal-related events, and reduced survival [^1149YxbP]. It often reflects aggressive tumor biology and extensive bone involvement [^112h5p81].

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on **correcting hypercalcemia** and treating the underlying malignancy:

- **Initial therapy**: IV hydration, calcitonin for rapid reduction, and loop diuretics after rehydration [^111f3qBb].
- **Antiresorptive therapy**: Zoledronic acid or denosumab to inhibit bone resorption; denosumab is preferred in renal impairment [^1118vdhg] [^116YydmG].
- **Systemic therapy**: Androgen deprivation therapy, chemotherapy, or targeted agents to control the tumor [^111HfuAU].
- **Monitoring**: Regular calcium and renal function checks to detect recurrence and manage complications [^1142ghTs].

---

## Conclusion

Hypercalcemia in prostate cancer with normal PTH most often reflects **HHM from PTHrP**, with osteolytic metastases or vitamin D–mediated mechanisms as alternatives [^115WNjnZ]. A **structured workup** — including PTHrP, vitamin D metabolites, and imaging — confirms the cause, and management centers on hydration, antiresorptives, and tumor control, with close monitoring to prevent recurrence [^116XRC2f] [^111sDohJ] [^116uRQtU] [^116YydmG].

### Hypercalcemia and cancer: differential diagnosis and treatment [^116uRQtU]. CA (2018). Low credibility.

Incidentally detected hypercalcemia usually presents in an indolent manner and is most likely caused by primary hyperparathyroidism. In contrast, hypercalcemia in the patient with a history of cancer presents in a wide range of clinical settings and may be severe enough to warrant hospitalization. This form of hypercalcemia is usually secondary to hypercalcemia of malignancy and can be fatal. Hypercalcemia of malignancy is most commonly mediated by tumoral production of parathyroid hormone-related protein or by cytokines activating osteoclast degradation of bone. The initial workup, differential diagnoses, confirmatory laboratory testing, imaging, and medical and surgical management of hypercalcemia are described in the patient with cancer.

Objective

To report the occurrence of hypocalcemia in a patient with metastatic prostate cancer, discuss its pathogenesis, and review the related medical literature.

Methods

An 82-year-old man with a known history of prostate cancer was found to have a serum calcium level of 5.4 mg/dL during an admission to the hospital for small bowel obstruction. A thorough review of his medical history revealed a temporal relationship between the diagnosis of malignant disease and progressive hypocalcemia. A complete evaluation was performed, including laboratory and imaging studies, to ascertain the cause of the hypocalcemia.

Results

The patient had no history of hypocalcemia before the diagnosis of, and initiation of antiandrogen therapy for, advanced prostate cancer. Serum magnesium and phosphorus levels were within normal limits. The serum calcium level responded to therapy in the hospital but remained between 5.8 and 7.1 mg/dL. The parathyroid hormone level was normal, and the 25-hydroxyvitamin D value was low. A 24-hour urine collection showed substantially reduced calcium excretion, and a whole-body bone scan revealed widespread metastatic deposits. These findings were compatible with hypocalcemia related to prostate cancer and bone metastatic lesions.

Conclusion

This case serves as a reminder that hypocalcemia can be a manifestation of prostate cancer metastatic to bone. In contrast to the occurrence of secondary hyperparathyroidism in this setting, however, this patient had normal levels of parathyroid hormone. Review of similar previous reports and the causes and implications of a possible functional hypoparathyroid state are discussed.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) in MEN1 — biochemical screening and diagnosis state that "Concomitant measurement of parathyroid hormone (PTH), adjusted serum calcium, and serum phosphorus is used to screen for PHPT". Diagnostic criteria note that "PHPT is diagnosed with the combination of hypercalcemia and elevated or inappropriately normal PTH; although normocalcemic PHPT may be noted with a persistently normal serum calcium combined with an elevated PTH without a secondary cause for hyperparathyroidism", and "An ionized calcium measurement may be considered, especially in normocalcemic PHPT".

Measuring calcium concentrations

Approximately 50% of serum calcium exists in an unbound ionized form, and 50% is bound to protein (predominantly albumin). Only unbound ionized calcium is physiologically active; therefore, serum calcium concentration must be corrected for albumin concentration in order to confirm a diagnosis of hypocalcaemia. This is particularly important in patients with advanced cancer in whom albumin levels are frequently low. Hypocalcaemia is defined as a corrected serum total calcium concentration below 2.1 mmol/l (ionized calcium < 1.1 mmol/l). Corrected calcium can be calculated using the following formula: measured total calcium (mmol/l) + 0.02 × [40 – measured albumin level (g/l)]. Analysis of unbound ionized calcium concentration provides the most accurate measurement of serum calcium and is recommended in patients who are seriously ill: unfortunately, ionized calcium measurements are not often routinely available. Analysis of creatinine, phosphate, magnesium, vitamin D, and PTH levels is also recommended when diagnosing hypocalcaemia in order to identify other underlying causes of low serum calcium concentrations.

### Parathyroid hormone-related protein: an update [^113KjJBk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

PTHrP was identified as a cause of hypercalcemia in cancer patients 25 yr ago. In the intervening years, we have learned that PTHrP and PTH are encoded by related genes that are part of a larger "PTH gene family". This evolutionary relationship permits them to bind to the same type 1 PTH/PTHrP receptor, which explains why humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy resembles hyperparathyroidism. This review will outline basic facts about PTHrP biology and its normal physiological functions, with an emphasis on new findings of the past 5–10 yr. The medical and research communities first became aware of PTHrP because of its involvement in a common paraneoplastic syndrome. Now, research into the basic biology of PTHrP has suggested previously unrecognized connections to a variety of disease states such as osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and breast cancer and has highlighted how PTHrP itself might be used in therapy for osteoporosis and diabetes. Therefore, the story of this remarkable protein is a paradigm for translational research, having gone from bedside to bench and now back to bedside.

Normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism is a common biochemical finding, usually identified during an assessment of bone or renal health. Hypercalcaemia must be considered by calculation of adjusted calcium, and a careful history taken to assess dietary calcium intake and for the possibility of a malabsorption syndrome. 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) should be measured and replaced if indicated. The management plan for the patient is influenced by the context in which calcium and PTH were measured. In this brief review we describe the assessment of a patient with normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism.

Main text

Diagnosing hypocalcaemia

Calcium homeostasis is mediated by the effect of active vitamin D (calcitriol) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) on the gastrointestinal (GI) absorption of calcium, renal excretion of calcium, and osteoclast/osteoblast activity in the skeleton (which is the main calcium sink in the body). Consequently, hypocalcaemia has many potential causes, such as vitamin D deficiency (which can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism), abnormal magnesium or phosphate levels, and partial or complete hypoparathyroidism. Hypocalcaemia can range in severity from mild asymptomatic cases to acute life-threatening crises; the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) define grades of hypocalcaemia from mild (grade 1) to severe (grade 5) (Table 1).

Table 1
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grading of hypocalcaemia

LLN lower limit of normal

Extracellular calcium is required for the normal functioning of muscles and nerves. Thus, signs and symptoms of hypocalcaemia include muscle twitching, spasms, tingling, and numbness, and patients with severe hypocalcaemia may develop tetany, seizures, and cardiac dysrhythmias. The development of neuromuscular excitability depends on both the absolute concentration of calcium and how rapidly the concentration has fallen. Patients who experience a rapid fall in serum calcium concentration are often symptomatic, whereas those who develop hypocalcaemia gradually may be asymptomatic, with hypocalcaemia being diagnosed as an incidental biochemical finding. However, if asymptomatic hypocalcaemia is not treated, long-term consequences can include neuropsychiatric symptoms, cataract formation, and raised intracranial pressure. Such cases predominantly occur in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism.

### Hypocalcemic and normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism in patients with advanced prostatic cancer [^114VM4o9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

PTH and ionized calcium levels were measured in 131 patients with advanced prostate cancer, all of whom had received at least first-line hormone therapy. Patients were classified into those in remission, those with stable disease, or those with progressive disease according to their prostate-specific antigen response and their clinical status. Thirty-four percent of all patients had PTH levels above the upper level of normal for controls of similar age (7.0 pmol/liter), and in 44% of these patients this was associated with a normal ionized calcium. Patients with proven bone metastases had significantly higher PTH levels than those without. (7.3 ± 0.5 vs. 4.3 ± 0.4 pmol/liter, P < 0.0005). There was evidence for a difference in the PTH levels between the three response groups. The PTH levels tended to be higher in patients with progressive disease. Thirty-seven of 65 patients (57%) with both progressive disease and proven bone metastases had elevated PTH levels. Mean levels of urinary deoxypyridinoline and cAMP were significantly greater in patients with high PTH than in those with a normal PTH. Treatment with oral calcium supplements in 32 patients with a high PTH seemed to have only a transient effect on elevated PTH or low ionized calcium levels. These data show that secondary hyperparathyroidism occurs frequently in patients with advanced prostate cancer, particularly in those with both progressive disease and bone metastases. The increased PTH levels are associated with an increase in bone resorption markers. These findings raise important questions about the role of PTH in progression of prostatic cancer in bone and the potential limitations of the use of bisphosphonates in patients with a raised PTH or low serum calcium.

### Hypocalcaemia in patients with prostate cancer treated with a bisphosphonate or denosumab: prevention supports treatment completion [^115Jbpx1]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Hypocalcaemia associated with the use of bisphosphonates and denosumab can be serious; however, it is both preventable and treatable. Given the reduction in skeletal morbidity and the potential improvements to quality of life that inhibitors of bone resorption offer patients with cancer and bone metastases, potential barriers to their use should be properly understood and addressed. With appropriate patient monitoring and preventative measures, patients with advanced prostate cancer, including those with additional risk factors for hypocalcaemia, should be able to continue to benefit from treatment with these agents.

Calcium Metabolism In Cancer and Hypercalcaemia Of Malignancy

The balance between bone formation and resorption may be disrupted in patients with cancer, leading either to increased bone resorption, calcium release, and possibly hypercalcaemia, or to increased bone formation, sequestration of calcium, and possibly hypocalcaemia. In adults, hypercalcaemia of malignancy is most common in patients with tumours that produce factors that induce osteoclast activation and enhance bone resorption. Impaired renal function and increased renal tubular calcium resorption may further affect calcium levels.

Treatment Of Hypercalcaemia Of Malignancy

Inhibitors of bone resorption, first the bisphosphonates and, later, denosumab, have been shown to be effective in hypercalcaemia treatment. Bisphosphonates (which are administered intravenously) are approved for hypercalcaemia of malignancy and are the current mainstay of treatment, whereas denosumab (which is administered subcutaneously) may offer an option for patients who do not respond to bisphosphonates or suffer from renal insufficiency.

Hypocalcaemia

TREATMENT AND PREVENTION: Hypocalcaemia is most common in patients with prostate cancer and osteoblastic bone metastases, but can occur in patients with a variety of tumour types who are receiving inhibitors of bone resorption. While patients often respond to calcium and vitamin D supplementation, prevention should be the aim; at-risk patients should be identified before starting treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption, be closely monitored during at least the first few months of treatment, and receive concomitant calcium and vitamin D supplementation unless hypercalcaemia is present.

Conclusion

Both hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia can be serious if left untreated. It is therefore important that patients with cancer are closely monitored and receive adequate prevention and treatment measures to maintain normal blood calcium levels.

Regarding specific circumstances for primary hyperparathyroidism, more specifically with respect to patients with parathyroid carcinoma, AAES 2016 guidelines recommend to suspect parathyroid cancer in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism with markedly elevated PTH and severe hypercalcemia.

### Pathophysiology of hypercalcemia [^115WNjnZ]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Extracellular calcium is normally tightly regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, as well as by calcium ion (Ca ++) itself. Dysregulated PTH production leading to hypercalcemia occurs most commonly in sporadic primary hyperparathryoidism (PHPT) but may also result from select genetic mutations in familial disorders. Parathyroid hormone-related protein shares molecular mechanisms of action with PTH and is the most common cause of hypercalcemia of malignancy. Other cytokines and mediators may also cause resorptive hypercalcemia once bone metastases have occurred. Less commonly, extrarenal production of calcitriol can occur in malignancies and in infectious and noninfectious inflammatory conditions and can cause hypercalcemia.

Calcium metabolism in cancer and hypercalcaemia of malignancy

The balance between bone formation and resorption may be disrupted in patients with cancer, leading either to increased bone resorption, calcium release, and possibly hypercalcaemia, or to increased bone formation, sequestration of calcium, and possibly hypocalcaemia. In adults, hypercalcaemia of malignancy is most common in patients with tumours that produce factors that induce osteoclast activation and enhance bone resorption. Impaired renal function and increased renal tubular calcium resorption may further affect calcium levels.

Treatment of hypercalcaemia of malignancy

Inhibitors of bone resorption, first the bisphosphonates and, later, denosumab, have been shown to be effective in hypercalcaemia treatment. Bisphosphonates (which are administered intravenously) are approved for hypercalcaemia of malignancy and are the current mainstay of treatment, whereas denosumab (which is administered subcutaneously) may offer an option for patients who do not respond to bisphosphonates or suffer from renal insufficiency.

Hypocalcaemia: treatment and prevention

Hypocalcaemia is most common in patients with prostate cancer and osteoblastic bone metastases, but can occur in patients with a variety of tumour types who are receiving inhibitors of bone resorption. While patients often respond to calcium and vitamin D supplementation, prevention should be the aim; at-risk patients should be identified before starting treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption, be closely monitored during at least the first few months of treatment, and receive concomitant calcium and vitamin D supplementation unless hypercalcaemia is present.

Conclusion

Both hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia can be serious if left untreated. It is therefore important that patients with cancer are closely monitored and receive adequate prevention and treatment measures to maintain normal blood calcium levels.

Treatment and prevention of hypocalcaemia

Hypocalcaemia in patients with cancer can have severe consequences, whether occurring with or without the use of inhibitors of bone resorption, but responds well to calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Furthermore, when treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption is required for the management of metastatic bone disease, hypocalcaemia can usually be prevented by identification and appropriate management of at-risk patients. Case reports and retrospective analyses have identified a number of risk factors associated with the development of hypocalcaemia in those receiving inhibitors of bone resorption; these include vitamin D deficiency, renal insufficiency, osteoblastic metastases, prostate cancer, and low baseline blood calcium levels (Table 2). It is therefore important that vitamin D and calcium levels are assessed and supplementation initiated before starting treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption. This evaluation is particularly important given the high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency among patients with metastatic cancer. Furthermore, all patients receiving inhibitors of bone resorption for the prevention of SREs should receive concomitant calcium and vitamin D supplementation; use of these supplements has been shown to lower the risk of developing hypocalcaemia by 27% and 40% in patients receiving zoledronic acid or denosumab, respectively. An interim analysis of an open-label observational study of treatment persistence in patients with cancer who were receiving denosumab to prevent SREs found that most patients (80%) received calcium and vitamin D supplementation at the start of denosumab treatment. Long-term follow-up persistence data, however, are not yet available. Previous reports suggest that adherence to calcium and vitamin D supplementation is low; patients should, therefore, be counselled on the importance of adequate calcium and vitamin D intake in order to improve adherence. Use of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the active metabolite of vitamin D, might offer further advantages in the prevention and treatment of hypocalcaemia; however, trials are required to confirm this.

Although hypocalcaemia can occur at any time during treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption, studies show that it often develops soon after treatment initiation; within 7 days, in some cases. Therefore, careful monitoring of at-risk patients after starting treatment is important to enable quick detection and resolution of hypocalcaemia. At-risk patients should also be educated about the symptoms of hypocalcaemia and encouraged to report any indicative symptoms. If hypocalcaemia occurs while a patient is receiving inhibitors of bone resorption, additional calcium and vitamin D supplementation and further monitoring are advised. Delaying the administration of inhibitors of bone resorption because of hypocalcaemia is rarely necessary.

### Hypocalcaemia in patients with prostate cancer treated with a bisphosphonate or denosumab: prevention supports treatment completion [^115fxK3Q]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with prostate cancer and osteoblastic metastases who are receiving treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption are at a particularly high risk of hypocalcaemia. Although often mild and transient, hypocalcaemia can also present as a serious and life-threatening condition, which can lead to treatment interruption or cessation. However, with proper patient monitoring, hypocalcaemia can be prevented and treated. In this review, we provide practical advice on managing the risk of hypocalcaemia in patients with advanced prostate cancer who are receiving treatment with bone resorption inhibitors. Relevant references for this review were identified through a literature search of PubMed (limited to English-language publications) with the search terms 'prostate cancer', 'bone-targeted agents', 'anti-resorptive agents', 'bisphosphonates', 'zoledronic acid', 'denosumab', 'hypocalcaemia', and 'hypocalcemia'.

### PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) in hypercalcemia [^116XRC2f]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

It is now 20 years since the tumor-associated factor parathyroid hormone-related peptide was identified. Since then, there have been significant changes in the understanding of the hypercalcemic syndromes associated with malignancy and with the role of this peptide in normal physiology as well as this specialized pathologic setting. Parathyroid hormone-related peptide has become a useful diagnostic tool in the differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia, and approaches to inhibit its expression or its effects by malignant cells hold promise for treating the hypercalcemia and osteolysis associated with some cancers.

### Hypocalcaemia in patients with prostate cancer treated with a bisphosphonate or denosumab: prevention supports treatment completion [^116nM9hg]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Retrospective analysis of patients treated for denosumab-associated hypocalcaemia found that the median time from detection of hypocalcaemia to normocalcaemia was 33 days (range: 9–92 days). However, the time to normalization of serum calcium levels depends on the baseline calcium concentration, the treatment regimen, and how frequently calcium levels are measured. Once a stable calcium concentration has been achieved, calcium concentrations should be monitored 1 week after hospital discharge. If satisfactory, further follow-up measurements should be taken monthly for 6 months. We recommend that treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption be delayed in patients who experience grade 2 or higher hypocalcaemia; treatment can be continued once a patient has had a stable normal calcium level for a minimum of 4 weeks. In patients who have experienced severe hypocalcaemia, serum calcium levels should be measured 2 weeks after reinitiating treatment with an inhibitor of bone resorption, and monthly thereafter. Our recommendations for the treatment of hypocalcaemia are summarised in Fig. 2.

### Hypocalcaemia in patients with prostate cancer treated with a bisphosphonate or denosumab: prevention supports treatment completion [^111YFpmq]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Most patients with advanced prostate cancer develop bone metastases, which often result in painful and debilitating skeletal-related events. Inhibitors of bone resorption, such as bisphosphonates and denosumab, can each reduce the incidence of skeletal-related events and delay the progression of bone pain. However, these agents are associated with an increased risk of hypocalcaemia, which, although often mild and transient, can be serious and life-threatening. Here we provide practical advice on managing the risk of hypocalcaemia in patients with advanced prostate cancer who are receiving treatment with bone resorption inhibitors. Relevant references for this review were identified through searches of PubMed with the search terms 'prostate cancer', 'bone-targeted agents', 'anti-resorptive agents', 'bisphosphonates', 'zoledronic acid', 'denosumab', 'hypocalcaemia', and 'hypocalcemia'. Additional references were suggested by the authors.

Main text

Among patients with advanced cancer receiving a bisphosphonate or denosumab, hypocalcaemia occurs most frequently in those with prostate cancer, although it can occur in patients with any tumour type. Consistent with its greater ability to inhibit bone resorption, denosumab has shown superiority in the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases from solid tumours. Consequently, denosumab is more likely to induce hypocalcaemia than the bisphosphonates. Likewise, various bisphosphonates have differing potencies for the inhibition of bone resorption, and thus the risk of hypocalcaemia varies between different bisphosphonates. Other risk factors for the development of hypocalcaemia include the presence of osteoblastic metastases, vitamin D deficiency, and renal insufficiency. Hypocalcaemia can lead to treatment interruption, but it is both preventable and manageable. Serum calcium concentrations should be measured, and any pre-existing hypocalcaemia should be corrected, before starting treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption. Once treatment has started, concomitant administration of calcium and vitamin D supplements is essential. Calcium concentrations should be monitored during treatment with bisphosphonates or denosumab, particularly in patients at high risk of hypocalcaemia. If hypocalcaemia is diagnosed, patients should receive treatment with calcium and vitamin D.

Conclusion

With preventative strategies and treatment, patients with prostate cancer who are at risk of, or who develop, hypocalcaemia should be able to continue to benefit from treatment with bisphosphonates or denosumab.

### Hypercalcemic hypocalciuria: a critical differential diagnosis for hyperparathyroidism [^111Q1kNX]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

A differential diagnosis for hyperparathyroidism includes all causes of hypercalcemia; the primary causes of which are primary hyperparathyroidism and humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. Benign familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a rare condition of primary importance because failure to recognize this entity leads to unnecessary surgery. There are a plethora of other rare causes of hypercalcemia that can be distinguished from primary hyperparathyroidism by history and laboratory profiles. This article discusses the main and less common causes of hypercalcemia and provides guidance for distinguishing among them.

Mild hypocalcaemia

Patients with mild hypocalcaemia (asymptomatic grade 1) should be treated with oral calcium and vitamin D supplements: calcium (1 g) and vitamin D (cholecalciferol at least 800 IU) should be given twice daily. Patients who are vitamin D deficient and who do not respond to this therapy can be given higher doses of vitamin D: at least 25,000 IU orally once a week for 8 weeks or, where available and if needed, 7 mg intramuscularly every 3 months. It is important to check whether a patient is hypomagnesaemic, which induces functional hypoparathyroidism leading to low serum calcium levels. If a patient is hypomagnesaemic, precipitating drugs should not be administered. To normalise magnesium concentration, intravenous magnesium at a dose of 24 mmol should be administered over 24 h. We recommend that treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption be continued in patients who experience grade 1 hypocalcaemia.

### Hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia: finding the balance [^1155Wr9W]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

In osteoblastic metastases, tumour cells produce osteoblast-stimulating factors, such as endothelin-1, platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and bone morphogenetic proteins, proteases (e.g. matrix metalloproteinases, prostate-specific antigen, urokinase-type plasminogen activator), all of which promote osteoblast proliferation and bone formation (Fig. 1). Osteoblastic metastases are common in patients with prostate cancer; endothelin-1 has been shown to be increased in the blood of such patients. Calcium is sequestered from the blood during the development of osteoblastic metastases; therefore, patients with prostate cancer and osteoblastic metastases are most at risk of developing hypocalcaemia.

In osteolytic metastases, tumour cells release factors that ultimately activate osteoclasts (Fig. 1). In breast cancer, the most important of these factors is parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP). Other examples include transforming growth factor beta, interleukin-1 and interleukin-6, and tumour necrosis factor alpha. These factors stimulate bone marrow stromal and osteoblast cells to express RANK ligand (RANKL), which signals via its cognate receptor RANK, expressed on osteoclast precursor cells and activated osteoclasts. Signalling through the RANK receptor induces osteoclast maturation and bone resorption. During bone resorption, calcium is released causing a rise in blood calcium concentration. Additionally, growth factors stored in the bone matrix are released and stimulate tumour cell proliferation and further release of PTHrP, feeding into the vicious cycle of bone metastases and tumour growth. Tumours of the breast and lung, and multiple myeloma, predominantly cause osteolytic metastases and lytic bone lesions, respectively; patients with these malignancies are, therefore, most at risk of developing hypercalcaemia of malignancy.

Although there are clear distinctions in the causes and epidemiology of osteolytic and osteoblastic bone metastases, it should be noted that these two types of bone lesion represent extremes of a spectrum of metastatic bone disease; a substantial proportion of patients have bone metastases with both osteolytic and osteoblastic elements. For example, in one study, the majority of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer, a spectrum of bone lesions from osteolytic to osteoblastic was present.

Calcium homeostasis can also be disrupted in patients with advanced cancer that has not metastasised to bone. In these patients, tumour-derived systemic factors (predominantly PTHrP) increase blood calcium concentrations by enhancing osteoclast activation and bone resorption and by increasing renal tubular calcium reabsorption.

A summary of the key factors contributing to the development of hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia, by primary tumour, is presented in Table 1.

### Prognostic role of serum parathyroid hormone levels in advanced prostate cancer patients undergoing zoledronic acid administration [^115oZCHC]. The Oncologist (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Secondary hyperparathyroidism is frequent in prostate cancer patients with bone metastases, and this condition is worsened by the administration of potent bisphosphonates. Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) elevation can impair the efficacy of these drugs in terms of survival.

Methods

The prognostic role of elevated serum PTH levels at baseline and after 3 months of zoledronic acid administration was assessed prospectively in 643 bone metastatic prostate cancer patients enrolled in a prospective randomized, placebo-controlled study.

Results

On multivariate analysis, after adjusting for major prognostic factors and bone turnover markers, elevated baseline serum PTH level was negatively associated with overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.448; 95% confidence interval, 1.045–2.006; p < .03) in zoledronic acid-treated patients but not in placebo-treated patients. In patients with normal baseline PTH levels, there was a trend but insignificant association between zoledronic acid administration and a better survival outcome than with placebo (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.65–1.01; p = .065), whereas a trend in the opposite direction was observed in patients with elevated PTH levels (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 0.87–2.39; p = .151); interaction test, p = .040. Elevated serum PTH level after 3 months of zoledronic acid treatment was not significantly associated with survival outcome.

Conclusions

Secondary hyperparathyroidism has a negative prognostic impact in metastatic prostate cancer patients undergoing zoledronic acid administration. Counteracting elevated PTH levels by adequate doses of vitamin D may improve the efficacy of this drug.

### Bone health in cancer: perspective on the use of osteoanabolic agents [^115wxzEj]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition, PTH analogs can lead to increases in serum calcium. This is a concern for their potential use in metastatic bone disease, as metastatic cancer in the bone may be complicated by hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) in 20%–30% of patients. HCM is mediated via a variety of mechanisms, including osteolytic lesions, secretion of PTHrP, and overproduction of 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. This is not a concern with romosozumab, which can rarely lead to hypocalcemia. In contrast to PTH analogs, antiresorptive agents are invaluable in the treatment of HCM.

PTH increased the number of metastatic lesions in preclinical studies on prostate cancer, a cancer associated with blastic bone lesions. Therefore, we generally avoid all osteoanabolic therapy in the solid tumor patient with active osteoblastic metastases, given that these lesions already demonstrate an overactivity of osteoblasts. For future research on this patient population, romosozumab presents a theoretically more attractive option than PTH or PTHrP analogs due to its ability to decrease, rather than increase, bone resorption. While preclinical studies on romosozumab are promising, the lack of published clinical trials means its potential remains speculative.

### Twenty-five years of PTHrP progress: from cancer hormone to multifunctional cytokine [^114R73Qc]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2012). Low credibility.

Twenty-five years ago a "new" protein was identified from cancers that caused hypercalcemia. It was credited for its ability to mimic parathyroid hormone (PTH), and hence was termed parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP). Today it is recognized for its widespread distribution, its endocrine, paracrine, and intracrine modes of action driving numerous physiologic and pathologic conditions, and its central role in organogenesis. The multiple biological activities within a complex molecule with paracrine modulation of adjacent target cells present boundless possibilities. The protein structure of PTHrP has been traced, dissected, and deleted comprehensively and conditionally, yet numerous questions lurk in its past that will carry into the future. Issues of the variable segments of the protein, including the enigmatic nuclear localization sequence, are only recently being clarified. Aspects of PTHrP production and action in the menacing condition of cancer are emerging as dichotomies that may represent intended temporal actions of PTHrP. Relative to PTH, the hormone regulating calcium homeostasis, PTHrP "controls the show" locally at the PTH/PTHrP receptor throughout the body. Great strides have been made in our understanding of PTHrP actions, yet years of exciting investigation and discovery are imminent. © 2012 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

Hypercalcaemia of malignancy

Previous estimates of hypercalcaemia of malignancy reported that it occurred in 5–30% of patients with cancer. However, prevalence rates have fallen progressively with the widespread, early and prolonged use of agents that inhibit bone resorption. A recent observational study in patients with cancer of any type or stage found that the 2012 hypercalcaemia prevalence was 0.67%; prevalence estimates varied across cancer types and were highest for individuals with lung cancer, multiple myeloma, or stage IV cancer. Similarly, a recent US study reported a hypercalcaemia prevalence of 2–2.8% among all patients with cancer, ranging from 1.4–2.1% in prostate cancer, to 7.5–10.2% in multiple myeloma. Furthermore, both studies examined the prevalence of hypercalcaemia in patients with cancer and not specifically hypercalcaemia of malignancy; therefore, the prevalence of true hypercalcaemia of malignancy is likely to be lower. Indeed, a study of 642 patients diagnosed with hypercalcaemia of malignancy reported that up to one third of cases were not caused by tumour-related factors.

Signs and symptoms of hypercalcaemia include polyuria, nausea and vomiting, constipation, weakness, obtundation, and, in severe cases, coma. Early symptoms can be mild and difficult to distinguish from the underlying cancer or side effects of cancer therapy. When hypercalcaemia of malignancy is suspected, blood calcium concentrations should be measured; total blood calcium concentrations, adjusted for albumin, above 10.2 mg/dL are diagnostic of hypercalcaemia. It should be noted, however, that disease development and the severity of symptoms are related to both the absolute blood calcium level and to the rate of increase.

Hypercalcaemia of malignancy can occur in patients with or without osteolytic bone metastases and is thus classified as osteolytic or humoral, respectively. Elevation of circulating PTHrP level has a central role in the pathogenesis of both humoral and osteolytic hypercalcaemia of malignancy. A study of 30 patients with solid tumours and humoral hypercalcaemia of malignancy revealed that up to 80% of individuals had raised plasma PTHrP concentrations compared with healthy controls. Elevated circulating PTHrP levels have also been reported in 65% of patients with bone metastases and hypercalcaemia.

### Approach to diagnosis and treatment of hypercalcemia in a patient with malignancy [^111wsekJ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is a common complication of malignancy and portends a worse prognosis. It causes a variety of symptoms in patients, which can range from confusion and polyuria to coma and death. There are 4 broad mechanistic categories to classify hypercalcemia of malignancy: local osteolysis secondary to metastatic cancer or multiple myeloma, excess parathyroid-related hormone, excess 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production, and ectopic parathyroid hormone production. Volume expansion with normal saline solution and treatment with intravenous bisphosphonates to decrease osteoclast-mediated bone destruction are effective initial therapies. Calcitonin, gallium nitrate, and corticosteroids can serve as adjunctive therapies. Denosumab is an attractive therapeutic option for refractory cases of hypercalcemia, although more data are required before this therapy can be recommended.

### Phase I / II study of 19-nor-1 α-25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 (paricalcitol) in advanced, androgen-insensitive prostate cancer [^1143csAh]. Clinical Cancer Research (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

We assessed the safety and efficacy of the vitamin D analogue, 19-nor-1alpha-25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 (paricalcitol), in patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer.

Experimental Design

Patients received paricalcitol i.v. three times per week on an escalating dose of 5 to 25 microg (3–15 microg/m2). The primary end point was prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response. Secondary end points were characterization of toxicity in this population, changes in serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), and survival.

Results

A total of 18 patients were enrolled. No patient showed a sustained 50% drop in serum PSA, despite several large declines in PSA (e.g., 1,300 ng/mL). Paricalcitol was well tolerated. One instance of significant hypercalcemia, a serum calcium of 14.3 mg/dL, was observed at the highest dose (25 microg). At entry into the study, seven (41%) of the patients had elevated serum levels of PTH, which were significantly reduced by paricalcitol. Higher levels of serum PTH at study entry were significantly and negatively associated with survival (P < 0.01).

Conclusion

No objective responses were seen in the primary end point. However, elevated serum levels of PTH, a common feature of advanced prostate cancer, were reduced by paricalcitol. Because elevated PTH is associated with increased cardiovascular and skeletal morbidity, including an increased risk for pathologic fracture, further evaluation of paricalcitol in the reduction of skeletal morbidity in advanced prostate cancer is warranted.

Severe hypocalcaemia

For symptomatic or at-risk patients, or those possibly/probably non-compliant with oral calcium supplement, intravenous calcium should be administered if corrected serum calcium concentration falls below 1.9 mmol/l (ionized calcium < 1.0 mmol/l; i.e.g.rade ≥ 2). Asymptomatic patients with a corrected serum calcium below 1.9 mmol/l can rapidly become critically ill, and so it is important to treat and monitor these patients closely.

Intravenously administered calcium gluconate (10%) is preferred to calcium chloride, which is a strong irritant. It can be given as repeated 50–100 mL boluses in 5% dextrose or by continuous infusion. If calcium chloride is given, it should be administered via a central line to prevent irritation of veins. In order to avoid precipitation of calcium salts, phosphate and bicarbonate should not be infused with the calcium. Patients with severe hypocalcaemia should also receive oral calcium supplements (as described above) and vitamin D (e.g. 50,000 IU each week for 8 weeks or calcitriol 0.5–1 μg/day for patients with hypoparathyroidism) as needed. Treatment should be repeated until symptoms have subsided. It should be noted that hypocalcaemia can be prolonged, so continuous administration of a dilute solution of calcium for a few days may be required. Magnesium replacement should also be given (as described above) to those who are hypomagnesaemic. Cardiac monitoring during intravenous calcium administration is recommended because the rapid elevation of serum calcium concentration required to correct hypocalcaemia can result in cardiac arrhythmia.

Key safety considerations for denosumab and bisphosphonates

Denosumab and bisphosphonate safety profiles have been described previously and are generally acceptable. However, adverse events should be considered when assessing the benefit–risk ratio, particularly given the likelihood that denosumab and bisphosphonates will be used for longer in clinical practice than has been investigated historically.

Denosumab and bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption and reduce skeletal calcium release; consequently, they are associated with a hypocalcemia risk. In the comparative study of denosumab 120 mg and zoledronic acid 4 mg every 4 weeks, hypocalcemia occurred in 13% and 6% of patients, respectively. The higher hypocalcemia incidence with denosumab vs zoledronic acid was consistent with its greater antiresorptive effect. Hypocalcemia appears to occur most often during the initial stages of therapy, but stabilizes thereafter and does not increase with exposure duration. Label guidelines for zoledronic acid and denosumab advise calcium and vitamin D supplementation, pre-treatment low serum vitamin D and calcium correction, and serum calcium monitoring during treatment.

### Clues from hypercalcaemia [^115Mxs2n]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

PTHrP stimulates osteoclastic bone resorption. Studies in breast cancer have shown that PTHrP is expressed in most breast primaries and bony metastases, but to a lesser extent in visceral metastases. The question then arises whether PTHrP is not merely a marker for bony metastases but also prognostic factor for progression. Animal experiments using a PTHrP-expressing cell line and blocking monoclonal antibody have demonstrated the importance of PTHrP in progression to metastatic bone disease, while cell culture work indicates that PTHrP can function as a transforming growth factor. There is, then, a high index of suspicion in breast cancer that PTHrP is a key factor in the development of bony metastases.

Prostate cancer has a different natural history to breast cancer. Hypercalcaemia is uncommon in prostate cancer and metastases are predominantly osteoblastic. It is important to realise, however, that the osteoblastic response seen in prostate cancer is preceded, at a cellular level, by osteoclast activation. The difference between breast and prostate, therefore, is not that osteoclast activation occurs or does not occur, but rather that in prostatic metastases an intense osteoblastic reaction is also present. Elegant experiments using in vivo inocculation of paired transfected and untransfected cell lines have, furthermore, indicated a greater metastatic potential for the transfected lines mirroring the results in breast cancer.

The paper by Bryden et al. (2002) in this issue of the journal extends observations of PTHrP expression in other tumours to prostate cancer. The authors have demonstrated a high rate of concordance for the expression of both PTHrP and its receptor in paired primary tumours and bony metastases. The ultimate purpose of studies such as these is either to identify new markers of prognostic importance, or to provide a mechanistic explanation of disease progression which may yield new therapeutic targets. The high frequency of expression in primary prostate cancers would seem to indicate that PTHrP is a poor discriminator of metastatic potential. However, the sample sizes are small, and larger studies linking PTHrP expression to outcome are required to demonstrate any prognostic significance of this observation. The role of experimental therapeutics directed against PTHrP may seem nonsensical, since the numerous factors which come into play by the time metastatic bone disease has developed implies that there is no role for PTHrP-directed intervention. If, however, a link between PTHrP and progression to bone disease is established, then targetting the PTHrP at earlier disease stages might eventually lead to a change in the natural history of prostate cancer.

### Estramustine-related hypocalcemia in patients with prostate carcinoma and osteoblastic metastases [^113JpSGY]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

We describe a patient with androgen-independent prostate cancer in whom hypocalcemia developed during treatment with estramustine. The patient's total serum calcium level before and after the initiation of estramustine was 8.3 and 4.3 mg/dL, respectively (normal range 8.4 to 10.2). This finding prompted us to review the calcium levels in 135 consecutive patients who were also undergoing treatment with a similar estramustine-containing regimen. We found that hypocalcemia had developed in 20% of these patients during treatment. We speculate that estramustine may cause hypocalcemia by inhibiting the mobilization of calcium and the action of the parathyroid hormone in the skeleton.

Bone health in prostate cancer — antiresorptive agents, dosing, cautions, and monitoring: Antiresorptive medications that increase bone mineral density and reduce disease‑related skeletal complications during ADT include denosumab 60 mg subcutaneously (SQ) every 6 months, zoledronic acid 5 mg IV annually, and alendronate 70 mg PO weekly, and treatment with either denosumab, zoledronic acid, or alendronate sodium is recommended when the absolute fracture risk warrants drug therapy. Bisphosphonates (zoledronic acid or alendronate) can cause acute phase reaction, joint pain, hypocalcemia, osteonecrosis of the jaw, nephrotoxicity with need for dose modification for renal insufficiency, ocular toxicities, and atypical femoral fractures with prolonged use (> 3 to 5 years), while denosumab can cause hypocalcemia, osteonecrosis of the jaw, and atypical femoral fractures with prolonged use. Denosumab‑associated hypocalcemia risk factors include blastic bone metastases, renal impairment, vitamin D deficiency, lack of prophylactic supplementation of calcium and/or vitamin D, preexisting hypoparathyroidism, hypomagnesemia, and gastric bypass; although renal monitoring is not required, denosumab is not recommended in patients with a creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min. Calcium, creatinine, and vitamin D levels should be checked prior to initiating therapy, periodic monitoring of serum calcium levels is recommended with denosumab use, and after stopping denosumab it is recommended to administer at least one dose of a potent bisphonate (zoledronic acid or 5 mg) to prevent rebound bone loss and presumably rebound fracture.

### Hypocalcaemia following denosumab in prostate cancer: a clinical review [^117B71JZ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Denosumab is often used in men with advanced prostate cancer to prevent skeletal-related events, but can be associated with severe hypocalcaemia. Our objective was to review the pathophysiology, identify risk factors and provide recommendations for prevention and management of denosumab-associated hypocalcaemia.

Design

We reviewed the literature regarding denosumab-associated severe hypocalcaemia, defined as necessitating hospitalization for intravenous calcium treatment, in the context of prostate cancer.

Patients

Men with prostate cancer with severe denosumab-associated hypocalcemia.

Results

We identified 20 men with prostate cancer with severe denosumab-associated hypocalcemia, including the present case. Median age (range) was 70 years (45–86). All had skeletal metastases and presented with symptomatic hypocalcemia 16 days (4–35) after the initial (n = 18) or second (n = 2) denosumab treatment, with a serum total calcium of 1.36 mmol/L (1.13–1.91). The key risk factor was presence of active osteoblastic metastases, evidenced by elevated serum alkaline phosphatase, 838 U/L (58–2620) and supportive imaging. Other risk factors reported in some men included vitamin D deficiency (< 50 nmol/L), 25-OH vitamin D 44 nmol/L (22–81), renal impairment, serum creatinine 103 μmol/L (62–1131) and hypomagnesaemia, 0.82 mmol/L (0.29–1.20). Men received intravenous calcium infusions for 16 days (1–90), and median total intravenous elemental calcium requirements were 3.17 g (0.47–26.65).

Conclusions

Denosumab treatment in men with metastatic prostate cancer can be associated with life-threatening hypocalcaemia requiring prolonged hospitalization for intravenous calcium treatment. Modifiable risk factors should be corrected before denosumab administration. In men with active osteoblastic metastases, consideration should be given to delay denosumab treatment until underlying disease activity is controlled, and/or be administered with close monitoring and proactive treatment with calcium and calcitriol.

### Hyperparathyroidism [^1176xNEt]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on primary hyperparathyroidism:

- **Definition**: Primary hyperparathyroidism is an endocrine disorder of calcium metabolism resulting from an abnormal increase in the secretion of PTH from one or more of the parathyroid glands.
- **Pathophysiology**: Primary hyperparathyroidism is primarily caused by solitary parathyroid adenoma (80%), four-gland hyperplasia (10–15%), multiple adenomas (5%), and parathyroid cancer (< 1%).
- **Epidemiology**: The average incidence of primary hyperparathyroidism in men and women in the US is 24.7 and 65.5 cases per 100,000 person-years, respectively. The age-adjusted prevalence in men and women is 85.2 and 232.7 per 100,000 individuals, respectively.
- **Disease course**: Primary hyperparathyroidism can present with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic biochemical abnormalities to overt end-organ complications. In developed countries, approximately 85% of patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis, identified incidentally through routine biochemical screening, while around 20% present with renal manifestations (such as nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis), skeletal complications (including fractures, osteitis fibrosa cystica, or bone pain), or symptomatic hypercalcemia. In contrast, the majority of patients in developing countries present with symptomatic disease. Symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism is associated with overt skeletal and renal complications and may also include cardiovascular and neurocognitive symptoms. Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism is further classified based on the presence or absence of target organ involvement, such as reduced bone mineral density or kidney stones. Normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism, defined by elevated PTH levels in the setting of normal serum calcium, may also present with or without end-organ involvement.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Parathyroidectomies have > 98% cure rates. The recurrence rates of double parathyroid adenoma, hyperplasia, and single adenoma are 4.0%, 2.2%, and 1.3%, respectively.

### Parathyroid hormone-related peptide and survival of patients with cancer and hypercalcemia [^115nqiBq]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

Parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) is the predominant cause of malignancy-associated hypercalcemia. However, its prognostic utility is unclear. We aimed to determine the prognostic value of serum PTHrP levels in patients who had hypercalcemia associated with malignancy.

Methods

In this prospective case series, we evaluated 76 patients with a diagnosis of cancer and hypercalcemia (serum calcium level ≥ 10.3 mg/dL on at least two occasions). PTHrP levels ≥ 1 pmol/L were considered elevated. We used multivariate Cox regression analysis to identify factors associated with mortality.

Results

Fifty patients (66%) died during follow-up. In a multivariate analysis, higher pretreatment calcium levels and elevated PTHrP levels were associated with increased mortality, with effects of PTHrP varying by age (P = 0.03). Survival was associated with pretreatment calcium levels both in patients over 65 years of age (hazard ratio [HR] per mg/dL = 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2 to 1.8; P < 0.001) and in patients aged 65 years or less (HR = 1.3; 95% CI: 1.1 to 1.5; P = 0.003). Adjusted for pretreatment calcium levels, elevated PTHrP levels were associated with increased mortality in patients aged ≤ 65 years (HR = 3.8; 95% CI: 1.6 to 8.8; P = 0.002), but not in older patients (HR = 0.7; 95% CI: 0.3 to 1.9; P = 0.51).

Conclusion

PTHrP is a useful prognostic factor in malignancy-associated hypercalcemia, at least in patients aged ≤ 65 years.

### Hypocalcaemia in patients with prostate cancer treated with a bisphosphonate or denosumab: prevention supports treatment completion [^116ecM2a]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Identifying patients who are at high risk of hypocalcaemia

It is rare for patients with cancer to develop hypocalcaemia as a direct result of the primary tumour. However, low calcium concentrations are quite frequently observed in individuals with osteoblastic bone metastases, in whom rapid mineralization of newly formed bone sequesters calcium from the bloodstream. In retrospective analyses, conducted before the introduction of bisphosphonate or denosumab treatment, hypocalcaemia was reported in 5–13% of patients with bone metastases, depending on the formula used to correct for albumin levels. Among these patients, 35% had hypocalcaemia of grade 1, 60% grade 2, and 5% grade 3 or higher. Prevalence was highest among individuals with prostate cancer and bone metastases; 13–27% of these patients developed hypocalcaemia.

Hypocalcaemia has been reported as an adverse event associated with the use of bisphosphonates (such as zoledronic acid) and denosumab. Bisphosphonates are analogues of a natural regulator of bone metabolism, pyrophosphonate. They localise to the extracellular bone matrix from where they may prevent osteoclast differentiation, induce osteoblasts to produce osteoclast inhibitory factors, and cause apoptosis of osteoclasts. Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody against RANKL that disrupts signalling through RANK, thus preventing tumour-mediated activation of osteoclasts. Bisphosphonates and denosumab lead to reduced osteoclast activity, thus reducing bone resorption and the release of calcium from bone into the bloodstream. Preclinical and clinical data indicate that denosumab is a more efficacious inhibitor of osteoclast activity than zoledronic acid and has shown superiority in the prevention of SREs compared with zoledronic acid. Consistent with the potent action of denosumab, in a combined analysis of three clinical trials comparing denosumab and zoledronic acid in patients with bone metastases from solid tumours (including prostate cancer) or multiple myeloma, hypocalcaemia of any grade occurred more frequently with denosumab than with zoledronic acid (9.6% vs. 5%, respectively) (Fig. 1).

Bone health in prostate cancer — duration of antiresorptive therapy and drug holidays indicates that for patients receiving antiresorptive therapy, there are currently no consensus guidelines on duration of treatment; due to concerns of long-term risks of antiresorptive therapy, a "drug holiday" at 3 to 5 years can be considered based on agent utilized, stability of bone mineral density, prior fracture history, and future fracture risk. Bone mineral density should be monitored approximately every 1 to 2 years after suspending therapy, and therapy should generally be resumed if bone mineral density declines significantly or if the patient develops a new fragility fracture.

### Hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia: finding the balance [^111sDohJ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Although hypercalcaemia of malignancy often occurs with metastatic bone disease, there is no clear correlation between the extent of bone metastases and the development or severity of hypercalcaemia. This is probably because osteolytic and humoral factors can be present together; a study of 443 patients with cancer and hypercalcaemia showed that 53% of patients had osteolytic hypercalcaemia, 35% had humoral hypercalcaemia, and 12% had both osteolytic and humoral factors. Furthermore, renal function and the extent of renal tubular calcium resorption also affect blood calcium levels.

Hypercalcaemia is associated with poor prognosis. Median survival has been shown to be only 52 and 54 days for patients with mixed solid tumours or colorectal cancer, respectively, increasing to 3.5 months in lung cancer and 4.5 months in breast cancer. Furthermore, there are data suggesting that the underlying pathology of hypercalcaemia of malignancy adversely influences prognosis; a prospective case series of 76 individuals with hypercalcaemia of malignancy showed that, for those aged 65 years or older, mortality was higher in patients with higher pretreatment blood calcium and elevated PTHrP levels than in those with lower calcium and normal PTHrP levels.

Benign causes of hypercalcaemia should also be considered when diagnosing patients with cancer. To confirm a diagnosis of hypercalcaemia, blood calcium (adjusted for albumin) and PTH concentration should be measured. If PTH levels are not supressed then primary hyperparathyroidism must be suspected. Vitamin D (25(OH) vitamin D) should also be measured to eliminate excess vitamin D as the cause of hypercalcaemia. Hyperparathyroidism has been shown to be a predominant non-malignant cause of hypercalcaemia and so requires a different treatment strategy. Other causes of hypercalcaemia are much less frequent than hyperparathyroidism. Therefore, in order to optimise the care of patients with cancer and hypercalcaemia, it is important to exclude other causes, which are mainly primary hyperparathyroidism and, more rarely, excess vitamin D.

177 Lu-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is an effective treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Rarer treatment-related adverse events have not yet been described. Methods: We present case reviews of 2 men with a marked hypocalcemic osteosclerotic response to 177 Lu-PSMA-I&T therapy. A clinical dataset of 177 Lu-PSMA-I&T therapy was evaluated to estimate the incidence and clinical association with hypocalcemia. Results: Forty-one of the 127 men (32%) had a serum calcium drop, and 6 (5%) developed clinical hypocalcemia during 177 Lu-PSMA therapy. The baseline total tumor volume was significantly higher in those who developed hypocalcemia (median, 3,249 cm 3 [interquartile range, 1,856–3,852] vs. 465 [interquartile range 135–1,172]; P = 0.002). The mean prostate-specific antigen response in those with hypocalcemia was 78% (SD, 24%). Conclusion: Hypocalcemia may occur in response to 177 Lu-PSMA-I&T, particularly with both high-volume bone metastases and a significant prostate-specific antigen response, and may be severe, requiring corticosteroids. Further evaluation of 177 Lu-PSMA-induced hypocalcemia is required to better understand mechanisms, optimal treatments, and repercussions from any subsequent osteosclerotic response.

### Metabolic bone disease induced by prostate cancer: rationale for the use of bisphosphonates [^1118VVmP]. The Journal of Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

Increasing evidences indicate that despite the osteoblastic nature of metastatic bone lesions due to prostate cancer osteolysis is a regular feature and may cause skeletal morbidity. This observation provides the rationale for the use of bisphosphonates for managing bone metastatic prostate cancer.

Materials and Methods

We reviewed the literature on the mechanisms by which prostate cancer affects bone cell function and disrupts physiological bone turnover. We also summarized the clinical results of bisphosphonate for treating bone pain in patients with prostate cancer.

Results

Metastatic prostate cancer in bone interferes with physiological bone remodeling by abnormal release of the hormones and paracrine factors physiologically involved in the modulation of osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity. Tumor induced bone formation and resorption develop within the same metastasis but excessive new bone is deposited away from bone resorption sites and does not contribute to bone strength. The increase in bone resorption may also be a generalized phenomenon that is most likely due to iatrogenic osteoporosis or related to hyperparathyroidism in response to the increased calcium demand. The bone resorption index in patients with bone metastatic prostate cancer correlates with bone pain and is an independent predictor of adverse skeletal events. However, small clinical studies of the efficacy of bisphosphonates for controlling bone pain in patients with prostate cancer show contradictory results.

Conclusions

Improved understanding of the pathophysiology of prostate cancer induced metabolic bone disease implies that bisphosphonates may have a role in the treatment of this disorder. This issue is being addressed by large-scale ongoing randomized studies.

### Prognostic significance of disordered calcium metabolism in hormone-refractory prostate cancer patients with metastatic bone disease [^1149YxbP]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Bone metabolic disruption that occurs in bone metastatic prostate cancer could lead to disturbances of calcium metabolism. The prognostic role of either hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia was assessed in a consecutive series of hormone-refractory bone metastatic prostate cancer patients. Serum calcium was measured in 192 patients. The presence of hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia was related with baseline biochemical and clinical characteristics and the role of these two calcium disturbances in predicting prognosis and adverse skeletal-related events (SREs) was assessed. As compared to normocalcemic patients, hypocalcemic patients (n = 51) had higher tumor load in bone (P = 0.005), higher plasma chromogranin A (CgA, P = 0.01), serum alkaline phosphatase (P = 0.01), urinary N-telopeptide (NTX, P = 0.002) and lower hemoglobin values (P = 0.01), while hypercalcemic patients (n = 16) had higher plasma CgA (P = 0.001) and serum lactate dehydrogenase values (P = 0.001), higher bone pain (P = 0.003) and a lower frequency of pure osteoblastic lesions (P = 0.001). Hypercalcemia was significantly associated with poor prognosis: hazard ratio (HR), 1.9 (95% confidence Interval (CI) 1.2–3.3) and higher risk to develop SREs HR, 2.5 (95% CI 1.2–5.2, P = 0.01), while hypocalcemia was not associated with poor prognosis. The prognostic role of hypercalcemia was maintained in multivariate analysis after adjusting for validated prognostic parameters: HR, 2.72 (95% CI 1.1–6.8, P = 0.03). These data suggest that serum calcium levels should be taken into account in the clinical decision-making process of bone metastatic prostate cancer patients. Patients with asymptomatic hypercalcemia could benefit of a strict follow-up and an immediate bisphosphonate treatment. Further prospective clinical trials are needed to confirm this finding.

### Severe hypocalcaemia following denosumab in a patient with cancer with vitamin D deficiency [^112F9292]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody that has been widely used for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with cancer with solid tumours and bone metastases, and acts by reducing the release of calcium from bones into the bloodstream. Severe hypocalcaemia is a rare and dangerous side effect of denosumab. We present a case of a patient with metastatic prostate cancer who developed severe hypocalcaemia after receiving a single dose of denosumab. Further laboratory analysis showed that the patient had a low vitamin D level, which contributed to the development of hypocalcaemia. He required an inpatient admission for repeated doses of intravenous calcium.

### Parathyroid hormone related peptide and receptor expression in paired primary prostate cancer and bone metastases [^111yASCK]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

PTHrP expression in primary prostatic carcinoma is common. Lymph node metastases exhibit similar levels of PTHrP expression to those of poorly differentiated primary tumours. In this study mRNA for PTHrP was detected in all 14 primary prostate tumours, although expression was heterogeneous in four cases. In the corresponding bone metastases, all 14 were positively staining, all but three being uniformly stained. Previous studies of 10 and 14 archival prostatic bone metastases by immunohistochemistry have demonstrated PTHrP expression in only 50% of samples. Differences in the technique of PTHrP detection are unlikely to account for this, as concordance between immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridization for detection of PTHrP has been described suggesting that PTHrP expression is regulated at the gene level. This difference may be due to variation in PTHrP expression with tumour grade as described for primary prostate carcinoma. In our previous study 7 out of 10 specimens contained well or moderately differentiated tumour, and lower levels of PTHrP expression might be anticipated than in the exclusively poorly differentiated group of prospectively collected metastases. In the series investigated by, neither the differentiation of the metastases, nor their treatment status (untreated, hormone manipulated or escaped hormonal control) is described, and it is therefore difficult to comment given these variables. It must also be considered that the sample sizes are small and that the differences in levels of PTHrP expression might simply represent true variation.

Despite the proposed importance of PTHrP in the development of prostatic bone metastases, paradoxically, hypercalcaemia is found in less than 2% of patients. In contrast to this, hypercalcaemia is seen in up to 20% of breast cancer sufferers with bone metastases. Hypercalcaemia may be partially accounted for by the release of bone bound calcium from lytic deposits, and conversely in the sclerotic metastases of prostate cancer there is calcium 'bone hunger' for new bone formation, which may even lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism. However the humoural contribution of PTHrP to calcium homeostasis derangement is well described in breast cancer, and the detection of PTHrP is strongly correlated with hypercalcaemia. Few studies have investigated the serum levels of PTHrP in prostate cancer specifically but levels have been found to be similar to those in normocalcaemic patients without malignancy. This would be consistent with the variable secretion of PTHrP into the serum from tumours in which PTHrP can be detected. Consequently the autocrine/paracrine effects of PTHrP are not universally coupled to the humoural effects.

### Non-malignant causes of hypercalcemia in cancer patients: a frequent and neglected occurrence [^1115vWCR]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Hypercalcemia is a frequent finding in cancer patients and can be observed in any type of cancer. The physician in charge of cancer patients often ignores non-malignant causes of hypercalcemia. Our objective was to review the causes of hypercalcemia in a large series of cancer patients.

Methods

We have retrospectively studied in a Cancer Centre all consecutive hypercalcemic (Ca > 10.5 mg/dl) patients over an 8-year period. Of 699 evaluated patients, 642 were analyzed after exclusion of patients whose hypercalcemia resolved after rehydration or who had a normal Ca level after correction for protein concentrations. Clinical information was gathered on the type of cancer, its histology, whether the disease was active or in complete remission, and on the presence of bone metastases. Biochemical data included serum Ca, P(i), proteins in all patients, PTH in most patients, and PTHrP, 25OH-Vitamin D, 1,25(OH)(2)-Vitamin D, TSH, and T4 in selected cases.

Results

By order of decreasing frequency, the main causes of hypercalcemia were cancer (69.0%), primary hyperparathyroidism (24.6%), hyperthyroidism (2.2%), milk alkali syndrome (0.9%), and sarcoidosis (0.45%). In cancer-related causes, bone metastases accounted for 53.0% of the cases, humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM) for 35.3% while there were 11.7% of cases apparently due to both HHM and bone metastases. Hypercalcemia was not due to cancer in 97% (84/87) of the patients who were in complete remission. Even in patients with active neoplastic disease, the number of patients whose hypercalcemia was not due to cancer remained clinically relevant (115/555 = 20.5%). In the 158 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, 92 patients were in complete remission and 66 patients had active neoplastic disease.

Conclusions

In this large series of hypercalcemia in cancer patients, the cause was not due to cancer in almost one third of the cases. Most patients considered to be in complete remission had hypercalcemia due to a benign condition. In that perspective, serum PTH determination is essential in the approach of hypercalcemic cancer patients since primary hyperparathyroidism is by far the first non-malignant cause of hypercalcemia.

### Humoral hypercalcemia of penile carcinoma [^112wa51n]. Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is a common life-threatening complication associated with several genitourinary malignancies. Parathyroid-related peptide has been shown to cause hypercalcemia in several solid tumors but rarely in penile cancer. We report a case of advanced penile cancer with hypercalcemia and associated dysphagia. Treatment is clinically challenging and should be definitive as soon as the patient has been stabilized. Serum calcium measurement can be used for monitoring the outcome and follow-up in such patients. Dysphagia is a rare but potential symptom of hypercalcemia, but additional studies are needed to prove this association.

### Severe hypocalcaemia as a cause of seemingly idiopathic bilateral lower limb oedema [^113BxCcm]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

The existing scientific literature has not drawn a link between severe hypocalcaemia and its role in recalcitrant peripheral oedema. This phenomenon is particularly relevant in oncological and geriatric medicine as bone strengthening but serum calcium-lowering agents such as bisphosphonates and denosumab are used for osteoporosis and/or bone metastasis. This case report, through metastatic prostate cancer in a 66-year-old man with bone metastasis being treated with a monoclonal antibody denosumab, proposes the mechanism of hypocalcaemic oedema as being akin to calcium deprivation such as those induced by calcium channel antagonism. It demonstrates the importance of calcium supplementation as a concurrent treatment while patients are on these osteoclast inhibiting agents.

Discussion

An extensive body of literature reports on the association between androgen deprivation therapy and the incidence of osteoporosis. All the five studies that we identified, and that met the inclusion criteria, indicated a positive association between ADT and osteoporosis. In relation to fractures, all four of the identified studies indicated a positive association between ADT and the incidence of fractures. Furthermore, the association persisted and remained statistically significant across a number of stratified analyses that explored clinical and study quality factors.

Observational primary studies usually cannot prove causality. However, the studies in this review presented an appropriate temporal relationship; the androgen deprivation therapy and the diagnosis of prostate cancer diagnosis preceded the incidence of osteoporosis and fractures in all of the studies. Furthermore, androgen deprivation therapy depletes the circulating levels of oestrogens and androgens that maintain bone mass through suppression of bone reabsorption and promotion of bone formation. These facts impart biological plausibility to our findings on the association between PCa and ADT with osteoporosis and fractures as shown by the forests plots (Figure 3A, 3B and 4).

The lack of adjustment for the presence of metastasis (only one study adjusted for this factor), calcium ingestion (no studies) and genetic predisposition (no studies) must be considered as a limitation of our study. The presence of metastasis, a low calcium ingestion and patients with history of osteoporosis in the family had a higher risk of osteopenia, osteoporosis and fractures.

It is estimated that two million men are affected by osteoporosis in the United States. Although men experience a gradual age-related loss of BMD of 7 to 12% per decade beginning at age 30, primary male osteoporosis is not common. Most men who have clinically significant osteoporosis are older than 70 years of age and have risk factors that contribute to decreased bone mineralization, such as hypogonadism, thyroid and parathyroid disorders, glucocorticoid excess, alcoholism, osteomalacia, and malignancy. The relationship between decreased BMD and ADT is well established. Androgen suppression reduces BMD approximately 3% to 7% per year. Recent reports have demonstrated that men who have prostate cancer and are receiving ADT have BMD measurements from 6.5% to 17.3% lower than men who are not treated with ADT. One study reported that spinal and femoral BMD values were 1.7% and 5.2% less after two years and 14% and 28% less after 10 years of ADT, respectively, as compared to age-matched control subjects.

### Severe hypercalcaemia in metastatic prostate cancer with biallelic BRCA2 mutations and lytic bone lesions [^112212qg]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Molecular genetics is increasingly used to define the course and prognosis of prostate cancer. Hypercalcaemia of malignancy is a rare complication of metastatic prostate cancer associated with poor outcomes. However, no associations have yet been made in literature between pathogenic genetic mutations and hypercalcaemia in patients with prostatic malignancy. We report of a patient with bone-metastatic prostate cancer. He received sequential genetic tests for pathogenic mutations. A somatic BRCA2 truncation mutation was identified at diagnosis and suppressed on olaparib. Six months after stopping olaparib, several pathogenic mutations, including biallelic BRCA2 mutations, were identified. The patient developed large lytic bone lesions and a severe symptomatic hypercalcaemia. He was hospitalised and treated aggressively for hypercalcaemia but died shortly thereafter. To our knowledge, this is the first case of hypercalcaemia in metastatic prostate cancer to be contextualised within complex genetic mutations.

### Updates to advanced prostate cancer: AUA / SUO guideline (2023) [^111HfuAU]. The Journal of Urology (2023). High credibility.

Advanced prostate cancer — bone-protective therapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with bony metastases is directed by the recommendation: "Clinicians should prescribe a bone-protective agent (denosumab or zoledronic acid) for mCRPC patients with bony metastases to prevent skeletal-related events. (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B)". In a phase III trial, zoledronic acid at 4mg or placebo every 3 weeks for 15 months reduced skeletal-related events (SREs) (33% with zoledronic acid versus 44% with placebo; P = 0.021), prolonged time to first SRE (> 410 days with zoledronic acid and 321 days with placebo; P = 0.011), and lowered pathologic fractures (13.1% with zoledronic acid versus 22.1% for placebo). A non-inferiority trial in 1,904 men showed denosumab was non-inferior to zoledronic acid (20.7 versus 17.1 months; p = 0.0002) and superior for time to first SRE in a secondary analysis (p = 0.008); however, rates of hypocalcemia were higher with denosumab, and clinicians should monitor calcium levels prior to infusions with vitamin D repletion and SOC calcium/vitamin D maintenance. For dosing intervals, CALGB 70604 randomized 1,822 patients to zoledronic acid every 4 weeks or every 12 weeks for 2 years and demonstrated non-inferiority of 12-week dosing intervals for prevention of SREs, with no differences in pain, performance status, or toxicity including ONJ or renal dysfunction. Because osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is an uncommon but serious toxicity, clinicians should consider evaluation by a dentist prior to initiation.

Prostate cancer — prevention of symptomatic skeletal-related events (SREs) in bone-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) notes that denosumab and zoledronic acid prevent disease-related skeletal complications, and denosumab was shown to be superior to zoledronic acid for SRE prevention in metastatic CRPC, albeit with numerically higher hypocalcemia and osteonecrosis of the jaw risks. Initial trials used administration every 4 weeks; later data showed that every–12–week zoledronic acid compared to every–4–week did not increase skeletal events, and every–12–week dosing of zoledronic acid is recommended for symptomatic SRE reduction when indicated, while every–12–week denosumab is under investigation and current data suggest noninferior symptomatic skeletal events compared to every–4–week dosing. The combination of radium-223 with abiraterone was associated with increased frequency of bone fractures, particularly in individuals not receiving an antiresorptive agent. For metastatic castration-sensitive disease with bone metastases, use of osteoclast inhibitors for reduction of symptomatic SREs is not recommended. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Introduction

Bone-related morbidity is a major concern in patients dying of prostate cancer. It is estimated 90% of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) will have bone involvement before death. Bone metastases may result in a set of complications called skeletal-related events (SREs). SREs are defined as a composite of bone radiotherapy, bone surgery, pathologic fractures, hypercalcemia, and spinal cord compression. Palliative radiotherapy to bone for pain or fracture is the most common SRE with approximately 40% of patients undergoing palliative bone radiotherapy prior to death due to pain or fracture. Furthermore, rates of palliative bone radiotherapy are increasing over time and most patients treated with palliative bone radiotherapy receive multiple courses.SREs are a significant source of morbidity. They result in higher pain levels, poorer mobility, and worse quality of life indices. On a system level, SREs are linked with high health care utilization and expenditures. As such, minimizing SREs is an important goal for both patients and the health care system.

### Clues from hypercalcaemia [^111WnEqt]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

The conundrum of hypercalcaemia in malignancy occurring in the absence of extensive bony metastases was finally solved in the late 1980s with the identification and cloning of PTHrP (parathyroid hormone-related protein) and the history of this discovery is summarised by. Original work in cell lines and a renal tumour was followed by the identification of PRHrP in a wide variety of malignances. PTHrP raises serum calcium and stimulates osteoclast activity, leading to bone destruction. This seemed to suggest a simple sequence of events, but malignancy, bony metastasis and hypercalcaemia are linked by mechanisms more subtle than any single linear chain of cause and effect. PTHrP shares eight of its first 13 amino acids with PTH. This structural homology leads to shared receptor binding. There are biochemical differences in the effects of these two hormones. PTHrP is a more potent inhibitor of caliuria and promoter of phosphaturia than PTH. Circulating PTHrP is undetectable in health but present in around 80% of patients with humoral hypercalcaemia. Tissue expression of PTHrP is far more extensive than PTH, and this is reflected in a range of functions beyond calcium homeostasis. The presence of PTHrP in the uterus and the stomach, coupled with its ability to relax smooth muscle, has led to the assertion that, in these tissues at least, it is PTHrP which is the true physiological effector molecule. The role of PTHrP in placental calcium transport seems, similarly, to imply far greater functional importance than that of PTH. It is the role of PTHrP in cartilage development, however, which may reveal its significance to the progression of malignant disease. When chondrocytes form new bone they first proliferate then produce the basic extracellular matrix which will be later invaded by cellular components of bone. The chondrocytes then apoptose. The absence of PTHrP, in PTHrP knock-out mice, leads to failure of proliferation and early apoptosis. This protection of chondrocytes from apoptosis in the physiological setting is mirrored in cancer, where transfection of PTHrP into cell lines confers resistance to apoptotic stimuli.

### Pathologic fracture and metastatic spinal cord compression in patients with prostate cancer and bone metastases [^116x6drZ]. BMC Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Bone pain, MSCC and PF continue to be common events during the course of prostate cancer with skeletal metastases. Serious SRE contribute significantly to morbidity and pose challenges to those involved in palliative care for these patients. Prevention of skeletal morbidity is a worthwhile goal in high-risk patients. Candidate risk factors defining high-risk groups, e.g. ALP, NTx and hypercalcemia, need to be studied in larger databases. Future studies might need to analyse patients already receiving zoledronic acid and/or taxotere separately from those continuing on endocrine treatment alone.

patients and methods

patients

This is an analysis of patients from a randomized, double-blind, phase III trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00321620). Eligible patients were men (aged ≥ 18 years) with histologically confirmed prostate cancer, serum testosterone < 50 ng/dl following chemical/surgical castration, prior hormonal therapy, radiographic evidence of bone metastasis, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2, and adequate renal and hepatic function. Patients were excluded if they had any prior denosumab or bisphosphonate treatment, investigational product exposure or participated in another clinical trial within the previous 30 days; planned radiotherapy or surgery to bone; brain metastasis; osteonecrosis or osteomyelitis of the jaw or jaw condition requiring oral surgery; nonhealed or planned dental/oral surgery; or life expectancy < 6 months. Patients provided written informed consent; the study protocol was approved by each site's ethics committee.

study design and treatment

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either subcutaneous denosumab 120 mg plus i.v. placebo every 4 weeks or subcutaneous placebo plus i.v. zoledronic acid 4 mg every 4 weeks. Zoledronic acid doses were adjusted for renal function per the label using the Cockcroft-Gault formula and withheld for significant renal deterioration during the study. Denosumab doses were not adjusted. Daily supplementation with calcium (≥ 500 mg) and vitamin D (≥ 400 IU) was recommended unless hypercalcemia developed. Randomization was stratified by previous SRE (yes versus no), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level (< 10 ng/ml versus ≥ 10 ng/ml), and current (within 6 weeks before randomization) chemotherapy for prostate cancer (yes versus no).

### Advanced prostate cancer as a cause of oncogenic osteomalacia: an underdiagnosed condition [^115QjASw]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) is a paraneoplastic bone mineral disturbance related to fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) overproduction by the tumor, usually from mesenchymal origin. Such condition leads to high phosphate renal wasting and, consequently, to cumbersome symptoms as weakness, bone pain, and fractures.

Method

Case report.

Result

We report a case of an advanced castration-refractory prostate cancer patient, which developed severe hypophosphatemia with elevated phosphate excretion fraction. TIO was suspected, and increased levels of FGF23 reinforced such diagnosis. The patient died 4 months after being diagnosed with TIO.

Conclusion

This case suggests that TIO has a dismal prognosis in prostate cancer patients. The clinical oncology community must be aware about such disturbance that can be present in those patients with weakness, bone pain, and hypophosphatemia.

### Hypocalcemia following pamidronate administration for bone metastases of solid tumor: three clinical case reports [^115ypTSH]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2003). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonates, such as pamidronate, are a new class of drugs, initially described for treatment of neoplasic hypercalcemia. Currently, they also may be used in the treatment of bone metastases from solid tumor, even without hypercalcemia. Hypocalcemia is a potential adverse effect of these drugs, which is considered infrequent and rarely symptomatic. We describe three cases of severe hypocalcemia following one injection of pamidronate. The three patients had bone metastases from solid tumors (breast in two cases, prostate in one), at least partially osteoblastic, and none had hypercalcemia. The induced hypocalcemia was rapid in onset, severe, and durable. The mechanism seems to be multiple and may include both the expected reduction of osteolysis and also a rapid and direct action on parathyroid glands followed by resistance to parathormone. Some elements could amplify the phenomenon, such as latent hypoparathyroidism after surgery, cervical radiotherapy, hypomagnesemia, or low 25 hydroxy vitamin D (25OH D). For patients who have such risk factors, it may be useful to check calcium several days after the first injection.

### Cancer-related hypercalcemia | JCO oncology practice… [^112MGhRH]. ASCO (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract Hypercalcemia has been reported to occur in up to 30% of patients who have a malignancy. Hypercalcemia is most common in those who have later-stage malignancies and predicts a poor prognosis for those with it. The most common causes include humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy mediated by parathyroid hormone–related peptide, osteolytic cytokine production, and excess 1, 25-dihydroxy vitamin D production. However, the etiology is not always mediated by malignancy. Hypercalcemia can occur in those with malignancy and an additional etiology for hypercalcemia such as primary hyperparathyroidism or granulomatous diseases. This paper reviews the cancers associated with hypercalcemia and their proposed mechanisms, nontumor-mediated hypercalcemia, as well as diagnosis and treatment strategies for each condition.

### Endocrine society hypercalcemia of malignancy guidelines… [^116YydmG]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

For hypercalcemia due to high calcitriol levels with symptomatic or severe hypercalcemia despite glucocorticoid therapy, the addition of IV BP or Dmab is suggested. Patients with parathyroid carcinoma can be treated with calcimimetic and/or antiresorptive therapy depending on the severity and results from initial treatment. dysfunction, kidney failure, and arrhythmias with rapidly rising calcium levels or severe hypercalcemia. 1 Pathophysiology followed by HCM can include production of parathyroid hormone–related peptides, bone metastases releasing osteoclast activating factors, and excess production of calcitriol. 2 Treatment of HCM begins with intravenous hydration, potent antiresorptive agents, and calcitonin for severe hypercalcemia.

Following initial treatment, identification and/or treatment of the underlying malignancy is critical for controlling HCM and preventing its recurrence. Hypercalcemia of malignancy due to parathyroid carcinoma may be treated with antiresorptive therapy and/or calcimimetic therapy, depending on the severity. For all forms of HCM, there is uncertainty about the best agents to use, given the particular clinical circumstances, and in what order. For refractory or recurrent HCM despite IV BP, Dmab was suggested based on evidence from 3 single-arm studies of 44 patients with solid tumors or multiple myeloma and HCM that was refractory to treatment with BP that demonstrated the association of Dmab with decreased serum calcium levels in such patients. For hypercalcemia associated with parathyroid carcinoma, the panel cited indirect evidence from studies of primary hyperparathyroidism and parathyroid carcinoma since the pathophysiology of hypercalcemia is the same.

Two RCTs showed that oral BP was not associated with a statistically significant benefit vs placebo in resolving hypercalcemia in primary hyperparathyroidism. 3 However, the panel suggested that IV compared with oral BP would have a greater potential for efficacy based on its increased potency, as well as data from several case series.

### Hypercalcemia of malignancy: a new twist on an old problem | JCO oncology practice… [^115Hz6Aj]. ASCO (2016). Low credibility.

Accompanying ArticleClinical ReviewsCancer-Related Hypercalcemia Hypercalcemia associated with malignancy is an old clinical problem, first described by Fuller Albright more than 50 years ago. It can cause significant morbidity in patients with cancer and is associated with a poor prognosis in most patients. Goldner 5makes several important points in this review. First, the clinician must determine if the hypercalcemia is indeed a result of malignancy, rather than just associated with a nonmalignant cause of hypercalcemia such as primary hyperparathyroidism. After this has been established, treatment is directed against the cancer as well as the hypercalcemia.

Tumor-produced systemic factors, such as parathyroid hormone–related peptide or 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D, or locally active factors in bone, such as interleukin-6 or tumor necrosis factor-α, disrupt normal calcium homeostasis by excessive stimulation of osteoclastic bone resorption, in addition to lesser effects, to increase renal tubular reabsorption of calcium to result in hypercalcemia. As therapy evolved to include the most potent bisphosphonates, our understanding of the pathophysiology also evolved. The discovery that most tumor osteolytic factors, either humoral or local, stimulated bone resorption via receptor activator of nuclear factor κ B–ligand led to more potent therapy to block osteoclastic bone resorption with the monoclonal antibody denosumab directed against this powerful stimulator of osteoclast formation and resorption.

Indeed, recent reports indicate that denosumab is effective to reduce serum calcium concentration in the setting of bisphosphonate resistance and is more effective than zoledronic acid to prevent hypercalcemia associated with bone metastases. 6–8. One downside to this new and more potent treatment is the increased risk of hypocalcemia. Thus, calcium should be closely monitored with the use of denosumab. Furthermore, because the studies describing denosumab use are small or retrospective analyses, further clinical studies using denosumab in the setting of hypercalcemia of malignancy are indicated. A future molecular target for the treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy involves PTHrP-related antibodies. In an animal model, PTHrP antibodies corrected hypercalcemia and also suppressed the release of cytokines associated with malignancy.
