## Question

A 52-year-old man with end-stage renal disease is being evaluated for kidney transplantation. His serology reveals he is varicella zoster virus (VZV) seropositive. He has no history of prior herpes zoster vaccination. He lives with his 48-year-old wife and 20-year-old daughter, both of whom are VZV seronegative. The transplant team asks you to advise on appropriate pre-transplant vaccination strategies for the patient and his household.

Based on current guidelines, what vaccination(s) should be recommended for this patient and his household members prior to transplantation?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about appropriate pre-transplant vaccination strategies for a 52-year-old man with end-stage renal disease who is VZV seropositive, has never received a herpes zoster vaccine, and lives with two VZV-seronegative household members (wife and adult daughter), with the goal of advising what vaccinations should be recommended for the patient and his household prior to kidney transplantation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's VZV serostatus and how that changes the indication for zoster vaccination. Then, I should verify the timing of zoster vaccination relative to transplant and whether to use the live versus non-live formulation. Next, I will consider the household members' serostatus and whether they should receive varicella vaccine and, if so, which formulation and timing. After that, I need to check general pre-transplant vaccination principles and whether any delays in transplantation are required. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant plan and confirm safety nuances, including any exceptions or special circumstances.

> Let me first confirm the patient's risk and indication for herpes zoster vaccination. Because he is VZV seropositive, he has latent VZV and is at increased risk for herpes zoster, which is common and often severe in transplant recipients, so vaccination is indicated to prevent shingles and its complications, and the preferred product is the recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV, Shingrix), which is non-live and can be given to immunocompromised candidates when appropriately timed pre-transplant [^663e49d9] [^a9af8214].

> Wait, let me verify the timing and formulation details so I don't overstate anything. KDIGO recommends completing live attenuated vaccines at least 4 weeks before transplantation and delaying transplant by 4 weeks if a live vaccine is given, whereas inactivated vaccines can be given pre- or post-transplant with better immunogenicity when given pre-transplant; importantly, RZV is a non-live recombinant subunit vaccine, so it is not subject to the 4-week transplant delay rule, though giving it pre-transplant maximizes response and is preferred when feasible [^8a57dea9] [^4284a738] [^663e49d9].

> Hold on, I should verify the exact regimen and whether age 52 changes the indication. ACIP recommends a 2-dose RZV series at 0 and 2–6 months for adults aged 50 years and older, and also for immunocompromised adults aged 19 years and older; thus, at 52 years old and as a transplant candidate, he should receive RZV as a 2-dose series, ideally completing both doses before transplantation to optimize immunogenicity, with no need to delay transplant solely for this non-live vaccine [^a9af8214] [^663e49d9].

> Next, I should review the household members' situation. Because his wife and daughter are VZV seronegative, they are susceptible to primary varicella and could serve as a source of exposure to the patient; vaccinating them reduces the risk of household transmission and indirectly protects the future transplant recipient, so they should receive varicella vaccine if they have no contraindications [^5d2cffb3] [^11302d12].

> I need to ensure I specify the correct formulation and timing for the household. The varicella vaccine is live-attenuated, so for transplant candidates and their close contacts, it should be given at least 4 weeks before transplantation to avoid viremia around the time of immunosuppression; if the household members cannot complete the series before transplant, they should still be vaccinated, but extra precautions may be needed post-transplant until immunity is established, and the transplant team should coordinate timing accordingly [^8a57dea9] [^5d2cffb3].

> Let me consider the broader pre-transplant vaccination context so I don't miss essentials. Pre-transplant vaccination is most effective when completed early, and inactivated vaccines can be accelerated if needed; candidates should also be up to date on influenza, pneumococcal, hepatitis B, and other age-appropriate inactivated vaccines, while live vaccines must be completed at least 4 weeks pre-transplant with a 4-week transplant delay if given; I should confirm that the team is addressing these concurrently with the VZV-related plan [^8a57dea9] [^4284a738] [^daef4a24].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on significant immunosuppression pre-transplant? I should double-check that RZV is still acceptable. RZV is non-live and can be administered to immunocompromised adults, including transplant candidates, recognizing that immunogenicity may be reduced with more intense immunosuppression; nonetheless, pre-transplant vaccination is still recommended when possible, and antivirals active against VZV do not preclude RZV administration, though coordinating antiviral timing can be considered to optimize response [^a9af8214] [^663e49d9].

> I will now examine the household transmission risk to ensure the recommendation is balanced. Household transmission of VZV from susceptible contacts can cause primary varicella in the candidate, which carries higher morbidity in immunocompromised hosts; vaccinating seronegative household members is a recognized strategy to reduce this risk and is endorsed in transplant guidance for solid organ candidates, reinforcing the need to immunize the wife and daughter pre-transplant when feasible [^5d2cffb3] [^11302d12].

> Let me synthesize the final, actionable plan and make sure I haven't overlooked anything critical. For the 52-year-old VZV-seropositive ESRD patient: administer RZV as a 2-dose series at 0 and 2–6 months, aiming to complete both doses before transplantation; no transplant delay is required for this non-live vaccine, though earlier completion improves immunogenicity. For the 48-year-old wife and 20-year-old daughter: administer the live-attenuated varicella vaccine as a 2-dose series 4–8 weeks apart, ensuring the series is completed at least 4 weeks before transplantation; if this timing cannot be met, coordinate with the transplant team for post-transplant precautions and consider prioritizing completion of the series as soon as possible [^a9af8214] [^663e49d9] [^8a57dea9] [^5d2cffb3].

Pre-transplant, the **patient should receive the recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV, Shingrix)** in a 2-dose series (0, 2–6 months) [^663e49d9] [^a9af8214] because he is VZV-seropositive and at high risk for shingles after transplantation [^23a18fec]. RZV is preferred over the live vaccine because it is **non-live and safe** for immunocompromised candidates [^663e49d9] [^a9af8214]; if the live vaccine is given, transplant must be delayed by 4 weeks [^8a57dea9] [^9c7eb0ed]. His VZV-seronegative wife and daughter should receive the **varicella vaccine** (2 doses, 4–8 weeks apart) [^b70d8bcb] at least 4 weeks before transplant to prevent household transmission [^8a57dea9] [^5d2cffb3]. Live vaccines are contraindicated post-transplant, so completing these now is essential [^06536f90] [^1534ae41].

## Patient vaccination recommendations

### Recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV, Shingrix)

- **Indication**: Recommended for immunocompromised adults aged ≥ 19 years, including transplant candidates [^a9af8214].
- **Schedule**: 2 doses, 2–6 months apart [^a9af8214].
- **Timing**: Administer before transplantation when feasible; if not, give ≥ 6–12 months post-transplant at stable immunosuppression [^a9af8214].
- **Rationale**: RZV is non-live and safe for immunocompromised patients; live zoster vaccine is contraindicated post-transplant [^663e49d9] [^06536f90].

---

### Alternative: live attenuated zoster vaccine (ZVL, Zostavax)

- **Indication**: Only if RZV is unavailable or contraindicated.
- **Timing**: ≥ 4 weeks before transplantation; if given, delay transplant by 4 weeks [^8a57dea9] [^9c7eb0ed].
- **Rationale**: Live vaccine is contraindicated post-transplant due to risk of disseminated infection [^06536f90] [^1534ae41].

---

## Household vaccination recommendations

### Varicella vaccine for seronegative household contacts

- **Indication**: Vaccinate VZV-seronegative close contacts (wife and daughter) to prevent household transmission [^5d2cffb3] [^11302d12].
- **Schedule**: 2 doses, 4–8 weeks apart [^notfound].
- **Timing**: Complete ≥ 4 weeks before transplantation [^8a57dea9].
- **Rationale**: Reduces risk of primary varicella in the transplant recipient, which can be severe or fatal [^5d2cffb3] [^11302d12].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Vaccine** | **Recipient** | **Schedule** | **Timing** |
|-|-|-|-|
| RZV (Shingrix) | Patient (VZV-seropositive) | 2 doses, 2–6 months apart | Before transplantation |
| Varicella vaccine | Wife and daughter (VZV-seronegative) | 2 doses, 4–8 weeks apart | ≥ 4 weeks before transplantation |

---

## Clinical considerations

- **Immunogenicity**: Vaccine responses are better pre-transplant than post-transplant; prioritize pre-transplant vaccination [^481a4dd0] [^8c7a70c7].
- **Safety**: RZV is safe in immunocompromised patients; monitor for standard adverse effects [^a9af8214].
- **Coordination**: Align vaccination with transplant timing to ensure immunity before immunosuppression [^8a57dea9].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

- **Patient**: Receive RZV (Shingrix) as a 2-dose series before transplantation [^663e49d9] [^a9af8214].
- **Household**: Wife and daughter should complete varicella vaccination ≥ 4 weeks before transplantation [^1105d81e] [^5d2cffb3].
- **Rationale**: These measures reduce shingles risk in the patient and prevent household varicella transmission, optimizing safety around transplantation [^663e49d9] [^5d2cffb3].

### Immunocompromised adults… [^a9af8214]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

At a glance ACIP recommends 2 doses of recombinant zoster vaccine for the prevention of shingles and related complications in adults aged ≥ 19 years who are or will be immunodeficient or immunosuppressed because of disease or therapy. The risk of deferring vaccination, and thus not mitigating the increased risk for shingles and related complications in immunocompromised patients, should be weighed against a possible diminished response to RZV if given during periods of more intense immunosuppression. Timing considerations for specific patients Hematopoietic cell transplant recipients
- **Autologous HCT**: Administer RZV at least 3–12 months after transplantation, depending on timing of discontinuation of prophylactic antiviral therapy; vaccination prior to discontinuation of antiviral therapy is preferred.
- **Allogeneic HCT**: Administer RZV at least 6–12 months after transplantation, depending on timing of discontinuation of prophylactic antiviral therapy; vaccination prior to discontinuation of antiviral therapy is preferred. Solid organ transplant recipients
- When possible, administer RZV prior to transplantation.
- If vaccination prior to transplantation is not possible, administer RZV at least 6–12 months after transplantation, preferably at a time of stable graft function, and on maintenance immunosuppression. Patients with cancer
- When possible, administer RZV prior to chemotherapy, treatment with immunosuppressive medications, radiation therapy, or splenectomy.
- If vaccination prior to chemotherapy, treatment with immunosuppressive medications, radiation therapy, or splenectomy is not possible, administer RZV:
- When the immune system is no longer acutely suppressed, or.

Patients living with HIV
- Antiretroviral treatment for human immunodeficiency virus may improve immune response to vaccination.
- While greater immunogenicity has been seen in the setting of viral suppression or higher CD4 cell counts with some vaccines, administration of inactivated or recombinant vaccines does not have to be delayed if these criteria have not been met, especially if that would lead to a significant delay of vaccine administration.
- Patients with advanced HIV should receive RZV, because the risk of shingles is further increased in the setting of such immune compromise. Patients with prior varicella or herpes zoster vaccine RZV may be administered to people who previously received varicella vaccine. People who previously received ZVL should receive RZV. Studies have shown that ZVL effectiveness wanes substantially over time, leaving recipients with reduced protection against shingles.

Patients taking antiviral medications Shingles is caused by varicella-zoster virus, the same virus that causes varicella, or chickenpox. After a person recovers from varicella, the virus stays dormant in their body. The virus can reactivate years or decades later, causing shingles. Acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovirare antiviral medications that are active against herpesviruses, including VZV.
- Shingles risk is reduced during antiviral treatment. Since RZV is not a live virus vaccine, RZV may be administered while patients are taking antiviral medications if indicated.
- For patients taking prophylactic antiviral medications, vaccination with RZV should ideally be initiated approximately 2 months prior to discontinuation of antiviral therapy. Other special populations Patients with a history of herpes zoster Shingles can recur. Patients with a history of shingles should receive RZV.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline in post-operative care in the kidney transplant recipient [^9e9e3dd6]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Kidney Transplant Recipient (KTR): infection complications (Guidelines 8.1–8.7)

Guideline 8.1 – KTR: vaccination

Guideline 8.1.1 – KTR: vaccination

We recommend that KTRs:
Should be vaccinated with inactivated viruses as per the normal population (1D)
Should receive annual influenza vaccination unless contraindicated (1C)

Guideline 8.1.2 – KTR: vaccination

We suggest that KTRs:
Should have HBsAb levels rechecked annually and consider revaccination if antibody titres fall below 10mIU/ml (2D)
Should not receive live attenuated vaccines (2C)
Should receive pneumococcal vaccine and a booster every 5 years (2D)

Rationale

Vaccination for KTRs and their household members should ideally be completed prior to transplantation. A minimum of 4 weeks is recommended between vaccination with live attenuated vaccines and transplantation. After transplantation, there is no evidence to link vaccination with rejection. After transplantation it is safe to administer inactivated vaccines but live attenuated vaccines should be avoided (see Table 4 below) as small studies have demonstrated concerns regarding their safety and efficacy in KTRs. Vaccination should probably be carried out at least 3 months and preferably 6 months after transplantation when the immunosuppression has been reduced. Consideration should be given to vaccination of close household contacts where appropriate e.g. Varicella vaccination for children of VZV seronegative KTRs.

Table 4
Commonly used inactive and live attenuated vaccines

The HPV vaccine has been assessed in a small study of transplant recipients. Although the vaccine was safe and tolerated, immunogenicity was suboptimal. There is a strong link between HPV and anogenital and non-melanoma skin cancer and, given the tolerability of these vaccines, some authors have recommended vaccination for all female KTRs aged between 9 and 26. Malaria prophylaxis should consist of chloroquine in sensitive areas, but it may increase levels of ciclosporin. Prophylaxis should therefore start 2 weeks prior to departure to permit monitoring of drug levels. In areas of chloroquine-resistance three options can be used: atovaquone and proguanil; mefloquine; or doxycycline. The choice of agent will be dictated by local preference and side effect profile but drugs should be started a few weeks prior to departure to allow for checks of renal and hepatic function, full blood count and immunosuppression levels. More extensive guidance is available for KTRs who are travelling overseas.

### Immunization after kidney transplantation-what is necessary and what is safe? [^481a4dd0]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2014). Medium credibility.

Many transplant recipients are not protected against vaccine-preventable illnesses, primarily because vaccination is still an underutilized tool both before and after transplantation. This missed opportunity for protection can result in substantial morbidity, graft loss and mortality. Immunization strategies should be formulated early in the course of renal disease to maximize the likelihood of vaccine-induced immunity, particularly as booster or secondary antibody responses are less affected by immune compromise than are primary or de novo antibody responses in naive vaccine recipients. However, live vaccines should be avoided in immunocompromised hosts. Although some concern has been raised regarding increased HLA sensitization after vaccination, no clinical data to suggest harm currently exists; overall, non-live vaccines seem to be immunogenic, protective and safe. In organ transplant recipients, some vaccines are indicated based on specific risk factors and certain vaccines, such as hepatitis B, can protect against donor-derived infection. Vaccines given to close contacts of renal transplant recipients can provide an additional layer of protection against infectious diseases. In this article, optimal vaccination of adult transplant recipients, including safety, efficacy, indication and timing, is reviewed.

### Primary varicella after transplantation [^9f1131ad]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

A 51-year-old white woman 6 months status post cadaveric renal transplant developed a mild case of primary varicella-zoster (VZ). It is hypothesized that the limited nature of her illness was due to infection with vaccine-type VZ virus instead of wild-type VZ. Approximately 1 month prior, she had daily household contact with a child who had developed a rash after immunization with live attenuated varicella vaccine. This case highlights several important questions. Should special precautions be undertaken with renal transplant recipients naive to varicella infection after vaccination of household contacts? Should pretransplant immunization with varicella vaccine be performed routinely in naive patients? Should naive patients transplanted and maintained on immunosuppressive therapy be vaccinated? Until there are clinical trials to answer these questions, it may be instructive to consider the recommendations for pediatric and immunocompromised patients.

### First case of rapidly fatal mpox from secondary (household) transmission in a kidney transplant recipient [^03d10281]. American Journal of Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

In 2022, a global outbreak of mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) was reported outside of areas considered endemic for the disease, predominantly in persons identifying as men who have sex with men, gay, or bisexual. To date, 3 cases of mpox in solid organ transplant recipients have been published; however, no instances of secondary transmission among solid organ transplant recipients have been reported. Here, we report a case of a 53-year-old male kidney transplant recipient who contracted mpox while caring for a household contact with the disease. The patient's clinical and laboratory findings during his rapidly fatal course, autopsy findings, and genomics analysis are presented, emphasizing the need for expanded pre-exposure prophylaxis efforts in patient populations without the risk factors prioritized by public health authorities for vaccination.

### Principles of immunisation in children with solid organ transplant [^638bf9d7]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2021). Medium credibility.

Vaccine-preventable diseases (VPD) are a significant risk to paediatric solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients on lifelong immunosuppressive therapy. Children progressing to end-stage organ dysfunction are unable to mount a robust immune response. Hence, it is important to plan vaccination early in the course of disease, especially if a child is anticipated to be a SOT candidate. Vaccine recommendations need to be individualised in this population based on vaccine history and serology. Catch-up or accelerated schedules may be used to complete vaccinations before transplant. Post-transplant, immunisation is recommenced in consultation with the transplant team taking into context the time since transplant and the intensity of the immunosuppressive regime. Inactivated vaccines are safe post-transplant but postexposure prophylaxis may still be required in children with inadequate immunity to VPD. Specific vaccines may be advised for SOT recipients travelling abroad (in consultation with a travel clinic) or those entering high-risk professions. Additionally, the vaccination status of all household members and close contacts should be reviewed and optimised, offering additional protection to the transplant recipient.

### Herpes virus infections in kidney transplant patients (HINT) [^a2fdf961]. ClinicalTrials (2022). Medium credibility.

Kidney transplantation is a life-saving procedure for patients with kidney failure, and in 2021, 252 kidney transplantations were performed in Denmark. Varicella-zoster virus is a vaccine-preventable disease that causes varicella during primary infection and herpes zoster when reactivated later in life. VZV is one of the most common infections after organ transplantation, and kidney transplant recipients have high risk of herpes zoster. Furthermore, kidney transplant recipients that acquire herpes zoster have high risk of disseminated and severe disease as well as increased risk of post-herpetic neuralgia. Until 2021, the only available VZV/herpes zoster vaccines in Europe were live vaccines, and live vaccines are contraindicated in immunosuppressed individuals due to the risk of infection with the vaccine strain.

However, a new, non-live, recombinant subunit herpes zoster vaccine that can be used in immunosuppressed individuals was recently approved and became available in Denmark in October 2021. The efficacy of Shingrix® in healthy individuals is excellent both with regard to preventing herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia. However, organ transplant recipients receive high doses of immunosuppressive medication, and information on efficacy and immunogenicity of Shingrix® in immunosuppressed individuals is sparse. One randomized study found the efficacy of the vaccine to be good in patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Furthermore, one phase III randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted in 246 kidney transplant recipients, and the vaccine was found to be safe and to induce antibody responses, but the study was not powered to demonstrate efficacy.

At present, international guidelines recommend vaccination against herpes zoster prior to or after transplantation, but there is no information about the optimal timing of vaccination or duration of the immune response in transplant recipients. Poor or no antibody response after vaccinations are documented among organ transplant recipients. Vaccination prior to transplantation or early post-transplantation may be of benefit because patients are at the highest risk of infections early post-transplantation due to high load of immunosuppressive therapy, however, this is also the period with the highest risk of non-response to vaccines. It is therefore of great importance, for both individual patients and for society, to determine the optimal timing of vaccination, response rates and duration of protection prior to use of vaccines in organ transplant recipients.

The investigators will conduct a prospective observational exploratory study including kidney transplant candidates and recipients who are offered Shingrix® vaccination. Shingrix® vaccination is routine care, and vaccination is not a part of the study, and acceptance of vaccination is not mandatory to participate in the study. The study is a national collaboration that includes all Danish kidney transplantation centers and kidney transplant recipients from all Danish regions. The study has potential to contribute with necessary information to design optimal programs for vaccine roll-out and thereby to reduce the incidence of herpes zoster and herpes zoster-related complications including hospital admissions in kidney transplant recipients as well as other solid organ transplant recipients. Furthermore, the investigators will explore differences in the immune systems of kidney transplant recipients who get VZV infections and those who don't.

### Practical guide to vaccination in all stages of CKD, including patients treated by dialysis or kidney transplantation [^e5e63932]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including those receiving maintenance dialysis or with a kidney transplant. Although responses to vaccines are impaired in these populations, immunizations remain an important component of preventative care due to their favorable safety profiles and the high rate of infection in these patients. Most guidelines for patients with CKD focus on the importance of the hepatitis B, influenza, and pneumococcal vaccines in addition to age-appropriate immunizations. More data are needed to determine the clinical efficacy of these immunizations and others in this population and define optimal dosing and timing for administration. Studies have suggested that there may be a benefit to immunization before the onset of dialysis or transplantation because patients with early-stage CKD generally have higher rates of seroconversion. Because nephrologists often serve as primary care physicians for patients with CKD, it is important to understand the role of vaccinations in the preventive care of this patient population.

### A comprehensive review of immunization practices in solid organ transplant and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients [^2df8d85c]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Vaccine-preventable diseases, especially influenza, varicella, herpes zoster, and invasive pneumococcal infections, continue to lead to significant morbidity and mortality in solid organ transplant (SOT) and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients.

Methods

We highlight guideline recommendations for the use of key vaccines in SOT and HSCT recipients and to review the latest evidence and developments in the field.

Results

Physicians should vaccinate individuals with end-stage organ disease, as vaccine seroresponse rates are higher pretransplantation. Most live attenuated vaccines continue to be contraindicated post-transplantation, but there are emerging safety profile and efficacy data to support the use of specific live attenuated vaccines, such as measles, mumps, and rubella in pediatric liver or kidney transplant recipients who are on low-level maintenance immunosuppression and without recent history of allograft rejection. An inactivated subunit varicella zoster virus vaccine is currently awaiting US Food and Drug Administration approval. While we await the safety profile and efficacy data of this subunit vaccine in transplant recipients, it will likely benefit immunocompromised individuals, including transplant recipients, because the live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine is currently contraindicated in transplant recipients and transplantation candidates receiving immunosuppression.

Conclusions

There is currently no evidence that vaccines lead to allograft rejection in SOT recipients. Household contacts of SOT and HSCT recipients should be vaccinated per the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices schedule and recommendations.

Implications

Immunizations remain underutilized in transplantation patients. Although efficacy of vaccines in SOT and HSCT may be suboptimal, partial protection is preferred over no protection.

### The RECOVAC IR study: the immune response and safety of the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine in patients with chronic kidney disease, on dialysis or living with a kidney transplant [^6b7a1481]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with severe morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), on dialysis and kidney transplant recipients. Although effective COVID-19 vaccination would lead to great clinical benefit, most studies with the presently available vaccines have excluded the aforementioned patients. The resulting lack of data is a problem, because vaccine efficacy is known to be considerably lower in patients with CKD and renal replacement therapy. Recent reports have suggested that only a minority of kidney transplant recipients developed anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies after messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccination.

The REnal Patients COVID-19 VACcination Immune Response (RECOVAC IR) study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04741386) aims to assess the immunogenicity and safety of COVID-19 vaccination in these specific patient groups up to 12 months post-vaccination (Figure 1). This prospective, controlled, multicenter study includes four different cohorts: (A) 175 patients with CKD Stages 4/5 (CKD4/5) (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²), (B) 175 patients on dialysis, (C) 300 kidney transplant recipients and (D) 200 controls (family or household members) in four university medical centres across The Netherlands. Included are people > 18 years of age without previously known COVID-19, active malignancy or immune deficiency (Supplementary data, Table S1). Participants receive two doses of the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine (Moderna Biotech Spain, S.L.) with a 28-day interval.

Live vaccine and timing of vaccine in kidney transplant recipients — There is no particular reason for a 6-month lag between transplant and vaccination, and in the United States most individuals are on their baseline maintenance immunosuppression therapy by 3 months posttransplant. Recipients also should avoid intimate contact with individuals who have received live vaccines, including contact after children have received oral polio vaccine for 3 weeks, and immunosuppressed individuals are advised to avoid contact for 7 days with individuals who have received live virus nasal sprays for influenza. We concur with the recommendation for flu vaccine, but common practice in the United States is to wait 3–6 months after transplant before it is administered.

### BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in immunocompromised patients: a prospective cohort study [^b128e6c1]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

We demonstrated that antibody response to the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine is highly variable among different immunosuppressed patients, and thus individual recommendations should be provided for different immunosuppressed patients. Younger patients – particularly those with HIV infection, those with solid malignancies being treated with immunochemotherapy, those with multiple myeloma, HSCT recipients six months post-transplant without GVHD, liver transplant patients and probably other transplant patients not receiving antimetabolite maintenance immunosuppression – are more likely to develop antibody responses, and vaccination should be encouraged for those patients. In contrast, older patients, particularly those after heart and kidney transplants, are less likely to develop antibody response and should be warned to follow strict infection control measures, particularly vaccination of all other household members. Further studies should be conducted to explore the cellular immune response to the vaccine in ICPs and the effect of additional booster doses of the vaccine.

Patient management during a pandemic — COVID-19 vaccination guidance for solid organ transplant (SOT) populations includes the ISHLT and other organizations' considerations: pretransplant vaccination of all SOT candidates as a priority whenever feasible; continued SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in SOT recipients and priority for vaccination of their household members and caregivers; continuation of a stable immunosuppression regimen at the time of vaccination to avoid the risk of organ rejection until more comprehensive data are available; and continued adherence of all transplant recipients to masking and social distancing regardless of vaccination status. The guideline notes that antibody response to COVID-19 vaccines are not as robust in transplant recipients as in non-transplant patients and reports a randomized clinical trial in which a third dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine in transplant recipients who had already received two doses showed enhanced immune response against Covid-19. Based on current evidence, the ISHLT states, "we recommend providing a third dose of mRNA vaccine for SOT recipients that have previously completed a 2-dose mRNA vaccine series if local regulations allow", and that "The use of a third dose should, until further evidence is available, be based on individual patients' unique situation and must depend on local availability of vaccines and local regulations".

We suggest avoiding vaccinations, except influenza vaccination, in the first 6 months following kidney transplantation (2C), and we suggest resuming immunizations once patients are receiving minimal maintenance doses of immunosuppressive medications (2C). We recommend giving all KTRs, who are at least 1-month posttransplant, influenza vaccination prior to the onset of the annual influenza season, regardless of status of immunosuppression (1C). Influenza vaccination needs to be provided on an annual basis in advance of the onset of the annual influenza season, and even while KTRs are receiving high levels of immunosuppression, the benefits of timely vaccination outweigh the risks of delaying vaccination.

Immunizations are a relatively safe and cost-effective intervention to prevent morbidity and mortality associated with vaccine preventable infection (VPIs). As such, immunizations are a critical part of the care of pre and posttransplant patients and should be prioritized. New tools are needed to continue to disseminate and implement the most up-to-date vaccine recommendations for the SOT population. These tools will help both primary care providers and multi-disciplinary transplant team members taking care of transplant patients to stay abreast of evidence-based best practices regarding the immunization of the SOT patient.

Kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) — safety and timing of inactivated vaccines are summarized as follows: Inactivated vaccines are described as safe in KTRs with "no evidence that vaccinations lead to an increased risk of rejection", and "the risk of vaccination with inactivated vaccines is minimal", while infection risk is higher than in the general population; therefore vaccination is "warranted". Because "the response to vaccination in KTRs is diminished compared to immunization prior to transplantation", the "optimal timing" is prior to transplant, though "repeated vaccinations after transplantation are necessary" in some cases. Immunosuppression is highest early after transplant and "some time during the first 6–12 months" it is reduced to maintenance levels, which "is likely to be the best time for vaccination", noting timing may differ if treated for acute rejection.

KDIGO kidney transplant candidate vaccinations — Assessment of vaccination status is an integral part of the pre-transplant evaluation, and schedule details include that kidney transplant candidates should receive the conjugate pneumococcal vaccine followed by the polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine at least 8 weeks later, and transplant candidates should receive the influenza vaccine annually while awaiting transplantation; depending on availability, the MF59 adjuvanted or the high-dose influenza vaccine can be used in transplant candidates ≥ 65 years of age. For hepatitis B vaccination in those with CKD, a 40 μg preparation ('dialysis dose') should be used with a 3-dose interval; anti-HBs should be measured 4–6 weeks after series completion, titers should be checked at regular intervals, and if titers have declined to < 10 IU/mL, a repeat HBV vaccine series can be given. In endemic areas (www.who.int), hepatitis A vaccine should be given to all candidates before transplantation. Meningococcal conjugate vaccine should be given to children as per local guidelines; in adults with risk factors including functional or anatomic asplenia, travelers to meningococcus endemic areas or those likely to require complement inhibitors perioperatively or post-transplant, two doses of quadrivalent vaccine at least 8 weeks apart can be given; in candidates who may receive eculizumab or other complement inhibitors, two doses of quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine (for serogroups A, C, Y, W-135) as well as meningococcal serogroup B vaccine should be administered. Human papillomavirus vaccine is also inactivated and can be given using the 3-dose schedule to males and females over age 9 years. A recombinant subunit inactivated vaccine is available to prevent herpes zoster and can be used in transplant candidates ≥ 50 years of age; in the general population, efficacy of this vaccine is > 97% and it is recommended for those ≥ 50 years. For inactivated vaccines, no specific wait period is required pre-transplantation and candidates can remain active if on a deceased donor waitlist; however, at least two weeks is required for establishment of vaccine immunity.

### Vaccination of solid-organ transplantation candidates [^a38fbb78]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Verifying immunization status and updating vaccinations are important steps in the evaluation of patients who are solid-organ transplant candidates because the potential benefits of vaccination outweigh the risk of adverse events. Because patients with end-organ disease, such as end-stage renal disease and cirrhosis, have reduced immune responses to many vaccines, vaccination should be performed as early as possible during the course of these diseases. Furthermore, it is particularly important for live vaccines to be updated during the pretransplant assessment because such vaccines are contraindicated once a patient is maintained on immunosuppression. Current information on vaccination for adult solid-organ transplant candidates is reviewed.

### Results of the first nationwide cohort study of outcomes in dialysis and kidney transplant patients before and after vaccination for COVID-19 [^daf33931]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What was known:

Dialysis patients and kidney transplant recipients have been identified as vulnerable groups for severe COVID-19.
Nationwide reports of outcomes in dialysis patients and KTRs before and after vaccination for COVID-19 have been lacking.

This study adds:

Mortality increased by 10% in dialysis patients and 22% in KTRs during the COVID-19 pandemic's first year.
After vaccinations for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 started, all-cause mortality rates among dialysis patients rapidly decreased to pre-pandemic levels, while no immediate decline was seen in KTRs.
During the 9 months following vaccination initiation, KTRs had a higher risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization and death compared with dialysis patients.
Compared with the general population, the age and sex standardized mortality ratio for 2019–2021 remained stable for dialysis patients but increased for KTRs.

Potential impact:

The study results indicate that early and prioritized vaccination of dialysis patients probably saved many lives in Sweden.
The delayed response following vaccination in KTRs indicates that this group should be prioritized and followed up closely after new vaccinations.
Our results could help guide future healthcare planning if new virulent COVID-19 strains emerge.

We recommend that the vaccination series be completed prior to kidney transplantation for any live attenuated vaccines (1B) and we recommend a 4-week delay in kidney transplantation if a live vaccine is administered (eg, MMR, VZV, shingles, yellow fever, oral typhoid, oral polio vaccine) (1B). The guideline recommends completing all necessary live attenuated vaccines prior to transplantation and waiting at least 4 weeks prior to moving forward with transplantation; while inactivated vaccines can be administered posttransplant, it is preferable to administer these pretransplant since responses to immunization are suboptimal posttransplant, and the guideline recommends using an accelerated vaccination schedule for inactivated vaccines if necessary. KDIGO recommends not to delay transplantation just to complete the vaccination series, but exceptions could be considered in situations where patients have no demonstrable antibodies against varicella zoster virus. The KDOQI work group agrees with waiting a minimum of 4 weeks after any live vaccine and notes that asplenic kidney transplant candidates should receive pretransplant pneumococcal, Haemophilus, and meningococcal vaccination, and that patients who may need complement inhibitors in the peri- or posttransplant period should get meningococcal vaccination to reduce the risk of meningitis.

Vaccinations

Immunization post-transplantation is essential for preventing a myriad of infectious diseases, albeit associated with variable immune responses. Influenza vaccine is crucial due to risk of severe complications associated with an infection in kidney transplant recipients. Guidelines advise standard-dose influenza vaccination for solid organ transplant recipients after 3–6 months, considering earlier administration in outbreaks and potential second doses for early effectiveness.

For kidney transplant recipients, adhering to general population recommendations, age-appropriate vaccinations are recommended. Live attenuated vaccines should be avoided posttransplant, and transplantation delayed by 4 weeks, if administered. Examples include: the Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine; the live attenuated influenza vaccine; the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine with (MMRV) or without varicella (MMR); the oral polio vaccine (OPV); the varicella (chickenpox) vaccine; and the yellow fever vaccine. Generally, posttransplant vaccination is ideally delayed by 3–6 months, except for inactivated influenza vaccination, which can begin after one month to cover the flu season. Certain non-live viral vaccines like hepatitis A, B, and HPV are considered for post-transplant recipients lacking pre-transplantation vaccination, seropositivity, or inadequate titers (anti-HBS). However, seroconversion rates may be suboptimal. Invasive pneumococcal infection is a concern, with the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) recommending the 15-valent PCV (PCV15) or 20-valent PCV (PCV20) for PCV–naïve adults who are either aged ≥ 65 years or aged 19–64 years with certain underlying conditions. When PCV15 is used, it should be followed by a dose of PPSV23, typically ≥ 1 year later. The pneumococcal and tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccines are advised at least 2 months post-transplant or after treatment for rejection.

Cancer screening

The American and European transplantation organizations recommend regular skin cancer screening for renal transplant recipients, involving monthly self-skin examinations and total body skin examinations conducted by expert physicians or dermatologists every 6 to 12 months. Recommendations for breast, cervical and colon cancer screening in the renal transplant population are based on screening guidelines in the general population.

### The use of vaccines in adult patients with renal disease [^65251069]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

In patients with renal disease, infection remains among the most common causes of morbidity and mortality. Alterations in the function of the immune system, as well as unique exposures of this patient population, account for the increased risk. Vaccination is an invaluable tool in preventing many infectious diseases. Unfortunately, responsiveness to vaccination in patients with renal disease can be diminished. In the present review, we examine the available evidence on the use of vaccinations in adult patients at different stages of chronic kidney disease. We address efficacy, clinical outcomes, and potential costs of individual vaccinations and provide our recommendations based on the literature reviewed. We also identify areas in which additional research is needed.

### Changing attitudes toward influenza vaccination in U.S. kidney transplant programs over the past decade [^dcdc7dc3]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Influenza infection in transplant recipients is often associated with significant morbidity. Surveys were conducted in 1999 and 2009 to find out if the influenza vaccination practices in the U.S. transplant programs had changed over the past 10 years.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

In 1999, a survey of the 217 United Network for Organ Sharing-certified kidney and kidney-pancreas transplant centers in the U.S. was conducted regarding their influenza vaccination practice patterns. A decade later, a second similar survey of 239 transplant programs was carried out.

Results

The 2009 respondents, compared with 1999, were more likely to recommend vaccination for kidney (94.5% versus 84.4%, P = 0.02) and kidney-pancreas recipients (76.8% versus 48.5%, P < 0.001), family members of transplant recipients (52.5% versus 21.0%, P < 0.001), and medical staff caring for transplant patients (79.6% versus 40.7%, P < 0.001). Physicians and other members of the transplant team were more likely to have been vaccinated in 2009 compared with 1999 (84.2% versus 62.3% of physicians, P < 0.001 and 91.2% versus 50.3% of nonphysicians, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Our study suggests a greater adoption of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention influenza vaccination guidelines by U.S. transplant programs in vaccinating solid-organ transplant recipients, close family contacts, and healthcare workers.

WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON DECEASED DONOR KIDNEY TRANSPLANTATION AND THE PLANNING OF LIVING DONOR KIDNEY TRANSPLANTATION?

KTR are faced with a higher risk of infectious complications due to immunosuppression. During the first wave, the mortality of COVID-19 appeared to be higher in KTR than in candidates for kidney transplantation, supporting a delay of transplant activities. With less pathogenic variants, and the majority of patients being vaccinated, a delay of transplantation seems no longer warranted.

If a transplant candidate contracts COVID-19, transplantation is usually postponed, but the optimal duration of the delay remains unclear. A more than 3-fold increased mortality has been demonstrated in (unvaccinated) patients undergoing surgery during the first 6 weeks after COVID-19. Therefore, recently updated guidelines recommend (i) pre-operative COVID-19 vaccination with three doses should be applied, preferably the last dose at least 2 weeks before surgery, and (ii) elective surgery should not be performed within 7 weeks after a SARS-CoV-2 infection in unvaccinated patients, unless the benefits exceed the risk of waiting. There is not enough evidence to make recommendations for those who become infected after COVID-19 vaccination, and it is also unknown whether the data on an increased risk of mortality after surgery are similar for asymptomatic patients and those infected with the Omicron variant.

Whether vaccination against COVID-19 should be mandatory for kidney transplantation candidates is an interesting question with several medical, ethical and legal aspects. For more extensive discussion of this topic we refer to some recent papers.

Although kidney donors are healthy before donation, following surgical nephrectomy they will have reduced renal reserve, which may increase the risk of acute kidney injury in the context of severe COVID-19 infection. Unless urgent indications exist, postponing living-donor transplantation could be considered during the highest waves of a pandemic until circumstances improve. This strategy may protect donors from extra risks and also increase their willingness to donate because some live donors may hesitate to donate their organs with the anxiety of contracting disease during evaluation or after donating. Especially when donors are vaccinated, a liberal approach is justified when the risk of acquiring infection is low and the prevailing virus variants cause less severe disease. The aforementioned recommendations on avoiding elective surgery within 7 weeks of SARS-CoV-2 infection apply for the unvaccinated donors as well.

Chapter 12: Vaccination — Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and routine inactivated vaccines in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs): We recommend giving all KTRs approved, inactivated vaccines, according to recommended schedules for the general population, except for HBV vaccination (1D). We suggest HBV vaccination (ideally prior to transplantation) and checking antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAb) titers 6–12 weeks after completing the vaccination series (2D), and we suggest annual HBsAb titers (2D). We suggest revaccination if the antibody titer falls below 10 mIU/ mL (2D). The efficacy of hepatitis B vaccination is determined by the prevention of hepatitis B infection, which is indirectly measured by the development of antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAb) titers > 10 mIU/mL.

### Results of the first nationwide cohort study of outcomes in dialysis and kidney transplant patients before and after vaccination for COVID-19 [^c5f6291b]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Another Swedish study found an overall excess mortality of 30% among KTRs and 9% among dialysis patients (compared with 8% in the general population) between March 2020 and March 2021. A registry study from the US reported an even greater impact on mortality rates, with an 41% increase above the expected number of deaths among KTRs during the same period. Among KRT patients in Madrid, Spain, a 35% higher mortality was found in 2020 as compared with before the pandemic. The European Renal Registry reported a 28-day COVID-19-attributable mortality rate of ≈20% for both dialysis and transplant recipients. During the second wave the 28-day mortality was slightly lower (19% and 13%, respectively). The protective effect of vaccination in the dialysis group observed in our study has also been reported from other dialysis cohorts and further strengthens the rationale for recommending vaccination in this vulnerable group.

Interestingly, compared with the general population, the SMR for patients on KRT did not display distinct peaks during the first and second waves. Overall, mortality rates were always substantially higher than in the general population, especially for those on dialysis. But, in the monthly standardized comparison, the relationship between the general population and dialysis patients remained stable or even declined slightly (SMR 7.19 for 2019, 7.15 for 2020 and 7.07 for 2021). The relative decline in the SMR indicates a higher mortality than usual in the general population in the same age groups. Possible explanations could be a high community dissemination giving rise to high mortality rates in care homes of vulnerable older adults in the first wave, earlier vaccinations/higher vaccination rates among dialysis patients than the general population, regular healthcare contacts at the dialysis unit regarding other diseases (while the general population may have avoided healthcare contacts) and earlier diagnosis (and treatment) of COVID-19. In KTRs however, the SMR increased to a higher baseline level throughout the follow-up, as well as after vaccinations were introduced (SMR 2.11 in 2019, 2.20 in 2020 and 2.47 in 2021).

### Zoster… [^8eae5d6e]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Herpes Zoster
- Caused by reactivation of varicella-zoster virus
- Observed relationship between varicella and herpes zoster in 1888
- Hypothesis formed in 1965 that herpes zoster was due to reactivation of latent VZV
- First vaccine to reduce risk of herpes zoster licensed in the U. S. in 2006. In 1954, Thomas Weller used cell culture to isolate VZV from vesicular fluid of patients with varicella or zoster. However, it was not until 1965 that Edgar Hope-Simpson hypothesized that herpes zoster was due to the reactivation of latent VZV. The first vaccine to reduce the risk of herpes zoster was licensed in the United States in 2006. Varicella-Zoster Virus Varicella-Zoster Virus
- DNA virus
- Member of herpesvirus family
- Persists as latent infection VZV is a DNA virus and is a member of the herpesvirus family. Like other herpesviruses, VZV persists in the body as a latent infection after the primary infection; VZV persists in sensory nerve ganglia.

Primary infection with VZV results in varicella. Latent infection can reactivate resulting in herpes zoster. The virus has a short survival time in the environment. Pathogenesis Zoster Pathogenesis
- Result of reactivation of latent VZV infection
- Immunologic mechanism for VZV latency not well understood
- **Risk factors**: Aging, immunosuppression, intrauterine exposure to VZV, history of varicella at younger than age 18 months. Herpes zoster is the result of reactivation of latent VZV infection. During the primary infection, VZV travels to the sensory ganglia where it resides permanently. In this latent form, replication is suppressed by the host immune system and VZV is noninfectious but can reactivate to form intact virions in the involved sensory neurons. Laboratory Testing The diagnosis of zoster is usually made clinically.

In some cases where disease is atypical, such as in persons with altered immunocompetence, laboratory testing can be performed, although a positive result does not differentiate zoster from varicella. Polymerase chain reaction to detect VZV DNA is the most useful test for confirming cases of zoster. Transmission VZV transmission occurs person-to-person by direct contact with vesicular fluid or inhalation of aerosols from vesicular fluid of skin lesions of persons with acute varicella or zoster. Transmission may also occur from infected respiratory tract secretions of patients with varicella that might also be aerosolized. Skin lesions are considered the major source of transmissible VZV. Transmission of VZV would cause varicella, not zoster, in a VZV-naïve person. RZV vaccine is licensed for use in persons age 50 years or older. RZV vaccine is recommended for immunocompetent adults age 50 years or older, including those who have previously received ZVL or varicella vaccine.

Persons with a previous history of shingles may also be vaccinated. Adults 50 years or older do not need to be screened for history of varicella infection prior to vaccination. Zoster Vaccine Use
- Immunocompetent persons age 50 years or older indicated for vaccination, including:

- Persons who have previously received ZVL or varicella vaccine
- Persons with a previous history of shingles Because estimates of efficacy against both herpes zoster and PHN are higher for RZV than for ZVL, and because ZVL efficacy wanes substantially during the 4 years following receipt when compared to RZV, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices issued a preferential recommendation for RZV over ZVL in 2017, when both vaccines were in use. Persons who have received ZVL vaccine should be revaccinated with a 2-dose series of RZV vaccine.

We recommend that the vaccination series be completed prior to kidney transplantation for any live attenuated vaccines (1B), and we recommend a 4-week delay in kidney transplantation if a live vaccine is administered (1B). We recommend that splenectomized candidates or those at increased risk for post-transplant splenectomy receive pretransplant pneumococcal, haemophilus, and meningococcal vaccination (1B), and we recommend that candidates requiring complement inhibitors perioperatively or post-transplant undergo meningococcal vaccination (1B). We suggest administering risk-based vaccines when indicated, including rabies, tick-borne meningoencephalitis, Japanese encephalitis (inactivated), meningococcus, Salmonella typhi (inactivated), and yellow fever (each 2D).

### Detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in pediatric kidney transplant patients [^14a2ed45]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

In a systematic review of 16 articles including children and adults with cancer and kidney, heart, liver and immunodeficiency patients, immunocompromised patients had similar and sometimes more favorable outcomes than the general population. However, this favorable outcome was not observed in cancer patients.

In our study, serological testing identified five patients with COVID-19 who otherwise would have been missed because of mild or asymptomatic disease. Although none of those five patients had severe symptoms or complications that required hospital attention, identifying them helped us better understand the full clinical spectrum of the disease in this vulnerable group. We learned that asymptomatic COVID-19 is not uncommon in the PKT population.

Out of the four patients with documented positive PCR, 75% seroconverted with relatively high antibody titers. Two patients had readings above the detectable upper limits of the test (> 400 AU/ml). Although these levels are very high, no one truly knew how these levels translate into protection from the virus. These findings were unexpected, as we already know that compared to the regular population, transplant patients who developed infection have a blunted immune response and a low rate of seroconversion. The fact that our transplant patients mounted a strong humoral immune response to natural infection makes us believe that they will elicit the same, if not stronger, immune response with future vaccination when it becomes available for this age group. More interestingly, all patients who mounted rigorous immune responses to COVID-19 were still positive at a median time of 75 days (IQR, 69–83 days). One patient (case 2) was still positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG at 120 days. The fact that all our positive serology patients had a history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive household members validates the positive serology results in our cohort. It also supports the hypothesis of possible household transmission among children that was addressed by Buonsenos et al. The one patient (case 9) who had only one positive test was consider as negative. Of note, the parents' antibody titers from approximately the same time as those assessed their children were significantly lower than those in their children except in one patient. These findings are in contrast to what has been reported by Pierce et al. who showed that serum neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were higher in adults than in children.

Vaccinations — kidney transplant candidates: We recommend that the vaccination series be commenced using an accelerated schedule, if necessary, prior to kidney transplantation for any inactivated vaccines (1B), and we suggest not excluding candidates who do not complete an inactivated vaccine series prior to kidney transplantation (2D). We recommend that the vaccination series be completed prior to kidney transplantation for any live attenuated vaccines (1B), and we recommend a 4-week delay in kidney transplantation if a live vaccine is administered (eg, MMR, VZV, shingles, yellow fever, oral typhoid, oral polio vaccine) (1B). We recommend that splenectomized candidates or those at increased risk for post-transplant splenectomy receive pretransplant pneumococcal, hemophilus, and meningococcal vaccination (1B), and we recommend that candidates requiring complement inhibitors perioperatively or post-transplant undergo meningococcal vaccination (1B). We suggest administering additional vaccines to at-risk candidates due to epidemiological factors, specifically rabies (2D), tick-borne meningoencephalitis (2D), Japanese encephalitis (inactivated) (2D), meningococcus (2D), Salmonella typhi (inactivated) (2D), and yellow fever (2D).

### Vaccination for the post-kidney transplant population [^b4aa99ee]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Kidney transplant recipients are at high risk of contracting infections, some of which are considered vaccine-preventable, because of their highly immunosuppressed state. In this vulnerable group of patients, infection can lead to poor outcomes including graft failure and death, thus vaccination in the posttransplant population is an important strategy in order to mitigate this risk. The present review is aimed at providing an update on recent advances with respect to vaccination strategies in kidney transplant recipients.

Recent Findings

General principles behind vaccination in kidney transplantation have remained consistent over many years. More recently, efforts have been focused on developing newer strategies for vaccination against influenza and herpes zoster in organ transplant recipients. Newer data on the immunogenicity of vaccines directed against pneumococcal disease, human papillomavirus, and hepatitis B virus in kidney transplant recipients have become available and will also be discussed in the present review.

Summary

Kidney transplant recipients are highly-vulnerable to contracting serious infections by way of their immunosuppressed state and their dampened ability to mount an immunogenic response to vaccines. Thus, ongoing advances in vaccination strategies in this group of patients should be an important area of focus of future research in order to help promote healthier living and greater survival postkidney transplant.

### Results of the first nationwide cohort study of outcomes in dialysis and kidney transplant patients before and after vaccination for COVID-19 [^37b3939c]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden resulted in increased mortality and hospitalization rates among KRT patients. Both absolute and relative mortality rates were substantially higher in dialysis patients during the first two COVID-19 waves compared with transplanted patients. Following the vaccine rollout, there was a distinct reduction in hospitalization and mortality rates among dialysis patients that was not reflected among the KTRs, who at this time surpassed the dialysis patients in COVID-19 mortality and hospitalization rates. Compared with the general population in Sweden, the monthly SMRs were several times higher but relatively stable in dialysis patients during the follow-up period. In contrast, the SMR for KTRs showed an increasing trend. These results could help guide future healthcare planning if new virulent SARS-CoV-2 strains emerge.

### Clinical guidance for smallpox vaccine use in a postevent vaccination program [^cc0d6a83]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Smallpox postevent vaccination — postexposure vaccination and severe immunodeficiency exceptions states that persons with a known exposure to smallpox virus should be vaccinated with a replication-competent smallpox vaccine unless severely immunodeficient, including bone marrow transplant recipients within 4 months of transplantation, persons infected with HIV with CD4 cell counts < 50 cells/mm³, and those with severe combined immunodeficiency or complete DiGeorge syndrome requiring isolation. Persons exposed include household family members of a case, others spending ≥ 3 hours in the household since the case's onset of fever, and nonhousehold members with ≥ 3 hours of contact at (< 6.5 feet) with a case with rash. Imvamune requires 2 doses administered 4 weeks apart to achieve an immune response comparable to that of replication-competent smallpox vaccines, and its efficacy in preventing smallpox in humans is less certain.

### Clinical overview of shingles (herpes zoster) [^23a18fec]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Herpes zoster is caused by the reactivation of varicella-zoster virus and can be prevented with Shingrix vaccine.
- Herpes zoster is hard to diagnose in children and younger adults, especially if the clinical presentation is mild.
- Older adults and people who are immunocompromised are at high risk for shingles complications. Cause Herpes zoster is caused by the reactivation of varicella-zoster virus, the same virus that causes varicella. Primary infection with VZV causes varicella. After a person has varicella, the virus remains dormant in the dorsal root ganglia. VZV can reactivate later in a person's life and cause herpes zoster, a painful maculopapular, and then a vesicular rash. Keep Reading: Clinical Overview of Chickenpox. Who is at risk People who had chickenpox can get shingles. About 1 in 3 people in the United States will develop herpes zoster during their lifetime.

Most people have only one episode, but herpes zoster can recur. A person's risk for herpes zoster and related complications, including hospitalizations, sharply increases after 50 years of age. The reasons why VZV reactivates and causes herpes zoster are not well understood. However, a person's risk for herpes zoster increases as their VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity declines. This decline in immunity can result from increasing age and medical conditions or medications that suppress a person's immune system. People with the following conditions that compromise or suppress their immune system have an increased risk for herpes zoster:

- Bone marrow or solid organ transplant recipients.
- Cancer, especially leukemia and lymphoma.
- Human immunodeficiency virus.
- Taking immunosuppressive medications, including steroids. About 30% of people hospitalized with herpes zoster have compromised or suppressed immune systems.

Other potential risk factors for herpes zoster have been identified, but the findings are inconsistent or unexplained. For example:

- More women than men develop shingles.
- Herpes zoster is less common in black people than in white people. How it spreads People with active herpes zoster lesions can spread VZV. VZV causes varicella in people who never had chickenpox or those who didn't receive the varicella vaccine. Once varicella resolves, these people would be at risk for herpes zoster. Active herpes zoster lesions are infectious through direct contact with vesicular fluid; or breathing in virus particles from the blisters until they dry and scab over. People with active herpes zoster lesions should cover their lesions; and avoid contact with susceptible people in their household and occupational settings until their lesions are dry and scabbed. Shingles complications include postherpetic neuralgia, hearing or vision loss, encephalitis, and pneumonia.

The signs and symptoms of herpes zoster are usually distinctive enough to make an accurate clinical diagnosis once the rash appears. However, clinical diagnosis of herpes zoster might not be possible in the absence of a rash. Prevention CDC recommends 2 doses of recombinant zoster vaccine to prevent shingles and related complications in adults 50 years and older. Shingrix is also recommended for adults 19 years and older who have weakened immune systems because of disease or therapy. Varicella vaccines contain live attenuated VZV, which results in latent infection. Although herpes zoster has always been uncommon among children, the rate in U. S. children has declined since the routine varicella vaccination program started in 1995.
- Children vaccinated against varicella have lower rates of herpes zosterwhen compared to children who had natural infection with varicella.

In this issue of Kidney International, the initial experience regarding the immunogenicity of prior coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and the response to the COVID-19 vaccines among patients on maintenance dialysis and kidney transplant recipients is summarized. Preliminary data suggest that there is durability of immune response after COVID-19 infection. Although immune response to the first dose of vaccine is less in infection-naïve patients than healthy individuals in both groups, after the second vaccine dose a significant portion of patients receiving maintenance dialysis develop robust antibody titers, whereas kidney transplant recipients show a less-strong immune response.

### Caregiver COVID-19 vaccination for solid organ transplant candidates [^62f349a8]. American Journal of Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

An increasing proportion of transplant centers have implemented a mandate for vaccination against COVID-19 for solid organ transplant candidates. There has been comparatively little exploration of the ethical considerations of mandating vaccination of a candidate's primary caregiver, despite a high risk of transmission given the close nature of contact between the candidate and caregiver. We examine how a caregiver mandate can improve overall utility in organ allocation, particularly in circumstances where vaccine effectiveness at preventing transmission and serious disease is low among recipients but high in caregivers. Our analysis reveals how sensitive such mandates must be to the evolving circumstances of disease severity, transmissibility, and vaccine effectiveness: as the facts change, the degree of benefit gained and therefore the degree of infringement on access to transplant and caregiver choice that is tolerated will likewise change.

Persons With Chronic Kidney Disease

Persons with chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly those with nephrotic syndrome and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), have an altered immune system and are at increased risk for pneumococcal disease. A study among KPNC members demonstrated that adults with stage 3 or 4 CKD (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] of 15–59 mL/min) had 1.2 times the risk for IPD, and adults with ESRD (GFR of < 15 mL/min or on dialysis) had 3.7 times the risk for IPD compared with KPNC members overall. The 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes clinical practice guideline recommends pneumococcal vaccination for adults with stages 4 and 5 CKD. A study that compared immunogenicity of PPSV23 in adults with CKD and healthy adults found that adults with CKD had significantly lower immune response to PPSV23. Another study reported rapid decline of antibody levels after PPSV23 was administered in children and young adults with CKD. Persons on dialysis are known to have rapid decline of antibody concentrations, which could be associated with impaired adaptive immune system, as well as gradual removal of a proportion of the serum antibody through dialysis.

Persons With Primary or Secondary Immunocompromising Conditions

Persons with primary (congenital) immunodeficiency (i.e. conditions that cause B- or T-cell deficiency, complement deficiency, or phagocytic disorders) or secondary (acquired) immunodeficiency (e.g. HIV infection, hematopoietic malignancy, and treatment with radiation or immunosuppressive medications) are at increased risk for infection or severe manifestations from vaccine-preventable diseases including pneumococcal disease. In these adults, immunologic response to pneumococcal vaccines, especially response to PPSV23, is considered to be diminished and short lived. Additional information about the degree of immune suppression associated with different medical conditions and treatments is available through ACIP's general best practices for vaccination of persons with altered immunocompetence, CDC's Yellow Book, and the 2013 IDSA Clinical Practice Guideline for Vaccination of the Immunocompromised Host. Adults who are HSCT recipients are addressed separately.

Persons With Other Medical Conditions, Occupational or Environmental Exposures, or Living Conditions

Other medical conditions, occupational or environmental exposures, or living conditions have been associated with increased risk for pneumococcal disease in certain reports but are not part of the risk-based pneumococcal vaccine recommendations. Persons in these groups include adults with obesity, adults experiencing homelessness, and adults who work as welders.

Rationale and specific vaccine schedules for transplant candidates: Live-attenuated vaccines should only be given prior to transplantation, while inactivated vaccines can be given pre- or post-transplantation and childhood vaccinations should be updated per local guidelines with accelerated schedules as needed. Transplant recipients have an increased risk for developing invasive pneumococcal disease; as such, kidney transplant candidates should receive the conjugate pneumococcal vaccine followed by the polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine at least 8 weeks later, and transplant candidates should receive the influenza vaccine annually while awaiting transplantation. Depending on availability, the MF59 adjuvanted or the high-dose influenza vaccine can be used in transplant candidates ≥ 65 years of age. HBV vaccine is recommended for those with CKD; a 40 μg preparation ('dialysis dose') should be used with a 3-dose interval, anti-HBs should be measured 4–6 weeks after series completion, and if titers have declined to < 10 IU/mL, a repeat HBV vaccine series can be given. Meningococcal conjugate vaccine should be given to all candidates before transplantation; in adults, two doses of quadrivalent vaccine at least 8 weeks apart can be given, and in candidates who may receive eculizumab or other complement inhibitors, two doses of quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine (for serogroups A, C, Y, W-135) as well as meningococcal serogroup B vaccine should be administered. Human papillomavirus vaccine is inactivated and can be given using the 3-dose schedule to males and females over age 9 years. A recombinant subunit inactivated vaccine to prevent herpes zoster can be used in transplant candidates ≥ 50 years of age; in the general population, efficacy of this vaccine is > 97% and it is recommended for those ≥ 50 years of age.

Posttransplant graft monitoring and infection prevention in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) — Frequent posttransplant monitoring may improve long-term outcomes by decreasing chronic graft failure or death with a functioning graft, and the work group concurred with routine screening in monitoring kidney allograft function with a low threshold for performing kidney biopsy in cases of graft dysfunction or proteinuria; it is now standard of care to use vaccinations in KTRs as long as the vaccine does not contain live or attenuated virus, and it also is routine to screen for or use prophylaxis to prevent several posttransplant viral infections; although chronic kidney disease in KTRs progresses more slowly than in other patients, the KDIGO guidelines on CKD should be followed in KTRs.

THE DYNAMIC LANDSCAPE OF COVID-19 VACCINATION GUIDELINES AND CLINICAL PRACTICE FOR SOLID ORGAN TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS

As the COVID-19 pandemic progressed and vaccines were developed and authorized for emergency use, guidelines for vaccine deployment were published. Although SOTRs were excluded from the initial clinical trials, COVID-19 vaccines were authorized for emergency use in this population. The subsequent study of vaccine safety and immunogenicity revealed that SOTRs required more doses than immunocompetent individuals, necessitating guideline revisions to ensure optimal protection of this vulnerable population. The COVID-19 treatment and vaccination guideline landscape for SOTRs is therefore continuously evolving, influenced by the discovery of new information, professional disease and transplant society guidelines, physician and patient perception, as well as the dynamic nature of the COVID-19 pandemic itself (Table 2). Importantly, guidelines strongly encourage pretransplant patients and SOTRs to adhere to vaccination schedules, given their increased risk for severe disease and death due to COVID-19. These guidelines are based on an array of evidence documenting vaccine efficacy and safety.

### Vaccination of adults with cancer: ASCO guideline [^11302d12]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Household and close contacts of adults with cancer — vaccination recommendations state that immunocompetent household members can safely receive all recommended live and nonlive vaccines, with specific exceptions. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guideline recommends against oral polio vaccine for household contacts of immunocompromised patients and also recommends against live-attenuated influenza vaccine in household contacts of patients who have recently received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) or have graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Clinically, all vaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for both adults and children, including live vaccines such as varicella and measles–mumps–rubella (MMR), can be safely administered to household contacts of patients undergoing cancer treatment except for live attenuated influenza vaccine use in close contacts of HSCT recipients, and close contacts should remain up to date with seasonal vaccines.

Table 1.
mRNA-Based COVID-19 Vaccine Recommendations for Immunocompromised Individuals in the United States

Given the heterogeneity of the immunocompromised population, adoption of nonstandard vaccination approaches could help to provide tailored patient care for those with attenuated responses to vaccination. When providing guidelines for immunization recommendations, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers timing of the COVID-19 vaccination as it relates to immunosuppressive therapies. For COVID-19, the current guidance for this population is to wait ≥ 2 weeks before starting or resuming immunosuppressive therapy after COVID-19 vaccination. Those patients receiving B cell–depleting therapies are advised to time their vaccination to coincide with approximately 4 weeks before their next scheduled therapy. Currently, US healthcare professionals have the potential to administer COVID-19 vaccines outside of the recommended dosing intervals if there are any clinical benefits of doing so; however, nonroutine vaccinations are not recommended as a standard practice. Active postvaccination assessment of immune response to vaccination through serologic, cellular, immune, or B cell quantification testing is currently not recommended to guide clinical care, although this approach may ultimately be important to establish for COVID-19 vaccines. For example, serologic tests have been used for assessing the need for hepatitis B revaccination or booster doses among hemodialysis patients; whether a similar approach might be practical for COVID-19 vaccines among immunocompromised patients may be worth further investigation. Overall, alignment on recommendations for tailored care may help to simplify immunization options, increase patient care options, and ultimately provide additional protection for those individuals currently still at risk for serious outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### Laboratory testing for varicella-zoster virus (VZV)… [^a6d8b47f]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- This varicella-zoster virus laboratory testing information applies to testing and diagnosis of primary VZV infection and reactivation.
- Polymerase chain reaction is the most helpful laboratory test for confirming cases of varicella and herpes zoster.
- The CDC Herpesvirus Laboratory can provide several types of VZV-specific testing. Specimens can also be submitted for suspected vaccine-related adverse events, including:

- Rash occurring 7 to 42 days after vaccination
- Suspected secondary transmission of the vaccine virus
- Herpes zoster in a vaccinated person
- Any serious adverse event For more information on VZV specimen collection, storage, and handling, please contact the CDC Herpesvirus Laboratory. Types of tests Polymerase chain reaction PCR is the most useful laboratory test for confirming suspected varicella and herpes zoster.

PCR can detect VZV DNA rapidly and sensitively in skin lesions. Specimens for PCR testing
- Vesicular lesions or scabs, if present, are the best for sampling.
- Adequate collection of specimens from maculopapular lesions in vaccinated people can be a challenge.
- However, one study that compares a variety of specimens from the same patients vaccinated with one dose suggests that maculopapular lesions collected with proper technique are a highly reliable specimen types for the detection of VZV.
- However, one study that compares a variety of specimens from the same patients vaccinated with one dose suggests that maculopapular lesions collected with proper technique are a highly reliable specimen types for the detection of VZV.
- Other sources, such as nasopharyngeal secretions, saliva, urine, bronchial washings, and cerebrospinal fluid are less likely to provide an adequate sample; they often lead to false negative results.

Serologic tests Serologic methods have limited use for laboratory confirmation of herpes zoster and should only be used when suitable specimens for PCR testing are not available. IgM serologic testing is considerably less sensitive than PCR testing of skin lesions. IgM serology provides evidence for a recent active VZV infection. However, it cannot distinguish between primary infection and reinfection or reactivation from latency. This is because specific IgM antibodies are produced with each exposure to VZV. IgM tests are also inherently prone to poor specificity. Specimens for serologic testing Measuring acute and convalescent sera also has limited value, since it is difficult to detect an increase in IgG for laboratory diagnosis of herpes zoster. Paired acute and convalescent sera showing a four-fold rise in IgG antibodies have excellent specificity for varicella. However, they are not as sensitive as PCR of skin lesions for the diagnosis of varicella.

People with a prior history of vaccination or disease may have very high baseline titers and may not achieve a four-fold increase in the convalescent sera. The usefulness of this method for diagnosing varicella is further limited as it requires two office visits. A single positive IgG ELISA result cannot confirm a varicella case. Laboratory guidelines
- The preferred diagnosis method is a demonstration of VZV DNA by PCR tests from a clinical specimen, ideally scabs, vesicular fluid, or cells from the base of a lesion.
- PCR is also useful for confirming breakthrough varicella. Other methods, such as DFA and culture, are available for diagnosis but are less sensitive and specific than PCR.
- Positive serologic test for varicella-zoster immunoglobulin M antibody when a varicella-like rash is present.
- Four-fold or greater rise in serum varicella immunoglobulin G antibody titer by any standard serologic assay between acute and convalescent sera.

### Hepatitis B vaccination status among patients with end-stage kidney disease on haemodialysis in Ethiopia: a multi-center cross-sectional study [^20623d3d]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Sample size determination

For the first objective, the sample size was determined using a single population proportion formula at a 95% confidence interval with expected vaccination status against HBV of CKD patients on hemodialysis of 19% with 5% precision and 10% added for possible non-response rate. The final sample size was n = 259.

The sample size for the second objective was calculated using Epi Info version 7.2.6.0. Socioeconomic class was the only factor associated with vaccination status in previous studies. The numbers of outcomes among the exposed and unexposed were 66.7% and 14.4% respectively. By assuming a 95% confidence interval, 80% power, and exposure to the unexposed ratio of 1:1, the calculated sample size was 34.

The final chosen sample size was 259 participants, accommodating both objectives. Consecutive sampling was used as a sampling technique. All people who met the inclusion criteria and were available were included in the study. Cluster random sampling was used as a sampling method among dialysis centers.

Data collection tools and procedure

Data were collected using a pretested interviewer-administered structured questionnaire. The questionnaire, which is attached as a supplemental file, asks about socio-demographic factors, clinical factors, and behavioral factors.

Study variables

Vaccination status was the outcome variable. Socio-demographic factors and clinical factors including duration of dialysis, comorbidity, and prospect/plan for renal transplantation were the independent variables.

Operational definitions

End-stage kidney disease (ESKD): is defined as an irreversible decline in a person's kidney function, which is severe enough to be fatal in the absence of dialysis or transplantation.

Vaccination status: a person is considered to be vaccinated against hepatitis B if he/ she has taken at least one dose of HBV.

Comorbidity: a person was considered to have comorbidity if they had at least one chronic medical disease in addition to ESKD.

Data collection and management

A structured interviewer-administered questionnaire was prepared after reviewing relevant literature. Data were collected by two health professionals with one supervisor. Data collectors obtained all relevant data related to socio-demographic, and clinical factors by interviewing the patients and additional information by reviewing patient medical records. The data collection tool was first prepared in English language and translated into Amharic language and then back to English. A 5% pretest was performed. Two days of training were provided to data collectors. Supervision was performed at each step of data collection and the collected data were checked for consistency and completeness before data analysis.

### Prophylactic measures in the solid-organ recipient before transplantation [^4cf02a0d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Pretransplant screening affords an important opportunity to detect and treat preexisting active infection in the solid-organ transplant recipient. In this article, pretransplant strategies for preventing infections after solid-organ transplantation are reviewed. In addition to the search for active preexisting infection in the transplant candidate, immunization remains a cornerstone of preventive practice. Because there is a suboptimal response to vaccinations in patients who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy, as well as in patients with end-stage organ dysfunction, standard immunization of the transplant candidate should be updated as early as possible in the course of the illness, including pneumococcal, influenza, and hepatitis B vaccines. Liver transplant candidates should receive hepatitis A vaccine, and children should receive Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccine. All nonimmune pretransplant patients should be considered candidates for the varicella vaccine. The management of special risk groups is discussed in detail.

### European best practice guidelines for renal transplantation. section IV: long-term management of the transplant recipient. IV.11 paediatrics (specific problems) [^6fda4e86]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Guidelines

A. Kidney transplantation should be the treatment of choice for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in children (up to 16 years of age). Because the incidence rate of ESRD is very low, approximately 1–2 children per million general population or 4–6 children per million childhood population, kidney transplantation in children should be performed in specialized paediatric centres with multidisciplinary experts, i.e. transplant surgeons, anaesthetists and paediatric nephrologists, and optimally should be supported by psychologists, paediatric nurses and social workers. B. Due to the urgent need for transplantation, children should have priority in the allocation systems. In addition, pre-emptive transplantation from either live or cadaveric donors should be offered to all paediatric transplant candidates whenever possible. These protocols will reduce the time on dialysis, thus limiting the retardation of growth and development. C. Absolute contra-indications to renal transplantation in children are extremely rare but should be respected: uncontrollable malignancy, ABO incompatibility, the presence of a current positive cross-match or multi-organ failure. There are few relative or transient contra-indications: history of cancer (Wilms tumour), viral infection (HIV, HBV, EBV), very young age (< 6 months), severe mental retardation and/or additional disabilities. D. In contrast to adult patients, primary renal diseases responsible for ESRD in children are mostly congenital and hereditary disorders (60%). Children with massive vesico-ureteric reflux or permanent urinary infection should undergo nephroureterectomy to avoid the development of sepsis. In children with ESRD not due to any urinary tract malformation, pre-transplant bilateral nephrectomy of the native kidney should be considered in the case of severe arterial hypertension, heavy proteinuria or risk of renal cancer. E. Psychosocial evaluation of future transplant recipients and their parents is necessary in assessing compliance with management of dialysis and after transplantation. Poor compliance worsens the outcome of paediatric renal transplantation. F. Routine childhood vaccination should be completed whenever possible prior to transplantation, in addition to vaccination against hepatitis B and varicella. G. The pharmacokinetics of immunosuppressive drugs often differ between adult and paediatric recipients. Therefore, drug monitoring is mandatory in order to find the correct drug dosage. H. Today the actuarial probability of graft survival at 1 year should exceed 90% in unselected renal transplant children, and the acute rejection rate should be lower than 30%. I. Special attention should be paid to specific risk factors in paediatric transplantation, such as thrombotic complications, EBV and CMV infections, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) and recurrence of original renal disease, mainly in patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) or atypical haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (HUS).

### Influenza vaccination in the organ transplant recipient: review and summary recommendations [^8f8ea9d6]. American Journal of Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Influenza virus causes a spectrum of illness in transplant recipients with a high rate of lower respiratory disease. Seasonal influenza vaccination is an important public health measure recommended for transplant recipients and their close contacts. Vaccine has been shown to be safe and generally well tolerated in both adult and pediatric transplant recipients. However, responses to vaccine are variable and are dependent on various factors including time from transplantation and specific immunosuppressive medication. Seasonal influenza vaccine has demonstrated safety and no conclusive evidence exists for a link between vaccination and allograft dysfunction. Annually updated trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines have been available and routinely used for several decades, although newer influenza vaccination formulations including high-dose vaccine, adjuvanted vaccine, quadrivalent inactivated vaccine and vaccine by intradermal delivery system are now available or will be available in the near future. Safety and immunogenicity data of these new formulations in transplant recipients requires investigation. In this document, we review the current state of knowledge on influenza vaccines in transplant recipients and make recommendations on the use of vaccine in both adult and pediatric organ transplant recipients.
