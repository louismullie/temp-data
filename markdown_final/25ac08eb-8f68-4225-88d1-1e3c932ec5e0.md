## Question

How many units of insulin are needed to reverse an opioid overdose?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many units of insulin are needed to reverse an opioid overdose. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether insulin is even the right agent for opioid toxicity. Then, I should identify the correct antidote and verify adult dosing by route. Next, I will review titration strategies to balance reversal with avoidance of precipitated withdrawal. After that, I need to consider special situations such as fentanyl-class exposures and buprenorphine, and finally, I should outline practical repeat-dosing, monitoring, and the need to call emergency services; critically, the specific antidote for opioid overdose is naloxone, not insulin [^114ay4Dg].

> Let me first confirm the critical premise error: insulin does not reverse opioid effects and could dangerously lower blood glucose in this context, whereas naloxone is an opioid receptor antagonist that reverses opioid-induced respiratory depression; I should be explicit that naloxone is the indicated treatment for suspected opioid overdose and has no activity against non-opioid overdoses [^114ay4Dg] [^116iaZLA].

> Now, I should verify labeled adult naloxone dosing by route; wait, let me double-check the ranges on FDA sources: intravenous dosing is 0.4–2 mg IV once, intramuscular is 0.2–4 mg IM once, and subcutaneous is 0.4–2 mg SC once, which establishes the on-label starting ranges across common parenteral routes [^115aT8vt] [^113f9mHw] [^1146xMSW].

> I need to check how this translates into practical protocols; typical practice is to reassess and repeat dosing every 2–3 minutes until ventilation improves, with some protocols escalating cumulatively up to about 10 mg if needed in refractory cases, but hold on, I should also emphasize the principle of using the lowest effective dose to mitigate withdrawal, which is supported by emergency department data linking lower initial doses to fewer adverse events [^112BZMz1] [^114GksWL].

> I will now examine intranasal use common in community settings; pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers suggest that a 2 mg intranasal dose achieves early systemic exposure comparable to 0.4 mg IM, supporting an initial 2 mg spray with a second dose after 2–3 minutes if breathing does not improve, but wait, let me verify clinical effectiveness — randomized prehospital trials show a single 1.4 mg intranasal dose can be slower and less effective at 10 minutes than 0.8 mg IM, underscoring the need for repeat dosing and airway/ventilatory support during rescue [^114zsLNp] [^113UK5Du] [^112H64YY] [^115V2zn6].

> Next, let me consider titration to avoid precipitated withdrawal; a low-dose IV strategy starting at 0.04–0.1 mg and titrating upward can reverse ventilatory depression while minimizing severe withdrawal, and I should confirm that higher initial doses are associated with more adverse events, including dose-related pulmonary complications and increased emergency department adverse events after higher prehospital dosing, which reinforces the "start low, titrate to effect" approach [^111Z69RV] [^114GksWL] [^1123oN1S] [^117YJNgJ].

> Now, special populations; at first glance, I assumed illicitly manufactured fentanyl overdoses always require much higher naloxone doses — wait, I need to correct that — retrospective data show median doses similar to traditional opioids, although multiple doses may be necessary due to potency and receptor kinetics, and mechanistic modeling highlights particular challenges with highly affine, slow-dissociating agents like carfentanil, which may demand vigilant repeat dosing and supportive care [^113t5cQU] [^113pPqZ9].

> For partial agonists such as buprenorphine, I should confirm that repeated or higher-than-usual naloxone and prolonged observation may be necessary because of strong receptor affinity and longer duration, and FDA labeling explicitly advises educating patients and caregivers that naloxone's effects are temporary and that emergency services should always be activated even if naloxone is given [^114sZvCf] [^114WZkUu].

> Let me synthesize practical steps and ensure nothing is missed; start with 0.4–2 mg by IV, IM, or SC depending on the setting and patient risk, or use 2 mg intranasally where available based on pharmacokinetic comparability, reassess every 2–3 minutes, and repeat doses until adequate respirations return; in refractory or long-acting opioid exposures, consider cumulative doses up to about 10 mg and transition to a naloxone infusion with continuous monitoring, while providing ventilation and activating EMS because naloxone's duration is shorter than many opioids and re-narcotization can occur [^115aT8vt] [^113f9mHw] [^1146xMSW] [^114zsLNp] [^112BZMz1] [^115V2zn6] [^114sZvCf].

> Final answer: zero units of insulin are appropriate, because insulin is not used for opioid overdose; the correct medication is naloxone, with typical initial adult doses of 0.4–2 mg by IV, IM, or SC, or approximately 2 mg intranasally with repeat dosing every 2–3 minutes as needed while arranging emergency care, titrated to restore ventilation while minimizing withdrawal and followed by observation for re-narcotization [^114ay4Dg] [^115aT8vt] [^113f9mHw] [^1146xMSW] [^114zsLNp] [^114sZvCf].

---

Zero units of **insulin** are used to reverse opioid overdose. Insulin is not indicated for opioid overdose reversal; the **standard treatment is naloxone**, an opioid antagonist [^116HPtYE] [^114ay4Dg], administered at 0.4–2 mg IV/IM/SC [^115aT8vt] [^113f9mHw] [^1146xMSW] or 2–4 mg intranasally [^114zsLNp], repeated every 2–3 minutes as needed [^111AHsCn] [^112BZMz1]. Insulin is only used if the patient is hyperglycemic or diabetic, and has no role in reversing opioid-induced respiratory depression.

---

## Pharmacological rationale

Opioid overdose causes respiratory depression via μ-opioid receptor activation in the brainstem [^115QUarr]. Naloxone, a competitive antagonist at these receptors, **rapidly reverses respiratory depression** and restores consciousness [^112H64YY]. Insulin, by contrast, regulates blood glucose and **has no known interaction with opioid receptors** or opioid-induced respiratory depression.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) state that **naloxone is the standard treatment** for opioid overdose [^116HPtYE] [^114ay4Dg]. Recommended doses include:

- **Intravenous (IV) route**: 0.4–2 mg IV once, repeated every 2–3 minutes as needed [^111AHsCn] [^115aT8vt].
- **Intramuscular (IM) route**: 0.2–4 mg IM once, repeated every 2–3 minutes as needed [^113f9mHw].
- **Subcutaneous (SC) route**: 0.4–2 mg SC once, repeated every 2–3 minutes as needed [^1146xMSW].
- **Intranasal (IN) route**: 2–4 mg IN, repeated every 2–3 minutes as needed [^114zsLNp].

These guidelines **do not mention insulin as a treatment** because it does not reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression [^114ay4Dg].

## Risks associated with insulin administration in opioid overdose

Administering insulin during opioid overdose carries **significant risks**, chiefly hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia can cause seizures, coma, or death if not promptly recognized and treated. In this setting — where patients may already be unconscious or have altered mental status — insulin-induced hypoglycemia can worsen the condition and complicate clinical management.

---

## Clinical scenarios where insulin may be administered

Insulin may be given to patients with opioid overdose only if a concurrent medical condition requires it, such as diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia. In such cases, insulin is **unrelated to the opioid overdose itself** and is managed separately from the overdose treatment.

---

## Conclusion

Insulin is **not used to reverse opioid overdose**. The sole recommended treatment for opioid overdose is naloxone, an opioid antagonist that rapidly reverses opioid-induced respiratory depression [^116HPtYE] [^111fPEoC]. Administering insulin to patients with opioid overdose without a medical indication is inappropriate and potentially dangerous due to the risk of hypoglycemia.

### Pharmacokinetics of concentrated naloxone nasal spray for opioid overdose reversal: Phase I healthy volunteer study [^111AHsCn]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Exploratory analyses were conducted to consider early exposure relative to the i.m. reference and repeat naloxone administration.

Given that T max may not fully describe the early absorption curve, three exploratory pharmacokinetic parameters were introduced to assess early exposure from the intranasal (i.n.) route relative to 0.4 mg intramuscular (i.m.) naloxone: t 50% (defined as the time taken to achieve blood levels of 50% of C max, denoted as C50%), AUCp (partial AUC from time of dosing to median T max of i.m. naloxone), and for i.n. administration, T50% ref (time taken to reach the C50% of the primary reference 0.4 mg i.m. naloxone).

In emergency medicine, naloxone doses may be repeated to achieve overdose reversal. Therefore, simulations of repeat administrations were performed using the superposition approach. Superposition relies upon linear pharmacokinetics and employs a simple overlay technique, assuming that observed plasma concentrations following a single dose can be used to predict plasma concentrations after multiple dosing.

Opioid overdose management guidelines typically recommend initial administration of 0.4 mg naloxone, repeated every 2–3 minutes if necessary. Consequently, we simulated repeat administration of five doses of the 0.4 mg i.m. reference at 3-minute intervals (simulating the upper limit of the recommended dose range, 2 mg i.m.) versus two doses of 2 mg i.n. at 3-minute intervals (simulating similar naloxone exposure, assuming 50% i.n. bioavailability).

### Development and preclinical testing of a naloxone prodrug depot for extended protection against opioid overdose [^112BZMz1]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

Naloxone is an essential tool for reversing opioid overdoses. On the street, it is typically administered via nasal spray or intramuscular/subcutaneous injection by bystanders or first responders. Due to naloxone's short half-life of 30 to 90 minutes, its effectiveness is often limited, necessitating multiple doses to prevent re-narcotization by fentanyl and its synthetic analogues. Patients generally require ongoing monitoring, and naloxone should be administered every 2 to 3 minutes for patients who relapse. Failure to monitor the patient until emergency medical services (EMS) arrive, especially following a high fentanyl or synthetic overdose, could result in death. For patients who relapse after multiple doses, EMS can provide oxygen and additional intravenous doses (if intravenous access is quickly available), with the dosage adjusted based on the patient's response during transport to the hospital.

In a hospital setting, patients receive close monitoring to address potential re-narcotization, especially with long-acting opioids. The precise naloxone dose needed for opioid reversal varies based on the amount and type of opioid ingested, its receptor affinity, the patient's weight and age, comorbidities, and any polysubstance use. Because this information is often unknown, an empirical dosing approach is necessary. For adults, initial doses range from 0.4 mg to 2 mg, with increases every 2 to 3 minutes as needed, up to a total of 10 mg. Patients with rebound toxicity are often moved to the intensive care unit (ICU), where they are administered continuous naloxone infusions.

### Development and preclinical testing of a naloxone prodrug depot for extended protection against opioid overdose [^116DE3un]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

To test the prevention of fentanyl-induced respiratory depression after initial reversal (re-narcotization), rats received a second fentanyl dose (1.5 mg kg−1; s.c.) 6 hours after naloxone or prodrug dosing. Naloxone failed to prevent opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD), with four out of six rats dying. AG10-L-E1-Naloxone was also ineffective in preventing OIRD. However, AG10-L-E2-Naloxone significantly prevented OIRD after the second fentanyl dose.

After 24 hours, rats received a third fentanyl dose (1.5 mg kg−1; s.c.). AG10-L-E2-Naloxone again demonstrated higher efficacy in preventing mortality and reversing OIRD compared to naloxone and AG10-L-E1-Naloxone, with one out of six rats dying in the AG10-L-E1-Naloxone group. The slow onset of AG10-L-E2-Naloxone suggests that enhancing the initial naloxone release from the prodrug may be needed for effective rescue from the first fentanyl dose. However, this slow-release profile might be helpful in certain therapeutic applications, as discussed below.

### Attitudes toward naloxone prescribing in clinical settings: A qualitative study of patients prescribed high dose opioids for chronic non-cancer pain [^114Q53Eq]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Over the last two decades, medical providers have increasingly prescribed pharmaceutical opioids for chronic non-cancer pain, while opioid overdose death rates have quadrupled. Naloxone, an opioid antagonist, can be prescribed to patients with chronic pain to reverse an opioid overdose, yet little is known about how patients perceive this emerging practice.

- **Objective**: This study assessed the knowledge and attitudes toward naloxone prescribing among non-cancer patients prescribed opioids in primary care.

- **Design**: Qualitative study design using semi-structured interviews.

- **Participants**: Adults (N = 24) prescribed high-dose (≥ 100 morphine mg equivalent daily dose) chronic opioid therapy in eight primary care internal medicine, family medicine, and HIV practices in three large Colorado health systems.

- **Approach**: Inductive and deductive methods were used to analyze interview transcripts.

- **Key Results**: Themes emerged related to knowledge of and benefits, barriers, and facilitators to naloxone in primary care. Patients reported receiving limited education about opioid medication risks from providers and limited knowledge of naloxone. When provided with a description of naloxone, patients recognized its ability to reverse overdoses. In addition to pragmatic barriers, such as medication cost, barriers to naloxone acceptance included the perception that overdose risk stems from medication misuse and that providers might infer that they were misusing their opioid medication if they accepted a naloxone prescription, prompting an opioid taper. Facilitators to the acceptance of naloxone included…

### Comparison of intranasal and intramuscular naloxone in opioid overdoses managed by ambulance staff: A double-dummy, randomised, controlled trial [^111jHXdR]. Addiction (2022). High credibility.

- **Statistical analysis**: We assumed a probability of 88% for return to spontaneous respiration within 10 minutes in both groups and calculated that 200 cases were required to determine with 90% (power) confidence that the upper limit of the two‐sided 95% CI would exclude a difference of > 15% in favour of the IM group. The non‐inferiority margin of 15% and the non‐inferiority of IN to IM administration were claimed if the 95% CI of the treatment difference for the primary end‐point lay fully within the margin. The 15% margin was not a mathematical calculation, but was based on clinical judgement and experience with naloxone. A similar range has been used to compare efficacy and safety in a biosimilar medication.

The primary efficacy analyses were conducted in the per‐protocol population, which comprised participants fully compliant with the pre‐specified treatment strategy. In non‐inferiority trials, analysis of the per‐protocol set is regarded as the primary analysis. This is a conservative approach because a full analysis set (FAS)/intention to treat analysis is generally considered to be biased toward smaller differences between groups. Protocol deviations that led to exclusion from the per‐protocol population are presented in Supporting Information Table S3.

Sensitivity analyses were performed in the FAS, which included all participants who received the study drug and did not withdraw consent. Safety analyses were conducted in all participants who received any study drugs, including those in the FAS as well as those who withdrew consent (safety set).

### Emergency medical services naloxone access: A national systematic legal review [^113S5b1z]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Fatal opioid overdose in the United States has reached epidemic levels. Naloxone, an effective opioid antidote, is commonly administered by advanced emergency medical services (EMS) personnel in prehospital settings. While states are rapidly moving to increase naloxone access for community bystanders, the EMS system remains the primary source for out-of-hospital naloxone access. Many communities have limited advanced EMS response capability and may not have prehospital access to the medication indicated for opioid overdose reversal. This research aimed to determine the authority of different levels of EMS personnel to administer naloxone for opioid overdose reversal in the United States, Guam, and Puerto Rico.

The authors systematically reviewed the scope of practice of EMS personnel regarding the administration of naloxone for opioid overdose reversal. All relevant laws, regulations, and policies from the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico in effect as of November 2013 were identified, reviewed, and coded to determine EMS personnel authority at four levels — increasing in order of training: emergency medical responders (EMRs), emergency medical technicians (EMTs), intermediate/advanced EMTs, and paramedics — to administer naloxone. Where available, protocols governing the route and dose of administration were also identified and analyzed.

All 53 jurisdictions license or certify EMS personnel at the paramedic level, and all permit paramedics to administer naloxone.

### Prehospital naloxone and emergency department adverse events: A dose-dependent relationship [^117YJNgJ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate prehospital and emergency department (ED) interventions and outcomes of patients who received prehospital naloxone for a suspected opioid overdose.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective was to evaluate if the individual dose, individual route, total dose, number of prehospital naloxone administrations, or occurrence of a prehospital adverse event (AE) were associated with the occurrence of AEs in the ED. Secondary objectives included a subset analysis of patients who received additional naloxone while in the ED, or were admitted to an intensive care or step-down unit (ICU).

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective, observational chart review of adult patients who received prehospital naloxone and were transported by ambulance to a suburban academic tertiary care center between 2014 and 2017. Descriptive, univariate, and multivariate statistics were used, with p < 0.05 indicating significance.

- **Results**: There were 513 patients included in the analysis, with a median age of 29 years, and a median total prehospital naloxone dose of 2 mg. An increasing number of prehospital naloxone doses, occurrence of a prehospital AE, and a route of administration other than intranasally for the first dose of prehospital naloxone were significantly associated with an increased likelihood of an ED AE. Patients who received less than 2 mg of prehospital naloxone had the least likelihood of being admitted to an ICU, whereas patients who received at least 6 mg had a dramatically increased likelihood of ICU admission.

- **Conclusions**: Our results suggest that an increasing dose of prehospital naloxone is associated with adverse events in the ED, highlighting the need for careful dose consideration in prehospital settings.

### Pharmacokinetics of concentrated naloxone nasal spray for opioid overdose reversal: Phase I healthy volunteer study [^113CaKAu]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

The FDA and Health Canada approved a first nasal naloxone product in November 2015 and October 2016, respectively. However, at the time of writing, only limited pharmacokinetic (PK) data for intranasal (i.n.) naloxone exist, with bioavailability estimates ranging from 4% for dilute formulations (2 mg/5 mL relative to intravenous (i.v.)) to 46–54% for concentrated formulations (0.8 mg/0.1 mL relative to i.v.; 4 mg/0.1 mL relative to intramuscular (i.m.)). Pharmacokinetics of a naloxone nasal spray formulation of intermediate concentration values were initially missing but have been updated in this version [correction added on 9 Feb 2018].

Recent work in Europe has explored different i.n. formulations, aiming to develop a nasal spray suitable for lay administration with rapid onset of action and adequate exposure without the risk of 'over-antagonism'. This study reports on the PK characteristics of nasal naloxone spray at different concentrations and doses, with a particular focus on early absorption. The primary aims of this study were to estimate the PK profile of i.n. naloxone and to compare its early partial systemic exposure to the i.m. reference. The secondary aim was to estimate i.n. bioavailability.

### Buprenorphine [^114sZvCf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Educate patients and caregivers on recognizing the signs and symptoms of an opioid overdose. It is essential to explain that naloxone's effects are temporary and that they must call 911 or get emergency medical help immediately in all cases of known or suspected opioid overdose, even if naloxone is administered. Repeat administration may be necessary, particularly for overdoses involving buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film, as naloxone is often not effective at the doses available for patient access [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Overdosage (10)].

If naloxone is prescribed, advise patients and caregivers:

- **How to treat with naloxone in the event of an opioid overdose**: Ensure they understand the treatment process and are prepared to act.
- **To tell family and friends about their naloxone**: It should be kept in a place where it can be easily accessed by family and friends in an emergency.
- **To read the Patient Information or educational material**: Emphasize the importance of doing this before an opioid emergency occurs so that they know what steps to take.

Advise patients that buprenorphine sublingual tablets contain an opioid that can be a target for individuals who abuse prescription medications or street drugs. Therefore, it is essential to keep the tablets in a secure place to protect them from theft. Ensure that buprenorphine sublingual tablets are stored securely and out of the sight and reach of children, as accidental or deliberate ingestion by a child may cause respiratory depression and could be fatal.

### Pharmacokinetics of concentrated naloxone nasal spray for opioid overdose reversal: Phase I healthy volunteer study [^115dM434]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Our particular focus has been the study of concentrated naloxone nasal spray to identify a dose and formulation comparable to 0.4 mg intramuscularly and similarly appropriate for dose titration, as recommended currently for the intramuscular dose. Our exploratory dose simulations indicate that a 2 mg intranasal dose provides an opportunity for titration, with administration of a second 2 mg intranasal dose resulting in naloxone exposure similar to a series of five 0.4 mg intramuscular doses (i.e. 2 mg intramuscularly in total). Such an intranasal schedule would straddle the overall dose range of an "initial [injectable] dose between 0.4 mg–2 mg", as recommended by the WHO.

The possibility of incremental dose titration presents distinct advantages, as it could significantly reduce the risk of adverse reactions. High initial naloxone doses may trigger severe sudden-onset opioid withdrawal. A recent qualitative analysis of cases of heroin/opioid overdose reversals identified apparent excessive naloxone dosing ("over-antagonism"), sometimes triggering patient self-discharge and active further drug-seeking. In addition to pharmacological toxicity, such "behavioral toxicity" needs to be considered. Withdrawal symptoms can be particularly challenging for overdose witnesses to manage in the community setting. Simulation of repeat administration of the 2 mg intranasal dose produced roughly equivalent plasma naloxone levels to a single 4 mg intranasal dose. Administering a single 2 mg intranasal dose at first and following up with a second 2 mg intranasal dose only if needed could lower the risk of naloxone "over-antagonism" and improve safety.

### An innovative model for naloxone use within an OTP setting: A prospective cohort study [^117HjxVd]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Unintentional opioid overdose deaths are a public health crisis, and naloxone is the most effective harm reduction tool to curb many of these deaths. There is growing evidence that take-home naloxone can prevent opioid overdose in targeted populations. The goal of this study is to measure the opioid overdose reversal rate with take-home naloxone among participants with a diagnosis of opioid use disorder (OUD) in an opioid treatment program (OTP) setting.

- **Methods**: Patients enrolled in an outpatient OTP program were eligible for this prospective cohort study between April 4, 2016, and July 4, 2016. Two hundred forty-four study participants received overdose education, instruction on how to use naloxone, and were provided with 2 doses of a take-home naloxone auto-injector kit. They were subsequently followed for 3 months.

- **Results**: Thirty-one study participants reported overdose reversals using naloxone auto-injector kits on 38 community members. All overdose reversals were heroin-related. Eighty-seven percent of the community members reversed with naloxone were friends or relatives of the study participants.

This study validates that naloxone is not commonly used on the index study participant, but is often used on a secondary target among people who inject drugs. The large number of overdose reversals reported in this prospective study suggests that this novel model for naloxone use may be replicated at other OTP settings to reduce opioid overdose deaths.

### Naloxone dosing after opioid overdose in the era of illicitly manufactured fentanyl [^113t5cQU]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2020). Low credibility.

Illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF) is responsible for a growing number of deaths. Some case series have suggested that IMF overdoses require significantly higher naloxone doses than heroin overdoses. Our objective was to determine if the naloxone dose required to treat an opioid overdose is associated with the finding of fentanyl, opiates, or both on urine drug screen (UDS).

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review was conducted at a single emergency department and its affiliated emergency medical services (EMS) agency. The charts of all patients who received naloxone through this EMS from 1/1/2017 to 6/15/2018 were reviewed. The study included patients diagnosed with a non-suicidal opioid overdose whose UDS was positive for opiates, fentanyl, or both. Data collected included demographics, vital signs, initial GCS, EMS and ED naloxone administrations, response to treatment, laboratory findings, and ED disposition. The fentanyl-only and fentanyl + opiate groups were compared to the opiate-only group using the stratified (by ED provider) variant of the Mann-Whitney U test.

- **Results**: Eight hundred and thirty-seven charts were reviewed, and 121 subjects were included in the final analysis. The median age of included subjects was 38 years and 75% were male. In the naloxone dose analysis, neither the fentanyl-only group (median 0.8 mg, IQR 0.4–1.6; p = 0.68) nor the fentanyl + opiate group (median 0.8 mg, IQR 0.4–1.2; p = 0.56) differed from the opiate-only group (median 0.58 mg, IQR 0.4–1.6).

- **Conclusion**: Our findings refute the notion that high potency synthetic opioids require significantly higher doses of naloxone for effective treatment compared to other opiates.

### Towards evidence-based emergency medicine: Best BETs from the Manchester Royal Infirmary. Diagnosis of drug overdose by rapid reversal with naloxone [^116DyNWm]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

A short-cut review was carried out to establish whether naloxone may have an awakening effect in patients who have not taken opiates, thereby clouding its use as a diagnostic maneuver. The clinical bottom line is that opioid antagonists are able to reverse symptoms such as altered consciousness in patients who have not taken an overdose of opiates. It is unclear in which conditions or circumstances this occurs.

### Reversal of opioid-induced ventilatory depression using low-dose naloxone (0.04 mg): a case series [^111Z69RV]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2016). Low credibility.

Naloxone is commonly administered in the emergency department (ED) to reverse opioid intoxication. Several naloxone dose recommendations exist for the acute management of opioid intoxication based on limited published clinical data. This case series presents ED patients with opioid-induced ventilatory depression that was reversed using low-dose naloxone (0.04 mg with titration).

- **Methods**: ED patients with opioid-induced ventilatory depression requiring naloxone administration were identified through medical toxicology consultation. A retrospective review of medical records was performed. Data collected included patient history, pre- and post-naloxone observations such as respiratory rate (RR), pulse oximetry (pulse ox), end-tidal CO2 level (ET-CO2), and Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS).

- **Results**: Fifteen ED patients with moderate to severe opioid-induced ventilatory depression (median RR, 6 breaths/min) were managed using a low-dose naloxone strategy. Twelve of the 15 patients reported ingestion of methadone (range, 30 to 180 mg). The median naloxone dose of 0.08 mg (range, 0.04 to 0.12 mg) effectively reversed opioid-induced ventilatory and CNS depression. Two patients experienced acute opioid withdrawal after receiving 0.08 mg.

- **Conclusion**: ED patients with moderate to severe opioid-induced ventilatory depression can be reversed using 0.04 mg IV naloxone with appropriate dose titration.

### Heroin overdose resuscitation with naloxone: Patient uses own prescribed supply to save the life of a peer [^113rFEHT]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Opiate overdose is the primary cause of death among injection-drug users, representing a major public health concern worldwide. Opiate overdose can be reversed through the timely administration of naloxone, and users have expressed willingness to carry the antidote for emergency use (take-home naloxone). In November 2014, new WHO guidelines identified that naloxone should be made available to anyone at risk of witnessing an overdose. We present the case of a 46-year-old man in opioid-maintenance treatment who used take-home naloxone to rescue an overdose victim. This is the first-ever account of a patient using dose titration of naloxone to restore respiratory function while minimizing the risk of adverse effects.

To improve the safety of take-home naloxone, the authors call for clinicians involved in the treatment of opiate users to:

- **Prescribe take-home naloxone**: to all patients.
- **Forewarn patients**: of potential side effects.
- **Instruct patients in naloxone dose titration**: This instruction is crucial to safely restore respiratory function.

### Comparison of intranasal and intramuscular naloxone in opioid overdoses managed by ambulance staff: a double-dummy, randomised, controlled trial [^11715U8W]. Addiction (2022). High credibility.

This study aimed to measure and evaluate the clinical response to nasal naloxone in opioid overdoses in the pre-hospital environment. The research was designed as a randomised, controlled, double-dummy, blinded, non-inferiority trial, conducted at two centres. Participants were included by ambulance staff in Oslo and Trondheim, Norway, and treated at the place where the overdose occurred.

Men and women aged above 18 years with miosis, a rate of respiration ≤ 8/min, and a Glasgow Coma Score < 12/15 were included. Informed consent was obtained through a deferred-consent procedure. A commercially available 1.4 mg/0.1 mL intranasal naloxone was compared with 0.8 mg/2 mL naloxone administered intramuscularly.

The primary endpoint was the restoration of spontaneous respiration of ≥ 10 breaths/min within 10 minutes. Secondary outcomes included time to restoration of spontaneous respiration, recurrence of overdose within 12 hours, and adverse events.

In total, 201 participants were analysed in the per-protocol population. Heroin was suspected in 196 cases. With 82% of the participants being men, 105 (97.2%) in the intramuscular group and 74 (79.6%) in the intranasal group returned to adequate spontaneous respiration within 10 minutes after one dose. The estimated risk difference was 17.5% (95% CI, 8.9%-26.1%) in favour of the intramuscular group. The risk of receiving additional naloxone was 19.4% (95% CI, 9.0%-29.7%) higher in the intranasal group. Adverse reactions were evenly distributed, except for drug withdrawal reactions, where the estimated risk difference was higher.

### Comparison of intranasal and intramuscular naloxone in opioid overdoses managed by ambulance staff: a double-dummy, randomised, controlled trial [^114kJeuH]. Addiction (2022). High credibility.

The study aims to measure and evaluate the clinical response to nasal naloxone in opioid overdoses in the pre-hospital environment. This randomized, controlled, double-dummy, blinded, non-inferiority trial was conducted at two centers.

Participants were included by ambulance staff in Oslo and Trondheim, Norway, and treated at the place where the overdose occurred. Men and women aged above 18 years with miosis, a respiration rate of ≤ 8/min, and a Glasgow Coma Score of < 12/15 were included. Informed consent was obtained through a deferred-consent procedure.

A commercially available 1.4 mg/0.1 mL intranasal naloxone was compared with 0.8 mg/2 mL naloxone administered intramuscularly. The primary endpoint was the restoration of spontaneous respiration of ≥ 10 breaths/min within 10 minutes. Secondary outcomes included the time to restore spontaneous respiration, recurrence of overdose within 12 hours, and adverse events.

In total, 201 participants were analyzed in the per-protocol population. Heroin was suspected in 196 cases. With 82% of the participants being men, 105 (97.2%) in the intramuscular group and 74 (79.6%) in the intranasal group returned to adequate spontaneous respiration within 10 minutes after one dose. The estimated risk difference was 17.5% [95% CI, 8.9%–26.1%] in favor of the intramuscular group. The risk of receiving additional naloxone was 19.4% [95% CI, 9.0%–29.7%] higher in the intranasal group. Adverse reactions were evenly distributed, except for drug withdrawal reactions.

### Acute opioid withdrawal following intramuscular administration of naloxone 1.6 mg: A prospective out-of-hospital series [^116PxctF]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2022). High credibility.

The study aimed to investigate the frequency of severe agitation following a single 1.6 mg intramuscular naloxone dose, considering that large doses of intramuscular naloxone are frequently used in out-of-hospital settings to reverse opioid toxicity. Its use is less common in hospitals due to concerns about opioid withdrawal, particularly agitation.

- **Methods**: A prospective study was conducted involving adult patients (older than 15 years) treated by an Australian state ambulance service. A 1.6 mg intramuscular administration of naloxone was used for respiratory depression, with respiratory rate measured 1 hour after naloxone administration. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of presentations with acute opioid withdrawal, characterized by tachycardia (pulse rate > 100 beats/min), hypertension (systolic > 140 mm Hg), vomiting, agitation, seizure, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, or pulmonary edema, as well as the reversal of respiratory depression (respiratory rate > 10 breaths/min and saturation > 92% or Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15).

- **Results**: From October 2019 to July 2021, there were 197 presentations in 171 patients, with a median age of 41 years (ranging from 18 to 80 years); 119 of the total patients were men (70%). The most commonly involved opioids were heroin (131 cases, 66%), oxycodone (14 cases, 7%), and morphine (11 cases, 6%). Severe agitation occurred in 14 presentations (7% [95% confidence interval 4% to 12%]). Opioid withdrawal symptoms occurred in 76 presentations.

### Assessment of a naloxone coprescribing alert for patients at risk of opioid overdose: A quality improvement project [^116VvjzU]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2022). Low credibility.

Patients taking high doses of opioids or taking opioids in combination with other central nervous system depressants are at increased risk of opioid overdose. Coprescribing the opioid-reversal agent naloxone is an essential safety measure recommended by the Surgeon General; however, the rate of naloxone coprescribing is low. Therefore, we set out to determine whether a targeted clinical decision support alert could increase the rate of naloxone coprescribing.

- **Methods**: We conducted a before-after study from January 2019 to April 2021 at a large academic health system in the Southeast. We developed a targeted point-of-care decision support notification in the electronic health record to suggest ordering naloxone for patients who have a high risk of opioid overdose based on a high morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD) ≥ 90 mg, concomitant benzodiazepine prescription, or a history of opioid use disorder or opioid overdose. We measured the rate of outpatient naloxone prescribing as our primary measure. A multivariable logistic regression model with robust variance to adjust for prescriptions within the same prescriber was implemented to estimate the association between alerts and naloxone coprescribing.

- **Results**: The baseline naloxone coprescribing rate in 2019 was 0.28 (95% confidence interval, 0.24–0.31) naloxone prescriptions per 100 opioid prescriptions. After alert implementation, the naloxone coprescribing rate increased to 4.51 (95% CI, 4.33–4.68) naloxone prescriptions per 100 opioid prescriptions (P < .001).

### Pharmacokinetics of concentrated naloxone nasal spray for opioid overdose reversal: Phase I healthy volunteer study [^112R6yAt]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Pharmacokinetic profiles of naloxone were evaluated in this study, with PK parameters shown in Table 1. Mean plasma naloxone concentrations during the first 2 hours post-dosing are displayed in Figure 1, with an expanded depiction of the first 20 minutes.

- **Intravenous (IV) administration**: Plasma concentration following i.v. administration (0.4 mg) spiked and reached an early peak (geometric mean C max 5.94 ng/ml, median T max 2 minutes), followed by a rapid decline during the next 10 minutes and a gradual decline thereafter.

- **Intramuscular (IM) administration**: The i.m. administration (0.4 mg) showed more gradual early uptake, with a lower and later peak (geometric mean C max 1.27 ng/ml, median T max 10 minutes) and a flatter, slower decline thereafter. Overall, AUCt-based exposure was comparable for i.m. and i.v. administrations.

- **Intranasal (IN) administration**: All i.n. doses (1 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg) achieved maximum plasma levels within 15–30 minutes (median T max). Geometric mean C max values for 1 mg i.n. (1.51 ng/ml), 2 mg i.n. (2.87 ng/ml), and 4 mg i.n. (6.02 ng/ml) were greater than for i.m. administration. For all three i.n. doses, geometric mean AUCt values (2.56–10.01 h × ng/ml) exceeded those of 0.4 mg i.m. and i.v. (both: 2.01 h × ng/ml). Of the three i.n. doses, the 2 mg dose followed the 0.4 mg i.m. curve most closely during the first 10 minutes post-dose, reaching blood levels at twice the 0.4 mg i.m. dose by 15 minutes and maintaining blood levels at more than twice the 0.4 mg i.m. dose for the next 2 hours.

### Comparison of intranasal and intramuscular naloxone in opioid overdoses managed by ambulance staff: a double-dummy, randomised, controlled trial [^112H64YY]. Addiction (2022). High credibility.

A single dose of 1.4 mg/0.1 mL intranasal (IN) naloxone was inferior to 0.8 mg intramuscular (IM) naloxone in terms of return to spontaneous breathing at 10 minutes after administration. In the IM naloxone group, 97% of cases achieved the primary endpoint, which outperformed our expectation of 88%. After a single 1.4 mg/0.1 mL spray, 80% achieved satisfactory respiration within 10 minutes, likely due to an average slower uptake of naloxone in the IN group. After 3 minutes, the stronger effect of IM became evident (Figure 3), and within the follow-up of 10 minutes, the effect of naloxone was 2.3 minutes slower in the IN group than in the IM group. The nasal effect curve was linear from about 3 minutes until censoring at 10 minutes, where non-responders were administered additional IM naloxone according to protocol.

Previous pharmacokinetic studies have shown that IN serum concentration continues to rise after 10 minutes, and measurement beyond 10 minutes would likely show an overall similar potency between IM and IN. Both 0.8 mg IM and 1.4 mg/0.1 mL IN naloxone showed few and mostly mild adverse reactions. There was no difference in the overall risk of adverse reactions, overdose complications, follow-up after treatment, or notable opioid overdose recurrence. However, more drug withdrawal reactions occurred in the IM group in the safety set. This is not a trivial matter, because over-antagonism is associated with physical reactions, aggression, refusal of treatment, and premature self-discharge.

To avoid over-antagonism and triggering opioid withdrawal, naloxone should be titrated appropriately.

### High opioid doses, naloxone, and central nervous system active medications received by Medicare-enrolled adults [^114ZMg9P]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2023). High credibility.

In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a guideline to address morbidity and mortality associated with opioid prescribing in the United States (US). This guideline highlighted opioid doses and the co-prescribing of medications such as hypnotics, benzodiazepines, and skeletal muscle relaxants (SMRs) associated with adverse events and increased healthcare utilization. Additionally, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a communication recommending avoiding the prescribing of central nervous system (CNS) active medications among patients utilizing opioids due to increased risks for respiratory depression, overdose, and death.

Subsequently, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recommended naloxone co-prescribing for patients at greater risk of an opioid overdose. These included individuals diagnosed with substance use disorder, utilizing ≥ 50 morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) per day, concurrently prescribed benzodiazepines, or having already experienced an opioid overdose.

One means of improving the uptake of naloxone among patients at risk for opioid overdose is enrollment in Medication Therapy Management (MTM) services. These services are utilized to comprehensively assess medication regimens to identify medication-related problems (MRPs). They provide recommendations that improve the uptake of evidence-based medications and indicated medication doses, and reduce the prevalence of supra-therapeutic medication doses, and drug–drug or drug–di interactions.

### Naloxone — does over-antagonism matter? Evidence of iatrogenic harm after emergency treatment of heroin/opioid overdose [^114EdAzr]. Addiction (2015). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to analyze drug users' views and experiences of naloxone during emergency resuscitation after illicit opiate overdose. The study sought to identify any evidence of harm caused by excessive naloxone dosing ('over-antagonism') and to explore implications for the medical administration of naloxone within contemporary emergency settings.

The design involved a re-analysis of a large qualitative data set, comprising 70 face-to-face interviews conducted within a few hours of a heroin/opioid overdose occurring. It also included observations from hospital settings and an additional 130 interviews with illicit opiate users. The data were generated between 1997 and 1999.

The setting included emergency departments, drug services, and pharmacies in two Scottish cities. The participants were two hundred illicit opiate users, including 131 males and 69 females.

The findings indicated that participants had limited knowledge of naloxone and its pharmacology. However, they routinely described it in negative terms and were critical of its medical administration. Specifically, they complained that naloxone induced acute withdrawal symptoms, leading patients to refuse treatment, become aggressive, discharge themselves from hospital, and take additional street drugs to counter the effects of naloxone. Participants believed that hospital staff should administer naloxone selectively and cautiously and that counter-naloxone medication should be prescribed if dosing precipitated withdrawals. In contrast, observational data suggested that participants did not always know they had received naloxone, and hospital doctors did not necessarily administer it incautiously.

In conclusion, opiate users in urban Scotland repeatedly reported the negative impacts of naloxone administration experienced during overdose treatments.

### Buprenorphine and naloxone [^114WZkUu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver. Patients being treated for opioid use disorder have the potential for relapse, putting them at risk for opioid overdose. Thus, strongly consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose, both when initiating and renewing treatment with buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film. Also, consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or opioid overdose.

Advise patients and caregivers that naloxone may also be administered for a known or suspected overdose with buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film itself. Higher than normal doses and repeated administration of naloxone may be necessary due to the long duration of action of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film and its affinity for the mu-opioid receptor.

Inform patients and caregivers of their options for obtaining naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g. by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program).

Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and, if naloxone is prescribed, how to treat with naloxone. Emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help, even if naloxone is administered.

### Take-home naloxone at opioid treatment programs: A lifesaver [^113HfTBM]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Employing a similar federal policy approach but using a harm reduction strategy, opioid overdose deaths could be reduced by requiring opioid treatment programs (OTPs) to provide at least two doses of naloxone and brief overdose education for every patient entered in their program. The most recent practice guidelines from the American Society of Addiction Medicine and the American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry recommend the co-prescription of naloxone (not take-home naloxone specifically) as a harm reduction medication at OTPs and outpatient-based opioid programs. Finally, although the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration's opioid overdose toolkit (2018) suggests that co-prescription of naloxone may benefit patients receiving medication-assisted treatment and high-dose opioids, the toolkit does not reference take-home naloxone, except in suggesting that it should not be cost-prohibitive.

Studies have shown that people who inject drugs will use naloxone within their social network to help reverse the opioid overdose of a friend, family member, or even a stranger. By directly providing two initial doses of naloxone and additional doses as needed, patients enrolled in an OTP can educate their social network about the harm reduction benefits of naloxone. These studies have demonstrated that the patient's family members and friends will readily use the naloxone on the patient or a community member. McDonald et al. performed a systematic review of 22 well-designed take-home naloxone programs and concluded that not only were the evaluated programs safe, but they also reduced overdose deaths in both the participants and the surrounding community.

### Development of a translational model to assess the impact of opioid overdose and naloxone dosing on respiratory depression and cardiac arrest [^113pPqZ9]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). High credibility.

In response to a surge of deaths from synthetic opioid overdoses, there have been increased efforts to distribute naloxone products in community settings. Prior research has assessed the effectiveness of naloxone in the hospital setting. However, it is challenging to assess naloxone dosing regimens in the community and first-responder settings, including the reversal of respiratory depression effects of fentanyl and its derivatives (fentanyls).

Here, we describe the development and validation of a mechanistic model that combines opioid mu receptor binding kinetics, opioid agonist and antagonist pharmacokinetics, and human respiratory and circulatory physiology to evaluate naloxone dosing for reversing respiratory depression. Validation supports our model, which can quantitatively predict displacement of opioids by naloxone from opioid mu receptors in vitro, hypoxia-induced cardiac arrest in vivo, and opioid-induced respiratory depression in humans from different fentanyls.

After validation, overdose simulations were performed with fentanyl and carfentanil, followed by the administration of different intramuscular naloxone products. Carfentanil induced more cardiac arrest events and was more difficult to reverse than fentanyl. Opioid receptor binding data indicated that carfentanil has substantially slower dissociation kinetics from the opioid receptor compared with nine other fentanyls tested, which likely contributes to the difficulty in reversing carfentanil. Administration of the same dose of naloxone intramuscularly from two different naloxone products with different formulations resulted.

### Pulmonary complications of opioid overdose treated with naloxone [^1123oN1S]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

We aim to determine whether administration of higher doses of naloxone for the treatment of opioid overdose is associated with increased pulmonary complications.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective, observational, cross-sectional study of 1,831 patients treated with naloxone by the City of Pittsburgh Bureau of Emergency Medical Services. Emergency medical services and hospital records were abstracted for data regarding naloxone dosing, route of administration, and clinical outcomes, including the development of complications such as pulmonary edema, aspiration pneumonia, and aspiration pneumonitis. For the purposes of this investigation, we defined high-dose naloxone as total administration exceeding 4.4 mg. Multivariable analysis was used to attempt to account for confounders such as the route of administration and pretreatment morbidity.

- **Results**: Patients receiving out-of-hospital naloxone in doses exceeding 4.4 mg were 62% more likely to have a pulmonary complication after opioid overdose (42% versus 26% absolute risk; odds ratio 2.14; 95% confidence interval 1.44 to 3.18). This association remained statistically significant after multivariable analysis with logistic regression (odds ratio 1.85; 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 3.04). A secondary analysis showed an increased risk of 27% versus 13% (odds ratio 2.57; 95% confidence interval 1.45 to 4.54) when initial naloxone dosing exceeded 0.4 mg. Pulmonary edema occurred in 1.1% of patients.

- **Conclusion**: Higher doses of naloxone in the out-of-hospital treatment of opioid overdose are associated with a higher risk of pulmonary complications.

### A comparison of intramuscular (Zimhi) and intranasal naloxone (Narcan) in reversal of fentanyl-induced apnea: a randomized, crossover, open-label trial [^115V2zn6]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The opioid receptor antagonist naloxone remains the primary treatment for opioid overdose. While originally available as an injectable for IV or IM use in a clinical setting, new formulations have recently been approved for use outside the hospital. IN and IM naloxone can be easily administered by first responders and bystanders. However, the efficacy and optimal dosing regimen have not been investigated in a controlled setting, particularly not in individuals who are apneic following the rapid IV administration of high-dose fentanyl. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first respiratory study that quantifies the effect of IM and IN naloxone following a 2-minute period of fentanyl-induced apnea.

This experimental study was designed to closely reproduce an opioid overdose in a community setting, albeit in a safe and monitored environment. During the study, personnel with airway management and resuscitation skills were continuously present. The use of supplemental oxygen prevented serious hypoxic adverse events. This is certainly different from the real-world setting, where overdose victims breathe air with 21% oxygen; this should be considered when extrapolating our findings to community overdose settings. In real-world settings, oxygen desaturations will occur rapidly and negatively impact cardiac output, complicating effective treatment with any naloxone formulation due to suboptimal drug distribution.

As discussed previously, the rescue of opioid overdose victims should include naloxone administration combined with resuscitation efforts, such as ventilation.

### Pharmacokinetics of concentrated naloxone nasal spray for opioid overdose reversal: Phase I healthy volunteer study [^111sgCfd]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Taken together with other recently published data, the results of this study lend strong support to the potential value of concentrated intranasal (i.n.) naloxone spray for opioid overdose reversal. Across all three i.n. doses, naloxone exposure was dose-proportional, with approximately 50% absolute bioavailability. We identified the 2 mg/0.1 mL i.n. dose as most similar to the 0.4 mg intramuscular (i.m.) reference, producing comparable early naloxone concentrations. The 2 mg i.n. dose had the added feature of effective maintenance of plasma levels for the next 2 hours. In September 2017, following acceptance of this manuscript but pre-publication, the European Medicines Agency gave a positive opinion to the application for product license for a 1.8 mg/0.1 mL concentrated naloxone nasal spray under the trade name Nyxoid; 1.8 mg naloxone in Nyxoid is equivalent to 2 mg naloxone hydrochloride.

Clinicians and policymakers will need to consider the potential merits of the different time-course profiles, including speed of onset and duration of effect, of i.n. versus injectable naloxone and may also see implementation advantages with i.n. naloxone for broad-based take-home naloxone provision.

### Low-dose oral naloxone reverses opioid-induced constipation and analgesia [^1121qr9s]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2002). Low credibility.

The most common side effect of opioid therapy is constipation, which is often difficult to treat and is believed to be primarily a peripheral effect. Single large doses of oral naloxone have been shown to be efficacious in reversing opioid-induced constipation; however, they often cause the unwanted side effect of analgesia reversal. This study evaluated the effects on constipation and analgesia of low doses of oral naloxone given three times daily. Patients taking stable doses of opioids with complaints of constipation were recruited for this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Patients were given 4 mg or 2 mg of oral naloxone or placebo, three times daily. Stool frequency and symptoms related to constipation were recorded daily. Patients also recorded the daily amount of analgesics required to maintain pain control. Nine patients were recruited for the study, and all the patients who received oral naloxone had some improvement in their bowel frequency. Three of the patients also experienced reversal of analgesia, including one who had complete reversal of analgesia. This study demonstrates that reversal of analgesia still occurred despite dividing the oral naloxone into very low doses relative to the total dose of opioid used. Patients using high doses of opioids appear to be the most vulnerable to the analgesic effect of oral naloxone.

### Naloxone administration in US emergency departments, 2000–2011 [^116bD9tb]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2016). Low credibility.

Rates of opioid overdose and opioid-related emergency department (ED) visits have increased dramatically. Naloxone is an effective antidote to potentially fatal opioid overdose; however, little is known about naloxone administration in ED settings. We examined trends and correlates of naloxone administration in ED visits nationally from 2000 to 2011. Using data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, we examined ED visits involving: (1) the administration of naloxone or (2) a diagnosis of opioid overdose, abuse, or dependence. We assessed patient characteristics in these visits, including concomitant administration of prescription opioid medications. Logistic regression was used to identify correlates of naloxone administration.

From 2000 to 2011, naloxone was administered in an estimated 1.7 million adult ED visits nationally; 19% of these visits recorded a diagnosis of opioid overdose, abuse, or dependence. An estimated 2.9 million adult ED visits were related to opioid overdose, abuse, or dependence; 11% of these visits involved naloxone administration. In multivariable logistic regression models, patient age, race, insurance, and non-rural facility locations were independently associated with naloxone administration. An opioid medication was provided in 14% of visits involving naloxone administration.

Naloxone was administered in a minority of ED visits related to opioid overdose, abuse, or dependence. Among all ED visits involving naloxone administration, prescription opioids were also provided in one in seven visits. Further work should explore the pr…

### Development and preclinical testing of a naloxone prodrug depot for extended protection against opioid overdose [^1162i4E7]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

The opioid crisis, driven by synthetic opioids like fentanyl, demands innovative solutions. The opioid antidote naloxone has a short action (~1 hour), requiring repeated doses. To address this, we present a new and simple naloxone prodrug delivery system repurposing a hydrophilic derivative of acoramidis, a potent transthyretin ligand. When the fully soluble prodrug solution is administered subcutaneously, the prodrug forms a zwitterionic depot at physiological pH, enabling extended naloxone release. This non-polymeric depot-forming approach is rare and employs carboxylesterase 2 for selective bioactivation, ensuring controlled drug release. In male rats and cynomolgus monkeys, a single subcutaneous dose provides steady naloxone release over several days, reducing blood-brain barrier diffusion, withdrawal symptoms, and CNS toxicity. Preclinical studies demonstrated efficacy in rat overdose models and achieved monkey naloxone levels matching effective human therapeutic levels. Although monkey efficacy was not assessed, combined rat efficacy and monkey pharmacokinetics suggest strong potential for successful human translation.

### Electronic advisories increase naloxone prescribing across health care settings [^116bZ5dy]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Naloxone is a life-saving, yet underprescribed, medication that is recommended for patients at high risk of opioid overdose.

- **Objective**: We set out to evaluate the changes in prescriber practices due to the use of an electronic health record (EHR) advisory that prompted opioid prescribers to co-prescribe naloxone when prescribing a high-dose opioid. It also provided prescribers with guidance on decreasing opioid doses for safety.

- **Design**: This retrospective chart abstraction study looked at all opioid prescriptions and all naloxone prescriptions written as emergency department (ED) discharge, inpatient hospital discharge, or outpatient medications, between July 1, 2018, and February 1, 2020. The EHR advisory went live on June 1, 2019.

- **Subjects**: Included in the analysis were all adult patients seen in the aforementioned settings at a large county hospital and associated outpatient clinics.

- **Main measures**: We performed an interrupted time series analysis looking at naloxone prescriptions and daily opioid dosing in morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs), before and after initiation of the EHR advisory.

- **Key results**: The EHR advisory was associated with changes in prescribers' behavior, leading to increased naloxone prescriptions and decreased prescribed opioid doses.

- **Conclusions**: EHR advisories are an effective systems-level intervention to enhance the safety of prescribed opioids and increase rates of naloxone prescribing.

### Pharmacokinetics of concentrated naloxone nasal spray over first 30 minutes post-dosing: Analysis of suitability for opioid overdose reversal [^112W1s9c]. Addiction (2017). Low credibility.

The lack of non-injectable naloxone formulations has impeded widespread take-home provision for the prevention of heroin/opioid overdose deaths. For non-injectable formulations that are finally being investigated, a rapid onset of action and sufficient bioavailability are vital. We present an analysis of data from a study of concentrated naloxone nasal spray formulations. Our aims are to assess: (1) pharmacokinetic properties and (2) suitability for overdose reversal in terms of naloxone absorption within 30 minutes post-dosing.

- **Design and interventions/comparator**: Open-label, randomized, four-way cross-over Latin-square pharmacokinetic study of naloxone administration by three routes: intranasal at two doses (8 mg/0.4 ml, 16 mg/0.4 ml) versus sublingual (16 mg/ml) versus intravenous reference (1 mg/ml).

- **Setting**: Clinical Pharmacology Unit at The Ohio State University (Columbus, OH, USA).

- **Participants**: Twelve healthy volunteers (age 20–41; seven female).

- **Measurements**: From blood plasma naloxone concentrations, (1) standard pharmacokinetic parameters, including maximum plasma concentration (C max) and mean absolute bioavailability (F%, relative to intravenous injection), were determined, as well as (2) partial area under the curve (AUC) values, t max (time to maximum plasma concentration), and t 50% (time to 50% of maximum plasma concentration) as measures of early absorption.

- **Findings**: Bioavailability was F% = 25–28% for intranasal naloxone. Sublingual had low bioavailability (F% = 2%) and was not considered further. Mean C max values for 8 mg (12.8).

### Distribution of naloxone for overdose prevention to chronic pain patients [^115doxPS]. Preventive Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

In this commentary, we reflect on the growing opioid overdose epidemic and propose that chronic pain patients prescribed opioids are contributing to the increasing mortality rates. We advocate for expanding naloxone access and overdose prevention training, which have historically been directed, when available, to injection drug users, to include chronic pain patients who may be at high risk for accidental opioid overdose.

### Pharmacokinetics of concentrated naloxone nasal spray for opioid overdose reversal: Phase I healthy volunteer study [^113UK5Du]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

To explore the pharmacokinetics of repeated administration, intranasal (i.n.) bioavailability (relative to intramuscular (i.m.) as reported above) was in the range of 47–51%. Hence, a 2:1 dose ratio (i.n.:i.m.) was assumed for the simulations, comparing cumulative 2 × 2 mg i.n. doses at 3-minute intervals with five cumulative 0.4 mg i.m. doses at 3-minute intervals (total 2 mg i.m.).

Figure 3 shows the peak plasma level from the observed 2 mg i.n. dose occurring between those from the observed i.m. 0.4 mg dose and the simulated 2 mg i.m. dose (5 × 0.4 mg administered 3 minutes apart). This simulation suggests that, in a hypothetical overdose scenario, a second dose of 2 mg i.n. administered after 3 minutes would expose the patient to approximately the same plasma naloxone levels, in terms of both initial rise and peak, as five consecutive i.m. 0.4 mg doses (also 3 minutes apart), i.e. 2 mg in total.

- **Scaled mean plasma naloxone concentrations**: After repeat administration at 3-minute intervals (versus mean observed profiles of 0.4 mg intramuscular (i.m.) and 2 mg intranasal (i.n.) doses).

In addition, the plasma naloxone levels from the simulated 2 × 2 mg i.n. dose declined more slowly than the simulated 5 × 0.4 mg i.m. administrations, indicating that plasma naloxone concentrations would be sustained for longer than those from i.m. dosing.

### Opioid overdose: Limitations in naloxone reversal of respiratory depression and prevention of cardiac arrest [^115QUarr]. Anesthesiology (2023). Low credibility.

Opioids are effective analgesics, but they can have harmful adverse effects, such as addiction and potentially fatal respiratory depression. Naloxone is currently the only available treatment for reversing the negative effects of opioids, including respiratory depression. However, the effectiveness of naloxone, particularly after an opioid overdose, varies depending on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the opioid that was overdosed. Long-acting opioids, and those with a high affinity at the µ-opioid receptor and/or slow receptor dissociation kinetics, are particularly resistant to the effects of naloxone. In this review, the authors examine the pharmacology of naloxone and its safety and limitations in reversing opioid-induced respiratory depression under different circumstances, including its ability to prevent cardiac arrest.

### Naloxone counseling for harm reduction and patient engagement [^114b3pq1]. Family Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The United States is experiencing an epidemic of opioid-related deaths. Naloxone, the drug of choice for reversing acute opioid overdoses, is not routinely prescribed for outpatient use. The aims of this project were to improve naloxone awareness, increase naloxone prescribing, and prevent opioid overdoses.

- **Methods**: A naloxone counseling intervention was implemented in three family health centers by an interprofessional team of providers, including family medicine physicians, clinical pharmacists, and social workers. An outreach letter was designed with provider input, an electronic order set was developed to facilitate prescribing, and intranasal naloxone kits were assembled for free dispensing. Providers and staff received education about opioid overdose and naloxone prescribing. Faculty and resident physicians were surveyed before and after the intervention to assess their attitudes. Patients who received naloxone kits were surveyed to assess their attitudes and use of opioids and naloxone.

- **Results**: Over 16 months, 71 outreach letters were distributed and 97 naloxone kits were dispensed. The majority of kits were prescribed for illicit opioid use. Faculty and resident physician surveys indicated improved knowledge about naloxone prescribing and increased professional satisfaction in caring for patients requesting opioids. Surveyed patients endorsed high levels of comfort discussing opioid use with their primary care physician. Five successful opioid overdose reversals were reported.

- **Conclusions**: An interprofessional naloxone counseling intervention demonstrated the feasibility and impact of naloxone prescribing in family health centers, with positive outcomes in overdose prevention and professional satisfaction.

### Characteristics of patients with opioid use disorder associated with performing overdose reversals in the community: An opioid treatment program analysis [^116r5RQQ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The opioid crisis is a US public health epidemic. Drug overdose (OD) deaths exceed all other causes of injury, including motor vehicle accidents and gun-related violence. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates there are 91 US deaths per day involving opioids. Approximately 3 million Americans suffer from opioid use disorder (OUD), a condition manifested by escalating physical and psychological cravings for opioid analgesics.

People begin using opioid analgesics for many different reasons. Some initially obtain prescription opioids from a medical provider for a diagnosis of acute or chronic pain. Others may begin using prescription opioids from a friend, relative, or stranger for the psychoactive feeling of well-being. Ultimately, the majority of people who develop OUD will switch to heroin because of the lower cost and accessibility. Polydrug use among people who use heroin, especially the use of alcohol and benzodiazepines, is an important contributor to drug OD.

Although self-administration of naloxone is not possible during an OD event, people who OD, especially from heroin, are usually not alone. Community members present, when trained and supplied with naloxone, can serve as first responders by performing OD reversals on others in their community. Community members who perform OD reversals are often reluctant to call emergency medical services due to fear of police. Other barriers to naloxone access include cost, inadequate first responder training, and lengthy response times, especially in rural communities.

### Characteristics of patients with opioid use disorder associated with performing overdose reversals in the community: An opioid treatment program analysis [^112VZSnr]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Results from our previous 3-month study suggested that providing opioid overdose (OD) education and take-home naloxone in an opioid treatment program (OTP) setting may reduce deaths from opioid ODs in others. This 6-month prospective cohort study, with an 87% study participant completion rate, evaluated characteristics of those performing overdose reversals in the community. Study participants with greater odds of using take-home naloxone to reverse overdoses in others were:

- **Demographics and personal experience**: (a) younger than 30 years, (b) Hispanic, (c) had personal experience of emergency room care for an overdose, (d) had previously witnessed others who have overdosed.

- **Urine toxicology screens**: (e) had positive urine toxicology screens for two or more illicit substances, or (f) no urine toxicology screens.

- **Urine toxicology screens**: These results indicate that patients who are performing overdose reversals in the community tend to have positive or missing urine toxicology screens. This suggests that these study participants are using illicit substances regularly despite receiving medication-assisted treatment (MAT). Persistent illegal polydrug use in these study participants may indicate their continued social connectedness to those at high risk for opioid OD. Study participants performed overdose reversals on someone they knew 86% of the time, whereas only 14% of the reported overdose reversals were performed on a stranger. These findings are in accordance with our hypothesis that individuals who test positive for urine toxicological screenings may be more connected to persons who inject drugs (PWID) and, thus, may be more likely to witness and perform overdose reversals on others in their communities.

Only five participants (< 2%) in this study were p.

### Community-based opioid overdose prevention programs providing naloxone - United States, 2010 [^116iaZLA]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2012). Low credibility.

Drug overdose death rates have increased steadily in the United States since 1979. In 2008, a total of 36,450 drug overdose deaths (i.e. unintentional, intentional [suicide or homicide], or undetermined intent) were reported, with prescription opioid analgesics (e.g. oxycodone, hydrocodone, and methadone), cocaine, and heroin being the drugs most commonly involved.

Since the mid-1990s, community-based programs have offered opioid overdose prevention services to persons who use drugs, their families and friends, and service providers. Since 1996, an increasing number of these programs have provided the opioid antagonist naloxone hydrochloride, the treatment of choice to reverse the potentially fatal respiratory depression caused by overdose of heroin and other opioids. Naloxone has no effect on non-opioid overdoses (e.g. cocaine, benzodiazepines, or alcohol).

In October 2010, the Harm Reduction Coalition, a national advocacy and capacity-building organization, surveyed 50 programs known to distribute naloxone in the United States to collect data on local program locations, naloxone distribution, and overdose reversals. This report summarizes the findings for the 48 programs that completed the survey and the 188 local programs represented by the responses. Since the first opioid overdose prevention program began distributing naloxone in 1996, the respondent programs reported training and distributing naloxone to 53,032 persons and receiving reports of 10,171 overdose reversals. Providing opioid overdose education and naloxone to persons who use drugs and to persons who might be in a position to assist them remains crucial in tackling overdose-related fatalities.

### Implementation of a naloxone best practice advisory into an electronic health record [^1132w3zG]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Naloxone is a harm reduction tool for mitigating the rising rate of opioid overdose deaths. We sought to develop and implement an alert in the electronic health record outlining which patients are at higher risk of opioid overdose and should be coprescribed naloxone. Our aim was to increase coprescribing of naloxone to qualified patients. We also endeavored to evaluate naloxone prescription volume, fill rates, and statewide dispenses before and after alert implementation.

- **Methods**: We developed the electronic alert according to a state opioid safety initiative specifying under which conditions it should activate. We collected data on naloxone prescriptions ordered in the five months before and after alert implementation and unique patients with a naloxone dispense statewide. We used internal pharmacy data to evaluate the percentage of fills and employed a χ² test to assess changes in percentage of fills. We used descriptive statistics and t-tests to analyze changes in the number of prescriptions and changes in unique patients dispensed naloxone.

- **Results**: We found a 2144% increase in the number of monthly naloxone prescriptions written after the alert became active. There was no statistically significant change in the percentage of fills. There was a 402.8% increase in unique patients statewide with a naloxone dispense after alert implementation.

- **Conclusions**: Designing and implementing an electronic alert prompting naloxone coprescription are feasible and were associated with substantial increases in numbers of naloxone prescriptions and patients with naloxone dispenses.

### Systematic review of naloxone dosing and adverse events in the emergency department [^114GksWL]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Experts recommend using the lowest effective dose of naloxone to balance the reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression and avoid precipitated opioid withdrawal; however, there are no established dosing standards within the emergency department (ED).

- **Objectives**: The aim of this review was to determine naloxone dosing practice in the ED and their association with adverse events.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review by searching PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and EBSCO from 2000–2021. Articles containing patient-level data for initial ED dose and patient outcome had data abstracted by two independent reviewers. Patients were divided into subgroups depending on the initial dose of IV naloxone: low dose ([LD], ≤ 0.1 mg), standard dose ([SD], 0.4–2 mg), and high dose ([HD], > 2 mg). Our outcomes were the dose range administered and adverse events per dose. We compared groups using chi-squared difference of proportions or Fisher's exact test.

- **Results**: The review included 13 articles with 209 patients in the results analysis: 111 patients in LD (0.04–0.1 mg), 95 in SD (0.4–2 mg), and 3 in HD (4–12 mg). At least one adverse event was reported in 37 SD patients (38.9%), compared with 14 in LD (12.6%, p < 0.0001) and 2 in HD (100.0%, p = 0.16). At least one additional dose was administered to 53 SD patients (55.8%), compared with 55 in LD (49.5%, p < 0.0001), and 3 in HD (100.0%, p = 0.48).

- **Conclusions**: Lower doses of naloxone in the ED may help reduce related adverse events without increasing the need for additional doses. Future studies should evaluate this further.

### Pharmacokinetics of concentrated naloxone nasal spray for opioid overdose reversal: Phase I healthy volunteer study [^114zsLNp]. Addiction (2018). High credibility.

Take-home naloxone can prevent death from heroin/opioid overdose, but pre-provision is difficult because naloxone is usually given by injection. Non-injectable alternatives, including naloxone nasal sprays, are currently being developed. To be effective, the intranasal (i.n.) spray dose must be adequate but not excessive, and early absorption must be comparable to intramuscular (i.m.) injection. This study reports on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a specially produced concentrated novel nasal spray.

- **Specific aims**: The aims were to (1) estimate PK profiles of i.n. naloxone, (2) compare early systemic exposure of i.n. versus i.m. naloxone, and (3) estimate i.n. bioavailability.

- **Design**: The study was an open-label, randomized, five-way cross-over PK study.

- **Setting**: Conducted at a clinical trials facility in Croydon, UK.

- **Participants**: Thirty-eight healthy volunteers (age 20–54 years; 11 female) participated in the study.

- **Intervention and comparator**: Three doses of i.n. (1 mg/0.1 ml, 2 mg/0.1 ml, 4 mg/0.2 ml) were compared to 0.4 mg i.m. (reference) and 0.4 mg intravenous (i.v.) naloxone.

- **Measurements**: Regular blood samples were taken, with high-frequency sampling during the first 15 minutes to capture early systemic exposure. PK parameters were determined from plasma naloxone concentrations. Exploratory analyses involved simulation of repeat administration.

- **Findings**: Mean peak concentration (C max) values for 1 mg (1.51 ng/ml), 2 mg (2.87 ng/ml), and 4 mg (6.02 ng/ml) i.n. exceeded 0.4 mg i.m. (1.27 ng/ml) naloxone. All three i.n. doses rapidly achieved plasma levels > 50% of peak concentrations (T50%) by 10 minutes.

### Best evidence topic report: Intranasal naloxone in suspected opioid overdose [^1166BFqA]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

A short cut review was carried out to establish whether intranasal naloxone is effective in suspected opiate overdose. Upon screening 596 papers, eight were identified as providing the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, date, country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results, and study weaknesses of these best papers are tabulated. The clinical bottom line is that intranasal naloxone is likely a safe and effective first-line prehospital intervention for reversing the effects of an opioid overdose and reducing the risk of needle stick injury. However, a large, well-conducted trial into its usage is required to confirm this.

### Pharmacokinetics of concentrated naloxone nasal spray for opioid overdose reversal: Phase I healthy volunteer study [^111FVYUK]. Addiction (2018). High credibility.

- **Simulation (2) immediate multiple dose administration of the full dose**: The observed pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles, scaled in dose, were used to explore the pharmacokinetics of possible unintended immediate administration of the full 2 mg intramuscular (i.m.) injection (i.e. all five 0.4 mg doses up to the top of the approved therapeutic dose range) versus two simultaneous 2 mg intranasal (i.n.) doses. The scaled concentration data indicate that the 2 mg i.m. dose would have the fastest speed of uptake. In addition, the scaled 4 mg profile (two 2 mg i.n. doses) was compared with the observed data from the 4 mg i.n. dose (administered as 2 mg per nostril) and lagged only slightly behind the observed 4 mg i.n. profile. However, in terms of dose‐adjusted area under the curve (AUC), the three administrations (2 mg i.m., 2 × 2 mg i.n., 4 mg i.n.) were roughly equivalent.

- **Scaled mean plasma naloxone concentrations**: The data present scaled mean plasma naloxone concentrations after immediate administration of multiple doses at 0 minutes versus the mean observed profile of a 4 mg intranasal (i.n.) dose.

### Subsys [^114ccPSM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Patient access to naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose**: Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver, assessing the potential need for access to naloxone both when initiating and renewing treatment with Subsys [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g. by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program). Consider prescribing naloxone based on the patient's risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.4, 5.6)]. Consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose.

- **Initial dosage**: Initiate treatment with Subsys for all patients (including those switching from another fentanyl product) using one 100 mcg spray sublingually. Prescribe an initial titration supply of 100 mcg Subsys units, which limits the number of units in the home during titration. Avoid prescribing a higher dose until patients have used up all units to prevent confusion and possible overdose.

### Characteristics of patients with opioid use disorder associated with performing overdose reversals in the community: An opioid treatment program analysis [^1173wZex]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Logistic regression analyses identified education as a potential confounder but found no potential effect modifiers. Analyses of the 16 explanatory variables showed that six were significantly (P < 0.050) associated with the use of take-home naloxone.

Final multivariate model selection resulted in a model with five significant explanatory variables. These were: being 29 years of age or younger, being Hispanic/White, reporting previous emergency room care for overdose, previously witnessing someone overdose, and testing positive for two or more substances in their 6-month urine toxicology screens. These associations had odds ratio point estimates ranging from 2.80 to 5.67, indicating increased odds of using naloxone compared to the reference categories.

Study participants in the final selected model included 247 of the 251 participants in the 6-month follow-up, who had complete records for all 16 explanatory variables in the initial full model. Four study participants were excluded from the final model due to very low numbers in the race/ethnicity categories. Odds ratios in the final selected multivariate logistic regression model are listed in Table 3.

### The evolution of recommended naloxone dosing for opioid overdose by medical specialty [^112Q4Mha]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2016). Low credibility.

Opioid abuse and opioid overdose deaths have increased significantly over the past decade. Naloxone is a potentially life-saving medication that can reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression, though precipitated opioid withdrawal can pose acute risks to the patient and medical personnel. The optimal naloxone dose is unclear and few studies address this question.

- **Methods**: A convenience sample of commonly available references were queried for the recommended IV naloxone dose. When dosing recommendations were different for opioid-tolerant patients, these were also recorded.

- **Results**: Twenty-five references were located. Forty-eight percent recommended a starting dose of ≤ 0.05 mg, while 36% recommend a dose ten-fold higher. More than half of medical toxicology and general medical sources recommended a low-dose strategy with a starting dose lower than 0.05 mg IV.

- **Conclusion**: There are variations in the recommended doses for naloxone, with ranges spanning an order of magnitude. Further exploration is needed to determine the dose that balances reversal of respiratory depression with mitigation of withdrawal.

### Vital signs: Pharmacy-based naloxone dispensing - United States, 2012–2018 [^111fPEoC]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). High credibility.

Among the 70,237 drug overdose deaths in the United States in 2017, which is the last year for which complete data are available, a total of 47,600 (67.8%) involved opioids. Millions of Americans are at increased risk for an opioid overdose, including those who use illicit opioids, misuse prescription opioids, or have an opioid use disorder. A particularly at-risk population includes individuals who use illicit drugs like cocaine and methamphetamine that might be mixed with illicit opioids.

The CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain recommends considering prescribing naloxone when factors that increase the risk for overdose are present, such as a history of overdose or substance use disorder, opioid dosages ≥ 50 morphine milligram equivalents (MME) per day [high-dose], and concurrent use of benzodiazepines. Given that approximately two-thirds of overdose deaths involve opioids, with 36% in 2017 being prescription opioids, the distribution of naloxone to reverse an overdose is an important element of the public health response to the opioid overdose epidemic.

For decades, emergency medical service (EMS) providers, first responders, and emergency department clinicians have administered naloxone in cases of suspected drug overdose. Community-based organizations have offered naloxone through education and distribution programs. Recent efforts have focused on expanding naloxone access through clinician prescribing and pharmacy dispensing. All 50 states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws permitting pharmacy-based naloxone dispensing.

### Drug overdose deaths involving stimulants - United States, January 2018-June 2024 [^111xBFaF]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). Low credibility.

Naloxone is a life-saving medication that can reverse an overdose from opioids, including heroin, fentanyl, and prescription opioids. Because SUDORS only includes people who died of a drug overdose, evidence of naloxone administration reflects failed administration (i.e. it did not reverse the overdose). This failure could be because naloxone was not administered soon enough or in sufficient dosages to reverse the overdose, it was not effective (i.e. the overdose did not involve opioids), or its effectiveness was affected by polydrug use.

- **Potential bystander**: A potential bystander is defined as a person aged ≥ 11 years who was physically nearby during or shortly preceding an overdose and potentially had an opportunity to intervene or respond. This includes persons in the same structure (e.g. same room or same building, but different room) as the decedent during that time. This does not include persons in different self-contained parts of buildings (e.g. persons in a different apartment in the same apartment building would not be a potential bystander).

- **Emergency department**: Denotes whether the person was seen in an emergency department for the fatal overdose regardless of whether they were dead or alive on arrival and regardless of whether or not they received treatment.

Among 46 states and DC with sufficient circumstance data, higher percentages of persons who died of overdoses involving stimulants and no opioids had a known history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared with those who died of overdoses co-involving stimulants and opioids (38.7% versus 21.2%) and were seen in the emergency department.
