## Question

When should a compression fracture have kyphoplasty

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when a vertebral compression fracture should have kyphoplasty. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and acuity of the fracture. Then, I should verify the severity of pain and functional impairment. Next, I will review the timing relative to fracture onset and whether a trial of conservative therapy has been attempted. After that, I need to check for contraindications and weigh kyphoplasty against vertebroplasty. Finally, I should consider special scenarios like multilevel disease, deformity, and malignancy, and ensure a plan for osteoporosis treatment and follow-up is in place.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and acuity, because I need to ensure we are dealing with a true osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture and not a mimic or a chronic, healed lesion. Plain radiographs confirm the fracture, but MRI is the modality of choice to distinguish acute from chronic injury via marrow edema or enhancement, and to exclude alternative pain generators or neurologic compromise that would change management [^112uncyA]. Wait, let me verify the timing window I'm using: most interventional guidance considers acute as within about 6 weeks, subacute up to roughly 3–6 months, and chronic beyond that, which aligns with the literature on early intervention benefits [^116gXh1Y] [^116UKRQ3].

> Next, I should review pain and functional severity, because kyphoplasty is generally reserved for clinically significant pain and disability rather than incidental radiographic findings. I need to check for severe pain, commonly operationalized as VAS or NRS greater than about 6/10, and functional impairment such as inability to ambulate, perform ADLs, or prolonged bedrest despite analgesics and bracing, which are typical thresholds used in trials and guidelines [^notfound] [^116gXh1Y]. Hold on, I should verify that the pain correlates anatomically with the imaged fracture level; concordance between focal tenderness and the target vertebra strengthens the indication for augmentation [^112ErA6d].

> I will now examine the timing relative to fracture onset, because early intervention affects both deformity correction and, potentially, pain trajectories. Let me think about the strongest evidence: kyphoplasty within about 6 weeks of symptom onset yields better restoration of vertebral height and kyphotic angle, with diminishing returns after that window, and randomized data for vertebroplasty show clinically meaningful benefits when performed within 6 weeks, supporting a similar early strategy for kyphoplasty in appropriately selected patients [^116uuJAK] [^116UKRQ3]. But wait, what if the patient presents at 8–12 weeks? Some comparative data suggest that early kyphoplasty within 2 months still improves outcomes relative to later treatment, so I should not automatically exclude subacute cases if pain and function remain poor [^116UKRQ3] [^111B2cUv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm whether a reasonable trial of conservative management has been attempted, because many fractures improve with nonsurgical care. A pragmatic approach is about 3–6 weeks of analgesia, activity modification, and bracing, with escalation considered if there is inadequate improvement and the patient remains at risk of immobility or complications, which is consistent with guideline pathways and observational recommendations [^116zQgRL] [^116pcWyz]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought a fixed 6-week trial was mandatory, but some contemporary guidance allows earlier consideration in high-risk patients who are failing medical therapy, so I should individualize this based on frailty, comorbidity, and trajectory [^116zQgRL].

> I need to ensure there are no absolute contraindications or red flags that would shift management away from kyphoplasty. Neurologic deficits, spinal cord compression, or cauda equina syndrome require decompression and stabilization rather than stand-alone augmentation, and posterior wall compromise increases cement leakage risk and may be a relative contraindication depending on expertise and technique [^114Rq4A2] [^113R8i4d]. Let me double-check that the fracture pattern is amenable to balloon reduction; split or burst patterns with extensive cortical disruption carry higher leakage risk and may be less suitable for kyphoplasty, which should temper enthusiasm for augmentation in those morphologies [^113R8i4d].

> Now, I should compare kyphoplasty with vertebroplasty and conservative care to avoid overpromising benefits. Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty provide broadly similar pain relief and functional gains, with kyphoplasty offering better height restoration and less cement leakage at the cost of longer procedure time and higher expense, so the choice can hinge on deformity correction goals, safety profile, and cost considerations [^115wq2YM] [^114g3prK] [^111m7GLY]. I should confirm that randomized data support early benefits: the FREE trial showed faster and larger improvements in quality of life at 1 month with kyphoplasty versus nonsurgical care, with convergence of some outcomes by 12–24 months, which helps set expectations about durability [^11324UsR] [^111eYrLz].

> Let me consider special scenarios that might tilt toward kyphoplasty. Significant vertebral height loss or progressive kyphotic deformity may justify kyphoplasty's height-restoration capability, although I should remember that deformity correction does not consistently correlate with superior pain or disability outcomes, so I must align the intervention with patient goals and baseline function [^115yLg6s] [^1122ZyLa]. For multilevel osteoporotic fractures, simultaneous kyphoplasty can be performed with acceptable safety in experienced hands, but I should verify that each treated level meets the usual clinical criteria and that the patient can tolerate the procedure [^1127y3aX]. In malignancy-related compression fractures, kyphoplasty is reasonable for pain control and function when neurologic structures are not threatened, with cancer-specific RCTs demonstrating improved back-specific function at 1 month compared with nonsurgical care [^114kXePm].

> I should confirm that a plan for osteoporosis evaluation and treatment is in place, because failing to address bone health undermines durability and increases refracture risk. Despite strong recommendations, real-world data show that most patients undergoing kyphoplasty do not receive timely osteoporosis screening or therapy, which is a critical care gap; instituting anti-resorptives or anabolic therapy and optimizing calcium, vitamin D, BMI, and fall risk can reduce subsequent fractures and should be initiated or reinforced peri-procedurally [^114hzqLf] [^112cyVsx]. Hold on, I should verify whether augmentation itself changes adjacent-level fracture risk; network meta-analyses suggest no significant increase in adjacent fractures compared with natural history, so the emphasis on systemic therapy remains justified [^116M9kpP].

> Putting this together, I should state the indication clearly and then sanity-check it against the evidence. Kyphoplasty is appropriate when there is a confirmed acute or subacute osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture with concordant severe pain and functional limitation persisting beyond a short, reasonable trial of conservative therapy, no neurologic compromise or posterior wall instability precluding safe augmentation, and a plan to treat the underlying osteoporosis, with earlier intervention within about 6 weeks favored for better deformity correction and faster symptom relief, recognizing that pain and function benefits are most pronounced in the early postoperative interval and may converge with conservative outcomes over longer follow-up [^116uuJAK] [^116UKRQ3] [^11324UsR] [^116zQgRL]. If these criteria are not met, I should reconsider and either extend conservative management, pursue alternative diagnoses, or choose vertebroplasty based on cost, speed, and deformity goals, always aligning the decision with the patient's priorities and risk profile [^115wq2YM] [^114g3prK].

Kyphoplasty is indicated for **acute or subacute osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures** with **severe pain persisting beyond 4–6 weeks** despite conservative therapy, especially when vertebral height loss exceeds 20% or kyphosis exceeds 20° [^116gXh1Y]. Early intervention (within 2–6 weeks) provides **superior pain relief, faster functional recovery, and better restoration of vertebral height and alignment** compared to delayed treatment or conservative care alone [^116UKRQ3] [^1143tvES] [^11324UsR]. It is also appropriate for pathological fractures from malignancy or multiple myeloma with severe pain and no neurological deficits, and for patients who cannot tolerate prolonged bed rest or opioid therapy [^114kXePm] [^116gXh1Y] [^116pcWyz]. Kyphoplasty is **not recommended for chronic fractures (> 6 months), asymptomatic lesions, or patients with neurological compromise**, infection, or coagulopathy [^113krCwo].

## Clinical indications for kyphoplasty

### Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs)

- **Acute or subacute fractures**: Kyphoplasty is most beneficial for acute (< 6 weeks) or subacute (6 weeks–6 months) fractures with severe pain and functional impairment [^116gXh1Y].

- **Persistent pain despite conservative management**: Patients who continue to experience severe pain (> 6/10 VAS) after 4–6 weeks of conservative therapy (analgesics, bracing, physical therapy) are candidates for kyphoplasty [^116gXh1Y].

- **Significant vertebral height loss or kyphotic deformity**: Vertebral height loss > 20% or kyphotic angle > 20° are indications for kyphoplasty to restore alignment and reduce deformity [^notfound].

- **Early intervention**: Performing kyphoplasty within 2–6 weeks of fracture onset yields superior pain relief, functional outcomes, and vertebral height restoration compared to delayed treatment [^111B2cUv] [^116UKRQ3].

---

### Pathological fractures due to malignancy

In pathological fractures due to malignancy, **multiple myeloma** is a key indication for kyphoplasty to achieve pain relief and vertebral stabilization [^115uHZrz]. Metastatic bone disease with painful vertebral metastases and no neurological deficits is also an appropriate scenario for kyphoplasty [^116gXh1Y].

---

### Traumatic vertebral compression fractures

For traumatic vertebral compression fractures, **low-energy trauma** in osteoporotic patients with significant pain and vertebral collapse may warrant kyphoplasty [^116gXh1Y].

---

## Clinical outcomes and benefits of kyphoplasty

Kyphoplasty provides **rapid and significant pain relief**, with most patients experiencing immediate improvement post-procedure [^111o1S2g]. It also yields faster functional recovery — improving mobility and reducing disability compared with conservative management [^111eYrLz]. Balloon inflation facilitates vertebral height restoration and correction of kyphotic deformity, improving spinal alignment [^112bB7g5]. In selected patients, vertebral augmentation may reduce subsequent vertebral fractures compared with conservative care [^1134GeRo]. Overall, the procedure enhances quality of life by reducing pain, improving function, and enabling faster return to daily activities [^111eYrLz].

---

## Contraindications and limitations

- **Chronic fractures**: Fractures older than 6 months with established healing are not suitable for kyphoplasty [^116gXh1Y].

- **Asymptomatic fractures**: Patients without significant pain or functional impairment do not benefit from kyphoplasty [^113TftcQ].

- **Neurological compromise**: Patients with neurological deficits, spinal cord compression, or cauda equina syndrome require surgical decompression rather than kyphoplasty [^113krCwo].

- **Infection or coagulopathy**: Active infection or bleeding disorders are contraindications to kyphoplasty [^notfound].

## Comparison with conservative management

| **Outcome** | **Kyphoplasty** | **Conservative management** |
|-|-|-|
| Pain relief | Rapid and significant improvement within days [^116TiQnQ] | Gradual improvement over weeks to months |
| Functional recovery | Faster return to daily activities and mobility [^111eYrLz] | Slower recovery, prolonged disability |
| Vertebral height restoration | Significant restoration of vertebral height and correction of kyphosis [^115yLg6s] | Minimal to no height restoration |
| Quality of life | Rapid improvement in quality of life [^111eYrLz] | Gradual improvement over time |
| Complications | Low complication rate, mainly cement leakage [^113ncqMz] | Prolonged immobility, respiratory complications, opioid dependence |

---

## Patient selection criteria

- **Severe pain**: Persistent pain > 6/10 VAS despite conservative therapy [^116gXh1Y].

- **Functional impairment**: Significant disability affecting daily activities and mobility [^116gXh1Y].

- **Vertebral height loss**: > 20% or kyphotic angle > 20° [^notfound].

- **Acute or subacute fracture**: Within 6 months of fracture onset [^116gXh1Y].

- **No neurological deficits**: Patients must be neurologically intact [^113krCwo].

Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures frequently result in significant morbidity and health care resource use. For patients with severe and disabling pain, vertebral augmentation (vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty) is often considered. Although vertebroplasty was introduced > 30 years ago, there are conflicting opinions regarding the role of these procedures in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. This review article updates clinicians on the published prospective randomized controlled data, including the most recent positive trials that followed initial negative trials in 2009. Analysis of multiple national claim datasets has also provided further insight into the utility of these procedures. Finally, we considered the recent recommendations of national organizations and medical societies that advise on the use of vertebral augmentation procedures for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.

### Diagnosis and management of vertebral compression fracture [^112uncyA]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Vertebral compression fractures are the most common complication of osteoporosis, with 700,000 cases reported every year in the United States. Vertebral compression fractures typically present with abrupt-onset low back pain with or without a history of trauma, although more than two-thirds are detected incidentally. Diagnosis is confirmed using plain radiographs, while computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging may be required to evaluate for a malignant cause or if there are neurological deficits on examination. Magnetic resonance imaging is also the modality of choice to determine if the fracture is acute vs chronic in nature. Patients can be managed with a combination of nonsurgical modalities including medications, bracing, and physical therapy, although when indicated, kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty may be considered to provide symptom relief.

### What is the role of vertebral augmentation for osteoporotic fractures? A review of the recent literature [^115A6G8m]. Neuroradiology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Vertebral augmentation procedures such as vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are utilized in the treatment of vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). However, their capacity for providing analgesia, reducing disability, and improving quality of life in patients with osteoporotic VCFs remains a topic of debate. The objective of this narrative review is to summarize the latest evidence for the safety and efficacy of vertebral augmentation for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs).

Methods

A systematic literature search was conducted using the PubMed and Cochrane electronic databases for systematic reviews, review articles, meta-analyses, and randomized clinical trials prior to May 2017. The keywords were "vertebroplasty", "kyphoplasty", and "vertebral augmentation".

Results

Thirty-three papers (7 systematic reviews, 6 cohort studies, 15 randomized clinical trials, and 5 international guidelines) were included in this narrative review.

Conclusion

Vertebral augmentation is a safe procedure, with low rates of serious complications and no increase in subsequent post-treatment fracture risk.

Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty have been used to treat osteoporotic compression fractures for many years. In 2009, two randomized controlled trials demonstrated limited effectiveness of vertebroplasty over sham treatment; thus, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons published evidence-based guidelines recommending "against vertebroplasty for patients who present with an osteoporotic spinal compression fracture". However, several other trials have since been published that contradict these conclusions. A recent meta-analysis cited strong evidence in favor of cement augmentation in the treatment of symptomatic vertebral compression fractures.

### Kyphoplasty for vertebral augmentation in the elderly with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures: scenarios and review of recent studies [^116pcWyz]. Clinical Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Vertebral compression fractures caused by osteoporosis are among the most common fractures in the elderly. The treatment focuses on pain control, maintenance of independence, and management of the osteoporosis. Elderly patients often encounter adverse effects to pain medications, do not tolerate bed rest, and are not ideal candidates for invasive spinal reconstructive surgery. Percutaneous vertebral augmentation (vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty) has become popular as a less-invasive alternative. However, studies have questioned the effectiveness of these procedures.

Methods

The authors conducted a MEDLINE search using relevant search terms including osteoporosis, osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture, elderly, kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty.

Case Summary/Results

Two elderly patients presented with a fracture of their third and first lumbar vertebral body, respectively. One patient progressed well with conservative treatment, whereas the other patient was hospitalized secondary to pain after conservative measures failed to offer improvement. The hospitalized patient subsequently opted for a kyphoplasty and was able to resume his normal daily activities after the procedure.

Conclusions

Selecting patients on an individual case-by-case basis can optimize the effectiveness and outcomes of a vertebral augmentation. This process includes the documentation of an osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture with the aide of imaging studies, including the acuity of the fracture as well as the correlation with the physical examination findings. Patients who are functional and improving under a conservative regimen are not candidates for kyphoplasty. However, if the conservative management is not successful after 4 to 6 weeks and the patient is at risk to become bedridden, an augmentation should be considered. A kyphoplasty procedure may be preferred over vertebroplasty, given the lower risk profile and better outcomes regarding spinal alignment.

### Kyphoplasty [^111tHsBF]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Kyphoplasty is a relatively new procedure that is indicated for the treatment of osteoporotic or pathologic compression fractures of the thoracic and/or lumbar spine. This minimally invasive procedure requires imaging guidance. Kyphoplasty entails the inflation of a balloon tamp, prior to the injection of opacified acrylic bone cement, within the compressed vertebral body in an attempt to restore vertebral body height and reduce the associated kyphotic deformity. Preliminary studies show that kyphoplasty, like vertebroplasty, provides significant pain relief in properly selected patients. Definitive demonstration of height restoration and kyphosis correction are still under investigation.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures [^116UKRQ3]. The Spine Journal (2025). High credibility.

NASS Clinical Guidelines — osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures: In adults with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures, it is suggested that there is optimal timing for treatment with vertebral augmentation and delayed treatment is associated with worse clinical outcomes. Grade of Recommendation: B. Evidence cited includes randomized data from the VAPOUR study indicating clinically significant benefits when vertebroplasty is performed within 6 weeks of fracture, with Level I evidence that early VP done within 6 weeks of fracture onset shows lower NRS pain scores and lower RMDQ at up to 6 months; comparative studies describe kyphoplasty outcomes in acute (< 10 weeks) versus chronic (> 16 weeks) fractures, and timing of BKP where early is ≤ 2 months. This paper provides Level II evidence that patients over 65 years old with OVCF and undergoing BKP within 2 months have significantly lower back pain scores at final follow-up (after 6 months) compared to those after 2 months.

### Treating vertebral compression fractures: establishing the appropriate diagnosis, preoperative considerations, treatment techniques, postoperative follow-up and general guidelines for the treatment of patients with symptomatic vertebral compression fractures [^112ErA6d]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) result from either trauma or a pathologic process that weakens the bone by conditions such as osteoporosis or tumor. The incidence of VCFs has been rising over the last few decades in accordance with the aging population. These fractures can result in severe pain, physical limitation and disability, as well as increased morbidity and mortality. Patients with VCFs are optimally treated by accurate and early diagnosis and treatment. An effective method to treat these fractures is percutaneous vertebral augmentation, which is a set of minimally invasive procedures that stabilizes osseous fractures, provides immediate pain relief, and improves quality of life. Vertebral augmentation procedures include vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty, and vertebral augmentation with implants. Each of these techniques is described in general terms in this article. The ideal candidate for vertebral augmentation is a patient with a symptomatic fracture seen on cross-sectional imaging in which nonsurgical management has failed and has positive signs on physical examination with no absolute contraindication. This procedure should be done with the appropriate equipment and personnel in a facility designed for this purpose. After the procedure, the patient should undergo the appropriate follow-up to ensure optimal recovery. Additionally, it is essential that the patient receives appropriate therapy for the underlying disorder that predisposed them to the vertebral fracture.

Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures — kyphoplasty vs conservative care (Lee et al): Both treatment arms showed successful clinical results at the end of the 1-year follow-up period, with KP showing better outcomes in the first month only; the authors advised against prompt KP when there are no risk factors for failure with conservative treatment and suggested a trial of medical 3-week management; the work group further stated that KP improves pain and functional outcomes for one month with results thereafter comparable with medical management, and that medical management is likely to fail in OVCF patients with severe osteoporosis, older age, obesity, and higher degree of collapse.

Interventional treatment question 5 — kyphoplasty outcomes in osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures: It is suggested that kyphoplasty shows improved height restoration and kyphotic angle, but degree of height restoration and kyphotic angle did not provide further improvement in pain relief or function in adults with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (Grade of Recommendation: B). Comparative evidence indicates that KP with an intravertebral reduction device was associated with better body heights and KA at least for 1 year for OVCF-associated spinal canal encroachment with noninferior clinical outcomes to VP, and Level III evidence shows a significant difference in height restoration and improved kyphotic angle but no difference in pain relief or outcomes.

### Comparison of 5766 vertebral compression fractures treated with or without kyphoplasty [^112sfstN]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The majority of the 700,000 osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) that occur annually in the United States affect women. The total treatment costs exceed $17 billion and approximate the total costs of breast cancer ($13 billion) and heart disease ($19 billion). Balloon-assisted percutaneous vertebral augmentation with bone cement (kyphoplasty) reportedly reduces VCF-related pain and accelerates return of independent functional mobility. Kyphoplasty may decrease overall cost of VCF treatment costs by reducing use of posttreatment medical resources.

Questions/Purposes

We evaluated complications, mortality, posthospital disposition, and treatment costs of kyphoplasty compared with nonoperative treatment using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database.

Methods

We identified 5766 VCFs (71% female) in patients 65 years of age or older with nonneoplastic VCF as the primary diagnosis in nonroutine hospital admissions; 15.3% underwent kyphoplasty. Demographic data, medical comorbidities, and fracture treatment type were recorded. Outcomes, including complications, mortality, posthospital disposition, and treatment costs, were compared for each treatment type.

Results

Women were more likely to be treated with kyphoplasty than were men. Patients undergoing kyphoplasty had comorbidity indices equivalent to those treated nonoperatively. Kyphoplasty was associated with a greater likelihood of routine discharge to home (38.4% versus 21.0% for nonoperative treatment), a lower rate of discharge to skilled nursing (26.1% versus 34.8%) or other facilities (35.7% versus 47.1%), a complication rate equivalent to nonoperative treatment (1.7% versus 1.0%), and a lower rate of in-hospital mortality (0.3% versus 1.6%). Kyphoplasty was associated with higher cost of hospitalization (mean $37,231 versus $20,112).

Conclusions

Kyphoplasty for treatment of VCF in well-selected patients may accelerate the return of independent patient function as indicated by improved measures of hospital discharge. The initially higher cost of treatment may be offset by the reduced use of posthospital medical resources.

### Invasive treatments for low back disorders [^1141YmWP]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for low back pain, more specifically with respect to kyphoplasty, ACOEM 2021 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to recommend for or against kyphoplasty for the treatment of low back or thoracic pain due to vertebral compression fractures.

### A review of vertebroplasty for osteoporotic and malignant vertebral compression fractures [^11765yv3]. Age and Ageing (2012). Low credibility.

Vertebral compression fractures are a common clinical problem and the incidence of them will increase with the ageing population. Traditionally management has been conservative; however, there has been a growing trend towards vertebroplasty as an alternative therapy in patients with persisting severe pain. NICE produced guidance in 2003 recommending the procedure after 4 weeks of conservative management. Recent high-quality studies have been contradictory and there is currently a debate surrounding the role of the procedure with no agreement in the literature. We examine the evidence in both osteoporotic and malignant vertebral compression fractures; we also describe the benefits and side effects, alternative treatment options and the cost of the procedure. Finally, we recommend when vertebroplasty is most appropriately used based on the best available evidence.

### Invasive treatments for low back disorders [^112Jqenc]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Kyphoplasty — Evidence synthesis notes there are three high-quality and 14 moderate-quality studies, but there are no quality studies comparing kyphoplasty with a sham procedure, and two high-quality, sham-controlled trials for vertebroplasty show a lack of benefit. Kyphoplasty has also been found to be associated with subsequent adjacent vertebral compression fractures, and it remains unclear whether highly select patients such as those with three or more simultaneous compression fractures may derive benefit. There is No Recommendation, Low Confidence For or against the use of kyphoplasty for the treatment of low back or thoracic pain due to vertebral compression fractures.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures [^1127y3aX]. The Spine Journal (2025). High credibility.

Kyphoplasty for multilevel osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF) — prospective randomized control trial (Chen et al.): Reported complications included cement extravasation in 6/49 patients (12.2%), cement embolization to pulmonary artery (N = 1/49), and subsequent fractures (N = 3/49), with vertebral height restoration and kyphosis correction that remains stable for at least 2 years after treatment. The guideline text states this provides Level II evidence that multiple OVCF can be treated simultaneously with a low risk of significant adverse events and that there was no significant difference in clinical or radiological effects among multilevel, unilateral or bilateral KP for OVCF.

### Rate of osteoporosis evaluation and treatment following kyphoplasty in patients with vertebral compression fractures: a retrospective study and review of the literature [^114hzqLf]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Lifetime risk of an osteoporotic fracture is 50% for women and 20% for men. Of these fractures, vertebral compression fractures (VCF) are the most common. While surgery plays a crucial role in managing these fractures, preventative measures are also critical when addressing the risk of osteoporotic VCFs. Although many recent guidelines recommend osteoporosis evaluation and treatment for patients with VCFs, the true proportion of patients who undergo an osteoporosis workup following their kyphoplasty procedure is unknown. The aim of this study is to assess the frequency of osteoporosis screening and treatment in patients who undergo a kyphoplasty procedure to correct a vertebral fragility fracture.

Methods

This study utilized the TriNetX Research Network, a database containing de-identified patient information. Using this database, we identified patients from 89 institutions with non-traumatic VCFs and VCFs that resulted from low-energy trauma who subsequently underwent a kyphoplasty procedure. We then analyzed any follow-up osteoporosis treatment or screening they received.

Results

A total of 3371 patients were identified to have undergone kyphoplasty to treat a VCF for the first time. To our knowledge, this is the largest study of its kind to date. Among these patients, 71.3% never had a DEXA scan or prior medical treatment for osteoporosis within 2 years before their kyphoplasty procedure. Additionally, 56.1% of all patients with VCFs treated with kyphoplasty for the first time were never screened or treated for osteoporosis in the two years preceding and 1 year following the procedure.

Conclusion

Our results suggest that only 15.2% of patients with a vertebral fragility fracture secondary to decreased bone density are screened and treated for osteoporosis. Despite existing guidelines recommending osteoporosis evaluation and treatment for patients with VCFs, our findings highlight missed opportunities for intervention. Improving the implementation of existing screening protocols and increasing awareness among healthcare providers could reduce VCF-associated morbidity and mortality.

### Rate of osteoporosis evaluation and treatment following kyphoplasty in patients with vertebral compression fractures: a retrospective study and review of the literature [^111Djo8Y]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Osteoporosis is the most common metabolic bone disease in the US and worldwide, with the prevalence in the United States eclipsing more than 50 million patients. Among Caucasians in the United States over the age of 50, lifetime osteoporotic fracture risk is 50% for women and 20% for men. These fractures are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality and impose a significant economic strain. It is projected that by 2025, healthcare costs associated with these fractures will contribute upwards of $25 billion in healthcare spending with the incidence expected to continually increase thus further contributing to this cost.

Vertebral compression fractures (VCF) are the most common location for osteoporotic fractures. While these fractures have a large overlap with vertebral fragility fractures, which encompasses fractures resulting from osteoporosis as well as other causes of bone fragility, VCFs are specifically the result of osteoporosis-related weakening of the trabecular bone. While most of these fractures are subclinical, they can cause considerable pain, disability, and deformity impairing mobility and limiting independence, thus reducing quality of life and shortening life expectancy. Additionally, VCFs are associated with a 5-fold increase in the risk for developing subsequent vertebral fractures. Patients with severe pain with advanced imaging findings suggestive of a VCF often require surgical vertebral augmentation with vertebroplasty and/or kyphoplasty. While surgical intervention plays a crucial role in treating these fractures, it is equally important to use preventative measures to help reduce the risk of osteoporotic VCFs from developing. The use of osteoporosis medications such as anti-resorptive agents and bone forming agents have specifically helped to address this by reducing the incidence of spine and hip fractures by up to 50% over 3 years. Unfortunately, many patients never receive these medications due to lack of screening for osteoporosis and failure to promptly identify osteoporosis and treat it.

Although several guidelines including those from the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology 2020, The Menopause Society 2021, and The American College of Radiology 2022recommend bone density evaluation, particularly if there is concern for VCF, the true proportion of patients who undergo screening or receive osteoporosis treatment following vertebroplasty and/or kyphoplasty remains unknown. The goal of this study was, therefore, to investigate the true frequency of osteoporosis screening and treatment among patients undergoing kyphoplasty for VCFs. Despite current recommendations and the effectiveness of kyphoplasty in treating severe VCFs, we hypothesized that many patients may not receive the appropriate osteoporosis treatment needed to improve long-term outcomes and reduce the risk of subsequent VCFs.

NASS Clinical Guidelines — osteoporotic fractures, kyphoplasty timing: In female patients with single-level osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF), "KP performed within 2 weeks of fracture onset" provided "better restoration of VBH and improvement in Cobb angle", and "timing of intervention does not seem to impact self-reported back pain at 3-month follow-up"; authors stated that "one might consider performing kyphoplasty soon after fracture occurrence". In elderly OVCF undergoing percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP), Level III evidence indicates that "early KP less than 4 weeks after fracture onset provides better height restoration and lower rate of subsequent fracture compared to PKP after 4 weeks", while "Clinical outcomes in terms of VAS and ODI at follow-up are comparable".

### Current medical, rehabilitation, and surgical management of vertebral compression fractures [^114g6Uqe]. Journal of Women's Health (2003). Low credibility.

Approximately 25% of women over the age of 50 in the United States will suffer one or more vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) related to osteoporosis. VCFs are the most common of all osteoporotic fractures, with an incidence of approximately 700,000 annually. Such a fracture may cause significant pain, disability, and loss of general health and mobility and may lead to a progressive decline in quality of life. This is a review of the clinical literature on VCFs, including patient presentation, methods of diagnosis, and current rehabilitation and medical management. Much of the pain and disability that follow a VCF may be minimized by addressing the psychological impact of such a fracture, using current medications to help limit bone loss and preserve bone mass, adhering to a well-planned rehabilitation program, and consideration of vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty in appropriate patients. A multifaceted approach will help to optimize recovery from a VCF related to osteoporosis.

### Can unilateral kyphoplasty replace bilateral kyphoplasty in treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113YAofJ]. Pain Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Kyphoplasty has been proven to be an efficient method to relieve patient suffering from osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs). Because of its technological superiority, unilateral kyphoplasty consumes less operative time and bone cement than traditional bilateral kyphoplasty. However, there is controversy about which method is most efficient in the treatment of OVCFs. Thus, an overall analysis should be performed to shed light on the facts corroborating both procedures.

Objective

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of unipedicular kyphoplasty versus bipedicular kyphoplasty in treating OVCFs.

Study Design

Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials focusing on comparing unilateral versus bilateral balloon kyphoplasty in treatment of OVCFs. The exclusion criteria contained infection, neoplastic etiology, traumatic fracture, neural compression, neurological deficit, spinal stenosis, previous surgery at the involved vertebral body, long-term use of steroids, and kyphoplasty with other invasive or semi-invasive intervention treatment. Retrospective studies, reviews, technology introductions, and biochemical trials were also excluded.

Settings

The PubMed MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and EMBASE were systematic searched. Only randomized controlled trials published up to June 2015 comparing unilateral kyphoplasty with bilateral kyphoplasty in treatment of OVCFs were identified.

Methods

Two researchers independently screeded the works for inclusion and data extraction. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to assess the methodological quality and evidence synthesis.

Results

Six articles with 563 patients were enrolled in this study. Results showed that the unilateral approach required less surgical time (MD, -23.19; 95% CI, [-27.08, -19.31]; P < 0.00001) and cement consumption (MD, -2.07; 95% CI, [-2.23, -1.91]; P < 0.00001), as well as a reduced cement leakage ratio (RR, 0.59; 95% CI, [0.35, 0.99]; P < 0.05) and improved short-term general health (MD, 1.48; 95% CI, [0.02, 2.93], P < 0.05). No significant difference was found in the visual analog scale score (short-term and long-term), Oswestry Disability Index score (mid-term and long-term) kyphotic angle reduction, restoration rate of anterior vertebral height, vertebral height loss rate, postoperative adjacent-level fractures, or in other assessments of 36-Item Short Form Health Survey parameters (short-term and long-term).

Limitations

Only 6 studies were included, so that the sample size was still relatively small and publication bias could not be revealed in this study. Observation time of some data was inconsistent. All of these problems could influence the reliability of the results.

Conclusion

Both unilateral kyphoplasty and bilateral kyphoplasty are safe and effective treatments for OVCFs. However, when operative time, cement volume, cement leakage, short-term general health, radiation dose, and hospitalization costs are taken into consideration, unilateral kyphoplasty may be the better choice. Yet, more high-quality RCTs with long-term follow-up are still required to make the final conclusion. Key words: Kyphoplasty, unilateral approach, bilateral approach, osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures, meta-analysis.

Kyphoplasty outcomes relative to preoperative MRI — A preoperative MR-detectable vertebral bone marrow edema predicts a better short-term outcome after kyphoplasty, but is not a prerequisite for long-term pain reduction, and Level III evidence indicates patients with preop vertebral body edema had relatively better pain control in the immediate postop along with greater VH restoration and KA correction compared to those without edema.

Kyphoplasty adjuncts and medical therapy — preventive strategies against new vertebral compression fractures include procedural cement use and osteoporosis management. For kyphoplasty, investigators concluded that "the application of a small amount of PMMA can be considered in order to lower the risk of new fractures in adjacent vertebrae. The postoperative use of anti-osteoporotic medication is recommended for the prevention of new VCFs". Additionally, authors emphasized systemic management: "The most important elements related to reducing NVCF were treating osteoporosis and improving BMD and BMI. More aggressive BMD and BMI correction is more important than the vertebroplasty technique".

### Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty: a comprehensive review [^113TftcQ]. Neurosurgical Focus (2005). Low credibility.

Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are relatively new techniques used to treat painful vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). Vertebroplasty is the injection of bone cement, generally polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), into a vertebral body (VB). Kyphoplasty is the placement of balloons (called "tamps") into the VB, followed by an inflation/deflation sequence to create a cavity prior to the cement injection. These procedures are most often performed in a percutaneous fashion on an outpatient (or short stay) basis. The mechanism of action is unknown, but it is postulated that stabilization of the fracture leads to analgesia. The procedures are indicated for painful VCFs due to osteoporosis or malignancy, and for painful hemangiomas. These procedures may be efficacious in treating painful vertebral metastasis and traumatic VCFs. Much evidence favors the use of these procedures for pain associated with the aforementioned disorders. The risks associated with the procedures are low but serious complications can occur. These risks include spinal cord compression, nerve root compression, venous embolism, and pulmonary embolism including cardiovascular collapse. The risk/benefit ratio appears to be favorable in carefully selected patients. The technical aspects of the procedures are presented in detail along with guidelines for patient selection. A comprehensive review of the evidence for the procedures and the reported complications is presented.

### Management of the elderly with vertebral compression fractures [^113wAWsT]. Neurosurgery (2015). Low credibility.

Vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) are the most common type of fracture secondary to osteoporosis. These fractures are associated with significant rates of morbidity and mortality and annual direct medical expenditures of more than $1 billion in the United States. Although many patients will respond favorably to nonsurgical care of their VCF, contemporary natural history data suggest that more than 40% of patients may fail to achieve significant pain relief within 12 months of symptom onset. As a result, percutaneous vertebral augmentation is often used to hasten symptom resolution and return of function. However, controversy regarding the role of kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty in the treatment of symptomatic VCFs exists. The purposes of this review are (1) to outline the epidemiology of VCFs as well as the physical morbidity and economic impact of these injuries, (2) to familiarize the reader with the best available evidence surrounding the operative and nonoperative treatment of VCFs, and (3) to examine the literature pertaining to the cost-effectiveness of surgical management of VCFs with the overarching goal of helping physicians make informed decisions regarding symptomatic VCF treatment.

### Efficacy and safety of balloon kyphoplasty compared with non-surgical care for vertebral compression fracture (FREE): a randomised controlled trial [^11324UsR]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

Balloon kyphoplasty is a minimally invasive procedure for the treatment of painful vertebral fractures, which is intended to reduce pain and improve quality of life. We assessed the efficacy and safety of the procedure.

Methods

Adults with one to three acute vertebral fractures were eligible for enrolment in this randomised controlled trial at 21 sites in eight countries. We randomly assigned 300 patients by a computer-generated sequence to receive kyphoplasty treatment (n = 149) or non-surgical care (n = 151). The primary outcome was the difference in change from baseline to 1 month in the short-form (SF)-36 physical component summary (PCS) score (scale 0–100) between the kyphoplasty and control groups. Quality of life and other efficacy measurements and safety were assessed up to 12 months. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00211211.

Findings

138 participants in the kyphoplasty group and 128 controls completed follow-up at 1 month. By use of repeated measures mixed effects modelling, all 300 randomised participants were included in the analysis. Mean SF-36 PCS score improved by 7.2 points (95% CI 5.7–8.8), from 26.0 at baseline to 33.4 at 1 month, in the kyphoplasty group, and by 2.0 points (0.4–3.6), from 25.5 to 27.4, in the non-surgical group (difference between groups 5.2 points, 2.9–7.4; p < 0.0001). The frequency of adverse events did not differ between groups. There were two serious adverse events related to kyphoplasty (haematoma and urinary tract infection); other serious adverse events (such as myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism) did not occur perioperatively and were not related to procedure.

Interpretation

Our findings suggest that balloon kyphoplasty is an effective and safe procedure for patients with acute vertebral fractures and will help to inform decisions regarding its use as an early treatment option.

### Comparing pain reduction following kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures [^116TiQnQ]. Pain Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Osteoporosis with subsequent osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures is an increasingly important disease due not only to its significant economic impact but also to the increasing age of our population. Pain reduction and stabilization are of primary importance with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Although many patients heal with conservative treatment consisting of rest or activity modification, analgesics, and bracing, the management of severe pain compels some patients to seek surgical intervention via 2 procedures: vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. Although there is abundant support in the literature for both procedures, there remains debate over which procedure can most successfully reduce patients' perception of pain.

Objective

To determine the amount of pain reduction using the visual analog scale (VAS) with kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.

Design

Meta-analysis

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis of the available literature was performed to quantify the amount of pain reduction using the visual analog scale (VAS) between vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.

Results

Twenty-one studies, 14 vertebroplasty and 7 kyphoplasty, qualified for inclusion representing totals of 1,046 vertebroplasty and 263 kyphoplasty patients treated, respectively. Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty resulted in a more than 5 point drop in the VAS in the immediate postoperative period (p < 0.00001). Between the two, the difference in early pain relief was not significant. At final follow-up, the long-term VAS was improved for both procedures, but the final follow-up VAS for vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty was not significant when compared to the initial postoperative VAS (p = 0.25, p = 0.38, respectively).

Conclusions

The analysis demonstrates that both procedures reduce the amount of pain in the immediate postoperative period by approximately 50%. Both procedures reduce pain in symptomatic osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures that have failed conservative treatment. Randomized controlled trials are needed to provide definitive data on which procedure is the most effective for vertebral compression fractures.

### Balloon kyphoplasty for the treatment of acute vertebral compression fractures: 2-year results from a randomized trial [^111eYrLz]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2011). Low credibility.

Vertebral fractures are often painful and lead to reduced quality of life and disability. We compared the efficacy and safety of balloon kyphoplasty to nonsurgical therapy over 24 months in patients with acute painful fractures. Adults with one to three vertebral fractures were randomized within 3 months from onset of pain to undergo kyphoplasty (n = 149) or nonsurgical therapy (n = 151). Quality of life, function, disability, and pain were assessed over 24 months. Kyphoplasty was associated with greater improvements in Short-Form 36 (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) scores when averaged across the 24-month follow-up period compared with nonsurgical therapy [overall treatment effect 3.24 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.47–5.01, p = .0004]; the treatment difference remained statistically significant at 6 months (3.39 points, 95% CI 1.13–5.64, p = .003) but not at 12 months (1.70 points, 95% CI -0.59 to 3.98, p = .15) or 24 months (1.68 points, 95% CI -0.63 to 3.99, p = .15). Greater improvement in back pain was observed over 24 months for kyphoplasty (overall treatment effect -1.49 points, 95% CI -1.88 to -1.10, p < .0001); the difference between groups remained statistically significant at 24 months (-0.80 points, 95% CI -1.39 to -0.20, p = .009). There were two device-related serious adverse events in the second year that occurred at index vertebrae (a spondylitis and an anterior cement migration). There was no statistically significant difference between groups in the number of patients (47.5% for kyphoplasty, 44.1% for control) with new radiographic vertebral fractures; fewer fractures occurred (~18%) within the second year. Compared with nonsurgical management, kyphoplasty rapidly reduces pain and improves function, disability, and quality of life without increasing the risk of additional vertebral fractures. The differences from nonsurgical management are statistically significant when averaged across 24 months. Most outcomes are not statistically different at 24 months, but the reduction in back pain remains statistically significant at all time points.

### Unilateral versus bilateral balloon kyphoplasty for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures: a systematic review of overlapping meta-analyses [^114mrRB2]. Pain Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

There have been many meta-analyses and systematic reviews that have discussed the differences between unilateral and bilateral balloon kyphoplasty. However, their conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of bilateral balloon kyphoplasty in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) are discordant.

Objective

We attempted to select the best evidence review to determine the differences between unilateral and bilateral balloon kyphoplasty, and we wanted to determine the best treatment approach for OVCFs.

Study Design

A systematic review of overlapping meta-analyses.

Setting

The electronic databases of PubMed, Embase and The Cochrane Library were searched. The search extended through Sept. 30, 2017. Moreover, we manually searched the last 10 years of conference reports and papers from the Peking University Health Science Library and consulted 2 experts in the field for any additional relevant information.

Methods

We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Statement and used "A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews" (AMTASR) and the Oxford Levels of Evidence to assess the methodological quality of the studies. We applied the Jadad decision algorithm to select the best evidence review.

Results

Seven meta-analyses were included in this systematic review. The AMTASR scores of the studies ranged from 4 to 9, with an average of 6. Finally, Sun H et al was shown to represent the best evidence study. Sun H et al proposed that the unilateral kyphoplasty required less surgical time and consumed less cement, reduced cement leakage, and improved short-term general health compared with that of bilateral kyphoplasty.

Limitations

The AMTASR scores indicated that some of the included studies were of low quality. In addition, not all of the studies used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) level. When used, the GRADE level indicated that most of the results consisted of studies of low quality.

Conclusions

Unilateral kyphoplasty reduces the operative time, cement volume, and cement leakage rate compared with bilateral kyphoplasty. Therefore, we conclude that unilateral kyphoplasty is more advantageous, effective and safe, compared to bilateral kyphoplasty for the treatment of OVCFs.

Key Words

Osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture, kyphoplasty, unilateral, bilateral, unipedicular, bipedicular, systematic review.

### Does percutaneous vertebroplasty or balloon kyphoplasty for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures increase the incidence of new vertebral fractures? A meta-analysis [^11614uiC]. Pain Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Because of an aging population, osteoporotic vertebral fractures are becoming more frequent. Conservative therapy was considered the gold standard for treating osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) in the past. Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) or balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) as minimally invasive techniques are new treatments that are widely used for painful OVCFs. However, an increase in new vertebral compression fractures at non-treated levels following augmentation is of concern. There is no convincing evidence that new fractures are inevitable after augmentation compared to after conservative treatment, and it is still unclear whether further fractures are the consequence of augmentation or a result of the natural progression of osteoporosis.

Objective

The objective of this study was to evaluate the new-level fracture risk after PVP or BKP compared with conservative (non-operative) treatment and to determine the dominant risk factor associated with new OVCFs.

Study Design

A meta-analysis of comparative studies was performed to evaluate the incidence of new vertebral fractures between vertebral augmentation, such as vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, and no operation.

Setting

The PubMed, ISI Web of Science, ELSEVIER ScienceDirect, and Cochrane Library databases and abstracts published in annual proceedings were systematically searched. In addition, we also retrieved data from references when titles met our inclusion criteria.

Methods

Detailed searches of a number of online databases comparing operative and non-operative groups were performed. We included randomized controlled trials, clinical controlled trials, and prospective clinical studies to provide available data. All studies were reviewed by two reviewers independently, and all the references that met our inclusion criteria were searched for additional trials, using the guidelines set by the QUOROM (Quality of Reporting of Meta-analysis) statement.

Results

We evaluated 12 studies encompassing 1,328 patients in total, including 768 who underwent operation with polymethylmethacrylateand 560 who received non-operative treatments. For new-level vertebral fractures, our meta-analysis found no significant difference between the 2 methods, including total new fractures (P = 0.55) and adjacent fractures (P = 0.5). For pre-existing vertebral fractures, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups (operative and non-operative groups) (P = 0.24). Additionally, there was no significant difference in bone mineral density, both in the lumbar (P = 0.13) and femoral neck regions (P = 0.37), between the 2 interventions.

Limitation

All studies we screened were published online except for unpublished articles. Moreover, only a few data sources could be extracted from the published studies. There were only 5 randomized clinical trials and 7 prospective studies that met our inclusion criteria.

Conclusion

Vertebral augmentation techniques, such as vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, have been widely used to treat osteoporotic vertebral fractures in order to alleviate back pain and correct the deformity, and it has been frequently reported that many new vertebral fractures occurred after this operation. Our analysis did not reveal evidence of an increased risk of fracture of vertebral bodies, especially those adjacent to the treated vertebrae, following augmentation with either method compared with conservative treatment. Key words: Vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty, new osteoporotic compression vertebral fracture, meta-analysis.

### Minimally invasive treatments of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures [^112kzXwc]. Spine (2003). Low credibility.

Study Design

A literature review of experiences with vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty for treating symptomatic, osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs).

Objectives

To summarize the advantages and disadvantages of kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty.

Summary Of Background Data

Osteoporotic VCFs are a leading cause of disability and morbidity in the elderly. The consequences of osteoporotic VCFs (pain and often progressive vertebral collapse with resultant spinal kyphosis) adversely affect quality of life, physical function, mental health, and survival. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are minimally invasive procedures for treating painful fractures. Vertebroplasty entails the percutaneous injection of bone cement into the fractured vertebra in attempts to stabilize the fracture and reduce pain. Kyphoplasty addresses pain and kyphotic deformity by the percutaneous expansion of an inflatable bone tamp to effect fracture reduction before cement deposition in a fractured vertebra.

Methods

A literature review of surgical techniques, indications, clinical results, and complications for vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty.

Results

Studies of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty have reported excellent pain relief and improved function in most patients with osteoporotic VCFs. Vertebroplasty has the advantage of being relatively quick and inexpensive. Kyphoplasty, while associated with increased cost and surgical time, offers the potential to improve spinal alignment. In addition, by creating an intravertebral cavity, kyphoplasty reduces the risk of extravertebral bone filler extravasation.

Conclusions

Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are currently used to treat osteoporotic VCFs with successful short-term results. Prospective, randomized studies comparing these procedures to one another and comparing their long-term outcomes to conventional medical management are required to define precise roles of these exciting treatments in the spine physician's armamentarium.

### Balloon kyphoplasty in the management of vertebral compression fractures: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^113ncqMz]. European Spine Journal (2007). Low credibility.

This systematic review updates the understanding of the evidence base for balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) in the management of vertebral compression fractures. Detailed searches of a number of electronic databases were performed from March to April 2006. Citation searches of included studies were undertaken and no language restrictions were applied. All controlled and uncontrolled studies were included with the exception of case reports. Prognostic factors responsible for pain relief and cement leakage were examined using meta-regression. Combined with previous evidence, a total of eight comparative studies (three against conventional medical therapy and five against vertebroplasty) and 35 case series were identified. The majority of studies were undertaken in older women with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures with long-term pain that was refractory to medical treatment. In direct comparison to conventional medical management, patients undergoing BKP experienced superior improvements in pain, functionality, vertebral height and kyphotic angle at least up to 3-years postprocedure. Reductions in pain with BKP appeared to be greatest in patients with newer fractures. Uncontrolled studies suggest gains in health-related quality of life at 6 and 12-months following BKP. Although associated with a finite level of cement leakage, serious adverse events appear to be rare. Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures appear to be associated with a higher level of cement leakage following BKP than non-osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. In conclusion, there are now prospective studies of low bias, with follow-up of 12 months or more, which demonstrate balloon kyphoplasty to be more effective than medical management of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures and as least as effective as vertebroplasty. Results from ongoing RCTs will provide further information in the near future.

### A randomized trial of balloon kyphoplasty and nonsurgical management for treating acute vertebral compression fractures: vertebral body kyphosis correction and surgical parameters [^116tCaSM]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical vertebral fractures affect an estimated 1.4 million individuals worldwide every year. Current therapies for vertebral fractures include nonsurgical and surgical treatment. Balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) is a percutaneous surgical option that aims to reduce pain and disability and correct vertebral body deformity using orthopedic balloons. Within the current literature, there are well over 300 unique cohorts of at least 10 patients or more with vertebral compression fracture due to osteoporosis or cancer treated with kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty. Importantly, within the current literature, several studies have demonstrated that kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty provide better clinical outcomes to NSM in randomized controlled studies; however, surgical parameters and radiographical outcomes have either been limited or not collected or reported. We recently reported 1- and 2-year quality of life (QOL) outcomes of the fracture reduction evaluation (FREE) study, a multinational, randomized controlled trial. The primary objective here is to report the surgical aspects and compare the clinical and radiographical outcomes and 30-day safety of kyphoplasty treatment with standard NSM.

### The treatment of symptomatic osteoporotic spinal compression fractures [^114Rq4A2]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2011). Low credibility.

This clinical practice guideline is based on a series of systematic reviews of published studies on the treatment of symptomatic osteoporotic spinal compression fractures. Of 11 recommendations, one is strong; one, moderate; three, weak; and six, inconclusive. The strong recommendation is against the use of vertebroplasty to treat the fractures; the moderate recommendation is for the use of calcitonin for 4 weeks following the onset of fracture. The weak recommendations address the use of ibandronate and strontium ranelate to prevent additional symptomatic fractures, the use of L2 nerve root blocks to treat the pain associated with L3 or L4 fractures, and the use of kyphoplasty to treat symptomatic fractures in patients who are neurologically intact.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures [^117X7jQh]. The Spine Journal (2025). High credibility.

Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF) — across randomized and comparative studies, vertebral augmentation provides immediate symptom benefits versus medical/nonsurgical management but mixed durability. Vertebroplasty provides Level II evidence for immediate but short-term pain relief and improvement in functional outcomes as compared to medical management, and percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) provides Level II evidence of rapid durable and significantly greater improvement in pain and function vs medical management. Kyphoplasty-related fracture risk data indicate that BK carries a low risk of adjacent level fractures, and the guideline states kyphoplasty improves pain and function and may decrease the rate of adjacent OVCF development over general followup treatment. In an RCT of acute/subacute fractures, investigators concluded that while PVP helps some patients, the majority of fractures will heal after 8 to 12 weeks of medical management, and the guideline notes PVP may provide immediate but short-lasting pain relief with mid to long term outcomes similar to conservative care. Two BKP RCTs — Wardlaw et al12 (1-year follow-up) and Van Meirhaeghe et al13 (2-year follow-up) — reported a total of 99% osteoporotic etiology and 1% myeloma, found statistically significant improvement in the EQ-5D and less Rolland – Morris disability at 2 years follow-up, and were downgraded to level II for less than 80% followup; overall, BKP was more effective in terms of pain and function than nonsurgical management. In a retrospective cohort, PVP provides a rapid decrease in pain and an early return to daily life activities but may not enhance the quality of life in patients with acute OVF at 6 months follow up, and Level III evidence indicates vertebral augmentation provides improved pain control and function in the first 3 months with no long-term difference in outcomes at 6 months.

### Rate of osteoporosis evaluation and treatment following kyphoplasty in patients with vertebral compression fractures: a retrospective study and review of the literature [^115qzwBJ]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Osteoporotic fractures are a significant cause of morbidity, mortality, and economic burden. Of these fractures, vertebral compression fractures (VCF) are the most common. Our results indicate a significant gap in osteoporosis care following kyphoplasty procedures in the management of VCFs. This highlights the importance of adjusting treatment algorithms for patients following kyphoplasty procedures to enable greater prevention of future fractures and morbidity. It also sheds light on the necessity of identifying patients at risk for VCFs including the use of third-party resources such as Fracture Liaison Services to help reduce rates of refracture in patients who undergo kyphoplasty.

Balloon kyphoplasty rapidly reduces pain and improves function, disability, and QOL over the course of two years compared with non-surgical management; the reduction in pain, EQ-5D QOL, patient satisfaction, and kyphotic angulation remain statistically significant at all time points. Peri-operative complications may be reduced with more care in patient positioning.

Study Design

Literature review.

Objectives

To describe new treatments for painful osteoporotic compression fractures in light of available scientific literature and clinical experience.

Summary Of Background Data

Painful vertebral osteoporotic compression fractures lead to significant morbidity and mortality. This relates to pulmonary dysfunction, eating disorders (nutritional deficits), pain, loss of independence, and mental status change (related to pain and medications). Medications to treat osteoporosis (primarily antiresorptive) do not effectively treat the pain or the fracture, and require over 1 year to reduce the degree of osteoporosis. Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty are new techniques that help decrease the pain and improve function in fractured vertebrae.

Methods

This is a descriptive review of the background leading to vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, a description of the techniques, a review of the literature, as well as current ongoing studies evaluating kyphoplasty.

Results

Both techniques have had a very high acceptance and use rate. There is 95% improvement in pain and significant improvement in function following treatment by either of these percutaneous techniques. Kyphoplasty improves height of the fractured vertebra, and improves kyphosis by over 50%, if performed within 3 months from the onset of the fracture (onset of pain). There is some height improvement, though not as marked, along with 95% clinical improvement, if the procedure is performed after 3 months. Complications occur with both and relate to cement leakage in both, and cement emboli with vertebroplasty.

Conclusion

Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty are safe and effective, and have a useful role in the treatment of painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures that do not respond to conventional treatments. Kyphoplasty offers the additional advantage of realigning the spinal column and regaining height of the fractured vertebra, which may help decrease the pulmonary, GI, and early morbidity consequences related to these fractures. Both procedures are technically demanding.

Vertebral Augmentation

Vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) may be classified as osteoporotic, pathologic or traumatic. In the United States, there are approximately 1 million osteoporotic VCFs reported per year along with 160,000 neoplastic fractures and 50,000 traumatic fractures. Overall, VCFs occur in 30–50% of individuals over 50 years of age, and may be associated with significant debilitating pain, poor quality of life (QOL), and decreased function and are prone to progression over time leading to worsening pain, compensatory structural changes that may predispose to adjacent fractures, worsening disability and increased morbidity and mortality. Vertebral compression fractures create a heavy financial burden in the healthcare industry with costs well over $1 billion dollars yearly, and treatment optimization is essential to improve patient outcomes and healthcare utilization reduction. Although some VCFs may be managed conservatively, those associated with significant vertebral height loss, kyphotic deformity, debilitating pain-limiting function, progression of vertebral height loss, evolution of symptoms and advanced imaging findings of a VCF may warrant vertebral augmentation.

This section will focus on specific vertebral augmentation methods, such as percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP), percutaneous balloon-kyphoplasty (PBK) and implantable vertebral augmentation devices for the management of symptomatic VCFs when clinically indicated as described below.

The ASPN Back Group opines that vertebral augmentation is indicated when the following criteria are present:
Urgent/emergent/hospitalized: Primary metastatic neoplasia with pathological fractures associated with severe pain (conservative treatment trial not indicated); Non-ambulatory patient secondary to VCF with severe pain preventing ambulation for more than 24–48 hours despite aggressive medical management;
Non-urgent/non-emergent/non-hospitalized in the following situations: Acute (< 6 weeks) painful VCF confirmed by advanced diagnostic imaging within 30 days; Sub-acute (< 6 months) painful VCF confirmed by advanced diagnostic imaging; Presence of debilitating severe pain and functional deficits related to a vertebral fracture; ● Severe pain on a daily basis, defined as > 6/10 on a visual analog scale or numeric pain; ● Significant functional impairment and inability to perform ADLs, such as non-ambulatory or limited ambulation, limited transfers, bathing, self-care, etc.; Lack of satisfactory improvement with at least 4 weeks of NSM as defined above. Absence of alternative causes for pain, such as discitis, disc herniation, spinal cord compression, etc.

### Balloon kyphoplasty vs vertebroplasty: a systematic review of height restoration in osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures [^112bB7g5]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Selection

Only RCTs published in English was included in this systematic review. Exclusion criteria for this study were as follows: systematic reviews, observational studies, case reports, editorials, case series, non-human (animal) studies, cadaver models, non-English language studies, inclusion of patients with vertebral compression fractures other than osteoporosis, and studies of kyphoplasty and/or vertebroplasty that did not look at outcome measures of vertebral height restoration.

We pre-specified eligibility criteria using the population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes (PICO) approach as follows:

Participants: Only trials with participants above the age of 18 years with OVCF as the primary indication for treatment with balloon kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty were included in this systematic review.

Interventions and Comparators: Intervention was defined as balloon kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty. Comparators were any other intervention or surgical technique used for vertebral augmentation.

Outcomes: The primary outcome was height restoration with statistical significance. Secondary outcomes of pain relief, functionality, cement leakage, Cobb's Angle, wedge angle restoration, kyphosis angle restoration, and Gardner's angle.

Six authors (NP, JJ, MT, LN, WD, RA) reviewed all trials for screening selection and extraction. Any discrepancies for qualification for the systematic review between the six reviewers were discussed and resolved together, as well as further discussion and review with the primary investigator, RA if there were any secondary discrepancies. A total of 5966 articles were retrieved from the broad search terms used. Identifying and excluding duplicate records resulted in 4147 articles. Titles and abstracts were then screened, resulting in 3909 articles that were excluded. The full text of 238 articles was then assessed for eligibility, and all studies apart from RCTs for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures without statistical analysis were removed. This resulted in a final number of 33 articles that were included in the study. The PRISMA flow diagram can be reviewed in Figure 1. We confirmed our search strategy by also reviewing all the studies identified by previous systematic reviews with a similar topic to ensure that no article was missed for inclusion.

Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures have previously been treated nonoperatively given the tremendous morbidity associated with open fixation in elderly patients who often have multiple medical comorbidities. With the advent of percutaneous vertebral augmentation techniques, these fractures can now be stabilized using minimally invasive surgical techniques while maintaining a relatively safe risk profile. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty provide immediate pain relief in the great majority of patients who have painful, osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. The balloon used in kyphoplasty may allow for improved height restoration, cavity creation, and decreased cement extravasation rates. The authors discuss the procedural steps, advantages and disadvantages, and results of each technique, recognizing that prospective, randomized controlled studies are necessary to objectively compare the two techniques.

### Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty: reasons for concern? [^115njCdB]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Two different minimally invasive percutaneous vertebral augmentation methods for cement application into the vertebral body for the management of symptomatic compression fractures without neurologic impairment have been developed, namely, vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. In vertebroplasty, polymethylmethacrylate cement is injected percutaneously into a collapsed vertebral body. Kyphoplasty involves placing an inflatable bone tamp percutaneously into a vertebral body. The inflation of the bone tamp with fluid allows restoration of vertebral height and correction of the kyphosis. After deflation, the cavity that has been produced is filled by injection of polymethylmethacrylate. This article provides an overview of the state of the art in vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, discussing the indications, techniques, results, and pitfalls.

TREATMENT OF OSTEOPOROTIC COMPRESSION FRACTURES

Efficacy and Safety of Balloon Kyphoplasty Compared with Non-Surgical Care for Vertebral Compression Fracture (Free): A Randomized Contolled Trial

What was known?.

Spontaneous vertebral fractures can cause significant morbidity and mortality. The use of both vertebroplasty (augmentation of vertebral compression fractures with polymethylmethacrylate (PMAA)) and kyphoplasty (inflating a balloon to restore the vertebral body to its original height while creating a cavity into which PMMA can be injected under low pressure) is increasing despite little evidence to support their use. There have also been reports of procedures being repeated at previously treated levels and the use of prophylactic vertebroplasty at levels deemed to be at high risk for fracture,

What this study adds.

Kyphoplasty was compared to nonsurgical care in 300 participants in 18 countries in participants with acute vertebral fractures of less than 3 months duration. Nonsurgical care included back brace, walking aids, analgesics and physical therapy. At one month follow-up, kyphoplasty recipients had significant improvement in the SF-36 physical component, 5.2 points (95%CI 2.9–7.4) greater than those who received nonsurgical care. At 12 months, there were no differences in outcomes between groups, and subsequent fractures were common in both groups (33% vs 25% control p = NS).

How should I change my practice?.

In patients with acute fractures, kyphoplasty improves pain and function at 1 month, but after 12 months, there was no difference compared with usual care. Kyphoplasty appears to be safe in the short term. Of note, two recent trials showed no benefit of vertebroplasty compared with placebo, although there was a high rate of crossover in the studies; it is possible that the placebo injected into the periosteum may have had some analgesic effect and the participants had fractures that were less acute (< 12 months in duration). For individuals with compression fractures who have failed conservative treatment, kyphoplasty may be an option to improve symptoms at one month. Longer term data on efficacy are needed.

### Balloon kyphoplasty vs vertebroplasty: a systematic review of height restoration in osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures [^1144vFYt]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our findings support the conclusion that balloon kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty are effective treatments for vertebral compression fractures. They may restore some vertebral body height loss and improve kyphosis, Cobb's, and wedge angles. Both treatments show benefits in pain reduction and improve patient-reported functionality when correlated with height restoration; however, many studies that investigated all 3 variables did not report statistically significant results, and further robust studies and data analysis are needed to confirm this finding. As a result, we cannot definitively conclude whether balloon kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty is superior for alleviating pain and restoring functionality, though our review suggests that balloon kyphoplasty may be favored for vertebral height restoration. Nevertheless, both surgical techniques of vertebroplasty and balloon kyphoplasty should be considered for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures.

Vertebral compression fractures in cancer — randomized data for kyphoplasty report changes in back-specific functional status and inform recommendations. The Cancer Patient Fracture Evaluation study was an RCT that enrolled patients who had cancer and one to three painful vertebral compression fractures, with patients (N = 134) randomly assigned to kyphoplasty or nonsurgical management (control group). The primary end point was back-specific functional status measured by the Roland-Morris disability questionnaire (RDQ) score at 1 month. The mean RDQ score in the kyphoplasty group changed from 17.6 at baseline to 9.1 at 1 month (mean change, −8.3 points; 95% CI, −6.4 to −10.2; P < .0001), whereas the control group changed from 18.2 to 18.0 (mean change, 0.1 points; 95% CI, −0.8 to 1.0; p = 0.83). At 1 month, the kyphoplasty treatment effect for RDQ was −8.4 points (95% CI, −7.6 to −9.2; P < .0001). Currently, there is good evidence to recommend kyphoplasty in the management of painful vertebral compression fractures, and the role, and the relationship/timing with palliative radiotherapy, needs to be further investigated.

Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures can be quite challenging to treat, especially since they often occur in older adults and can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The standard treatment for these fractures has been medical management, as many of these patients are not candidates for open surgery. Vertebral augmentation procedures have emerged as another treatment option. Though initially accepted by clinicians, the benefit of these procedures has been questioned by several clinical trials. Safety concerns related to adjacent level fractures and cement extravasation have also been raised. We review these controversies in the context of the current literature.

### Prospective and multicenter evaluation of outcomes for quality of life and activities of daily living for balloon kyphoplasty in the treatment of vertebral compression fractures: the EVOLVE trial [^117TtFdo]. Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, significantly reduced pain and disability, improved function, ambulatory status, self-care abilities, and quality of life following kyphoplasty were observed. Narcotic medications usage was reduced, as were days of bed rest and limited activity. There was statistically significant vertebral deformity correction. Five device-/procedure-related AEs were reported; symptoms of each resolved with appropriate treatment. All cases of cement extravasation were asymptomatic. The rate of new and/or adjacent vertebral fractures after kyphoplasty was relatively high and likely attributed to fracture risk factors such as an older patient population, multiple prevalent VCFs, and less osteoporosis treatment. Improvements in pain, function, and quality of life are prompt and sustained indicating that BKP is rapidly effective and durable up to 1 yr. Statistical significance was attained for all primary endpoints and at all time points. These results support the use of kyphoplasty as a safe and highly effective treatment for painful, acute vertebral body compression fractures in patients commonly referred for treatment with an excellent risk:benefit profile.

### Criteria for the appropriate treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures [^114W2j8z]. Pain Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The heterogeneity of patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCF) necessitates a tailored approach of balancing the benefits and limitations of available treatments. Current guidelines are divergent, sometimes contradictory, and often insufficiently detailed to guide practice decisions.

Objectives

This study aimed at establishing treatment recommendations at the patient-specific level.

Study Design

Using the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method (RAM), the appropriateness of different treatment options for osteoporotic VCFs was assessed.

Setting

The assessment was conducted by a European multidisciplinary panel of 12 experts.

Methods

The appropriateness of non-surgical management (NSM), vertebroplasty (VP), and balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) was determined for 128 hypothetical patient profiles. These were unique combinations of clinical factors considered relevant to treatment choice (time since fracture, MRI findings, impact and evolution of symptoms, spinal deformity, ongoing fracture process, and pulmonary dysfunction). After 2 individual rating rounds and plenary meetings, appropriateness statements (appropriate, inappropriate, and uncertain) were calculated for all clinical scenarios.

Results

Disagreement dropped from 31% in the first round to 7% in the second round. Appropriateness outcomes showed specific patterns for the 3 treatments. For three-quarters of the profiles, only one treatment was considered appropriate: NSM 25%, VP 6%, and BKP 45%. NSM was usually appropriate in patients with a negative MRI or a positive MRI without other unfavorable conditions (poor outcomes for the other variables). VP was usually appropriate in patients with a positive MRI, time since fracture ≥ 6 weeks, and no spinal deformity. BKP was recommended for all patients with an ongoing fracture process, and also in most patients with a positive MRI and ≥ 1 other unfavorable factor.

Limitations

The prevalence of the patient profiles in daily practice is yet unknown.

Conclusion

The panel results may help to support treatment choice in the heterogeneous population of patients with osteoporotic VCF.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures [^1169VuhA]. The Spine Journal (2025). High credibility.

Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures — risk factors for new fractures after vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty are described across retrospective studies as follows: In both sexes, "hand grip strength, older age, and lower BMI associated with higher risk of subsequent VF". Level III evidence indicates "lower BMI and higher number of compression fractures are associated with a high risk of new VCF after vertebroplasty", and that "lower BMI (less than 22kg/m2) and greater kyphosis correction are associated with increased hazards of future new VCF in patients undergoing PV for single-level OVCF". Among women after kyphoplasty, those with new VCFs "have lower BMI and longer duration of symptoms compared to those not incurring new VCFs". After percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP), "two-thirds of these new fractures occur in vertebrae adjacent to those previously treated", and affected patients differed by "BMI (low BMI vs controls), lower BMD and lower serum PTH levels". One study reported different patterns: "The incidence of new symptomatic VCFs after PVP was higher in osteoporotic patients with initial multiple-level fractures", and Level III evidence stated "a higher BMI and increase in number of initial VCFs are associated with increased risk of new VCFs after PVP". The work group summarized that "The majority of the evidence supports this recommendation, but considering that one article6 showed the opposite (higher BMI with increased initial OCVFs), more research is needed".

### Early radiographic and clinical results of balloon kyphoplasty for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures [^115Pi82i]. Spine (2003). Low credibility.

Study Design

A prospective consecutive cohort study of clinical and radiographic outcomes after kyphoplasty for treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.

Objectives

To measure changes in spinal deformity, activity level, and pain after kyphoplasty treatment.

Summary Of Background Data

Pain and kyphosis caused by osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures adversely affect quality of life and survival. Kyphoplasty involves the inflation of a balloon bone tamp, percutaneously placed in a fractured vertebral body, followed by deposition of bone cement into the resulting cavity. Previous reports indicate that kyphoplasty improves patient function and restores height of collapsed vertebral bodies, but limited data about the effects of kyphoplasty on spinal sagittal alignment are available.

Methods

Twenty-nine patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures who did not respond to medical therapy were treated by kyphoplasty. These patients underwent 37 operations to treat 61 vertebral compression fractures between T6 and L5. Sagittal alignment was analyzed from standing radiographs (pre- and postkyphoplasty). Patient surveys were used to assess pain relief, improvement in activity, and satisfaction with the surgical procedure.

Results

In this cohort, a mean of 8.8 degrees (range 0–29 degrees) of correction of local spinal kyphosis was achieved with kyphoplasty. Thirty of 52 fractures (17 patients) were considered reducible and had > 5 degrees of correction, with a mean improvement in sagittal alignment of this population of 14.2 degrees. Patient surveys revealed significant pain reduction within the first week after surgery and improved activity levels for a majority of patients.

Conclusions

Kyphoplasty improves physical function, reduces pain, and may correct kyphotic deformity associated with vertebral compression fractures.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures [^1161AQNQ]. The Spine Journal (2025). High credibility.

Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures — kyphoplasty (KP) versus vertebroplasty (VP) comparative studies indicate that KP has advantages in kyphosis correction, vertebral height restoration, and cement leakage prevention, while pain improvement and quality of life (QOL) are similar between procedures. A prospective comparison reported no differences in QOL or pain but higher serious complications after vertebroplasty, and that mean vertebral body height restoration at 1 year follow-up was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the kyphoplasty group. In a study using an intravertebral reduction device (IRD) with KP, height restoration and kyphosis correction were significantly more efficient with fewer refractures and IRD may not increase the risk of adjacent or nonadjacent fractures, with pain improvement similar in KP and VP. Additional reports note KP advantages particularly for V-shape compression fractures and that balloon kyphoplasty was followed by a lower rate of cement leakage.

### The role of kyphoplasty in the management of osteogenesis imperfecta: risk or benefit? [^112ZsJsE]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Kyphoplasty is a recognized treatment option in the management of symptomatic osteoporotic compression fractures, osteolytic vertebral metastases or haemangioma. To our knowledge, kyphoplasty with polymethylmethacrylate in a patient with type I osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) and a vertebral compression fracture has not been reported so far. We report on a 58-year-old patient with type I OI and a vertebral compression fracture at L2 with undislocated posterior vertebral wall and an additional older L1 fracture. Because of severe back pain resistant to conservative therapy over 5 months the indication for percutaneous kyphoplasty was made. Preoperative adjacent endplates of L2 were nearly parallel. Radiologically a minimal loss of height of the L2 vertebra was seen without adjacent fractures at 9 months follow-up. A slight increase of the preoperative kyphotic angle of overlying vertebrae L1 (8.7 degrees/10.3 degrees) and T12 (10.4 degrees/11.0 degrees) was apparent. The visual analogue scale showed decrease of low back pain from 10 to 2 allowing mobilization with a walking frame. Kyphoplasty constitutes a minimal invasive therapeutic alternative in the treatment of vertebral fractures in type I OI and pain, resistant to conservative treatment. Similar to the results of osteoporotic fractures the immediate reduction of pain and stabilization of the fracture in undislocated fragments can be achieved. No adjacent fractures occurred 9 months postoperatively after kyphoplasty in type I OI. Preoperative parallelism of the endplates seems to protect from adjacent fractures.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures [^111jUpmJ]. The Spine Journal (2025). High credibility.

NASS Clinical Guidelines — osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures: There is conflicting evidence to make a recommendation for or against vertebral augmentation compared to medical treatment regarding new, adjacent-level, or distant fractures (Grade of Recommendation: I). A prospective comparative study concluded that balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) carries a low risk of adjacent level fractures and had a positive effect over conventional treatment on reducing the incidence of adjacent level fracture, with Level II evidence that VA with KP improves pain and function and may decrease adjacent osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture development one year following treatment. Another prospective comparative study concluded that PVP/PKP was not associated with increased risk of recompression in new levels, although recompression in new levels occurred sooner and adjacent-level new vertebral fractures were substantially higher in the PVP/PKP group. A retrospective comparative study found that patients treated with nonoperative medical management had a 2.8 times greater risk for a subsequent vertebral compression fracture than those treated with balloon kyphoplasty and PMMA augmentation, providing Level III evidence that BKP had fewer vertebral compression fractures than medical management.

METHODS

Study Design and Patients

A prospective, phase IV, open-label, multicenter, 12-mo clinical study was conducted; outcomes included activities of daily living, pain, quality of life, and safety parameters in a Medicare-eligible population treated with kyphoplasty for painful acute or subacute VCFs associated with osteoporosis or cancer. The protocol and informed consent were approved by the institutional review board at each study center. All patients provided written informed consent. A total of 354 patients were enrolled at 24 sites between May 2013 and October 2014; last patient, last visit was completed on December 2015. In preparing this manuscript STROBE recommendations were followed.

Medicare-eligible patients with 1 to 3 painful VCFs from T5 to L5 due to osteoporosis or cancer, with clinical findings (pain on palpation or percussion over the fractured vertebral body) correlating with imaging findings, were eligible. Acute or subacute (≤ 4 mo) status of fracture(s) were based on magnetic resonance (MR) or nuclear bone scan or an acute change in VB height or morphology from a previous x-ray, computed tomography, or MR. Pretreatment Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) score ≥ 7 and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score ≥ 30, and mental capacity to comply with protocol requirements for the 12-mo study duration were required. Subjects with vertebral morphology or fracture configuration contraindicating BKP (eg, split fracture, complete burst fracture, pedicle fracture), VCFs due to high-energy trauma, asymptomatic VCFs, VCF accompanied by objective evidence of neurological compromise, spinal cord compression or canal compromise requiring decompression were excluded as were patients with pre-existing conditions or clinical comorbidities contraindicating surgery or precluding long-term follow-up. The trial is registered, and a complete list of inclusion/exclusion criteria is posted on(NCT01871519). Bone mineral density measurements were made by dual axial absorptiometry scanning but were not required, as low-energy VCF supports the diagnosis of osteoporosis.

### Kyphoplasty for treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures: a prospective non-randomized study [^1126ZF4C]. European Spine Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Minimally invasive augmentation techniques of vertebral bodies have been advocated to treat osteoporotic vertebral body compression fractures (VBCFs). Kyphoplasty is designed to address both fracture-related pain as well as kyphotic deformity usually associated with fracture. Previous studies have indicated the potential of this technique for reduction of vertebral body height, but there has been little investigation into whether this has a lasting effect. The current study reports on our experience and the one-year results in 27 kyphoplasty procedures (24 patients) for osteoporotic VBCFs.

Results

All but one patient experienced pain relief following the procedure (on VAS 1–10) — with a lasting effect over the follow-up period in 25 cases. An average vertebral kyphosis reduction of 47.7% was achieved with no loss of reduction after one year. The potential for reduction was statistically related to the pre-operative amount of kyphosis, the level treated, and the age of the fracture, but not to the age of the patient. During follow-up, one fracture adjacent to a treated level was observed. Pain relief was not related to the amount of reduction.

Conclusion

Kyphoplasty is an effective treatment of VBCFs in terms of pain relief and durable reduction of deformity. Whether spinal realignment results in an improved long-term clinical outcome remains to be investigated.

### Balloon kyphoplasty vs vertebroplasty: a systematic review of height restoration in osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures [^112bakm3]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This systematic review comprehensively compared balloon kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty with respect to height restoration and pain relief.

Recent Findings

PRISMA guidelines were utilized to compare balloon kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty, focusing on the primary outcome of height restoration and the secondary outcomes of pain relief and functionality. A total of 33 randomized controlled trials were included; 20 reviewed balloon kyphoplasty, 7 reviewed vertebroplasty, and 6 compared vertebroplasty to balloon kyphoplasty. Both treatments restored some vertebral body height and showed benefits in pain reduction and improved patient-reported functionality.

Summary

Balloon kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty are effective treatments for vertebral compression fractures and this review suggests that balloon kyphoplasty may be favored for vertebral height restoration. Further studies are needed to conclude whether balloon kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty is superior for alleviating pain.

### A randomized trial comparing balloon kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty for vertebral compression fractures due to osteoporosis [^114g3prK]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Several trials have compared vertebral augmentation with nonsurgical treatment for vertebral compression fractures. This trial compares the efficacy and safety of balloon kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty.

Materials and Methods

Patients with osteoporosis with 1–3 acute fractures (T5-L5) were randomized and treated with kyphoplasty (n = 191) or vertebroplasty (n = 190) and were not blinded to the treatment assignment. Twelve- and 24-month subsequent radiographic fracture incidence was the primary end point. Due to low enrollment and early withdrawals, the study was terminated with 404/1234 (32.7%) patients enrolled.

Results

The average age of patients was 75.6 years (77.4% female). Mean procedure duration was longer for kyphoplasty (40.0 versus 31.8 minutes, P < .001). At 12 months, 7.8% fewer patients with kyphoplasty (50/140 versus 57/131) had subsequent radiographic fracture, and there were 8.6% fewer at 24 months (54/110 versus 64/111). The results were not statistically significant (P > .21). When we used time to event for new clinical fractures, kyphoplasty approached statistical significance in longer fracture-free survival (Wilcoxon, P = 0.0596). Similar pain and function improvements were observed. CT demonstrated lower cement extravasation for kyphoplasty (157/214 versus 164/201 levels treated, P = 0.047). For kyphoplasty versus vertebroplasty, common adverse events within 30 postoperative days were procedural pain (12/191, 9/190), back pain (14/191, 28/190), and new vertebral fractures (9/191, 17/190); similar 2-year occurrence of device-related cement embolism (1/191, 1/190), procedural pain (3/191, 3/190), back pain (2/191, 3/190), and new vertebral fracture (2/191, 2/190) was observed.

Conclusions

Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty had similar long-term improvement in pain and disability with similar safety profiles and few device-related complications. Procedure duration was shorter with vertebroplasty. Kyphoplasty had fewer cement leakages and a trend toward longer fracture-free survival.

Methods

This systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Protocols Statement issued in 2015.

Literature Search

An initial literature search was performed on March 25, 2020 within the Henry Ford Health System library system to identify relevant studies in electronic databases, PubMed/MEDLINE (1946 to June 2020), Embase (1974 to June 2020), Web of Science (1954 to March 2020), Cochrane Library (including Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews [1970 to June 2020]), ClinicalTrials.gov (2008 to March 2020), and CINAHL (1937 to June 2020) to retrieve RCTs. This identified 1752 articles with 504 duplicates between the databases, for a total of 1248 articles that were screened. The Mesh strategy that was used can be found in the. An add-on literature search was performed on June 26, 2020, without the term height or height restoration. This resulted in an additional 4214 articles. When duplicates were removed 2899 articles were screened in addition to the 1248 previous articles for a total of 4147 that were screened.

The search was performed by the librarians using medical subject headings (MESH) of kyphoplasty, vertebroplasty, vertebral height restoration, vertebral height restoration, spinal fracture, and vertebral compression fracture. Two independent librarians completed a literature review of articles from 1937 to June 2020, with their results compiled. An example of one search strategy used is the following: ((((((("Kyphoplasty"[Mesh]) OR kyphoplasty)) OR (("Vertebroplasty"[Mesh]) OR vertebroplasty))) AND ((((("vertebral height restoration") OR vertebral-height-restoration) OR vertebral height restoration) OR restoration of vertebral height) OR vertebrae height restor*)) AND (((vertebral compression fracture) OR (("Fractures, Compression"[Mesh]) AND (vertebr* OR spine OR spinal))) OR (("Spinal Fractures"[Mesh]) AND (compress*)))). The full electronic search strings used by the research librarian staff to perform this search are included in. Add-on search included the same search string without height or height restoration, which is also provided in.

### Rate of osteoporosis evaluation and treatment following kyphoplasty in patients with vertebral compression fractures: a retrospective study and review of the literature [^11457A8J]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Vertebral compression fractures, especially those precipitated by osteoporosis, are a widespread issue, particularly within the elderly population. Consequently, our primary objective was to evaluate the prevalence of osteoporosis screening and treatment in patients undergoing a kyphoplasty procedure in the management of their VCF. To our knowledge, this study is the largest to date examining these rates. Our results suggest that only a small proportion of patients with a vertebral compression fracture secondary to decreased bone density are screened and treated for osteoporosis. In fact, among patients never treated or screened for osteoporosis, only 21% received any osteoporosis screening or treatment following their first kyphoplasty procedure.

The inadequacy of follow-up treatment for osteoporosis has been well documented in the setting of VCFs. In a 2021 study, Haffner et al found that in a population of patients with low-energy VCFs, only 11.5% received post-injury DEXA evaluation and only 19.2% received appropriate osteoporosis-targeting pharmacological therapy. Similarly, a study of 156 former military members with VCFs revealed only 38% were treated medically for osteoporosis in the year following their fracture and 39% patients underwent DEXA evaluation. In another large-scale study of 2933 VCF patients performed by Barton et. Al, 98% of patients did not undergo a DEXA scan within the two years before or 1 year following their VCF. Additionally, only 7% were prescribed antiresorptive therapy following their fracture, with 73% of patients never receiving any antiresorptive therapy at all. This study also revealed that 38% of patients went on to develop a second fragility fracture within 2 years. The authors did acknowledge, however, that their figures may be confounded as they did not differentiate between high impact and low impact VCFs in their study population. The profoundly low treatment and screening follow-up rates for VCFs occur despite these fractures being associated with a 5 times greater risk of developing future VCFs and significantly increased mortality rates.

### Rate of osteoporosis evaluation and treatment following kyphoplasty in patients with vertebral compression fractures: a retrospective study and review of the literature [^114kwo6s]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite constituting 31.3% of all patients who underwent kyphoplasty for vertebral compression fractures, males comprised 34.9% of the patients who did not receive any pre- or post-kyphoplasty osteoporosis treatment. In contrast, only 26.8% of patients who received pre-kyphoplasty osteoporosis treatment were males. This discrepancy may partly be attributable to the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) not recommending routine osteoporosis screening for men due to insufficient evidence regarding its benefit in preventing osteoporotic fractures. Osteoporosis is four times more common in women, corresponding to a greater focus on female populations and resulting in a lack of extensive research on male osteoporosis screening. However, it is crucial to recognize that men are also at substantial risk for fragility fractures. In fact, current evidence indicates that men experience more osteoporosis-related complications and exhibit a higher mortality rate following osteoporosis fractures, particularly those of the hip, than women, starting from the time of hospital admission. - This emphasizes the importance of developing targeted screening protocols for men to address this critical gap in osteoporosis management.

Our study also evaluated refracture rates by examining the proportion of patients who underwent additional kyphoplasty procedures or had other, non-vertebral fractures more than 3 months after their initial kyphoplasty. We hypothesized that the refracture rate would be higher in the treatment-naive group compared to the cohort of patients with a history of osteoporosis intervention. Contrary to our expectations, we found that the treatment-naive group had a statistically insignificant (P = 0.125), proportion of patients undergoing a second kyphoplasty, indicating a similar refracture rate to the group that underwent treatment and/or screening for osteoporosis. Furthermore, the data in Table 4 and Figure 4 revealed that patients without follow-up osteoporosis evaluation or treatment had significantly lower rates of femur and humerus fractures compared to those with prior osteoporosis evaluation and/or treatment. While this may be a function of underdiagnosis or misclassification in this group leading to fewer documented fractures, it is also possible that patients who did not receive follow-up osteoporosis treatment after kyphoplasty may represent a healthier subset with lower baseline fracture risk. The unexpected refracture rates may also be related to the small treatment group used in our analysis therefore making the rate of refracture difficult to truly measure. Furthermore, the use of a database with deidentified patient information limited our ability to fully elucidate the cause behind this finding. Existing literature generally indicates that refracture rates are higher in treatment-naive patients, highlighting the need for further research to understand these discrepancies.

### Risk of adjacent level fracture after percutaneous vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty vs natural history for the management of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116M9kpP]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Percutaneous vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are common interventions for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. However, there is concern about an increased risk of adjacent-level fractures after treatment. This study aimed to compare the risk of adjacent-level fractures after vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty with the natural history after osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.

Materials and Methods

A network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to evaluate the risk of adjacent-level fractures after vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty compared to the natural history after osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Frequentist network meta-analysis was conducted using the "netmeta" package, and heterogeneity was assessed using Q statistics. The pooled risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using random effects.

Results

Twenty-three RCTs with a total of 2838 patients were included in the analysis. The network meta-analysis showed comparable risks of adjacent-level fractures between vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty, and natural history after osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures with a mean follow-up of 21.2 (range: 3–49.4 months). The pooled RR for adjacent-level fractures after kyphoplasty compared to natural history was 1.35 (95% CI, 0.78–2.34, p = 0.23) and for vertebroplasty compared to natural history was 1.16 (95% CI, 0.62–2.14) p = 0.51. The risk of bias assessment showed a low to moderate risk of bias among included RCTs.

Conclusion

There was no difference in the risk of adjacent-level fractures after vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty compared to natural history after osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. The inclusion of a large patient number and network meta-analysis of RCTs serve evidence-based clinical practice.

Clinical Relevance Statement

The risk of adjacent-level fracture following percutaneous vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty is similar to that observed in the natural history after osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.

Key Points

RCTs have examined the risk of adjacent-level fracture after intervention for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. There was no difference between vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty patients compared to the natural disease history for adjacent compression fractures. This is strong evidence that interventional treatments for these fractures do not increase the risk of adjacent fractures.

Figure 3.
Percentage of Patients From Each Cohort who Underwent a Second Kyphoplasty More than 3 months after Their Initial Procedure. Intervention was Defined as Either Medical Management or Osteoporosis Screening.

An analysis of non-vertebral fracture rates in the different cohorts following kyphoplasty revealed several trends. Patients with previous osteoporosis evaluation and/or treatment had the highest fracture rates across all sites, with 11.4% experiencing femur fractures, 6.3% experiencing humerus fractures, and 3.4% experiencing distal radius fractures. In comparison, intervention-naïve patients with follow-up osteoporosis evaluation and/or treatment had slightly lower fracture rates, with 9.6% for femur fractures, 4.9% for humerus fractures, and 4.4% for distal radius fractures. Odds ratios were 0.83 (95% CI: 0.65–1.05) for femur, 0.77 (95% CI: 0.58–1.02) for humerus, and 1.29 (95% CI: 0.94–1.77) for distal radius fractures, suggesting lower risks for femur and humerus fractures, but a higher risk for distal radius fractures when compared to the previously treated cohort. The lowest fracture rates were observed in intervention-naïve patients without follow-up osteoporosis evaluation and/or treatment, with 7.7% for femur fractures, 3.5% for humerus fractures, and 2.7% for distal radius fractures. The corresponding odds ratios were 0.66 (95% CI: 0.51–0.85) for femur, 0.55 (95% CI: 0.40–0.76) for humerus, and 0.79 (95% CI: 0.55–1.14) for distal radius fractures, indicating a reduced risk for fractures in the femur and humerus, but no significant change in risk for distal radius fractures when compared to the previously treated cohort. This data can be found in Table 4 and Figure 4.

### Early kyphoplasty in the elderly patient [^114cp66h]. Injury (2024). Medium credibility.

Prevalence of vertebral compression fractures is over 30% in the elderly population. The ideal treatment for these fractures remains a subject of debate. The objective in this study is to compare the clinical outcomes of early kyphoplasty and conservative treatment in vertebral compression fractures.

Materials and Methods

Observational retrospective study of 50 consecutive patients with acute vertebral compression fracture (25 patients treated by kyphoplasty and 25 treated by conservative therapy). Number and location of the fractures, radiographic assessment (Beck Index), symptoms duration, pain intensity (Visual Analog Scale -VAS), patient's functional capacity (Oswestry Disability Index - ODI) and analgesic use and dose were analysed. Both groups were followed for 1 year.

Results

Most of the patients in the sample were women with a mean age of 80,5 years old, both groups being comparable in age and sex (p = 1 and p = 1 respectively). The mean ASA score for kyphoplasty vs conservative was 2.6 vs 2.5 (p 0,54). VAS at initial diagnosis 8,50 vs 8,80 (p 0,405). VAS two months after initiation of the treatment 4,40 vs 2,40 (p 0,028), and VAS at one year follow-up was 1,80 vs 1,30 (p 0,216). ODI mean scores conservative vs kyphoplasty at initial diagnosis were 69,79 vs 74 (p 0,87) and two months later 31,60 vs15,40 (p 0,03). The mean Beck Index at the diagnosis conservative vs kyphoplasty was 59,20% vs 61,50% (p 0,68) and after 1 year 51,80% vs 57,40% (p 0,45). In the kyphoplasty group only 1 patient had to be hospitalised during 24 h. Cement leakage was detected in 2 patients without clinical repercussion. In the conservative group 5 patients had home help during their recovery and 3 went to nursing homes.

Conclusion

Kyphoplasty is a minimally invasive surgical procedure with hardly any complications. It offers a faster and greater pain relief to elderly patients than conservative treatment. Early treatment with kyphoplarty allows patients to walk in a short time (early wandering) after the fracture. This treatment avoids long periods of rest and loss of muscle mass. It is a surgical procedure that should be considered as part of the initial therapeutic choices for osteoporotic vertebral fractures.

### Balloon kyphoplasty vs vertebroplasty: a systematic review of height restoration in osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures [^112eHq4R]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF) are common sequelae of osteoporosis, accounting for 700,000 cases annually in the United States. Of these, about one-third are symptomatic, often presenting as acute or chronic low back pain.

Conservative approaches such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), mild opioids, lumbosacral orthotic compressor belts, physical therapy, bed rest, and tincture of time are commonly used for OVCF management, unless there is neurological compromise or evidence of instability. However, for many patients, conservative management is often insufficient and results in significant morbidity, leading to loss of work hours, decreased functional independence, and chronic pain. Furthermore, insufficient vertebral height can cause sequelae of spinal deformities, reduced pulmonary function, depression, reduced mobility, and poorer quality of life, underscoring the importance of surgical correction.

Balloon kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty have been found to be beneficial for restoration of bone height in chronic back pain refractory to conventional therapies. Tsoumakidou et al published guidelines in 2017 on vertebral augmentation indications. The indications for percutaneous vertebroplasty include painful vertebral compression fractures (either refractory to medical treatment or secondary to benign bone tumors), osteolytic processes, and osteonecrosis. Additional indications include symptomatic vertebra plana, acute stable fractures, chronic fractures with non-union or internal cystic changes, need for vertebral body or pedicle reinforcement prior to surgical stabilization, and traumatic acute vertebral compression fracture with a local kyphotic angle greater than 15 degrees.

The placement of acrylic cement (specifically polymethylmethacrylate [PMMA]) percutaneously for diseases of the spine has been described since the 1980s. Vertebroplasty for osteoporotic compression fractures started developing in the 1990s, with case reports describing marked pain relief after the procedure with minimal complications. Multiple clinical trials have been conducted to determine the outcomes of vertebroplasty. A study published by Farrokhi et al in 2011 determined that vertebroplasty restored vertebral body height and provided significant pain relief compared to conservative management.

### Number needed to treat with vertebral augmentation to save a life [^113cQS2z]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Evidence from randomized controlled trials for the efficacy of vertebral augmentation in vertebral compression fractures has been mixed. However, claims-based analyses from national registries or insurance datasets have demonstrated a significant mortality benefit for patients with vertebral compression fractures who receive vertebral augmentation. The purpose of this study was to calculate the number needed to treat to save 1 life at 1 year and up to 5 years after vertebral augmentation.

Materials and Methods

A 10-year sample of the 100% US Medicare data base was used to identify patients with vertebral compression fractures treated with nonsurgical management, balloon kyphoplasty, and vertebroplasty. The number needed to treat was calculated between augmentation and nonsurgical management groups from years 1–5 following a vertebral compression fracture diagnosis, using survival probabilities for each management approach.

Results

The adjusted number needed to treat to save 1 life for nonsurgical management versus kyphoplasty ranged from 14.8 at year 1 to 11.9 at year 5. The adjusted number needed to treat for nonsurgical management versus vertebroplasty ranged from 22.8 at year 1 to 23.8 at year 5.

Conclusions

Both augmentation modalities conferred a prominent mortality benefit over nonsurgical management in this analysis of the US Medicare registry, with a low number needed to treat. The calculations based on this data base resulted in a low number needed to treat to save 1 life at 1year and at 5years.

### Vertebroplasty: weighing the benefits and the risks… [^114EseJ7]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Vertebral injection treatments of fractured or pathologically weakened bone are an important advancement in the management of painful vertebral compression fractures and vertebral metastases. Vertebroplasty introduces a low viscosity cement under relatively high pressure to fill minor voids and the interstices of the cancellous bone. Kyphoplasty involves the creation of a large cavity within the vertebra using an inflatable bone tamp. The creation of this large defect can reduce kyphotic deformity, restore vertebral body height, and allows for the injection of a higher viscosity cement under lower injection pressure. These two procedures are discussed in the article, "Percutaneous Vertebroplasty: New Treatment for Vertebral Compression Fractures, " 1 in this issue of American Family Physician. The indication for vertebral injection therapy must be more selective than just the diagnosis of fracture, metastasis, or hemangioma.

Complications from these procedures can occur and, occasionally, are fatal. Cement intrusion into the spinal canal may require emergent decompression for removal and protection of the neural elements. Patients with severe pain and functional disability from compression fractures who have failed treatment with bracing and analgesia are certainly candidates for vertebral cement injection. Radiographic scans should show acute or subacute fractures. Healed fractures are unlikely to benefit from injection therapy. Without significant wedging or kyphosis, vertebroplasty is appropriate. With multiple fractures and mild kyphosis or single fractures with significant kyphosis, kyphoplasty may provide better long-term results by restoring vertebral height and correcting deformity. For painful metastatic lesions and impending fracture and pain, cement injection can be helpful in improving function and reducing pain. In these circumstances, vertebroplasty is the procedure of choice.

Involvement of the posterior vertebral body wall is a relative contraindication, and injection therapy in these patients should only be performed by physicians who have a large experience with these procedures. Simple vertebral hemangiomas are common and are usually incidental findings on radiographs in patients with back pain. Aggressive hemangiomas with soft tissue extension or pathologic fractures may well be amenable to vertebral cement injection. A preinjection vertebrogram must be performed to ensure that the cement will not pass directly into the venous system; preinjection vascular embolization may also be useful. Consultation with a subspecialist in spine surgery should be considered before referral for a vertebral cement injection. The decision to be invasive, even minimally invasive, should not be taken lightly.

Certain clinical situations may be more appropriate for vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty, or may occasionally require open spinal surgery for additional posterior vertebral body fracture and collapse with spinal canal compromise. Most clinical situations do not require invasive therapy because most fractures will heal uneventfully and cause little functional loss. Recently, there has been increasing interest in vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty for the management of acute vertebral fractures. However, neither technique has been subjected to controlled trials to demonstrate any benefit over traditional medical management. 2 Long-term studies have not been performed to evaluate possible complications, which could include local acceleration of bone resorption caused by the treatment itself or by foreign-body reaction at the interface of cement and bone, and increased risk of fracture in treated bone or adjacent vertebrae.

### Kyphoplasty in the treatment of osteolytic vertebral compression fractures as a result of multiple myeloma… [^115uHZrz]. ASCO (2002). Low credibility.

Abstract PURPOSE: We prospectively evaluated the safety and efficacy of kyphoplasty in the treatment of osteolytic vertebral compression fractures resulting from multiple myeloma. The principle symptoms in multiple myeloma result from bone destruction, especially the spine. Kyphoplasty is a new technique that involves the introduction of inflatable bone tamps into the vertebral body. The purpose of the IBT is to restore the vertebral body back toward its original height, while creating a cavity that can be filled with highly viscous bone cement. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-five consecutive kyphoplasty procedures were performed in 18 patients with osteolytic vertebral compression fractures resulting from multiple myeloma. Cement leakage and any complications were recorded. Early objective analysis was made by comparing preoperative and latest Short Form 36 Health Survey scores. Height restoration was estimated by measuring vertebral height on lateral radiographs.

RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 63. 5 years, mean duration of symptoms was 11 months, and mean follow-up was
7. 4 months. There were no major complications related directly to use of this technique. On average, 34% of height lost at the time of fracture was restored. Asymptomatic cement leakage occurred at two of 55 levels. Significant improvement in SF36 scores occurred for Bodily Pain, Physical Function, Vitality, and Social Functioning. CONCLUSION: Kyphoplasty was efficacious in the treatment of osteolytic vertebral compression fractures resulting from multiple myeloma. Kyphoplasty is associated with early clinical improvement of pain and function as well as some restoration of vertebral body height.

### Vertebral augmentationen.wikipedia.org › wiki › vertebral_augmentation… [^114g7P4n]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Vertebral augmentation, including vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, refers to similar percutaneous spinal procedures in which bone cement is injected through a small hole in the skin into a fractured vertebra in order to relieve back pain caused by a vertebral compression fracture. After decades of medical research into the efficacy and safety of vertebral augmentation, there is still a lack of consensus regarding certain aspects of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. Procedure Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are the two most common procedures for spinal augmentation. These medical terms are classical compounds of the suffix -plasty meaning "molding or shaping surgically" and the prefixes vertebro- "vertebra" and kypho- "humped; stooping forward".

During the procedure, bone cement is injected with a biopsy needle into the collapsed or fractured vertebra. The needle is placed with fluoroscopic x-ray guidance. The cement, although more modern cements are used as well) quickly hardens and forms a support structure within the vertebra that provide stabilization and strength. The needle makes a small puncture in the patient's skin that is easily covered with a small bandage after the procedure. Kyphoplasty Kyphoplasty is a variation of a vertebroplasty which attempts to restore the height and angle of kyphosis of a fractured vertebra, followed by its stabilization using injected bone cement. The procedure typically includes the use of a small balloon that is inflated in the vertebral body to create a void within the cancellous bone prior to cement delivery.

Once the void is created, the procedure continues in a similar manner as a vertebroplasty, but the bone cement is typically delivered directly into the newly created void. In a 2011 review Medicare contractor NAS determined that there is no difference between vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, stating, "No clear evidence demonstrates that one procedure is different from another in terms of short- or long-term efficacy, complications, mortality or any other parameter useful for differentiating coverage". Effectiveness As of 2019, the effectiveness of vertebroplasty is not supported. A 2018 Cochrane review found no role for vertebroplasty for the treatment of acute or sub-acute osteoporotic vertebral fractures. The subjects in these trials had primarily non-acute fractures and prior to the release of the results they were considered the most ideal people to receive the procedure.

Some have suggested that this procedure only be done in those with fractures less than 8 weeks old; however, analysis of the two blinded trials appear not to support the procedure even in this acute subgroup. Others consider the procedure only appropriate for those with other health problems making rest possibly detrimental, those with metastatic cancer as the cause of the spine fracture, or those who do not improve with conservative management. Evidence does not support a benefit of kyphoplasty over vertebroplasty with respect to pain, but the procedures may differ in restoring lost vertebral height, and in safety issues like cement extravasation. As with vertebroplasty, several unblinded studies have suggested a benefit from balloon kyphoplasty. As of 2012, no blinded studies have been performed, and since the procedure is a derivative of vertebroplasty, the unsuccessful results of these blinded studies have cast doubt upon the benefit of kyphoplasty generally.
