## Question

I frequently should Nystatin be applied for intetrigo

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how often nystatin should be applied for intertrigo. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and whether Candida is likely. Then, I should verify the correct nystatin formulation and labeled dosing. Next, I will align the regimen with guideline-based care for candidal intertrigo. After that, I need to consider duration, adherence, and when to stop. Finally, I should address special scenarios, non-candidal intertrigo, and summarize a practical, safety-conscious plan with monitoring advice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context: intertrigo is inflammation of opposing skin surfaces, often macerated and erythematous, and when Candida is involved, satellite papules or pustules are typical. Diagnosis is usually clinical, but KOH smear can confirm yeast if uncertain, which matters because nystatin only treats Candida, not bacteria or dermatophytes [^39df7510].

> Wait, let me verify the formulation before dosing: nystatin for skin is available as cream, ointment, and powder. The powder is particularly useful for very moist lesions because it reduces maceration and improves adherence, so I should tailor the vehicle to moisture burden and site of involvement [^9ba74a9d] [^d75bed94].

> I will now examine labeled dosing for the cream and ointment: apply liberally to affected areas twice daily until healing is complete. This is the FDA-labeled regimen for cutaneous candidiasis and serves as the foundation for candidal intertrigo therapy [^4cba2b7f] [^7005546c].

> Hold on, I should verify the powder dosing because moisture changes the game: for very moist lesions, the topical powder is applied two or three times daily until healing is complete. This aligns with both labeling and practical dermatology guidance for macerated folds [^9ba74a9d] [^d75bed94].

> Next, I should review guideline concordance: the AAFP recommends topical antifungals for intertrigo with Candida, applied twice daily until the rash resolves, which matches the FDA-labeled BID schedule for nystatin cream/ointment and supports the 2–3 times daily powder approach when moisture is prominent [^d8c7520f] [^39df7510].

> Let me consider duration and adherence carefully: even if symptoms improve in a few days, patients should continue until the rash is fully resolved, typically about 1–2 weeks, and then stop. If there is no improvement in about 2 weeks or if the presentation is atypical, I should double-check the diagnosis with KOH or culture and reassess for non-candidal etiologies or mixed infections [^0f5565f4] [^8ce82675].

> But wait, what if the intertrigo is not candidal or is mixed: nystatin is inactive against dermatophytes and bacteria, so for tinea or bacterial superinfection, imidazole or allylamine antifungals or topical antibiotics are indicated. If inflammation is marked, a short course of a low-potency steroid combined with antifungal can be considered, but I need to ensure we do not mask infection and limit steroid duration in folds [^39df7510] [^a28a2442].

> I should confirm safety and monitoring: nystatin topical therapy has a very low rate of adverse effects, mainly local irritation. If irritation or sensitization occurs, stop therapy and reassess. In immunocompromised patients or those not improving, I need to consider non-Candida pathogens like Mucorales and escalate diagnostics and therapy accordingly [^ffc405fc] [^33c51642].

> Putting this together, my practical recommendation is: for candidal intertrigo, apply nystatin cream or ointment twice daily until the rash resolves, or use nystatin powder two to three times daily if lesions are very moist. Continue for about 1–2 weeks and reassess if not improved, verifying the diagnosis and considering alternative or additional therapy if the course is incomplete or the presentation is atypical [^4cba2b7f] [^9ba74a9d] [^d8c7520f].

---

Apply nystatin **twice daily** to affected intertriginous areas until the rash resolves, typically 7–14 days [^d8c7520f]. For very moist lesions, use nystatin powder **two to three times daily** to reduce maceration and enhance antifungal contact [^9ba74a9d]. Continue treatment for at least 48 hours after symptoms resolve to prevent recurrence, and reassess if there is no improvement in 2 weeks or if irritation occurs [^0f5565f4] [^8ce82675].

---

## Recommended frequency of nystatin application

- **Standard regimen**: Apply nystatin cream or ointment liberally to affected areas twice daily (morning and evening) until healing is complete [^4cba2b7f] [^7005546c].

- **Moist lesions**: For very moist or macerated areas, nystatin powder is preferred and should be applied two to three times daily until healing is complete [^9ba74a9d] [^d75bed94].

- **Duration**: Continue treatment for at least 48 hours after clinical resolution of symptoms to prevent recurrence [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting recommended frequency

The twice-daily regimen is supported by **FDA labeling** for nystatin cream and ointment, which instructs application until healing is complete [^4cba2b7f] [^7005546c]. The **AAFP guideline** likewise recommends topical antifungals, including nystatin, be applied twice daily for candidal intertrigo until the rash resolves [^d8c7520f]. For very moist lesions, the powder formulation is recommended to be applied two to three times daily to reduce maceration and improve antifungal contact [^9ba74a9d] [^d75bed94].

---

## Factors influencing frequency of application

Several factors may influence the **frequency of nystatin application**:

| **Factor** | **Impact on frequency** |
|-|-|
| Severity of infection | More severe infections may require more frequent application (up to three times daily) [^9ba74a9d] |
| Moisture level | Very moist lesions benefit from powder formulations applied two to three times daily [^9ba74a9d] [^d75bed94] |
| Patient adherence | Twice-daily regimens are generally more practical and improve adherence [^notfound] |
| Clinical response | Lack of improvement may necessitate reassessment of diagnosis or treatment plan [^8ce82675] |

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with different frequencies

Clinical outcomes generally improve with **consistent twice-daily application**, with most cases resolving within 7–14 days [^d8c7520f]. More frequent application (three times daily) may be beneficial for severe or highly moist lesions, but evidence is limited and largely anecdotal [^9ba74a9d]. Inadequate frequency or premature discontinuation increases the risk of recurrence or persistent infection [^0f5565f4].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

- **Immunocompromised patients**: May require longer treatment duration and closer monitoring due to higher recurrence risk [^notfound].

- **Pediatric patients**: Safe and effective use has been established, with similar application frequencies as adults [^9c3a9a03].

- **Pregnant patients**: Topical nystatin is considered safe, but caution is advised and benefits should outweigh risks [^0862a87e].

---

## Potential side effects and adherence issues

Topical nystatin is generally well tolerated; common adverse effects include mild irritation, burning, or rash (< 0.1%) [^ffc405fc]. Adherence is typically better with twice-daily regimens, and patients should be counseled to continue treatment for at least 48 hours after symptom resolution to prevent recurrence [^0f5565f4].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Standard regimen**: Apply nystatin cream or ointment twice daily until healing is complete [^4cba2b7f].

- **Moist lesions**: Use nystatin powder two to three times daily [^9ba74a9d].

- **Duration**: Continue for at least 48 hours after symptom resolution [^notfound].

- **Reassessment**: If no improvement in 2 weeks, reassess diagnosis or treatment plan [^notfound].

---

Nystatin should be applied **twice daily** for intertrigo, with powder formulations used two to three times daily for very moist lesions. This regimen is supported by FDA labeling and clinical guidelines, with treatment continued until at least 48 hours after symptom resolution.

### Intertrigo and secondary skin infections [^39df7510]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Intertrigo is a superficial inflammatory dermatitis occurring on two closely opposed skin surfaces as a result of moisture, friction, and lack of ventilation. Bodily secretions, including perspiration, urine, and feces, often exacerbate skin inflammation. Physical examination of skin folds reveals regions of erythema with peripheral scaling. Excessive friction and inflammation can cause skin breakdown and create an entry point for secondary fungal and bacterial infections, such as Candida, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and Corynebacterium minutissimum. Candidal intertrigo is commonly diagnosed clinically, based on the characteristic appearance of satellite lesions. Diagnosis may be confirmed using a potassium hydroxide preparation. Resistant cases require oral fluconazole therapy. Bacterial superinfections may be identified with bacterial culture or Wood lamp examination. Fungal lesions are treated with topical nystatin, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, oxiconazole, or econazole. Secondary streptococcal infections are treated with topical mupirocin or oral penicillin. Corynebacterium infections are treated with oral erythromycin.

General:

Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestations of Cushing’s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients. Conditions that augment systemic absorption include application of the more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Therefore, patients receiving a large dose of any potent topical steroid applied to a large surface area should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression by using the urinary free cortisol and ACTH stimulation tests, and for impairment of internal homeostasis. If HPA axis suppression or elevation of the body temperature occurs, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or substitute a less potent steroid.

Recovery of HPA axis function and thermal homeostasis are generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of the drug. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of steroid withdrawal may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids.

Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts of topical corticosteroids and thus be more susceptible to systemic toxicity (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use).

If irritation or hypersensitivity develops with the combination nystatin and triamcinolone acetonide, treatment should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.

Information for the Patient:

Patients using this medication should receive the following information and instructions:

This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes.
Patients should be advised not to use this medication for any disorder other than for which it was prescribed.
The treated skin area should not be bandaged or otherwise covered or wrapped as to be occluded (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).
Patients should report any signs of local adverse reactions.
When using this medication in the inguinal area, patients should be advised to apply the cream sparingly and to wear loose fitting clothing.
Parents of pediatric patients should be advised not to use tight-fitting diapers or plastic pants on a child being treated in the diaper area, as these garments may constitute occlusive dressings.
Patients should be advised on preventive measures to avoid reinfection.

Laboratory Tests:

If there is a lack of therapeutic response, appropriate microbiological studies (e.g. KOH smears and/or cultures) should be repeated to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other pathogens, before instituting another course of therapy.

A urinary free cortisol test and ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression due to corticosteroids.

### A clinician's guide to the diagnosis and treatment of candidiasis in patients with psoriasis [^fe7b2f18]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Guideline recommendations from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis are summarized in Table 1. Topical therapy (e.g. clotrimazole troches or nystatin suspensions or pastilles) is recommended as first-line treatment for patients with an initial episode of mild disease (strength of recommendation: B). The recommended initial treatment for moderate-to-severe disease is oral fluconazole 100–200 mg (3 mg/kg) once-daily for 7–14 days (strength of recommendation: A). For esophageal candidiasis, systemic antifungal therapy is always required, and oral fluconazole 200–400 mg (3–6 mg/kg) daily for 14–21 days is recommended (strength of recommendation: A).

Cutaneous Candidiasis

Cutaneous candidiasis usually affects intertriginous areas, such as the groin, abdominal skin folds, and inframammary skin, but can also occur in interdigital spaces. Typically, cutaneous candidiasis presents as thin, bright-red plaques that can be erosive, dry, scaly, oozing, or macerated (Fig. 1 b); pustules and collarette scales may also be present. Diagnosis of cutaneous candidiasis is usually based on clinical appearance of the skin, the presence of pseudohyphae in KOH wet mounts, or positive fungal culture of scrapings from affected areas.

IDSA guidelines recommend topical triazoles and polyenes (e.g. clotrimazole, miconazole, and nystatin) for the treatment of cutaneous candidiasis. Affected areas should be kept dry and, if necessary, Burrow’s solution compresses can be used as a drying agent.

### Cutaneous mucormycosis arising in the skin folds of immunocompromised patients: a case series [^33c51642]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This report describes 5 immunocompromised patients with prolonged hospitalization who developed intertriginous cutaneous mucormycosis. All patients in the series were immunocompromised and included 3 patients with hematologic malignancy receiving chemotherapy, 1 solid organ transplant recipient, and 1 patient with a critical autoimmune condition. In addition, a sixth patient with similar clinical presentation who developed mucormycosis in the left axilla during prolonged hospitalization status after heart transplantation has previously been reported from our inpatient service.The patients were susceptible to opportunistic infection from Mucorales fungi, which are commonly encountered in the environment, including on hospital linen. Surgery, catheterization, and adhesive tape are potential forms of iatrogenic skin trauma that can promote inoculation.All patients presented herein lacked documented trauma to their site of intertriginous mucormycosis infection. Intertrigo is common among bedridden patients; friction and moisture can lead to maceration disrupting the epidermal barrier and presumably serve as a portal of entry for Mucorales fungal spores. Common sites of intertrigo include the skin folds of the inguinal, axillary, and inframammary areas,as seen in this cohort. Four patients were thought to have candidal intertrigo before their diagnosis of mucormycosis was made. Clues to cutaneous mucormycosis infection included ulceration, signs of inflammation, and induration.

All but 1 patient expired due to complications of mucormycosis infection. Delaying amphotericin B therapy and surgical intervention significantly increases mucormycosis-associated mortality, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis. Given its low incidence, the initial differential diagnosis for the skin findings did not include mucormycosis for all patients as initial treatments included oral fluconazole and topical nystatin before the correct diagnosis was confirmed via skin biopsy and fungal culture. Mucorales species are commonly resistant to most azoles, allylamines, and echinocandins. Inception or persistence of intertriginous lesions in the setting of typical antifungal prophylaxis agents should raise suspicion for mucormycosis, even without predisposing skin trauma as in this cohort.Interestingly, voriconazole prophylaxis in immunocompromised patients has also been identified as a risk factor for mucormycosis infection.

This series demonstrates that intertriginous skin lesions in immunocompromised patients should prompt concern for cutaneous mucormycosis. Measures to minimize moisture within skin folds such as application of drying powders or cloth can prevent the development of intertrigo. Further research is needed to determine effective strategies for prevention and management of cutaneous mucormycosis given the significant associated morbidity and mortality.

PRECAUTIONS

General

Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced 
reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestations 
of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients. 
Conditions that augment systemic absorption include application of the more 
potent steroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition 
of occlusive dressings (see DOSAGE AND 
ADMINISTRATION).

Therefore, patients receiving a large dose of any potent topical steroid 
applied to a large surface area should be evaluated periodically for evidence of 
HPA axis suppression by using the urinary free cortisol and ACTH stimulation 
tests, and for impairment of internal homeostasis. If HPA axis suppression or 
elevation of the body temperature occurs, an attempt should be made to withdraw 
the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or substitute a less potent 
steroid.

Recovery of HPA axis function and thermal homeostasis are generally prompt 
and complete upon discontinuation of the drug. Infrequently, signs and symptoms 
of steroid withdrawal may occur, requiring supplemental systemic 
corticosteroids.

Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts of topical corticosteroids 
and thus be more susceptible to systemic toxicity (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use).

If irritation or hypersensitivity develops with the combination nystatin and 
triamcinolone acetonide, treatment should be discontinued and appropriate 
therapy instituted.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^3b4dd64b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

IDSA 2016 candidiasis guideline—oropharyngeal candidiasis treatment outlines first-line therapy for mild and moderate to severe disease and options for fluconazole-refractory cases. For mild disease, clotrimazole troches, 10 mg 5 times daily, or miconazole mucoadhesive buccal 50-mg tablet applied to the mucosal surface over the canine fossa once daily for 7–14 days are recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). Alternatives for mild disease include nystatin suspension (100 000 U/mL) 4–6 mL 4 times daily, or 1–2 nystatin pastilles (200 000 U each) 4 times daily, for 7–14 days (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). For moderate to severe disease, oral fluconazole, 100–200 mg daily, for 7–14 days is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). For fluconazole-refractory disease, itraconazole solution, 200 mg once daily, or posaconazole suspension, 400 mg twice daily for 3 days then 400 mg daily, for up to 28 days are recommended (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Alternatives for fluconazole-refractory disease include voriconazole, 200 mg twice daily, or AmB deoxycholate oral suspension, 100 mg/mL 4 times daily (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Other alternatives for refractory disease include intravenous echinocandin regimens—caspofungin 70-mg loading dose then 50 mg daily, micafungin 100 mg daily, or anidulafungin 200-mg loading dose then 100 mg daily—or intravenous AmB deoxycholate 0.3 mg/kg daily (weak recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).

### An intertrigo-like eruption from pegylated liposomal doxorubicin [^b943850a]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) is a chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of solid tumors. It has a considerably lower risk of cardiotoxicity than its parent compound, doxorubicin. PLD also has a different cutaneous side effect profile than doxorubicin, and its cutaneous toxicity can be dose limiting. We report the case of a 60-year-old woman who developed erythema and erosions in the axilla and groin while on PLD for breast cancer. Nystatin was ineffective. Biopsies revealed an interface dermatitis with epidermal dysmaturation. Bland emollients and reduction in the dose of PLD resulted in resolution of the eruption. An intertriginous eruption with histological features of epidermal dysmaturation and an interface dermatitis has been previously reported in the dermatopathology literature. This eruption appears to be a distinct cutaneous toxicity of PLD.

Characteristics of candidiasis

We documented a mixed picture of skin infections in the CMC cohort under study. Altogether, 50 % (13/26) of patients reported intertrigo, 46 % (12/26) pustules and 44 % (11/25) infections of the scalp; and 50 % (9/18) of affected patients reported chronic skin infections. More chronic than recurrent cases were reported, regarding infections of the scalp (chronic infections: 67 %, 6/9; recurrent infections: 33 %, 3/9). Onychomycosis appeared in 64 % (16/25) and paronychia in 39 % (7/23) of patients. Onychomycosis and paronychia were both chronic in three quarters of cases (76 %, 13/17). Treatment response varied from complete remission (20 %, 3/15) to partial remission (80 %, 12/15), rendering resistance a possible complication in patients with nail candidiasis.

Nine female patients of reproductive age provided information about vulvovaginal candidiasis. In 67 % (6/9) of these female patients Candida infection of the vulva was documented and candidiasis affected both vagina and perineal region in the two-thirds of cases (67 %, 4/6). Complete response after antifungal therapy was likely (80 %, 4/5), but infections of the vulvovaginal area often reoccurred (83 %, 5/6) when antifungal treatment was stopped.

The majority of patients received both topical and systemic antifungal treatment. Oral therapy with fluconazole and other triazoles was often used to provide a long-lasting prophylaxis. Oral preparations of amphotericin B were administered in severe cases. In case of topical treatment, nystatin proved to be a good alternative to triazoles. Duration of topical antifungal treatment ranged from 2 weeks to several months while medical prescription was reported to continue for about 4 weeks per episode in most cases.

Case report

We report the case of a 75-year-old woman who was referred to Dermatology for a full body rash that developed after 3 months of treatment for stage IV lung adenocarcinoma with amivantamab 1400 mg infusions every 3 weeks. Prior to referral, she was prescribed oral fluconazole, topical nystatin, and hydrocortisone cream. At presentation, she had an acneiform eruption of the face, chest, and upper back as well as painful paronychia of the right great toenail. Additionally, there were eroded erythematous papules of her inframammary folds (Fig 1, A), groin, and buttocks. Culture swab of a groin lesion showed Pseudomonas oryzihabitans. Polymerase chain reaction tests for varicella zoster virus and herpes simplex 1 and 2 viruses were negative. Amivantamab treatment was paused due to dAEs, and she was prescribed a 2-week course of doxycycline 100 mg twice daily (for concomitant paronychia and acneiform eruption) and an empiric course of valacyclovir (until polymerase chain reaction results were negative) and instructed to perform dilute vinegar soaks of the affected intertriginous areas. After 2 weeks, skin examination showed dramatic improvement.

### Oral nystatin prophylaxis in surgical / trauma ICU patients: a randomised clinical trial [^0f3dd6c2]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

In the present study, almost 70% of included patients were colonised at admission. This was a surprising finding. While neurosurgical and abdominal surgery patients have several comorbidities and risk factors (that is, long hospital stay, central venous catheter, parenteral nutrition, antibiotic therapy) that may predispose to subsequent Candida colonisation, this is usually not true for trauma patients. When we analysed the subgroup of trauma patients, however, we noted that almost 50% of them were colonised at admission to the ICU - suggesting that, in many cases, fungal colonisation can be community acquired and not only hospital related. Further trials are needed, in our opinion, to investigate this hypothesis.

Candida colonisation is very common among ICU patients, reaching 60% in non-neutropenic critically ill patients, and is a well-known risk factor for invasive candidiasis since changes in the ecology of the endogenous flora may promote Candida species overgrowth on mucosal and skin surfaces and translocation across the gut barrier, mostly when its integrity is lost. Candida colonisation can be statistically associated with a higher frequency of clinical manifestation or even higher mortality. Based on the previous consideration, we suggest the use of nystatin for fungal pre-emptive therapy in high-risk colonised patients on admission to the ICU as a rationale choice, since it could be effectively used in almost all ICU patients with CCI > 0.4 without increased risk of adverse events. Calculating the CCI, however, is time consuming and resource consuming and is not always feasible. When the CCI is not known we favour nystatin use in those patients expected to require a long ICU stay. Only under these conditions will the risk-benefit and cost-benefit ratios for prophylaxis reflect an advantage for the patient.

Question 1: What is the diagnosis? 
A. Mycosis fungoides
B. Inverse psoriasis
C. Dermatophytosis
D. Erythrasma
E. Candidiasis

Answers: 
A. Mycosis fungoides – Incorrect. Mycosis fungoides classically appears as patches. It takes years to develop and most cases occur in whites (70%; Hispanics, 9%).
B. Inverse psoriasis – Incorrect. Inverse psoriasis presents with erythematous, shiny, moist plaques in intertriginous areas but with no scale.
C. Dermatophytosis – Incorrect. Dermatophytosis often occurs with onychomycosis; lack of response to antifungals makes this diagnosis less likely.
D. Erythrasma – Correct. Erythrasma presents with erythematous to tan, asymptomatic or pruritic scaly plaques in intertriginous areas and is caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum.Risk factors include obesity, poor hygiene, warm climate, and diabetes mellitus.
E. Candidiasis – Incorrect. Candidiasis has satellite papules and would have improved with antifungals.

PRECAUTIONS

General

Nystatin Ointment should not be used for the treatment of systemic, oral, intravaginal or ophthalmic infections.

If irritation or sensitization develops, treatment should be discontinued and appropriate measures taken as indicated. It is recommended that KOH smears, cultures, or other diagnostic methods be used to confirm the diagnosis of cutaneous or mucocutaneous candidiasis and to rule out infection caused by other pathogens.

INFORMATION FOR THE PATIENT

Patients using these medications should receive the following information and instructions:

The patient should be instructed to use these medications as directed (including the replacement of missed doses). These medications are not for any disorder other than that for which they are prescribed.
Even if symptomatic relief occurs within the first few days of treatment, the patient should be advised not to interrupt or discontinue therapy until the prescribed course of treatment is completed.
If symptoms of irritation develop, the patient should be advised to notify the physician promptly.

Laboratory Tests

If there is a lack of therapeutic response, KOH smears, cultures, or other diagnostic methods should be repeated.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

No long-term animal studies have been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of nystatin. No studies have been performed to determine the mutagenicity of nystatin or its effects on male or female fertility.

Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects

Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with any nystatin topical preparation. It also is not known whether these preparations can cause fetal harm when used by a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. Nystatin topical preparations should be prescribed for a pregnant woman only if the potential benefit to the mother outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.

Nursing Mothers

It is not known whether nystatin is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when nystatin is prescribed for a nursing woman.

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness have been established in the pediatric population from birth to 16 years.

Discussion

The main finding of the present study is that systematic nystatin prophylaxis significantly reduces the development of Candida species colonisation and that it significantly reduces the CCI after 6 days of treatment in patients already colonised at ICU admission.

Invasive candidiasis infections are associated with an increased morbidity and mortality in ICU patients (30 to 40%), depending on the severity of underlying disease, the Candida species involved, and the timing and choice of antifungal treatment. Early and adequate antifungal treatment is well known to be independently associated with a reduction of hospital mortality. This is the reason why early antifungal treatments, such as prophylaxis, pre-emptive, or empiric therapies, have progressively emerged; however, most of these strategies lack an evidence base that would establish them as the standard of care. Several studies evaluated the effects of prophylaxis or pre-emptive therapy on fungal infection and mortality, and most of them compared fluconazole with placebo. Some concerns remain about the use of azoles for prophylaxis, including the emergence of resistance among previously susceptible strains (C. albicans) or a shift to less susceptible or resistant non- albicans species (C. glabrata or C. krusei), increased costs, and adverse events. Moreover, because patient populations, dosing regimens, severity of illness, and definitions of infection and other outcome measures varied between trials, conclusions are difficult to extrapolate. Current recommendations limit the use of antifungal prophylaxis to high-risk adult patients admitted to those ICUs that have very high rates of invasive candidiasis, and advocate against the widespread use of an antifungal in all ICU patients.

Background

Despite the limited use of nystatin for tinea infections, physicians may continue to use it.

Methods

We assessed the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey for all to determine the extent of topical nystatin use in tinea infections.

Results

Topical nystatin was used at 4.3% (2.1%, 6.0%) of all tinea infection visits. It was not used at visits with dermatologists and was most common among family medicine physicians (P=.02).

Discussion

Physicians are continuing to use nystatin for the treatment of tinea infections.

Question 2: Which of the following topical therapies is most effective in treating this condition? 
A. Topical antifungal therapy
B. Topical imiquimod
C. Topical steroid therapy
D. Topical antibiotic therapy
E. Topical 5-fluorouracil

Answers: 
A. Topical antifungal therapy – Incorrect. This would be appropriate for the management of tinea cruris or intertrigo. It is important to note that EMPD can mimic fungal or inflammatory conditions, which often results in delays in diagnosis and management.
B. Topical imiquimod – Correct. Topical imiquimod is often used as a first line agent and has been shown to provide a complete response in up to 73% of patients. Its efficacy is due to its ability to stimulate an immune response against tumor cells.
C. Topical steroid therapy – Incorrect. Topical steroid therapy does not have a role in the management of EMPD.
D. Topical antibiotic therapy – Incorrect. Topical antibiotic therapy is not applicable in the management approach for EMPD, as it does not target the underlying malignant pathology.
E. Topical 5-fluorouracil – Incorrect. While it has been shown to be effective in some case series, it is not effective as a monotherapy. Instead, it must be paired with other agents, such as imiquimod or calcipotriene, and is often reserved for refractory cases.

Monitoring and adverse events, including IRIS—topical and azole antifungal safety considerations include that no adverse effects have been reported with oral nystatin for treatment of oral candidiasis, though bitter taste may affect adherence. Azole drugs have relatively low toxicity but inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes (ketoconazole has the strongest inhibitory effect) and can substantially interact with other drugs; the potential for drug interactions, particularly with ARV drugs such as protease inhibitors, should be carefully evaluated before initiation of therapy (strong, low). The most frequent adverse effects of azole drugs are gastrointestinal, including nausea and vomiting.

### Intertrigo and common secondary skin infections [^065c631e]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Intertrigo is inflammation of skinfolds caused by skin-on-skin friction. It is a common skin condition affecting opposing cutaneous or mucocutaneous surfaces. Intertrigo may present as diaper rash in children. The condition appears in natural and obesity-created body folds. The friction in these folds can lead to a variety of complications such as secondary bacterial or fungal infections. The usual approach to managing intertrigo is to minimize moisture and friction with absorptive powders such as cornstarch or with barrier creams. Patients should wear light, nonconstricting, and absorbent clothing and avoid wool and synthetic fibers. Physicians should educate patients about precautions with regard to heat, humidity, and outside activities. Physical exercise usually is desirable, but patients should shower afterward and dry intertriginous areas thoroughly. Wearing open-toed shoes can be beneficial for toe web intertrigo. Secondary bacterial and fungal infections should be treated with antiseptics, antibiotics, or antifungals, depending on the pathogens.

### Severe intertrigo resembling acquired acrodermatitis enteropathica unmasking zinc deficiency in a patient on cabozantinib therapy [^61021851]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 75-year-old man with a history of HCC refractory to tremelimumab/duravalumab, a combinatorial monoclonal antibody therapy, presented to the dermatology clinic with a bilateral, macerated rash on his inguinal creases following 1 month of cabozantinib therapy. His course of cabozantinib was complicated by nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea requiring intravenous fluid resuscitation, as well as ageusia, weakness, and malaise.

One month after starting cabozantinib, the patient’s hands and feet developed a mild rash resembling palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, which was treated with petrolatum ointment. He also presented with a right scrotal rash extending to the inguinal creases, which worsened and spread after a 2-day course of nystatin powder (Fig 1). At his initial dermatology visit, candida intertrigo was suspected and he was treated with a 7-day pulse of oral fluconazole (200 mg daily) and topical miconazole cream. Limited improvement was seen after an additional 2 weeks of miconazole cream usage, and the rash ultimately failed to resolve with multiple residual lesions on the scrotum and gluteal cleft.

Fig 1 
The patient presented with acrodermatitis enteropathica-like rash resembling intertrigo 1 month after starting cabozantinib.

Given the severity and macerated appearance of the rash, zinc deficiency was considered. Upon testing, zinc levels were found to be 46 mcg/dL (normal: 60-106 mcg/dL). After complete cessation of the antifungal regimen due to a lack of resolution, he was subsequently prescribed zinc sulfate tablets, which normalized his zinc level within 3 weeks. Within 2 months of zinc treatment, without any concurrent dermatologic or antifungal intervention, his skin symptoms nearly completely resolved (Fig 2). He regained taste, had improvement in his palmar rash, and experienced less nausea and improved strength, suggesting that zinc deficiency may have been contributing to his other symptoms as well. Unfortunately, due to gastrointestinal bleeding and deep vein thrombosis requiring anticoagulation, cabozantinib was eventually discontinued and he restarted tremelimumab/durvalumab. Zinc treatment was provided throughout, helping to prevent recurrence of the rash and his other symptoms.

### Oral nystatin prophylaxis in surgical / trauma ICU patients: a randomised clinical trial [^8f4aa6a1]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Unfortunately, no definitive conclusion regarding the effect of nystatin prophylaxis on Candida infection can be drawn from our study because none of the included patients, even if heavily colonised, developed the infection. A probable hypothesis to explain this unexpected result is that, in our ICU, a rigid surveillance policy of central venous catheters was undertaken, including strict asepsis during insertion, careful medication, and early removal as soon as possible (median 3 days). This approach, together with a rapid interruption of parenteral nutrition in favour of the enteral route, could justify why no episode of Candida infection was documented during the study period. Moreover, the number of patients with abdominal surgery is low, especially in comparison with neurosurgical patients. This factor could be important because abdominal surgery is a risk factor for invasive candidiasis more than other types of surgery. This trial, finally, was designed to investigate the effect of nystatin prophylaxis on fungal colonisation during the ICU stay and not to detect any reduction in fungal infection, which would have required a larger number of patients.

Other limitations of the present study included the single-centre, open-label design and the small sample size. The inclusion criteria adopted (surgical patients expected to require invasive mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours), however, selected a homogeneous population of ICU patients, treated by the same staff adopting the same protocols to prevent infection - assuring, in our opinion, consistent and reliable results. Larger trials are warranted to elucidate the impact of nystatin prophylaxis on the infection rate and mortality in critically ill patients.

Conclusion

The present trial shows that nystatin pre-emptive therapy in surgical/trauma ICU patients significantly reduces fungal colonisation, even in those colonised at admission. Moreover, when CCI is not calculated, we suggest nystatin use in those patients expected to require a long intensive care stay. This approach could contain antifungal therapy costs. Further clinical data are needed, however, to better identify patients who might warrant antifungal prophylaxis using drugs with low risk of resistant stain emergence, in order to drastically reduce fungal-related morbidity and mortality.

### Nystatin prophylaxis and treatment in severely immunodepressed patients [^46296dc1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Nystatin is sometimes used prophylactically in patients with severe immunodeficiency or in the treatment of fungal infection in such patients, although the effect seems to be equivocal.

Objectives

To study whether nystatin decreases morbidity and mortality when given prophylactically or therapeutically to patients with severe immunodeficiency.

Search Strategy

MEDLINE and The Cochrane Library using a comprehensive search strategy, date of last search November 2001. Contacted industry and scanned reference lists.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing nystatin with placebo, an untreated control group, fluconazole or amphotericin B.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data on mortality, invasive fungal infection and colonisation were extracted by both authors independently. The outcomes were weighted by the inverse variance. A random effects model was used unless p>0.10 for the test of heterogeneity.

Main Results

We included 12 trials (1,464 patients). The drugs were given prophylactically in ten trials and as treatment in two. Seven trials were in acute leukaemia, two in cancer, one in liver transplant patients, one in critically ill surgical and trauma patients, and one in AIDS patients. Nystatin had been compared with placebo in three trials and with fluconazole in nine; the dose varied from 1.5 MIE to 72 MIE daily. The effect of nystatin was similar to that of placebo on fungal colonisation (relative risk 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.65 to 1.13). There was no statistically significant difference between fluconazole and nystatin on mortality (relative risk 0.76, 0.49 to 1.18) whereas fluconazole was more effective in preventing invasive fungal infection (relative risk 0.37, 0.15 to 0.91) and colonisation (relative risk 0.49, 0.34 to 0.70). The results were very similar if the three studies which were not performed in cancer patients were excluded.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Nystatin cannot be recommended for prophylaxis or treatment of Candida infections in immunodepressed patients.

### Oral nystatin prophylaxis in surgical / trauma ICU patients: a randomised clinical trial [^10ae1469]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

In this context, the use of nystatin may present a rationale alternative. Nystatin, like amphotericin B, is a nonabsorbable polyene with a wide antifungal activity, especially against Candida species, including C. glabrata and C. krusei. Although most species of Candida isolated in ICU patients remain susceptible to azoles, indiscriminate use of such drugs may lead to the spread of C. krusei and C. glabrata, intrinsically resistant to and dose-dependently sensitive to azoles, respectively. In contrast, primary resistance to polyenes among Candida species is limited to Candida lusitaniae and to some strains of Candida guillermondii, and resistance seldom develops during treatment. Moreover, no adverse effects of nystatin are reported. Azoles are generally well tolerated, but side effects such as hepatic dysfunction are possible. These risks, even if low, could be more difficult to accept in the setting of prophylaxis in critically ill patients. The third advantage of oral nystatin is its low cost, making this strategy potentially highly cost-effective.

Nonabsorbable polyenes are integrated in most selective decontamination of the digestive tract regimens, and a recent meta-analysis showed that they significantly reduce fungal carriage and overall fungal infections, but without impact on fungemia. This meta-analysis, however, included only two trials testing nystatin prophylaxis. Moreover, the majority of selective decontamination of the digestive tract regimens included either concurrent systemic or topical antibacterial antibiotic prophylaxis in the treatment group, which might increase the risk of fungal infection in that group relative to the placebo group. A recent study investigated the effect of oral nystatin prophylaxis to prevent Candida species colonisation. This trial, however, included both medical and surgical patients and excluded those patients who exhibited baseline Candida species colonisation. Since colonisation can be observed on admission to the ICU in almost 50% of patients, a considerable cohort of ICU population was excluded in this latter study, making these positive results not applicable to all ICU patients.

### Oral nystatin prophylaxis in surgical / trauma ICU patients: a randomised clinical trial [^0eb2e89a]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

The present trial showed that oral nystatin prophylaxis started on the day of admission is significantly effective in reducing heavy fungal colonisation, even in baseline colonised patients. This finding was presumably related to the efficacy of oral nystatin to significantly reduce the proportion of positive gastrointestinal sites (for example, stomach and rectum), as shown in the treatment group. Accordingly, the CCI regularly decreased over time in patients receiving nystatin, whereas it tended to increase in controls. No adverse events developed during the study period, confirming that this polyene is a safe choice in the surgical ICU population. Interestingly, nystatin prophylaxis also reduces colonisation in the urinary tract, which is now advocated as the easier and simpler marker for heavily colonised patients. A possible explanation could be that oral nystatin, by reducing gastrointestinal fungal carriage, can also help to control genital and perineal fungal colonisation, thus lowering the risk of retrograde access to the urinary tract, especially in the presence of indwelling bladder catheters. Moreover, oral nystatin increases costs only by €1.1/patient/day of treatment (data not shown).

### Candidiasis (oropharyngeal) [^d2976977]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Candida is present in the mouths of up to 60% of healthy people, but overt infection is associated with immunosuppression, diabetes, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and corticosteroid use. In most people, untreated candidiasis persists for months or years unless associated risk factors are treated or eliminated. In neonates, spontaneous cure of oropharyngeal candidiasis usually occurs after 3-8 weeks.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent and treat oropharyngeal candidiasis in: adults having treatment causing immunosuppression; infants and children; people with diabetes; people with dentures; and people with HIV infection? Which treatments reduce the risk of acquiring resistance to antifungal drugs? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 46 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antifungals (absorbed or partially absorbed, and topical absorbed/partially absorbed/non-absorbed [e.g. amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, and nystatin]) used for intermittent or continuous prophylaxis or therapy, and denture hygiene.

### Current concepts in systemic and topical therapy for superficial mycoses [^b5798eaa]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

There presently exists a wide selection of choices in the treatment of superficial mycoses. The main categories of broad-spectrum agents are the allylamines and imidazoles, which have been tried and proven over more than 2 decades of usage with good safety. Nystatin and griseofulvin have even longer experience of about 5 decades but have niche usage for yeasts and dermatophytes, respectively. Although no new therapeutic groups have appeared, extensive development of vehicles and delivery systems has enhanced therapeutic results and increased patient compliance.

FIGURE 2 
(A, B) Perialar intertrigo: orange‐red follicular fluorescence under Wood's lamp examination

A microbiological sample had been performed before the enrollment visit in 2 (4.9%) patients and was sterile.

Regarding previous treatments, 23 (53.5%) patients had received at least one treatment for the intertrigo before study inclusion. Topical corticosteroids, antifungals, antibiotics, ivermectin, metronidazole, and tacrolimus had respectively been used in 9 (22%), 8 (19.5%), 5 (12.2%), 5 (12.2%), 3 (7%), and 1 (2%) case.

The possible causes suggested by the investigators were acne (n = 10/41; 24.4%), seborrheic dermatitis (n = 8/41; 19.5%), rosacea (n = 4/41; 9.8%), psoriasis (n = 4/41; 9.8%), perioral dermatitis (n = 3/41; 7.3%), skin dryness (n = 2/41; 4.9%) and eczema (n = 1/41; 2.3%). No diagnosis was proposed in 9/41 (22%) cases. A topical treatment for the intertrigo was prescribed to 80.5% (n = 33). Topical treatments included antifungal (n = 8/33; 19.5%), ivermectin (n = 6/33; 14.6%), corticosteroids (n = 5/33; 12.2%), metronidazole (n = 4/33; 9.8%), topical retinoids (n = 4/33; 9.8%), benzoyl peroxide (n = 2/33; 4.9%), emollient cream (n = 2/33; 4.9%), tacrolimus (n = 1/33; 2.4%) and chlorhexidine (n = 1/33; 2.4%). Some patients received systemic treatments to treat the intertrigo in the context of severe skin disease outside the perialar region in the hypothesis that the intertrigo was part of the other dermatosis. Systemic treatments were prescribed to 3 patients (7.3%): cyclosporine for severe generalized psoriasis (2 patients) and isotretinoin (1 patient) for a diagnosis of possible recurrent acne after a previous course of isotretinoin before inclusion into this study. Five patients (12.2%) did not receive any treatment.

### Oral nystatin prophylaxis in surgical / trauma ICU patients: a randomised clinical trial [^8148f630]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

The challenge posed by nosocomial fungal infections in critically ill patients has become increasingly apparent over the past 20 years. Candida species are now among the leading pathogens in ICUs in both Europe and the United States [-]. The incidence of nosocomial candidaemia has dramatically increased and has been associated with high overall (35 to 80%) and attributable (30 to 40%) mortality. Moreover, it has been reported that the length of stay of critically ill patients who survived candidaemia was prolonged from 8 to 30 days with a significant increase of nursing workload. Candidaemic patients needed a prolongation of mechanical ventilatory support of 10 days. Candidaemia is associated with high morbidity, high mortality, and the significant use of additional resources.

Colonisation by Candida species is the leading risk factor for infection, and several elements support the assumption that multiple- site colonisation is a prerequisite for subsequent infection [-]. Several risk factors can promote further invasion with possible secondary haematogenous dissemination; among these risk factors, surgical procedures seem to play a key role.

Assuming the risk of death is similar in multiple-site colonised surgical patients and in those with proven candidiasis, several studies have focused on the degree of colonisation and screening. Pittet and colleagues established the degree of colonisation with the Candida colonisation index (CI) and found a strong correlation between colonisation intensity (that is, CI > 0.5) and invasive infections. The same authors showed that considering heavy colonised body sites with the corrected colonisation index (CCI) enhances the discriminatory power of the CI, with higher (100%) sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive, and negative predictive values than the CI.

For these reasons, oral chemoprophylaxis has been advocated for ICU patients, and in particular for surgical ICU patients, with the aim to reduce the incidence of heavy colonisation and infection, although whether this approach should be implemented remains controversial. Oral nystatin prophylaxis efficiently prevented Candida species colonisation both in medical and surgical patients that were not colonised at admission to the ICU. Since colonisation can be observed on admission in up to 50% of ICU patients a considerable cohort was excluded, making these positive results not applicable to all ICU populations.

We therefore decided to perform a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the time course of CCI in a surgical/trauma ICU population, including those colonised at admission, undergoing nystatin prophylaxis.

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the Hiv Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^6c1ef962]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Oropharyngeal candidiasis alternatives and topical options—Using topical agents reduces systemic drug exposure, diminishes the risk of drug-drug interactions and systemic adverse events, and may reduce the likelihood that antifungal resistance develops, although unfavorable taste and multiple daily dosing may decrease tolerability; as alternatives to oral fluconazole, once-daily miconazole in 50-mg mucoadhesive buccal tablets (BI) or five-times-per-day clotrimazole troches can be used to treat oropharyngeal candidiasis (BI), and nystatin suspension or pastilles four times daily remain an additional alternative (BII), while topical, low-concentration gentian violet (0.00165%) applied twice daily may be an alternative, well-tolerated, and cost-effective regimen to nystatin suspension (BII). Itraconazole oral solution for 7 to 14 days is as effective as oral fluconazole for oropharyngeal candidiasis but less well tolerated (BI), and posaconazole oral suspension is also as effective as fluconazole and generally better tolerated than itraconazole solution, although both posaconazole and itraconazole have more drug-drug interactions than fluconazole (BI); in a multicenter, randomized study, posaconazole was found to be more effective than fluconazole in sustaining clinical success after antifungal therapy was discontinued. A new solid oral delayed-release tablet formulation of posaconazole, which exhibits less variable absorption than the oral suspension, is now available; whether it offers any advantage for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis is unknown, and it currently is indicated only for prophylaxis of invasive Aspergillus and Candida infections.

### Nystatin and triamcinolone [^0862a87e]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Laboratory Tests

If there is a lack of therapeutic response, appropriate 
microbiological studies (e.g. KOH smears and/or cultures) should be repeated to 
confirm the diagnosis and rule out other pathogens, before instituting another 
course of therapy.

A urinary free cortisol test and ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in 
evaluating hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression due to 
corticosteroids.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of 
Fertility

Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate 
carcinogenic or mutagenic potential, or possible impairment of fertility in 
males or females.

Pregnancy Category C

There are no teratogenic studies with combined nystatin and 
triamcinolone acetonide. Corticosteroids are generally teratogenic in laboratory 
animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. The more 
potent corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal 
application in laboratory animals. Therefore, any topical corticosteroid 
preparation should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit 
justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

Topical preparations containing corticosteroids should not be used 
extensively on pregnant patients, in large amounts, or for prolonged periods of 
time.

Nursing Mothers

It is not known whether any component of this preparation is 
excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution 
should be exercised during the use of this preparation by a nursing woman.

Pediatric Use

In clinical studies of a limited number of pediatric patients 
ranging from two months through 12 years, nystatin and triamcinolone acetonide 
cream formulation cleared or significantly ameliorated the disease state in most 
patients.

Pediatric patients may demonstrate greater susceptibility to 
topical corticosteroid-induced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis 
suppression and Cushing's syndrome than mature patients because of a larger skin 
surface area to body weight ratio.

HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have 
been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of 
adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed 
weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and absence of response to ACTH 
stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging 
fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema.

Administration of topical corticosteroids to children should be limited to 
the least amount compatible with an effective therapeutic regimen. Chronic 
corticosteroid therapy may interfere with the growth and development of 
children.

### A clinician's guide to the diagnosis and treatment of candidiasis in patients with psoriasis [^ea919c8d]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Candidal Balanitis

Candidal balanitis (Fig. 1 d) is defined as inflammation of the glans penis in the presence of Candida spp. and accounts for less than 20 % of all balanoposthitis. Candidal balanitis is generally sexually acquired and is more common in patients with diabetes and in uncircumcised men. Infections are almost always opportunistic and often occur in patients with primary inflammatory dermatoses, such as psoriasis. Symptoms include local burning, soreness, and pruritus, and clinical features include pronounced erythema and papules. Diagnosis is often based on clinical appearance, but European consensus guidelines recommend performing a subpreputial culture to confirm the presence of Candida.

European guidelines for the management of candidal balanitis recommend treatment with 1 % clotrimazole cream applied twice daily until symptoms resolve or, if symptoms are severe, oral fluconazole 150 mg once daily (strength of recommendation for both: A). Application of 2 % miconazole cream twice daily until symptoms resolve or, if resistance or allergy to imidazoles is suspected, nystatin cream (100,000 units/g) is also recommended (strength of recommendation for both: B). Topical imidazole with 1 % hydrocortisone can be used if marked inflammation is present (strength of recommendation: C).

For severe acute Candida vulvovaginitis, fluconazole, 150 mg, given every 72 hours for a total of 2 or 3 doses, is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). For C. glabrata vulvovaginitis unresponsive to oral azoles, topical intravaginal boric acid, 600 mg daily, for 14 days is an alternative (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence), nystatin intravaginal suppositories, 100 000 units daily for 14 days (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence), or topical 17% flucytosine cream alone or with 3% AmB cream administered daily for 14 days (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence). For recurring vulvovaginal candidiasis, 10–14 days of induction therapy with a topical agent or oral fluconazole, followed by fluconazole, 150 mg weekly for 6 months, is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence).

### Nystatin prophylaxis and treatment in severely immunodepressed patients [^0cf61dab]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Nystatin is sometimes used prophylactically in patients with severe immunodeficiency or in the treatment of fungal infection in such patients, although its effect seems to be equivocal.

Objectives

To study whether nystatin decreases morbidity and mortality when given prophylactically or therapeutically to patients with severe immunodeficiency.

Search Methods

We searched PubMed from 1966 to 7 July 2014 and the reference lists of identified articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials comparing nystatin with placebo, an untreated control group, fluconazole or amphotericin B.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data on mortality, invasive fungal infection and colonisation were independently extracted by both authors. A random-effects model was used unless the P value was greater than 0.10 for the test of heterogeneity.

Main Results

We included 14 trials (1569 patients). The drugs were given prophylactically in 12 trials and as treatment in two. Eleven trials were in acute leukaemia, solid cancer, or bone marrow recipients; one in liver transplant patients; one in critically ill surgical and trauma patients; and one in AIDS patients. Nystatin was compared with placebo in three trials, with fluconazole in 10, and amphotericin B in one; the dose varied from 0.8 MIE to 72 MIE daily and was 2 mg/kg/d in a liposomal formulation. The effect of nystatin was similar to that of placebo on fungal colonisation (relative risk (RR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.13). There was no statistically significant difference between fluconazole and nystatin on mortality (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.03) whereas fluconazole was more effective in preventing invasive fungal infection (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.93) and colonisation (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.68). There were no proven fungal infections in a small trial that compared amphotericin B with liposomal nystatin. The results were very similar if the three studies that were not performed in cancer patients were excluded. For the 2011 and 2014 updates no additional trials were identified for inclusion.

Authors' Conclusions

Nystatin cannot be recommended for prophylaxis or the treatment of Candida infections in immunodepressed patients.

### Oral candidiasis in a specialist palliative care unit: assessment, diagnosis, management [^0136dde0]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2023). High credibility.

Background

Oral health impinges on patients’ quality of life during palliative care,while oral symptoms go under-reported, underdiagnosed and undertreated.Assessment tools do not generally specify oral symptoms,yet Candida is prevalent in advanced illness.Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) aims to optimise antimicrobial use.

The Hospital National Antimicrobial Prescribing Survey (NAPS), a standardised auditing tool, enables national benchmarking of the quality of antimicrobial prescribing,informed by the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care (ACSQHC) AMS Clinical Care Standard.NAPS criteria stipulate >95% of antimicrobial prescriptions adhere to evidence-based guidelines, document treatment indications and duration or timing of review.The Australian Therapeutic Guidelines: Palliative Care recommends nystatin as first-line treatment for oral candidiasis.

A NAPS at Concord Repatriation General Hospital (CRGH) 2015–2018 identified nystatin as the most frequently prescribed antimicrobial. In 2018, 100% of surveyed nystatin prescriptions at CRGH included documentation of indication for treatment; however, only 33.3% included a review or stop date.

Aim

To evaluate current clinical practices of assessment, diagnosis and management of oral candidiasis in a specialist palliative care unit.

Setting

The Concord Centre for Palliative Care (CCPC), a 20-bed inpatient unit attached to CRGH, delivers multidisciplinary care to patients with complex needs.

### Impact of a multifaceted prevention program on ventilator-associated pneumonia including selective oropharyngeal decontamination [^dfe19e4e]. Intensive Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Multifaceted prevention program

A multidisciplinary task force, consisting of intensivists, ICU nurses, pharmacists, infection control and infectious diseases physicians, was created in May 2014 to develop a policy for VAP prevention. Knowledge of health-care workers (HCWs) on VAP prevention was assessed by a questionnaire in August 2014 and again in December 2015 (Supplementary Appendix). A targeted educational program of 1 h was designed for nurses, nursing assistants and physiotherapists and conducted between September 2014 and March 2015. Our multifaceted prevention program focused on nine preventive measures based on ATS/IDSA recommendations, meta-analyses of specific measures and monocentric studies with VAP bundle implementation. Three groups of measures were implemented throughout the intervention period: (1) good basic practices in September 2014: compliance with hand hygiene, keeping patients in a semirecumbent position (> 30°), oral hygiene three times daily with 0.2% chlorhexidine-gluconate aqueous solution, maintaining an endotracheal tube cuff pressure ≥ 25 cm H 2 O, daily sedation hold, daily trial of ventilation weaning, daily active mobilization; (2) new device in December 2014: continuous aspiration of subglottic secretions; (3) new practice in March 2015: SOD with colistin, tobramycin and nystatin three times per day for patients likely to be ventilated ≥ 48 h. The same measures were applied in the post-intervention period.

Adherence with the different bundle components was measured throughout the study period, and less frequently in the post-intervention period; relevant process indicators are reported in the Supplementary Appendix. Global compliance with the eight indicators (except hand hygiene compliance, measured as an aggregate data indicator) was calculated (1 point was attributed for each indicator correctly applied; sum of points was divided by the number of assessable indicators) and expressed as a percentage for each patient. A daily e-surveillance form was used to record data. A team of five ICU and infection control personnel was trained for these evaluations. Performance feedback consisted of regular meetings, and visible displaying for HCWs of graphs documenting compliance and VAP rates.

### Oral nystatin prophylaxis in surgical / trauma ICU patients: a randomised clinical trial [^d671daaa]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

We performed a randomised, open-label, single-centre study with blinded assessment of the objective primary evaluation criterion. We studied a single drug (nystatin) versus control. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Policlinico Hospital, Bari, Italy and was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01495039).

The study was performed from November 2008 to August 2009 (date of final data collection for the primary outcome measure). The primary evaluation criterion was the time course of the CCI; the secondary evaluation criterion was occurrence of a fungal infection.

Study population

The patients or their next of kin provided informed consent for participation in the study. The inclusion criteria were: surgical patients admitted to our ICU > 18 years of age and expected to require invasive mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours. The exclusion criteria were: pregnancy, proven Candida infection, prophylactic or curative antifungal treatment within the last 2 months, contraindication to oral drug administration, known allergy to nystatin or its derivatives, and prior inclusion in the study.

Reasons for admission, demographic characteristics, immune status, and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score were recorded on admission. The duration of mechanical ventilation, the duration of antibiotic and corticosteroid therapy, the length of stay in the ICU, the route of nutrition (that is, enteral vs. parenteral), and mortality were also recorded. In cases of residual gastric volume > 500 ml/24 hours or vomiting, the patient was excluded from the analysis. Risk factors for Candida infection were identified and recorded as previously suggested (that is, diabetes, previous antibiotic and corticosteroid therapy or dialysis, central venous catheter, parenteral nutrition, multiple transfusions, pancreatitis, chronic renal failure, immunosuppressive therapy other than steroids, leucopenia (white blood cells < 4,000/mm)). Patients were randomised to one of the two study groups, according to a randomisation sealed envelope opened on admission to the ICU, to receive either systematic nystatin prophylaxis (2 × 10 6 U/day administered three times daily via the nasogastric tube; group N) or no nystatin prophylaxis as control (group C).

KDIGO—Candida prophylaxis after kidney transplantation—“We suggest oral and esophageal Candida prophylaxis with oral clotrimazole lozenges, nystatin, or fluconazole for 1–3 months after transplantation, and for 1 month after treatment with an antilymphocyte antibody. (2C)” “KTRs are at increased risk for oral and esophageal infections due to Candida species.” “The use of oral clotrimazole troches or nystatin provides effective prophylaxis without systemic absorption and hence without concerns for side effects,” and “prophylaxis should logically be continued until patients are on stable, maintenance immunosuppression, particularly corticosteroids.” The risk “is greatest early after transplantation,” and “these agents can likely be discontinued once the patient is on maintenance immunosuppression, particularly when steroid doses are stable and low.” Drug interactions include “a potential drug–drug interaction between clotrimazole and tacrolimus” and that “there are drug–drug interactions between fluconazole and CNIs.”

### Clotrimazole [^361ab29b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

If irritation or sensitivity develops with the use of clotrimazole cream, treatment should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.

Information for Patients

The patient should be advised to:

Use the medication for the full treatment time even though the symptoms may have improved.

Notify the physician if there is no improvement after four weeks of treatment.
Inform the physician if the area of application shows signs of increased irritation (redness, itching, burning, blistering, swelling, oozing) indicative of possible sensitization.
Avoid the use of occlusive wrappings or dressings.
Avoid sources of infection or reinfection.

Laboratory Tests

If there is a lack of response to clotrimazole cream, appropriate microbiological studies should be repeated to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other pathogens before instituting another course of antimycotic therapy.

Drug Interactions

Synergism or antagonism between clotrimazole and nystatin, or amphotericin B, or flucytosine against strains of C. albicans has not been reported.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

An 18-month oral dosing study with clotrimazole in rats has not revealed any carcinogenic effect.

In tests for mutagenesis, chromosomes of the spermatophores of Chinese hamsters which had been exposed to clotrimazole were examined for structural changes during the metaphase. Prior to testing, the hamsters had received five oral clotrimazole doses of 100 mg/kg body weight. The results of this study showed that clotrimazole had not mutagenic effect.

### Topical treatment for vaginal candidiasis (thrush) in pregnancy [^33ea605d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Vaginal candidiasis (moniliasis or thrush) is a common and frequently distressing infection for many women. It is even more common in pregnancy. There is no evidence that thrush in pregnancy is harmful to the baby.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of different methods of treating vaginal candidiasis in pregnancy.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Trials Register. In addition, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL/CCTR) was searched. Date of last search: March 2001.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials of any treatment for vaginal candidiasis in pregnancy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Ten trials were included. Based on five trials, imidazole drugs were more effective than nystatin when treating vaginal candidiasis in pregnancy (odds ratio 0.21, 95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.29). In turn, Nystatin was as effective as hydrargaphen in one trial (odds ratio 0.29, 95% confidence interval 0.05-1.84). A trial of clotrimazole was more effective than placebo (odds ratio 0.14, 95% confidence interval 0.06 to 0.31). Single dose treatment was no more or less effective than three or four days treatment. However, two trials involving 81 women, showed that treatment lasting for four days was less effective than treatment for seven days (odds ratio 11.7, 95% confidence interval 4.21 to 29.15). Based on two trials, treatment for seven days was no more or less effective than treatment for 14 days (odds ratio 0.41, 95% confidence interval 0.16 to 1.05). Terconazole was as effective as clotrimazole (odds ratio 1.41, 95% confidence interval 0.28- 7.10).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Topical imidazole appears to be more effective than nystatin for treating symptomatic vaginal candidiasis in pregnancy. Treatments for seven days may be necessary in pregnancy rather than the shorter courses more commonly used in non-pregnant women.

### Candidosis, a new challenge [^332a48c3]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Superficial candidosis is a common fungal infection that could become a gateway to systemic spread. Candida albicans is the most important Candida spp; recently, so-called emergent species, such as C dubliniensis, C famata, and C lipolytica have been isolated. This chapter describes the clinical manifestations and laboratory diagnostic techniques, including direct examination, smears, cultures, and physiologic tests. Topical antifungal drugs available for the treatment of superficial candidosis, including imidazoles, triazoles, allylamines, and nystatin, are also discussed. For granulomatous and invasive forms of candidosis, triazoles, allylamines (terbinafine), echinocandins (caspofungin), and amphotericin B are elective therapeutic choices. It is important to eliminate associated predisposing factors that contribute to infection and, if possible, all samples obtained should be evaluated for cases of resistance.

### Topical anti-inflammatory agents for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face or scalp [^acc32db8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder affecting primarily the skin of the scalp, face, chest, and intertriginous areas, causing scaling and redness of the skin. Current treatment options include antifungal, anti-inflammatory, and keratolytic agents, as well as phototherapy.

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical pharmacological interventions with established anti-inflammatory action for seborrhoeic dermatitis occurring in adolescents and adults.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to September 2013: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 9), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), LILACS (from 1982), and the GREAT database. We searched five trials databases and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs in adults or adolescents (> 16 years) with diagnosed seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp or face, comparing topical anti-inflammatory treatments (steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and lithium salts) with other treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pairs of authors independently assessed eligibility for inclusion, extracted data, and evaluated the risk of bias. We performed meta-analyses if feasible.

Main Results

We included 36 RCTs (2706 participants), of which 31 examined topical steroids; seven, calcineurin inhibitors; and three, lithium salts. The comparative interventions included placebo, azoles, calcipotriol, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory compound, and zinc, as well as different anti-inflammatory treatments compared against each other. Our outcomes of interest were total clearance of symptoms, erythema, scaling or pruritus scores, and adverse effects. The risk of bias in studies was most frequently classified as unclear, due to unclear reporting of methods.Steroid treatment resulted in total clearance more often than placebo in short-term trials (four weeks or less) (relative risk (RR) 3.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22 to 11.56, three RCTs, 313 participants) and in one long-term trial (lasting 12 weeks). Steroids were also more effective in reducing erythema, scaling, and pruritus. Adverse effects were similar in both groups.There may be no difference between steroids and calcineurin inhibitors in total clearance in the short-term (RR 1.08, 95% 0.88 to 1.32, two RCTs, 60 participants, low-quality evidence). Steroids and calcineurin inhibitors were found comparable in all other assessed efficacy outcomes as well (five RCTs, 237 participants). Adverse events were less common in the steroid group compared with the calcineurin group in the short-term (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.89, two RCTs, 60 participants).There were comparable rates of total clearance in the steroid and azole groups (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.32, eight RCTs, 464 participants, moderate-quality evidence) as well as of adverse effects in the short-term, but less erythema or scaling with steroids.We found mild (class I and II) and strong (class III and IV) steroids comparable in the assessed outcomes, including adverse events. The only exception was total clearance in long-term use, which occurred more often with a mild steroid (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.98, one RCT, 117 participants, low-quality evidence).In one study, calcineurin inhibitor was more effective than placebo in reducing erythema and scaling, but there were similar rates in total clearance or adverse events for short-term treatment. In another study, calcineurin inhibitor was comparable with azole when erythema, scaling, or adverse effects were measured for longer-term treatment.Lithium was more effective than placebo with regard to total clearance (RR 8.59, 95% CI 2.08 to 35.52, one RCT, 129 participants) with a comparable safety profile. Compared with azole, lithium resulted in total clearance more often (RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.90 in short-term treatment, one RCT, 288 participants, low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Topical steroids are an effective treatment for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face and scalp in adolescents and adults, with no differences between mild and strong steroids in the short-term. There is some evidence of the benefit of topical calcineurin inhibitor or lithium salt treatment. Treatment with azoles seems as effective as steroids concerning short-term total clearance, but in other outcomes, strong steroids were more effective. Calcineurin inhibitor and azole treatment appeared comparable. Lithium salts were more effective than azoles in producing total clearance.Steroids are similarly effective to calcineurin inhibitors but with less adverse effects.Most of the included studies were small and short, lasting four weeks or less. Future trials should be appropriately blinded; include more than 200 to 300 participants; and compare steroids to calcineurin inhibitors or lithium salts, and calcineurin inhibitors to azoles or lithium salts. The follow-up time should be at least one year, and quality of life should be addressed. There is also a need for the development of well-validated outcome measures.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^83ea224c]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Children With and Exposed to HIV—preferred treatment for oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) in children with HIV infection—specifies that uncomplicated OPC can be effectively treated with topical clotrimazole troches or nystatin suspension for 7 to 14 days (strong, moderate). Oral fluconazole for 7 to 14 days is recommended for moderate or severe OPC disease (strong, high). For fluconazole-refractory OPC, itraconazole oral solution is recommended, although itraconazole is less well tolerated than fluconazole (strong, moderate). Chronic suppressive therapy is usually unnecessary; if it is required, fluconazole 3 times weekly is recommended (strong, high).

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 10 post-travel evaluation [^1be20f2e]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Post-travel dermatologic conditions—tinea (pityriasis) versicolor—clinical diagnosis often is based on lesion appearance; under a Wood ultraviolet lamp, the lesion produces a subtle yellowish-green hue, and microscopic examination using a KOH preparation can be confirmatory; the causative fungi are difficult to grow in standard culture media, and lesions on any one individual have a uniform color. Topical azole products (clotrimazole cream, ketoconazole shampoo used as a body wash), selenium sulfide shampoo, or topical zinc pyrithione are recommended treatments, and systemic azoles (e.g., fluconazole) can be used to treat severe, relapsing infections, or those recalcitrant to first-line therapies. In many countries, the most common treatment is Whitfield ointment (salicylic acid 3% and benzoic acid 6%, mixed in a vehicle such as petrolatum), and oral griseofulvin, topical nystatin, and both oral and topical terbinafine are ineffective against Malassezia.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections among HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, the Hiv Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the American Academy of Pediatrics [^9c0b91b5]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Table 3—candidiasis in HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children—management includes oropharyngeal and esophageal regimens: for oropharyngeal disease, first-choice options are fluconazole 6–12 mg/kg body weight (maximum 400 mg/dose) by mouth once daily, clotrimazole troches, 10-mg troche by mouth 4–5 times daily, or nystatin suspension 4–6 mL by mouth 4 times daily, or 1–2, 200,000-unit flavored pastilles by mouth 4–5 times daily; treatment duration is 7 to 14 days. For esophageal disease, first choice is fluconazole 6–12 mg/kg body weight by mouth once daily (maximum dose: 600 mg) or itraconazole oral solution, 2.5 mg/kg body weight/dose by mouth twice daily; alternatives include oropharyngeal (fluconazole-refractory) itraconazole oral solution 2.5 mg/kg body weight/ dose by mouth twice daily (maximum 200–400 mg/ day) and esophageal disease amphotericin B (deoxycholate) 0.3–0.7 g/ kg body weight IV once daily. Itraconazole oral solution should not be used interchangeably with itraconazole capsules and itraconazole capsules are generally ineffective for treatment of esophageal disease; central venous catheters should be removed, when feasible, in children with HIV with fungemia, and in uncomplicated catheter-associated C. albicans candidemia, an initial course of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole to complete treatment can be used.

### Effect of probiotics on necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^5863f5c2]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

All studies, except for two that used nystatin only as an intervention in the control group, included blank or placebo controls. Most studies initiated the intervention during the initial feeding phase, on the second or third day of life for preterm infants, administering it once a day until hospital discharge. The intervention was administered orally or through tube feeding, with dosages ranging from 10 6 to 10 10 CFU. One particular study examined the impact of different dose levels and treatment durations on the efficacy of the probiotic. In the remaining studies, the treatment course lasted more than 7 days (Table 1).

Table 1 
Characteristics of the included studies

The study’s first author, publication date, region, study population, intervention, and primary outcomes are described. Primary outcome 1 was mortality; primary outcome 2 was the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (at or beyond Bell Stage II); primary outcome 3 was the length of hospital stay; primary outcome 4 was the time to reach full feeding; primary outcome 5 was the incidence of culture-proven sepsis

### Nystatin cream USP (...) [^e1c7aa2c]. FDA (DailyMed) (2023). Medium credibility.

Nystatin acts by binding to sterols in the cell membrane of susceptible species resulting in a change in membrane permeability and the subsequent leakage of intracellular components. On repeated subculturing with increasing levels of nystatin, Candida albicans does not develop resistance to nystatin. Generally, resistance to nystatin does not develop during therapy. However, other species of Candida become quite resistant on treatment with nystatin and simultaneously become cross resistant to amphotericin as well. This resistance is lost when the antibiotic is removed. Nystatin exhibits no appreciable activity against bacteria, protozoa, or viruses. Nystatin cream is indicated in the treatment of cutaneous or mucocutaneous mycotic infections caused by Candida albicans and other susceptible Candida species. This cream is not indicated for systemic, oral, intravaginal or ophthalmic use.

Nystatin cream is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of its components. General Nystatin cream should not be used for the treatment of systemic, oral, intravaginal or ophthalmic infections. If irritation or sensitization develops, treatment should be discontinued and appropriate measures taken as indicated. It is recommended that KOH smears, cultures, or other diagnostic methods be used to confirm the diagnosis of cutaneous or mucocutaneous candidiasis and to rule out infection caused by other pathogens. Patients using this medication should receive the following information and instructions:

1. The patient should be instructed to use this medication as directed. This medication is not for any disorder other than that for which it is prescribed.
2.

Even if symptomatic relief occurs within the first few days of treatment, the patient should be advised not to interrupt or discontinue therapy until the prescribed course of treatment is completed.
3. If symptoms of irritation develop, the patient should be advised to notify the physician promptly. Adults and Pediatric Patients Apply liberally to affected areas twice daily or as indicated until healing is complete. Nystatin Cream USP is a light yellow to yellow cream that is supplied in: 15 gram tube NDC 0316-0221-15 30 gram tube NDC 0316-0221-30.

### Oral nystatin prophylaxis in surgical / trauma ICU patients: a randomised clinical trial [^d8a9d5b8]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Definitions and mycological assessment

Multiple-site testing for fungi included tracheal secretions, swab, stomach contents, pharyngeal, rectal and groin skinfold swabs, urine, and blood. These tests were performed in each patient at ICU admission (T0) and subsequently every 3 days throughout the ICU stay (T3, T6, T9, and so forth). The specimens were placed in a dry medium and taken to the Mycology Laboratory. Group assignment was not indicated on the specimens, so the mycologists were therefore blinded to treatment allocation. Each specimen was directly microscopically examined and cultured on Sabouraud media. The attending physicians were not aware of the results of the colonisation samples, and therefore no empirical or pre-emptive antifungal therapy was in place in enrolled patients.

Colonisation was assessed for each body site specimen, and yeasts were identified. Fungal colonisation was defined as the presence of the same yeast on one or more of the six distinct body sites tested (blood sample excepted). The CI was calculated for each multiple-site testing as the ratio between the number of distinct body sites colonised by Candida species (except blood) and the total number of sites tested. The CCI was calculated for each time point as the product of the CI multiplied by the ratio of the number of distinct nonblood body sites showing heavy growth to the total of body sites growing Candida species. Fungal infection was defined as either the presence of candidaemia or the identification of Candida species in a normally sterile body site, associated with severe sepsis and negative tests for bacteria. During the study period, adverse events related to the study drug were monitored (that is, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, intestinal pain, urticarial skin reactions).

Outcome measures and statistical analysis

Continuous variables are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation or median (interquartile range). Categorical variables were compared by chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Student's t test was used to compare normally distributed continuous variables, and the Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyse variables not normally distributed. All P values were two-tailed. Statistical significance was set at P ≤ 0.05. For an estimated rate of fungal colonisation reaching approximately 60% in ICU patients, 49 patients per group had to be enrolled in the study to show a 50% reduction in fungal colonisation, with an α error of 5% and a β error of 20%.
