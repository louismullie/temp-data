## Question

Which laboratory tests should be ordered for a patient who bruises easily?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which laboratory tests should be ordered for a patient who bruises easily. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pretest clinical assessment that frames testing. Then, I should define the core initial laboratory panel. Next, I will interpret results using a pattern-based algorithm. After that, I need to add targeted tests based on clinical suspicion, followed by specialized secondary testing if needed. Finally, I should clarify thresholds for hematology referral and propose a pragmatic prioritization and stewardship plan, while considering pediatric and trauma-specific nuances where appropriate.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because testing without anchoring to history and exam risks false positives and misinterpretation. I need to check the bleeding history including site patterning (mucocutaneous versus deep tissue), duration and severity, medications and supplements, alcohol use, diet quality, family history, and trauma history, and to examine for petechiae, mucosal bleeding, hemarthroses, hepatosplenomegaly, and stigmata of liver disease; using a structured bleeding assessment tool like the ISTH-BAT strengthens pretest clarity, but hold on, I should verify that a high score is not diagnostic in isolation and must be paired with labs and clinical synthesis. In children, I must not jump to conclusions: patterned or developmentally discordant bruising warrants parallel consideration of nonaccidental trauma and medical causes, so I should double-check for red flags and follow pediatric guidance on when to pursue hematologic evaluation in the context of suspected abuse [^116izDRZ] [^115Fw1w7] [^112mWRez].

> Next, I should review which core initial laboratory tests are consistently recommended as the first-line panel. I need to ensure I include a complete blood count with platelet count, a peripheral smear, PT/INR, aPTT, and fibrinogen, because these tests efficiently screen for thrombocytopenia, qualitative platelet disorders, intrinsic versus extrinsic pathway defects, and hypofibrinogenemia or consumption. Wait, let me verify the role of the smear: it helps detect platelet morphology abnormalities, blasts, schistocytes, or spurious counts that automated analyzers might miss, which can redirect the workup early if abnormal [^1146F8KM] [^116izDRZ].

> I will now examine result patterns using a stepwise algorithm, but I need to ensure I align each branch to likely etiologies. If PT and aPTT are both normal with normal platelets, I should consider qualitative platelet dysfunction or von Willebrand disease; if aPTT is prolonged with normal PT and platelets, I should confirm with a mixing study, because correction points to factor deficiencies (VIII, IX, XI) whereas non-correction points to inhibitors such as lupus anticoagulant. If PT is prolonged with a normal aPTT, I should think about factor VII deficiency, early vitamin K deficiency, or warfarin effect and consider a vitamin K challenge or factor VII assay. If both PT and aPTT are prolonged, I should check for common pathway factor deficiencies, liver disease, or DIC and add liver panel, D-dimer, and targeted factor assays. But wait, I should verify platelet count interpretations too: thrombocytopenia with any coagulation pattern necessitates a careful smear review and etiologic evaluation such as ITP, marrow suppression, DIC, or drug-induced thrombocytopenia [^1146F8KM] [^116izDRZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump past von Willebrand testing when mucocutaneous bleeding predominates and initial PT/aPTT/platelets are normal. I should order a VWD panel with VWF antigen, VWF activity (ristocetin cofactor or collagen binding), and FVIII, and then examine ratios to distinguish quantitative from qualitative defects; if the patient is older or has a relevant comorbidity, I need to consider acquired von Willebrand syndrome and verify correction strategies accordingly. I almost said that a normal aPTT rules out VWD, but wait a minute, that is not reliable because many VWD cases have normal screening coagulation times, which is why the dedicated VWF panel is essential [^115WeHtV] [^113RUBMd] [^114nRFJk].

> If dietary risk is present or exam suggests scurvy (gingival disease, perifollicular petechiae, corkscrew hairs), I should confirm with a vitamin C level, because bruising with otherwise unrevealing coagulation studies may reflect vitamin C deficiency; I need to ensure I do not overcall scurvy without objective deficiency or clear response to supplementation, so careful documentation and re-evaluation after repletion are prudent [^112gpa8r] [^111hUAgZ].

> When liver disease is suspected by history or exam, I should review AST, ALT, bilirubin, albumin, and correlate with PT/INR and aPTT, keeping in mind that synthetic dysfunction often manifests with prolonged PT earlier than aPTT; I should confirm whether factor V and VII are disproportionately affected and broaden to hepatitis testing as indicated. Let me reconsider: if both PT and aPTT are prolonged with low fibrinogen and elevated D-dimer, that pattern leans toward consumption coagulopathy, so I need to differentiate this from isolated hepatocellular dysfunction before assuming a single diagnosis [^111dWsVc] [^116izDRZ].

> If uremia is plausible, I need to check renal function and consider platelet function testing when bleeding is disproportionate to platelet count and routine coagulation tests, because uremic platelet dysfunction is classically qualitative; I should confirm that testing modality selection matches local expertise since light transmission aggregometry remains a reference standard, while screening platforms such as PFA can be supportive but are not definitive alone [^111DbZRS].

> Medication-induced bleeding and bruising must be systematically screened, and I should verify exposures to anticoagulants and antiplatelets, including heparin, DOACs like rivaroxaban and dabigatran, and cytotoxics such as PARP inhibitors or agents like anagrelide, because labels explicitly warn of easier bruising and prolonged bleeding; if such agents are present, I need to correlate timing, dose, and concomitant NSAIDs or antiplatelets before attributing to a primary hemostatic disorder. But wait, I should double-check that the lab patterns fit the pharmacology, for example anti-factor Xa agents may not prolong aPTT reliably, so clinical correlation is essential [^116rXRpi] [^112mm21G] [^1168ehhz] [^111cyueF] [^1145cbAi].

> If the initial workup is unrevealing but suspicion remains high, I should escalate to specialized testing. I need to ensure I order platelet function analysis such as PFA-100 and, when feasible, light transmission aggregometry for qualitative platelet disorders; perform specific factor assays guided by mixing study results; obtain a Bethesda inhibitor titer when a mixing study fails to correct; and assess for lupus anticoagulant when aPTT is prolonged with inhibitor pattern. Let me verify marrow involvement if cytopenias or blasts are present by adding bone marrow evaluation, and consider genetic testing for suspected inherited thrombocytopenias or platelet function disorders in consultation with hematology, avoiding over-testing without a clinical anchor [^111DbZRS] [^115HRcaT] [^116izDRZ].

> I should confirm referral thresholds early. Referral to hematology is appropriate when any initial test is abnormal with clinically significant bleeding, or when the history and exam strongly suggest a bleeding disorder despite normal screening tests; urgent referral is required for platelet counts below approximately 50,000/µL with bleeding, prolonged PT/aPTT with active hemorrhage, or any life-threatening bleed. Hold on, I should verify that these thresholds align with primary care guidance and reflect common practice standards to ensure timely escalation [^1146F8KM] [^116izDRZ].

> Let me think about prioritization and stewardship to avoid unnecessary testing while preventing delays. First, obtain the core panel immediately, because it shapes all downstream steps. Same-day additions include a VWD panel when indicated, vitamin C level if deficiency is suspected, and a liver panel when clinical cues point to hepatic disease. If the initial tests are unrevealing yet suspicion remains, I should plan mixing studies, targeted factor assays, and platelet function testing within a week, recognizing that excessive or batched testing can prolong care and emergency department length of stay, so I need to pace testing to decision points rather than order everything upfront [^116izDRZ] [^1165pmp8] [^116aPBCx].

> For pediatric patients, I need to ensure a dual track: evaluate hemostatic disorders and, concurrently, assess for nonaccidental trauma where developmentally incongruent bruising or concerning patterns are present. Wait, let me verify that guidance emphasizes not relying solely on history to exclude bleeding disorders in suspected abuse; targeted labs are warranted when presentations overlap, and the threshold to broaden testing should be individualized based on prevalence and phenotype of specific disorders [^112mWRez].

> In trauma or major hemorrhage contexts, I briefly considered viscoelastic assays and serial hemoglobin or lactate, but hold on, I should clarify that these belong to acute bleeding pathways and are not part of the routine evaluation for chronic easy bruising in stable outpatients; they do matter in resuscitation and can guide component therapy when bleeding is brisk or massive, which is a different clinical question than atraumatic bruising [^116MmcXL] [^116cFZZK] [^111weYrd].

> Summarizing, a careful history and exam using a structured bleeding assessment tool feed a focused core lab panel of CBC with platelets, smear, PT/INR, aPTT, and fibrinogen; interpretation by pattern directs targeted testing such as a VWD panel, nutritional assays, liver workup, and renal assessment, with secondary specialized studies for qualitative platelet disorders, factor deficiencies, and inhibitors when indicated, and timely hematology referral when abnormalities or high clinical suspicion persist. I should double-check at each step that the next test changes management and that I am not over-ordering without clinical justification, keeping the pathway efficient and evidence-guided [^1146F8KM] [^116izDRZ].

For a patient with easy bruising, order a **CBC with platelet count and peripheral smear** to assess for thrombocytopenia or marrow disorders, and **PT/INR, aPTT, and fibrinogen** to screen for coagulopathies [^116izDRZ] [^1146F8KM]. If initial tests are abnormal or suspicion remains high, add **VWF antigen/activity, factor VIII, and platelet function assays** to evaluate for von Willebrand disease or platelet dysfunction [^115WeHtV] [^114nRFJk] [^111DbZRS]. Additionally, check **LFTs, renal function, TSH, and vitamin C** to identify systemic or nutritional causes [^111dWsVc] [^112gpa8r] [^111hUAgZ]. Escalate to mixing studies, specific factor assays, or hematology referral if results are inconclusive or if severe disease is suspected [^1146F8KM] [^116izDRZ].

A 67-year-old man presented to the dermatology clinic for a skin check. On examination, he was found to have hyperpigmented eruptions (PE) of the back and chest in addition to curly, cork-screw hairs. He denied any gum bleeding or swelling but endorsed easy bruising of the arms and legs for the past few years. He denied alcohol use and reported a prior 90-pack year history of smoking, having quit 24 years ago. His diet included fruit intake three to four times weekly and infrequent vegetable intake, once monthly. He did not take any vitamin supplements. A vitamin C level was ordered, resulting at 0.4 mg/dL, the absolute lower limit of normal. The patient was advised to avoid alcohol, incorporate more citrus fruit into his diet, and begin ascorbic acid 100 mg or 250 mg daily for a few months.

A 61-year-old African American man presented to the dermatology clinic for an acne follow-up. He noted intermittent blackhead-like lesions on his arms. On physical exam, hyperpigmented, erythematous follicular-based papules were appreciated on bilateral forearms (Fig 4). Few compound hair follicles were present without evidence of any hair shaft changes. He denied gum bleeding/swelling or easy bruising. He took a baby aspirin and vitamin D daily. He had been drinking 2 ounces of hard liquor three times monthly for the last two years with periodic cigar smoking. His diet consisted of vegetable and fruit intake a few times weekly.

### Bleeding and bruising: Primary care evaluation [^1146F8KM]. American Family Physician (2024). Low credibility.

Easy bruising and bleeding are commonly seen in primary care. The use of a bleeding assessment tool, a comprehensive history, a physical examination, and patient-provided photographs can help identify the causes of abnormal bleeding and bruising. Family history can aid in the diagnosis of a heritable cause. Nonaccidental trauma should be considered, especially in vulnerable populations.

Initial laboratory testing includes a complete blood cell count, peripheral blood smear, prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and fibrinogen. Normal PT and aPTT results may indicate a platelet disorder. A normal PT result with a prolonged aPTT result indicates a disorder of the intrinsic coagulation pathway, while a prolonged PT result with a normal aPTT result may indicate a disorder of the extrinsic coagulation pathway. Consultation with a hematologist is recommended when the initial evaluation indicates a bleeding disorder or when suspicion remains high despite a normal laboratory workup result.

### Alcoholic liver disease [^111dWsVc]. World Journal of Hepatology (2012). High credibility.

Alcohol-related liver disease can be associated with a variety of symptoms and conditions. Common symptoms include easy bruising, abdominal pain, increased serum AST, excessive daytime sleepiness, muscle cramps, peripheral edema, fatigue, portal hypertension, and amenorrhea. Patients may also present with increased serum ALT, decreased libido, epigastric pain, proximal muscle weakness, weight gain, liver cirrhosis, jaundice, and sleeping disorders. Additional manifestations include loss of appetite, insomnia, increased serum TBIL, pupillary athetosis, abdominal distension, pancytopenia, coagulopathy, sarcopenia, hepatic encephalopathy, confusion, and ascites. Weight loss, bilateral parotid gland enlargement, right upper quadrant pain, Dupuytren's contracture, alcohol use disorder, scleral icterus, hair loss, and generalized pruritus may also occur.

### The laboratory diagnosis of platelet disorders [^111DbZRS]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to provide both a detailed description of the laboratory tests available for diagnosing platelet disorders and a testing algorithm. This algorithm, based on platelet count, can be used to guide the evaluation of platelet disorders.

- **Data sources**: A literature search was conducted using the National Library of Medicine database.
- **Study selection**: Literature on laboratory testing of platelet function was reviewed.
- **Data extraction and data synthesis**: Based on the literature review, an algorithm for platelet testing was developed.

A history of mucocutaneous bleeding often indicates abnormal platelet function, which can be associated with a normal, increased, or decreased platelet count. Multiple laboratory procedures can now be used to identify the underlying pathological condition of platelet dysfunction when other deficiencies or defects of the coagulation cascade or fibrinolysis are ruled out. Simple procedures, such as platelet count, peripheral blood smear, and a platelet function screening test, often lead investigators to more specific analyses. Although platelet function testing is often limited to larger medical centers with highly trained technologists, newer technologies are being developed to simplify procedures and make platelet function testing more accessible. This review provides an algorithm for platelet testing that may be beneficial to pathologists and physicians dealing with hemostatic disorders.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Instructions for Use).

- **Bleeding**: Advise patients that bruising and bleeding may occur more easily and that nosebleeds and bleeding of gums may occur. It may take them longer than usual to stop bleeding. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider immediately if symptoms of excessive bruising, excessive bleeding, or major bleeding occur. Signs and symptoms of bleeding include pain, swelling, or discomfort; prolonged bleeding from cuts; increased menstrual flow or vaginal bleeding; nosebleeds; bleeding of gums from brushing; unusual bleeding or bruising; red or dark brown urine; red or tar black stools; headache, dizziness, or weakness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider before scheduling any elective surgery, dental procedure, or other invasive interventions.

### Bruising: A neglected, though patient-relevant complication of insulin injections coming to light from a real-life nationwide survey [^111FgHpp]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

The study protocol was designed according to the original Helsinki Declaration and subsequent amendments, and it was approved by the Scientific and Ethical Committee of the Coordinator Centre, "Vanvitelli" University Hospital of Naples, Italy (protocol number 207/19.09.2017) and by the institutional review board (IRB Min No. 8726 dated 09.11.2017).

All patients provided informed consent for the use of personal data for study purposes. Each patient completed a questionnaire previously utilized by several groups, including ours, which also allowed specifically trained nurses to identify individual injection sites. Skin lesions were then examined according to a structured protocol.

The following data were recorded: demographics, diabetes duration, insulin type, therapeutic scheme daily dose, number of injections per day, type of needle (length and gauge), needle reuse, injection site rotation, ice-cold insulin injections, distance between injection sites (centimeters), intra-LH injections, rate of unexplained hypoglycemia (hypo), and blood glucose variability (GV).

Hypoglycemia (hypo) was defined as the occurrence of one or more symptoms of hypoglycemia (such as palpitations, tiredness, sweating, hunger, dizziness, and tremor) and a confirmed blood glucose meter reading of 60 mg/dL or less, as previously described by several studies. Frequent unexplained hypo was defined as experiencing one or more hypos a week without changes in medication, diet, or physical activity. In the absence of any universally accepted definition, in our study, GV was classified as unpredictable and unex…

### Lynparza [^114w3xKZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

- **Mds/aml**: Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if they experience weakness, feeling tired, fever, weight loss, frequent infections, bruising, bleeding easily, breathlessness, blood in urine or stool, and/or laboratory findings of low blood cell counts, or a need for blood transfusions. This may be a sign of hematological toxicity or a more serious uncommon bone marrow problem called 'myelodysplastic syndrome' (MDS) or 'acute myeloid leukemia' (AML), which have been reported in patients treated with Lynparza [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Pneumonitis**: Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if they experience any new or worsening respiratory symptoms, including shortness of breath, fever, cough, or wheezing [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Venous thromboembolism**: Advise patients to immediately report any signs or symptoms of thromboembolism, such as pain or swelling in an extremity, shortness of breath, chest pain, tachypnea, and tachycardia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **Embryo-fetal toxicity**: Inform pregnant women of the risk to a fetus and potential loss of the pregnancy. Advise females to inform their healthcare provider of known or suspected pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

### Diagnostic utility of the ISTH bleeding assessment tool in patients with suspected platelet function disorders [^115Fw1w7]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Low credibility.

- **Methods**:

- **Study design, setting, and population**: We included all patients older than 18 years of age referred with a suspected bleeding disorder to a specialized outpatient clinic of Inselspital University Hospital in Bern, Switzerland, between January 2012 and March 2017. Reasons for the referral were (a) a bleeding tendency, (b) a family history of bleeding disorders, or (c) abnormal laboratory test results. Inselspital Bern is a tertiary university hospital in Switzerland covering a region with 1.5 million inhabitants. The catchment area of the hospital is representative for Switzerland with regard to German‐speaking and French‐speaking residents, as well as patients living in either urban or rural areas. Inselspital University Hospital comprises the only specialized laboratory, and its hematological outpatient clinic functions as a reference center for coagulation disorders.

Clinical data were prospectively recorded using an established in‐house questionnaire as well as the ISTH-BAT sheet in the electronic hospital database. Laboratory data were stored accordingly. Patient files were coded using an in‐house identification system, and data were retrieved by two investigators working in parallel. All patients signed informed consent forms, and the ethics committee approved the study protocol (No. 02289).

- **Evaluation of patients and determination of ISTH-BAT**: The evaluation of patients was done using a standardized protocol as proposed in previous recommendations. Before consultation, patients completed a 13-item, in-house questionnaire.

### Approach to the bleeding child [^1142ZTSs]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Bruising and bleeding are normal events during childhood. Pediatricians must be able to determine whether a child's symptoms are normal or indicative of defective hemostasis. A thorough medical history and physical examination should enable clinicians to identify which patients require further evaluation. Pediatricians, rather than immediately referring to a hematologist, should be capable of conducting the initial laboratory evaluation and making a correct diagnosis in most cases.

### Heparin sodium [^1161fA8k]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Addition of 70 to 150 units of heparin sodium per 10 to 20 mL sample of whole blood is usually employed to prevent coagulation of the sample. Leukocyte counts should be performed on heparinized blood within two hours after addition of the heparin. Heparinized blood should not be used for isoagglutinin, complement, or erythrocyte fragility tests or platelet counts.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Slight discoloration does not alter potency.

- **Note**: To prevent needle-stick injuries, needles should not be recapped, purposely bent, or broken by hand.

### Advances in immunopathogenesis of adult immune thrombocytopenia [^11116SA2]. Frontiers of Medicine (2013). High credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia can be associated with various factors including age (most commonly peaking between 20–40 years), flu-like symptoms, easy bruising, viral hepatitis, autoimmune disorders, HIV-1 infection, heavy menstrual bleeding, gum bleeding, and female sex. It can also present with petechiae, hematuria, blood in the stools, nosebleeds, and a decreased platelet count.

### Guidance on the critical shortage of sodium citrate coagulation tubes for hemostasis testing [^114tucbo]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

Note: If unbuffered preparation is required, then eliminate the HEPES and pH adjustment steps. The proper ratio is 1 part citrate to 9 parts whole blood when hematocrit is within 25–55%. Citrate volume adjustment for hematocrits outside the aforementioned range can be adjusted as previously described.

For preparing local blood collection tubes:

- **2.0 mL tubes**: Add 0.2 mL of prepared citrate solution. This will then require 1.8 mL of collected whole blood.
- **3.0 mL tubes**: Add 0.3 mL of prepared citrate solution. This will then require 2.7 mL of freshly collected whole blood.
- **5.0 mL tubes**: Add 0.5 mL of prepared citrate solution. This will then require 4.5 mL of freshly collected whole blood.

After citrate is aliquoted into each blood collection tube, they must be capped using an appropriate rubber stopper (optimal), polypropylene cap, or suitable alternative. Failure to appropriately seal the collection vial may result in leaks during inversion or erroneous citrate concentration or pH due to evaporation or gas exchange with room air.

In-house citrate blood specimen collection tubes should be appropriately labeled, indicating citrate concentration, a lot identifier (e.g. preparation date), and expiry date. Tubes should be stored in a cool, dry place or refrigerated after capping. A space for labeling with the patient's name and other appropriate identifiers, date, and time of blood collection must also be available. All information on the tube label must be in permanent, water-insoluble ink.

When required for patient testing, the blood must be collected via syringe technique as these collection tubes will…

### The use of viscoelastic haemostatic assays in the management of major bleeding: A British Society for Haematology guideline [^116MmcXL]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for traumatic hemorrhage, particularly in relation to coagulation and viscoelastic testing, the BSH 2018 guidelines recommend considering the use of low clot strength measures on thromboelastography and rotational thromboelastometry. Additionally, lysis greater than 3% on thromboelastography should be viewed as an indicator that a trauma patient is at a higher risk of requiring RBCs and blood components.

### The utility of routine electrolytes and blood cell counts in patients with chest pain [^116w3rNy]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to determine whether routine screening laboratory tests, specifically electrolytes (E) and hemoglobin and hematocrits (H/H), could have been safely avoided in emergency department (ED) patients presenting with chest pain. A retrospective case series over a three-month period was reviewed. Acceptable indications for ordering E and H/H tests were prospectively developed using American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) guidelines.

Charts were reviewed to determine whether any indications were present, whether the E and H/H laboratory tests were abnormal, and whether the abnormal test affected treatment or disposition. Patients were excluded if they had an abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) indicating ischemia or electrolyte abnormality. This resulted in 191 patients meeting the inclusion criteria. Sixty-eight patients did not have any criteria for ordering E or H/H. Of these, only one (1.5%) had an abnormal laboratory test. The sensitivity of the guidelines for predicting an abnormal laboratory test was 96% (95% CI, 82 to 100%) and the specificity was 46% (95% CI, 38 to 54%).

There were no interventions, consultations, or any change in disposition based on E or H/H testing in these patients. Of the 123 patients that met at least one criterion for ordering laboratory tests, 27 (18%) had an abnormal result. It was concluded that practice guidelines may reduce the number of E and H/H tests ordered without missing significant abnormalities. A prospective trial is needed to validate these findings.

### The effect of laboratory testing on emergency department length of stay: A multihospital longitudinal study applying a cross-classified random-effect modeling approach [^1165pmp8]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The objective was to examine the relationship between laboratory testing (including test volume and turnaround time [TAT]) and emergency department (ED) length of stay (LOS) using linked patient-level data from four hospitals across four years.

This was a retrospective, multisite cohort study of patients presenting to any one of four EDs in New South Wales, Australia, during a two-month period (August and September) in 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011. Data from ED information systems were linked to laboratory test data. A cross-classified random-effect modeling approach was applied to identify factors affecting ED LOS, taking into account the correlation between patients' presentations at the same hospital and/or in the same calendar year. The number of test order episodes (tests ordered at one point in time during the ED stay) and TAT (time from laboratory order receipt to result available) were examined.

As the number of test order episodes increased, so did the duration of patient ED LOS (p < 0.0001). For every five additional tests ordered per test order episode, the median ED LOS increased by 10 minutes (2.9%, p < 0.0001). Each 30-minute increase in TAT was, on average, associated with a 5.1% (17 minutes; p < 0.0001) increase in ED LOS, after adjustment for other factors. Patients presenting to the ED at night (7 p.m. to 7 a.m.) had longer stays than those presenting during the daytime, although the median TATs at night were shorter than those during the daytime.

Laboratory testing has a direct effect on patients' LOS in ED.

Child abuse might be suspected when children present with cutaneous bruising, intracranial hemorrhage, or other manifestations of bleeding. In these cases, it is necessary to consider medical conditions that predispose to easy bleeding or bruising. When evaluating for the possibility of bleeding disorders and other conditions that predispose to hemorrhage, it is important for pediatricians to consider the child's presenting history, medical history, and physical examination findings before initiating a laboratory investigation. Many medical conditions can predispose to easy bleeding. Before ordering laboratory tests for a disease, it is useful to understand the biochemical basis and clinical presentation of the disorder, condition prevalence, and test characteristics. This technical report reviews the major medical conditions that predispose to bruising or bleeding and should be considered when evaluating for abusive injury.

### Talzenna [^114sNdNQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

- **Mds/aml**: Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if they experience weakness, feeling tired, fever, weight loss, frequent infections, bruising, bleeding easily, breathlessness, blood in urine or stool, and/or laboratory findings of low blood cell counts, or a need for blood transfusions. This may be a sign of hematological toxicity or a more serious uncommon bone marrow problem called MDS or AML, which have been reported in patients who received PARP inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Myelosuppression**: Advise patients that Talzenna may affect hematopoiesis and can cause anemia, leukopenia/neutropenia, and/or thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Administration instructions**: Advise patients that Talzenna can be taken once daily with or without food. Instruct patients that if they miss a dose of Talzenna, they should take their next normal dose at the usual time. Also advise patients to swallow each capsule whole, and that capsules must not be opened or dissolved [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

- **Embryo-fetal toxicity**: Advise females to inform their healthcare provider if they are pregnant or become pregnant. Inform female patients of the risk to a fetus and potential loss of the pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Talzenna and for 7 months after the last dose.

### Laboratory tests in the patient with abdominal pain [^116BE929]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is one of the most common presenting complaints in the emergency department (ED). More often than not, some degree of laboratory testing is used to narrow the differential diagnosis based on the patient's history and examination. Ordering practices are often guided by evidence, habit, consulting services, and institutional/regional culture. This review highlights relevant laboratory studies that may be ordered in the ED, along with commentary on the indications and diagnostic value of these tests.

### Ear bruising in a newborn [^1173We5r]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Although rare, severe complications can occur with subgaleal hemorrhages, including hypovolemic shock, coagulopathy, severe metabolic acidosis, seizures, apnea, and death.

Early detection and monitoring are key in preventing poor outcomes. Infants should be closely monitored for signs of blood loss, which include pallor and tachycardia. Serial hematocrit checks and a coagulopathy work-up should be considered. Head imaging, such as MRI or computed tomography (CT), may be useful in differentiating other cranial injuries if diagnosis is uncertain. Head ultrasound can be used as a noninvasive tool that can better describe the hemorrhage. An outpatient provider should closely follow the newborn's physical examination and head circumference.

Treatment is based on the severity of presentation and is primarily supportive. In severe cases, volume resuscitation may be necessary, and blood products should be administered to correct anemia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy that can occur as a sequela of the expanding hemorrhage. Like other extracranial injuries in newborns, subgaleal hemorrhages can cause hyperbilirubinemia from increased bilirubin production from red blood cell breakdown. Bilirubin should be monitored closely to determine the need for phototherapy or exchange transfusion. Surgical intervention to evacuate subgaleal blood is rare and limited to case reports.

The final diagnosis was that the retro-auricular bruising was secondary to a subgaleal hemorrhage from birth, causing blood accumulation within the subgaleal space in this area.

### Managing snakebite [^1123C7qv]. BMJ (2022). High credibility.

- **Examination**: Bite site — Look for fang marks, retained fangs, bleeding, swelling, bruising, discoloration, and blisters. Fang marks do not confirm snakebite since bites by lizards, fish, rodents, large spiders, some insects, and thorns also leave paired punctures. Their absence does not preclude envenoming, as many snake species produce faint or undetectable bites. Raised vertical, red, tender streaks on the bitten limb suggest lymphangitis. Regional lymph nodes may be enlarged and tender with bruised overlying skin. Note any tourniquets, ligatures, wound incisions, or cauterization, and local traditional remedies, as these may lead to specific complications requiring management. For instance, tourniquets and ligatures, if left on for long, can cause severe local damage, including ischemia, necrosis, and gangrene. Similarly, incisions and local applications can lead to local bacterial infections, sepsis, and tetanus.

- **Systemic examination**: Look for signs of coagulopathy such as subconjunctival, retinal, nasal, and gingivobuccal bleeds, ecchymoses, and internal hemorrhage (such as intracranial, pericardial, pleural, and retroperitoneal). Assess extraocular movements, bulbar function, and muscle power. Look for ptosis, muscle tenderness, and jaw stiffness. Jaw stiffness is a prominent but often overlooked feature in sea snake envenoming that, unlike trismus, can be reduced by sustained pressure on the lower jaw.

- **Identifying snake species**: Occasionally patients or accompanying persons may bring the killed snake for identification or have a picture of it. A herpetologist can be consulted for accurate identification.

### Unexpected diagnosis in an adolescent with bruises and ecchymosis: Celiac disease [^11139j62]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Low credibility.

Acquired coagulopathy is a rare but challenging diagnosis for pediatric emergency physicians. Although the coagulopathy usually presents with mild skin and mucosal hemorrhages, it can also lead to life-threatening events. Therefore, accurate interpretation of hints obtained from a detailed history, physical examination, and laboratory findings is essential for prompt diagnosis and management. This case demonstrates an uncommon cause of coagulopathy: celiac disease presenting with spontaneous bruises and ecchymosis in an adolescent.

### Reducing unnecessary coagulation testing in the emergency department (REDUCED) [^116aPBCx]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Although our study was prospective, the results are limited by the fact it was not randomized and lacked individual patient-level characteristics. We did not specifically monitor when appropriate INR/PT or aPTT were not ordered due to our intervention. This is currently being assessed in a separate project involving a full chart review of a random subset of patient charts during our project. Furthermore, while we reduced PT/INR and aPTT testing in the emergency department, it is unknown whether these tests were ordered if patients were admitted to the hospital. However, it is unlikely to affect our findings since only 15% of patients who arrive at the emergency department are admitted. Since our study was based at a single academic teaching hospital, the results may not be widely generalizable. In hindsight, it would have been ideal to perform this study at multiple centers to strengthen our external generalizability.

An important consideration for any quality improvement study is the sustainability of the observed results. We believe our results are sustainable since the biggest impact occurred after implementing a process change in the way laboratory tests are ordered in the emergency department. This change made it easier for physicians to avoid ordering unnecessary tests, which we believe is crucial for sustainability. Additionally, the lower rate of coagulation test ordering has been maintained to the present date.

We also received positive feedback from the laboratory staff who noticed a decrease in test volumes after the order panel changes.

### Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, including secondary forms, and selection of second-line treatment [^115HRcaT]. Haematologica (2022). High credibility.

A young female patient with immune thrombocytopenia presents with various symptoms. A 20-year-old female returns home from college and notes heavier periods and easy bruising. Her internist observes that she is pale and has visible petechiae on her arms. Complete blood counts reveal mild anemia (hemoglobin 10.2 g/dL) and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 5×10⁹/L. Concerned about a possible leukemia diagnosis, the internist urgently sends her to the emergency room. There is no hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, or other abnormal findings on physical examination.

A review of a peripheral blood smear shows no blasts or abnormalities of other cell lines, although her mean corpuscular volume is low (72 fL), and several of her few platelets are large. She is diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and receives prednisone 1 mg/kg. Over the next few days, she experiences typical steroid-related side effects, such as feeling "a little crazy", insomnia, and abdominal pain. Her bruises and petechiae disappear, and her period ends. Her hematologist prescribes oral iron supplements and changes her prednisone to dexamethasone 40 mg daily for 4 days. Her steroid-related side effects worsen during the 4 days on dexamethasone; however, she soon feels better with no further petechiae, bruising, or menstrual bleeding noted. Her platelet count normalizes to 147×10⁹/L, and her hemoglobin improves to 11.2 g/dL.

She begins checking her blood counts monthly. The improved complete blood count with a nearly normal mean corpuscular volume excludes bone marrow failure as well as thalassemia.

### Bruising, hives, and joint pain in a 3-year-old boy [^1118nqYu]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

- **Question 3**: What is the most appropriate first-line treatment for this patient?
	- A. Admission to the hospital for management
	- B. Immediate cessation of the offending medication and administration of plasmapheresis
	- C. Immediate cessation of the offending medication and short course of glucocorticoids
	- D. Immediate cessation of the offending medication and supportive care
	- E. Short course of glucocorticoids and administration of antihistamines

- **Answers**:
	- A. Admission to the hospital for management – Incorrect. The patient is stable, and supportive care can be managed in the outpatient setting. Indications for hospitalization include severe symptoms, such as high fever or severe arthritis, or an uncontrolled infection for which the culprit drug had been prescribed.
	- B. Immediate cessation of the offending medication and administration of plasmapheresis – Incorrect. While immediate cessation of the suspected triggering medication is correct, plasmapheresis is unnecessary. Plasmapheresis may be utilized in situations where it is not possible to immediately stop the offending medication.
	- C. Immediate cessation of the offending medication and short course of glucocorticoids – Incorrect. High fever or severe arthritis and arthralgias may be managed with a short course of systemic glucocorticoids. This patient does not have these findings and is best managed conservatively with NSAIDs.
	- D. Immediate cessation of the offending medication and supportive care – Correct. This is appropriate management for this patient whose symptoms are limited to the skin and joints and who is otherwise stable.

### Xarelto [^112mm21G]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Advise patients to report any unusual bleeding or bruising to their physician. Inform patients that it might take them longer than usual to stop bleeding and that they may bruise and/or bleed more easily when treated with Xarelto [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Bleeding risks**: If patients have had neuraxial anesthesia or spinal puncture, and particularly if they are taking concomitant NSAIDs or platelet inhibitors, advise patients to watch for signs and symptoms of spinal or epidural hematoma, such as back pain, tingling, numbness (especially in the lower limbs), muscle weakness, and stool or urine incontinence. If any of these symptoms occur, advise the patient to contact their physician immediately [see Boxed Warning].

- **Invasive or surgical procedures**: Instruct patients to inform their healthcare professional that they are taking Xarelto before any invasive procedure (including dental procedures) is scheduled.

- **Concomitant medication and herbals**: Advise patients to inform their physicians and dentists if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs or herbals, so their healthcare professionals can evaluate potential interactions [see Drug Interactions (7)].

- **Pregnancy and pregnancy-related hemorrhage**: Advise patients to inform their physician immediately if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with Xarelto [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise pregnant women receiving Xarelto to immediately report any bleeding or symptoms of blood loss to their physician [see Warnings and Precautions].

### Pradaxa [^1168ehhz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Inform patients or their caregivers that they may bleed more easily, bleed longer, and should contact their healthcare provider for any signs or symptoms of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Instruct patients or their caregivers**: Seek emergency care immediately if they experience any of the following, which may indicate serious bleeding:
	- Unusual bruising (bruises that appear without a known cause or that get bigger)
	- Pink or brown urine
	- Red or black, tarry stools
	- Coughing up blood
	- Vomiting blood, or vomit resembling coffee grounds

- **Further instruction**: Call their healthcare provider or get prompt medical attention for signs or symptoms of bleeding such as:
	- Pain, swelling, or discomfort in a joint
	- Headaches, dizziness, or weakness
	- Recurring nosebleeds
	- Unusual bleeding from gums
	- Bleeding from a cut that takes a long time to stop
	- Menstrual bleeding or vaginal bleeding that is heavier than normal

If patients have had neuraxial anesthesia or spinal puncture, particularly if taking concomitant NSAIDs or platelet inhibitors, advise them to watch for signs and symptoms of spinal or epidural hematoma. These include back pain, tingling, numbness (especially in the lower limbs), muscle weakness, and stool or urine incontinence. If any such symptoms occur, advise contacting their physician immediately [see Boxed Warning].

### Acquired von Willebrand syndrome: Focused for hematologists [^113RUBMd]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

A 70-year-old man presented to the emergency room of the main Mantua city hospital in northeast Italy with spontaneous gingival bleeding. Apart from mild fatigue and headache, the patient felt well with no bruising or other hemorrhagic symptoms. His medical history was positive for hypertension under satisfactory drug control but negative for a bleeding diathesis. He had undergone an inguinal herniotomy 20 years earlier with no hemorrhagic complications. On physical examination, there was mild cutaneous and conjunctival pallor, blood oozing from the gums, and lymphadenomegaly at superficial stations (maximum diameter, 2 cm).

Blood tests revealed normocytic anemia (hemoglobin 9 g/dL) with normal white cell and platelet counts. Despite a normal prothrombin time, the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was mildly prolonged (ratio, 1.29; normal range, 0.82–1.18), but its full correction with a normal plasma mixing test excluded a coagulation inhibitor. Screening for lupus anticoagulant was also negative. Factor VIII coagulant activity (FVIII:C) was 40% (normal range, 50–150%), von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF:Ag) was 18% (normal range, 50–120%), ristocetin co-factor activity (vWF:RCo) was 29% (normal range, 50–150%), and the collagen binding activity (vWF:CB) was 37% (normal range, 50–150%).

Following the observation of slightly elevated serum proteins (8.8 g/dL; normal range, 6.5–8.0 g/dL), electrophoresis showed increased concentrations in the beta (β) (2.58 g/dL; normal range, 0.6–0.9 g/dL) and gamma (γ) (2.36; normal range, 0.8–1.4 g/dL) regions.

### Why is there variation in test ordering practices for patients presenting to the emergency department with undifferentiated chest pain? A qualitative study [^114gUxgx]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Diagnostic investigations involving laboratory tests aim to increase certainty of the presence or absence of disease, support clinical management, and monitor a patient's trajectory (e.g. during or after treatment). It is estimated that 60%–70% of medical decisions are based on laboratory test results. Evidence shows that some 84% of people admitted to a hospital can expect to have at least one pathology test during their stay, usually within four hours of their admission as an inpatient.

Zhi and colleagues estimated that 45% of laboratory testing in healthcare is underused and 21% overused. Major international initiatives, such as Choosing Wisely, are seeking to reduce the inappropriate use of tests, treatments, and procedures as part of a collaborative effort involving health professionals, consumers, and specialist colleges and societies. The Sensible Test Ordering Practice initiative was developed in Australia to promote consistent and rational diagnostic test ordering practices in acute care settings. It involves the use of traffic light systems (green, amber, or red) to restrict the range of tests that can be ordered depending on the seniority of the clinician — 'green' tests may be ordered by junior doctors, while more complex and expensive tests in 'amber' or 'red' require senior medical staff sign-off. The Australasian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM) and the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia (RCPA) have also developed a set of laboratory testing recommendations for adult patients attending the ED across a range of common presentations.

### Diagnosis and management of mild bleeding disorders [^111ZHhFD]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

Mild bleeding disorders are a common reason for referral to a hematologist, and these conditions can be challenging to evaluate. Recent research has highlighted that some bleeding symptoms are quite common in the general population and that there is clinical variability in symptom expression among individuals with defined bleeding problems. Moreover, bleeding risks for many bleeding disorders are unknown.

This article reviews symptoms and problems that can be considered suspicious of a mild form of bleeding disorder and the diagnostic investigations useful to evaluate these problems. A stepwise approach is presented for the diagnostic evaluation to allow detection of common and rare coagulation and fibrinolytic defects, and adequate assessments of potential von Willebrand factor and platelet problems. Some common problems in the diagnosis and management of mild bleeding problems are reviewed, including the common failure to establish a diagnosis with testing. An approach is proposed for the translation of knowledge to patients who are challenged by mild bleeding problems.

### Simple interventions improve the quality of a missed lab appointment process [^112gtJfH]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2016). Low credibility.

When considering the possible reasons for the system failure, we decided that the process needed to become more patient-centered. An intervention was designed to communicate the importance of having the labs completed to the patient on a more personal level. A number of different ideas were considered, including having the clinician or their allied health staff personally call patients; however, these options did not seem sustainable over time.

The agreed-upon intervention was that each provider would receive a message through our electronic medical record system to advise them that their patient had missed a lab appointment. The provider was prompted to respond to the message and request:

- The lab order be canceled (if deemed to no longer be needed).
- A reminder be sent to the patient, which included the corresponding diagnosis for the lab study.

Reminder letters were sent via the electronic patient portal (an internet or mobile application that allows patients 24-hour access to their care team, electronic medical record, and upcoming appointments) or through the US postal service to patients without a portal account. The letters were structured so that they could easily be personalized by inserting relevant information. If, after 14 days, there was still no response, a second and final letter was sent to the patient.

The intervention was felt to potentially be sustainable for the following reasons:

- There was no extra monetary cost involved.
- A system was already in place that could be modified and improved, specifically for missed lab reports.

### Heparin sodium [^117GpEPy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Inform patients about potential **hemorrhage** risks. They should know it may take longer to stop bleeding and that they may bruise or bleed more easily with heparin. Patients should report any unusual bleeding or bruising to their physician, as hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin, including fatal hemorrhages [see warnings and precautions (5.2)].

Before undergoing **surgery**, advise patients to inform physicians and dentists that they are receiving heparin [see warnings and precautions (5.2)].

Inform patients about the risk of **heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)**. HIT may progress to venous and arterial thromboses, known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). HIT and HITT can occur up to several weeks after discontinuing heparin therapy [see warnings and precautions (5.3)].

Inform patients of the possibility of **hypersensitivity** reactions. Skin necrosis has been reported at subcutaneous injection sites [see warnings and precautions (5.8), adverse reactions (6.1)].

Due to hemorrhage risks, advise patients to inform their physicians and dentists about all **other medications**, including non-prescription drugs, and before starting any new medication [see drug interactions (7.1)].

### Redox control in acute lymphoblastic leukemia: From physiology to pathology and therapeutic opportunities [^111JVk68]. Cells (2021). High credibility.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is associated with a range of clinical features and conditions. Patients may present with increased lymphoid blasts, dyspnea, cranial nerve palsy, and various syndromes such as Down's syndrome, Bloom syndrome, and Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Additionally, symptoms like easy bruising, pancytopenia, hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and fatigue are common.

Leukemia cutis, the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome, and night sweats are also notable symptoms. Conditions like Fanconi anemia, fever, mediastinal mass, and petechiae are observed, along with decreased white blood cell counts, splenomegaly, arthralgia, dizziness, and blurred vision. Long-term exposure to pesticides is a risk factor, and symptoms may include decreased platelet count, bleeding tendency, somnolence, and orbital mass.

Genetic abnormalities such as the TCF3-PBX1 fusion gene, ETV6-RUNX1 fusion gene, and KMT2A rearrangement contribute to the disease profile. Other manifestations include pallor, lethargy, tonsillar enlargement, palpable abdominal mass, and IL3-IGH fusion gene. Headache, pleural effusion, recurrent infections, ataxia-telangiectasia, weight loss, and anemia are frequently reported.

Patients may also experience testicular enlargement, purpura, tumor lysis syndrome, and complications from radiation therapy, such as limb pain. Genetic mutations, including the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, are significant, along with conditions like neurofibromatosis type 1. Additional symptoms include chin numbness and increased white blood cell counts.

These may be signs of hematological toxicity or a more serious uncommon bone marrow problem called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which have been reported in patients treated with Rubraca.

- **Embryo-fetal toxicity**: Advise females to inform their healthcare provider if they are pregnant or become pregnant. Inform female patients of the risk to a fetus and potential loss of the pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for six months after receiving the last dose of Rubraca. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential or who are pregnant to use effective contraception during treatment and for three months after receiving the last dose of Rubraca. Advise male patients not to donate sperm during therapy and for three months following the last dose of Rubraca [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

- **Photosensitivity**: Advise patients to use appropriate sun protection due to the increased susceptibility to sunburn while taking Rubraca.

### Quality improvement in the coagulation laboratory: Reducing the number of insufficient blood draw specimens for coagulation testing [^116dg4Ef]. Laboratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

To report the efforts of our laboratory to reduce quantity-not-sufficient (QNS) specimens, several methods were employed to directly measure the effect of expired collection tubes on the amount of blood that can be drawn. We tracked the number of QNS venous-blood specimens per month received by our coagulation laboratory from March 2008 to December 2012.

- **Interventions**: Communications were developed to inform nurses and phlebotomists on how to avoid drawing QNS specimens. Additionally, floor sweeps were conducted, during which laboratory staff searched for and removed expired vacuum-based blood-collection tubes (VBCTs) from inpatient hospital floors. Furthermore, we assessed 11 healthy donors to determine the amount of blood that could be drawn into expired VBCTs.

During the study period, the rate of QNS specimens dropped from a mean of 0.7% to 0.3%. In expired VBCTs collected from healthy donors, a statistically significant difference was observed in the amount of blood drawn into nonexpired vs expired VBCTs (P < 0.001). Additionally, there was a negative relationship between the number of months that the VBCT had been expired and the amount of blood that could be drawn into the VBCTs (P < 0.001). For every month that VBCTs were expired, the amount of blood drawn decreased by approximately 1.8 mm (0.1 mL), according to linear regression analysis.

Our evidence strongly suggests that expired VBCTs consistently and progressively yield QNS specimens. Methods to reduce blood draws from expired VBCTs may include communications promoting proper blood draw technique and floor sweeps to remove expired VBCTs.

### Diagnosis and management of bleeding disorder in a child [^116giQP4]. Clinical Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Children with symptoms of bleeding and bruising are commonly seen in clinical practice. Primary care providers should be able to decide when and whether evaluation for a bleeding disorder is warranted. This decision depends on one's index of suspicion for bleeding disorders based on history, physical examination, and screening laboratory investigations. Knowledge of hemostatic physiology is essential to order appropriate laboratory investigations and accurately interpret them.

Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and blood platelet concentration constitute the initial diagnostic workup of any bleeding disorder. An abnormality in any of these parameters in a child with excessive bleeding should lead to a presumptive diagnosis of a bleeding disorder and trigger referral to a hematologist for confirmation and definitive treatment. Awareness of basic treatment principles for the management of bleeding/clotting disorders may prepare the provider to develop appropriate management plans, especially in a life-threatening situation.

### Evaluation for bleeding disorders in suspected child abuse [^113frSVG]. Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Bruising or bleeding in a child can raise concerns about child abuse. Assessing whether these findings are due to trauma and/or a bleeding disorder is critical. Many bleeding disorders are rare, and not every child with bruising or bleeding that may raise concerns for abuse requires an evaluation for bleeding disorders. However, in some instances, bleeding disorders can present in a manner similar to child abuse. Bleeding disorders cannot be ruled out solely on the basis of patient and family history, regardless of how extensive that history is.

The history and clinical evaluation can be used to determine the necessity of an evaluation for a possible bleeding disorder. The prevalence and known clinical presentations of individual bleeding disorders can guide the extent of laboratory testing. This clinical report provides guidance to pediatricians and other clinicians regarding the evaluation for bleeding disorders when child abuse is suspected.

### The NSW pathology atlas of variation: Part I-identifying emergency departments with outlying laboratory test-ordering practices [^116TPcPJ]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain and chest pain are leading reasons for emergency department (ED) presentations, with laboratory tests frequently ordered to aid the diagnostic process. This study aims to identify EDs with outlying laboratory ordering practices for patients presenting with undifferentiated abdominal pain and chest pain.

This retrospective observational study analyzed 519,597 patients who presented with abdominal or chest pain at 44 major hospital EDs across New South Wales, Australia, from January 2017 to September 2018. For each condition, the risk-adjusted rate of ordering at least one laboratory test and each of the top 15 ordered tests was evaluated. Funnel plots were used to graph variations in test ordering and identify EDs with outlying test-ordering practices. EDs lying above or below the 99.8% funnel control limits were regarded as outliers.

From 3,360,152 unplanned presentations, abdominal pain and chest pain represented 8.8% (n = 296,809) and 6.6% (n = 222,788) of all cases, respectively. No major outliers were observed for ordering at least one laboratory test; however, variations were observed for individual tests. For abdominal pain, the top three tests with the highest ordering variation included glucose (20 outlier EDs), C-reactive protein (10 outliers), and calcium-magnesium-phosphate (7 outliers). For chest pain, the top three tests with the highest ordering variation were glucose (21 outlier EDs), C-reactive protein (17 outliers), and liver function test (14 outliers).

Identifying EDs with outlying laboratory ordering practices is crucial for understanding resource utilization and potential areas for improvement.

### Lipodystrophy in insulin-treated subjects and other injection-site skin reactions: Are we sure everything is clear [^116D4MqT]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Another original aspect of insulin injection-related skin lesions is bruising at the injection site, as shown in Fig. 1. Bruising is mentioned in several published studies on insulin injections. It is a problematic side-effect of insulin injections, which disturbs diabetic patients due to the resulting blemishes, for which there are as yet no solutions. Unfortunately, in terms of both patient and healthcare provider perspectives, injection-related problems negatively affect the overall number of shots diabetic patients are willing to take. In fact, some studies indicate that one-half of the patients reported mentioning injection-related problems to their healthcare providers who were unable to resolve the associated pain and bruising.

Fig. 1. Two examples of bruising due to insulin injection, in the absence of any antiplatelet and/or anticlotting agents.

In a series of 780 insulin-treated adults with type 2 (n = 556) or type 1 (n = 223) diabetes mellitus on a multiple daily injection regimen (4 shots/day), we identified 46.2% of patients had areas affected by LH, with a mean lesion diameter of 4.8 ± 3.1 cm, but LA was quite uncommon (3.2%) (unpublished data). In this same series, 33.2% of patients showed bruising, either associated with LH (n = 178, 53.9%) or isolated (n = 156, 46.6%), independent of the use of antiplatelet and/or anticlotting drugs (unpublished data).

It is important to note that injection site-related adverse events, such as pain, redness, bruising, and bleeding, are significant barriers to patient adherence to treatment regimens involving multiple daily injections.

### Clinical evaluation of bleeding and bruising in primary care [^116izDRZ]. American Family Physician (2016). High credibility.

Bleeding and bruising are common symptoms in the primary care setting. The patient history can help determine whether the bruising or bleeding is abnormal. The International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis has developed a bleeding assessment tool that can be used to indicate possible pathology. A family history of bleeding problems may suggest a hereditary coagulation defect. Such a history is especially important in children who may not have experienced a major bleeding episode. Medication review can identify pharmacologic causes of the bleeding or bruising. Physical examination findings such as mucocutaneous bleeding suggest that the underlying condition is caused by platelet dysfunction, whereas hemarthroses or hematomas are more common in coagulopathy.

If the history and physical examination findings suggest a bleeding diathesis, initial laboratory testing includes a complete blood count, peripheral blood smear, prothrombin time (PT), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT). A normal PT and PTT indicate a platelet disorder, the most common of which is von Willebrand disease. A normal PT and prolonged PTT signal a deficit in the intrinsic pathway, and a mixing study should be performed. A vitamin K challenge is indicated in patients with an abnormal PT and normal PTT. A workup for liver failure is warranted in patients with prolonged PT and PTT. If initial testing does not reveal an etiology in a patient with a high suspicion for a bleeding disorder, the patient should be referred to a hematologist for additional evaluation.

### Inherited thrombocytopenias: history, advances and perspectives [^114vSVDV]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

In taking account of these advances, the fundamentals for a systematic approach to the diagnosis and management of inherited thrombocytopenia remain largely those expertly outlined in a recent European Hematology Association consensus report on mild and moderate bleeding disorders, to which the reader is directed. In the context of immune thrombocytopenia, a systematic approach includes careful primary tier assessment of the basic clinic-pathological information for each new patient prior to next stage investigations and, if needed, referral to a specialist center.

The recommendations in this European Hematology Association report are very useful in emergency situations and for prevention or control of spontaneous bleeding, such as epistaxis or gum bleeding, and at-risk situations, including dental and surgical procedures or traumatic events when immediate practical decisions must be made.

### Extensive bruising secondary to vitamin C deficiency [^111hUAgZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

An otherwise fit and well 56-year-old man presented with extensive ecchymosis and soft-tissue hematomas affecting his legs. Coagulation studies were normal. Further questioning revealed a severely restricted diet. The bruising improved rapidly after commencing oral vitamin C supplementation, and serum vitamin C level was low, supporting the clinical diagnosis of scurvy.

### Bruising: A neglected, though patient-relevant complication of insulin injections coming to light from a real-life nationwide survey [^116GKWru]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). High credibility.

Another original aspect of this paper was the first clinical evaluation made of skin bruising at the injection sites (Figs. 2 and 3).

- **Insulin injection-induced bruising**: In two subjects, bruising was observed in the abdominal wall on the left and on the arm in the right panel.

- **Bruising at the injection site**: (a, b) Lateral view of a LH nodule coming together with bruising (c), best seen after magnification (d).

Bruising is mentioned in several studies. It is a rather disturbing insulin injection side effect due to the resulting blemishes, for which no solutions have been identified as yet. Unfortunately, in terms of both patient and healthcare provider perspectives, injection-related problems negatively affect the overall number of shots that patients with diabetes are willing to take, so that in some studies, half of the patients reported mentioning such problems to their healthcare providers without getting any solution against the associated pain and bruising. Concerning that, site-related adverse events, including pain, redness, bleeding, and especially bruising, are significant barriers to patient adherence to multiple daily injection regimens. This is particularly important when physicians and/or healthcare providers have insufficient experience or knowledge about specific assistance, or when the doctor–patient relationship is unsatisfactory.

To fill this gap, during the last few years, an interesting exchange of experiences started among patients through various networks, including the American Diabetes Association Community first. These forums enabled patients to propose solutions and share experiences, facilitating a better understanding of how to manage and decrease the impact of bruising associated with insulin injections.

### The diagnosis and management of von Willebrand disease: A United Kingdom Haemophilia Centre Doctors Organization guideline approved by the British Committee for Standards in Haematology [^115WeHtV]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). High credibility.

The diagnostic criteria for von Willebrand disease serve as a clinical tool for identifying patients with this common inherited bleeding disorder. The primary purpose of these criteria is to facilitate accurate diagnosis, thereby enabling appropriate management and treatment strategies for affected individuals.

The diagnostic process involves two key components. The first is a history of significant mucocutaneous bleeding, which is a common symptom in patients with von Willebrand disease. This could include symptoms such as easy bruising, frequent nosebleeds, prolonged bleeding from minor wounds, or heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding in women.

The second component is a laboratory finding of von Willebrand factor activity less than 0.3 units/mL. Von Willebrand factor is a protein that helps blood to clot, and its activity can be measured in a laboratory test. A low level of von Willebrand factor activity is indicative of von Willebrand disease.

The diagnosis of von Willebrand disease is confirmed if both these criteria are met. If either of these criteria is not met, the diagnosis is not confirmed. This binary approach ensures a high degree of specificity in the diagnostic process, reducing the likelihood of false-positive results.

The tool is designed to determine whether an individual meets the diagnostic criteria for von Willebrand disease based on two key clinical inputs:

- **History of significant mucocutaneous bleeding**: This includes easy bruising, frequent nosebleeds, prolonged bleeding from minor wounds, or heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding in women.
- **Laboratory finding of von Willebrand factor activity**: This involves determining if the von Willebrand factor activity level is less than 0.3 units/mL in a laboratory test.

### Heparin sodium [^116rXRpi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Inform patients that it may take them longer than usual to stop bleeding, that they may bruise and/or bleed more easily when they are treated with heparin, and that they should report any unusual bleeding or bruising to their physician. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Prior to surgery**: Advise patients to inform physicians and dentists that they are receiving heparin before any surgery is scheduled [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia**: Inform patients of the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Hypersensitivity**: Inform patients that generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

- **Other medications**: Because of the risk of hemorrhage, advise patients to inform their physicians and dentists of all medications they are taking, including non-prescription medications, and before starting any new medication [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Anagrelide [^111cyueF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patient counseling information includes several key points for those undergoing treatment with anagrelide:

- **Dose**: Patients should be informed that their dosage will be adjusted on a weekly basis until it effectively reduces platelet levels to an appropriate level. This adjustment period will also help patients acclimate to common side effects. They should contact their doctor if they experience any tolerability issues so that the dose or dosing frequency can be modified [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

- **Cardiovascular effects**: Patients should contact a doctor immediately if they experience chest pain, palpitations, or an irregular heartbeat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Risk of pulmonary hypertension**: Patients should seek immediate medical attention if they experience shortness of breath, swelling in legs or ankles, or if their lips and skin turn a bluish color [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Risk of bleeding**: It is crucial to warn patients that concomitant use of aspirin or other medicines affecting blood clotting can increase the risk of bleeding. Patients should immediately contact a doctor if they notice signs or symptoms of bleeding, such as vomiting blood, passing bloody or black stools, or unexplained bruising [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **Lactation**: Patients are advised not to breastfeed during treatment with anagrelide and for one week following the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].

- **Infertility**: Females of reproductive potential should be advised that treatment with anagrelide may impair fertility [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

### Evaluating for suspected child abuse: Conditions that predispose to bleeding [^111ATqoa]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Child abuse might be suspected when children present with cutaneous bruising, intracranial hemorrhage, or other manifestations of bleeding. In these cases, it is necessary to consider medical conditions that predispose to easy bleeding/bruising. When evaluating for the possibility of bleeding disorders and other conditions that predispose to hemorrhage, the pediatrician must consider the child's presenting history, medical history, and physical examination findings before initiating a laboratory investigation.

Many medical conditions can predispose to easy bleeding. Before ordering laboratory tests for a disease, it is useful to understand the biochemical basis and clinical presentation of the disorder, condition prevalence, and test characteristics. This technical report reviews the major medical conditions that predispose to bruising/bleeding and should be considered when evaluating for abusive injury.

### Interpreting bruises at necropsy [^113J7vze]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

The accurate interpretation of bruising at necropsy is essential to understanding how a victim has been injured and assists the pathologist in a reliable reconstruction of the events leading to death. It is essential not only to assess the mechanism of production of a bruise, taking into account the type of impacting surface and the magnitude of force used, but also to estimate when the injury was caused. An account is given of the various methods used in the examination of bruises, particularly with respect to aging, as well as the factors that may affect their appearance. Differentiation from artefacts resulting from postmortem changes is also discussed in some detail.

### Managing snakebite [^114XfTB7]. BMJ (2022). Low credibility.

- **What tests can be performed**: Perform a baseline 20-minute whole blood clotting test (20WBCT) to screen for coagulopathy in patients without overt bleeding. The 20WBCT is a simple, rapid, and inexpensive bedside test to screen for and monitor coagulopathy in areas with limited access to emergency laboratory facilities. Collect a sample of venous blood from the patient and place a few millilitres into a clean dry test tube. Leave it undisturbed for 20 minutes at ambient temperature. Unclotted blood that runs out or a friable clot that readily breaks down on tipping the tube once at 20 minutes indicates a possible clotting disorder.

- **Validation and sensitivity**: Most clinical validation studies on the 20WBCT report a sensitivity of 82–89% and specificity of 82–98%. One study indicated that the test might potentially miss one of every five coagulopathic patients. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of the 20WBCT to evaluate its accuracy in detecting coagulopathy (defined as INR > 1.4 or fibrinogen < 100 mg/dL) revealed an 84% sensitivity and 91% specificity using the international normalised ratio (INR) as reference standard and 72% sensitivity and 94% specificity using plasma fibrinogen as reference standard. The test was less sensitive in detecting milder coagulopathy (median INR for patients with a false negative 20WBCT was 1.9 (IQR 1.6 to 12).

### A good growth in a child with scurvy [^112joYqQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

We report on a 13-month-old boy who experienced pain while mobilizing and had bruising and swelling of the lower limbs. Laboratory examinations revealed anemia, and skeletal X-rays showed irregularity and thickening of the provisional zones of calcification of the lower and upper limbs. The boy had been fed exclusively with goat milk, homogenized meat, fruits, and vegetables, all of which had been boiled together. Forty-eight hours after starting oral vitamin C supplementation, the patient showed dramatic clinical improvement. The clinical presentation, along with laboratory and imaging findings and the good response to vitamin C intake, allowed us to confirm the diagnosis of infantile scurvy.

Scurvy is a disease that can occur among children, especially those with restrictive eating patterns. Fortunately, once diagnosed, scurvy is easily treatable with the administration of vitamin C and a correct diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and fresh meat, all of which contain vitamin C.

### Bruising in infants: Those with a bruise may be abused [^112FD7bN]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

Bruising in young infants is rare. If present, it may be a manifestation of physical child abuse. Early signs of abuse, such as bruising, are often overlooked or their significance goes unrecognized, resulting in poor patient outcomes. In such cases, the opportunity to intervene and potentially prevent repeat injury is lost, placing the child back in harm's way. This brief report presents three cases of non-mobile infants who presented to healthcare providers with bruising before a subsequent fatal or near-fatal event. These cases emphasize the importance of including abusive trauma in the differential diagnosis of an infant with a bruise or a history of easy bruising, and the necessity of initiating a thorough trauma evaluation immediately, alongside any other workup for the causes of bruising in the non-cruising infant.

### Bruising and bleeding in infants and children — a practical approach [^116szxdb]. British Journal of Haematology (2006). Low credibility.

Bruising and bleeding are commonly seen in children and are usually associated with minor injury and trauma. However, in two groups of children, the bruising may be more significant than expected: those with an underlying haemostatic abnormality, such as an inherited bleeding disorder, or those who have been subjected to non-accidental injury (NAI). Diagnosing inherited bleeding disorders in children is fraught with difficulty, from venous access to the interpretation of results; the possibility of NAI should be borne in mind, even in those children with proven significant bleeding disorders when the severity of the injury and the history are non-compatible. This text describes the investigation of the haemostatic system in children with bruising and/or bleeding, with an emphasis on the key haemostatic disorders that need to be excluded.

### Inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy heralding accelerated Chediak-Higashi syndrome [^114CtxCt]. Muscle & Nerve (2017). Low credibility.

Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder (gene CHS1/LYST) characterized by partial albinism, recurrent infections, and easy bruising. Survivors develop a constellation of slowly progressive neurological manifestations.

- **Methods**: We describe clinical, laboratory, electrophysiological, and genetic findings of a patient who developed an immune-mediated demyelinating neuropathy as the main clinical feature of CHS.

- **Results**: The patient presented with subacute flaccid paraparesis, absent reflexes, and reduced vibration sense. Protein and immunoglobulins (Igs) were elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid. Electrodiagnostic tests indicated an acquired chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy. Intravenous Ig and immunosuppressant treatment resulted in neurological improvement. The patient later developed organomegaly and pancytopenia. Bone marrow smear revealed giant azurophilic granules pathognomonic for CHS. Two novel mutations in the LYST gene were identified through whole exome sequencing [c.7786C > T and c.9106+1G > T].

- **Conclusions**: This case expands the clinical phenotype of CHS and highlights inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy as a manifestation of the disease.

### The feasibility and impact of midnight routine blood draws on laboratory orders and processing time [^1153qr6m]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

To evaluate the feasibility of midnight routine blood draws and assess their impact on test result availability and stat laboratory orders, we changed the timing of routine blood draws from early morning to midnight on five inpatient wards during the period November 16 to 30, 2011.

For the entire institution, of all orders placed each day, laboratory test orders placed from 4:00 to 8:00 am decreased from 55% to 39%, and those placed from 12:00 to 4:00 am increased from 12% to 30%. Stat orders per day decreased during the intervention period (301 ± 53 vs 344 ± 55, P = 0.04). Morning specimens were more likely to be available by 9:00 am (78.1% vs 58.9%, P < .001), and their turnaround time improved by 25.8 minutes (158 vs 184 minutes, P < .001). Patient surveys revealed a potential preference for midnight blood draws.

Midnight is a feasible alternative for the timing of routine blood draws. Redesigning the inflow of laboratory orders improved the efficiency of laboratory processing and reduced stat orders.

### How I approach bleeding in hospitalized patients [^114nRFJk]. Blood (2023). High credibility.

A 27-year-old woman presents in a critical situation to the obstetrics service, with heavy vaginal bleeding 9 days after the delivery of a healthy infant. Her initial postpartum course, following a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery at 40 weeks and 1 day, was typical, with an estimated blood loss of < 500 mL. She was discharged on postdelivery day 2 and had normal lochia. She noticed an increase in bleeding over 24 to 48 hours before presentation and, at the time of presentation, was saturating a maxipad every 20 to 30 minutes.

Initial laboratory analysis reveals anemia, with hemoglobin dropping to 6.2 g/dL from 10.8 g/dL on postdelivery day 1, and a slightly prolonged aPTT at 37 seconds. Other coagulation assays, including PT and fibrinogen, are normal. Upon careful history taking, the patient reveals that she did indeed have excessive bleeding in the past, after childhood tonsillectomy, and thinks she might have been diagnosed with von Willebrand disease (VWD). She also notes that her periods have always been heavy, saturating a pad or tampon every 1 to 2 hours on heavy days, and that she has a history of easy bruising and iron deficiency dating back to her teens. This was her first delivery.

Her condition is managed with tranexamic acid (TXA), 1000 mg intravenously, followed by 1300 mg orally every 8 hours, and supportive care while laboratory analysis is performed. She is ultimately diagnosed with VWD per a von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen level of 28%, VWF activity level of 26%, and factor VIII (FVIII) level of 45%.
