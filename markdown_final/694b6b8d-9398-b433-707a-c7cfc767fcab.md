## Question

Ogilvie syndrome recommendations for anxiety/agitation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about recommendations for managing anxiety and agitation in patients with Ogilvie's syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical entities and whether anxiety/agitation are part of Ogilvie's syndrome itself or comorbid phenomena. Then, I should verify the standard-of-care for Ogilvie's syndrome to anchor the management sequence. Next, I will examine evidence-based approaches to anxiety and agitation in the ICU context, since many Ogilvie's patients are hospitalized and may be critically ill. After that, I need to integrate these streams into a practical, stepwise plan and highlight special cautions, including drug–disease interactions and monitoring. Finally, I will state what to do if anxiety/agitation persist despite best practices and note evidence gaps that could change practice in the future.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities so I don't conflate pathophysiology with symptom management. Ogilvie's syndrome, or acute colonic pseudo-obstruction, is a functional colonic dilation without mechanical obstruction, typically in hospitalized, elderly, or comorbid patients, with risk of ischemia and perforation if not decompressed; anxiety and agitation are not defining features of Ogilvie's itself, but they commonly coexist in the same inpatient population and can complicate care, so I need to treat both the pseudo-obstruction and the neuropsychiatric symptoms in parallel rather than assume a causal link [^111VeqGG] [^1141H8C2].

> Next, I should review the standard-of-care for Ogilvie's to anchor sequencing. Supportive measures come first: NPO, nasogastric and rectal decompression, correction of electrolytes and fluids, removal of precipitating drugs, and early mobilization when feasible; if no improvement in 48–72 hours, escalate to neostigmine 2–5 mg IV once, with a second dose if partial response, under cardiac monitoring with atropine available; if neostigmine fails or is contraindicated, proceed to decompressive colonoscopy; if still refractory, consider percutaneous endoscopic cecostomy before surgery, reserving operative intervention for ischemia, perforation, or failure of all other measures [^1141H8C2] [^1167jgXi] [^111VeqGG].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about sedation choices without aligning with ICU best practices for anxiety and agitation. I should confirm that modern ICU guidance favors analgesia-first strategies, light sedation targets, and protocolized reassessment; benzodiazepines are discouraged for routine anxiety or agitation due to delirium risk and lack of benefit signals, while dexmedetomidine is conditionally preferred over propofol when light sedation is desired, and enhanced mobilization is recommended to reduce delirium and improve functional outcomes; melatonin may be considered for sleep and delirium modulation, though heterogeneity limits firm dosing guidance [^111wb4JX] [^112UPLap] [^115iYJ6j] [^113PaDsw] [^116Hs9Vh].

> I need to ensure I'm not overlooking nonpharmacologic foundations for anxiety and agitation in the ICU. Environmental modification, reorientation, communication aids, family presence, and early mobilization are core elements; music therapy has supportive evidence for reducing anxiety and medication requirements in critical care contexts, and should be incorporated when feasible; these strategies often reduce the need for sedatives and can be implemented safely even in patients with abdominal distension if carefully coordinated [^115iYJ6j] [^115D4CUC] [^116C4PgQ].

> Now, I will examine pharmacologic options for anxiety and agitation when nonpharmacologic measures are insufficient, keeping Ogilvie's-specific risks in mind. Wait, let me verify the benzodiazepine signal: guidelines judge the evidence insufficient to recommend benzodiazepines for ICU anxiety, and they carry delirium and respiratory depression risks; if used at all, it should be short-term, lowest effective dose, with close monitoring, and avoided in patients with baseline benzodiazepine dependence unless managing withdrawal; dexmedetomidine is a reasonable alternative for light sedation with less delirium signal, though bradycardia and hypotension must be watched; antipsychotics are not recommended for routine anxiety but may be used short-term for severe agitation posing safety risks, with attention to QTc and extrapyramidal effects [^1123p8hW] [^112UPLap] [^113C6stR].

> But wait, what if the patient has Ogilvie's and is on methylnaltrexone for opioid-induced constipation? I should double-check the label. Methylnaltrexone carries a boxed warning for gastrointestinal perforation and should be avoided in patients with known or suspected GI tract wall compromise, which is precisely the concern in Ogilvie's; if already on it, it should be discontinued promptly in this setting to mitigate perforation risk, and alternative constipation management strategies should be used once the pseudo-obstruction is resolving [^113Ax8jx].

> Let me consider special populations and drug–disease interactions so I don't overgeneralize. Elderly patients with Ogilvie's are at higher risk of anticholinergic burden, falls, and delirium; benzodiazepines and sedating antipsychotics should be minimized, and if antipsychotics are absolutely necessary for safety, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration with daily attempts to taper; in frail patients, enhanced mobilization may require creative adaptations to abdominal distension, but even passive range of motion and frequent repositioning can help reduce delirium risk and anxiety [^115iYJ6j] [^113C6stR].

> I should confirm monitoring priorities to keep the patient safe while treating anxiety and agitation. Continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring is prudent when using dexmedetomidine or antipsychotics, with daily sedation and delirium assessments using validated tools; watch for bradycardia with dexmedetomidine, QTc prolongation with antipsychotics, and respiratory depression with benzodiazepines; reassess the need for sedatives daily and attempt dose reductions as the colonic distension improves and the patient stabilizes [^113PaDsw] [^111wb4JX].

> Next, I should review what to do if anxiety and agitation persist despite these measures. Let me reconsider the differential: untreated pain, hypoxemia, withdrawal syndromes, and delirium are common drivers in ICU patients with Ogilvie's; a focused search for and treatment of these contributors often resolves agitation without escalating sedatives; if anxiety remains functionally impairing after addressing modifiable factors, a time-limited, carefully monitored trial of a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic such as buspirone may be considered off-label, recognizing the evidence base is limited and that serotonergic interactions must be screened [^116C4PgQ] [^113yzmtb].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan is explicit and actionable. For a patient with Ogilvie's and concurrent anxiety or agitation, I would: 1) treat the pseudo-obstruction per guideline sequence with supportive care, neostigmine, colonoscopic decompression, and PEC if refractory; 2) implement nonpharmacologic anxiety/agitation strategies including environmental optimization, communication tools, family engagement, and mobilization as tolerated; 3) avoid routine benzodiazepines and methylnaltrexone; 4) if pharmacologic sedation is required, prefer dexmedetomidine for light sedation with hemodynamic monitoring, reserving short-course antipsychotics only for severe agitation with safety risk; 5) reassess daily and de-escalate sedatives as the colonic condition improves; 6) address reversible contributors such as pain, hypoxemia, and withdrawal; and 7) document rationale and monitor for adverse effects throughout, adjusting the plan based on patient response and evolving evidence [^1141H8C2] [^111wb4JX] [^112UPLap] [^113Ax8jx].

There is **no direct evidence** on managing anxiety or agitation in Ogilvie's syndrome, so care should follow general critical care principles: prioritize nonpharmacologic measures (reorientation, environmental modification, family presence, early mobilization) [^115iYJ6j] and use the lowest effective dose of sedatives only when necessary [^113PaDsw]. Benzodiazepines are **not recommended** for routine anxiety or agitation in ICU patients due to delirium risk [^113PaDsw]; if sedation is required, dexmedetomidine is preferred over propofol for light sedation because it reduces delirium and agitation without respiratory depression [^112UPLap] [^1122P269]. Antipsychotics may be used short-term for severe agitation or delirium when nonpharmacologic measures fail, with close monitoring for adverse effects [^113C6stR]. Always address underlying causes (pain, hypoxia, electrolyte disturbances, medications) and reassess frequently to minimize sedation exposure [^116C4PgQ].

---

## Pathophysiological considerations

Ogilvie's syndrome is characterized by **colonic dysmotility** and distension without mechanical obstruction, often triggered by surgery, trauma, infection, or metabolic derangements [^111VeqGG]. Anxiety and agitation are common in critically ill patients and may be exacerbated by pain, discomfort, and the hospital environment [^116C4PgQ]. Effective management requires addressing both the underlying pseudo-obstruction and the neuropsychiatric symptoms.

---

## Nonpharmacologic interventions

Nonpharmacologic strategies are **first-line** for anxiety and agitation in critically ill patients, including those with Ogilvie's syndrome:

- **Environmental modifications**: Reduce noise, optimize lighting, and provide familiar objects to create a calming environment [^1151nVVk].

- **Reorientation and communication**: Regularly orient the patient, explain procedures, and use clear communication to reduce anxiety [^1132j2Jx].

- **Family presence**: Encourage family visitation to provide emotional support and reduce anxiety [^notfound].

- **Early mobilization**: Mobilize patients as soon as clinically feasible to reduce anxiety, agitation, and delirium [^115iYJ6j].

---

## Pharmacologic interventions

Pharmacologic therapy should be reserved for cases where **nonpharmacologic measures are insufficient**. The choice of agents must consider the patient's respiratory status, hemodynamics, and risk of delirium:

| **Medication class** | **Recommended use** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Benzodiazepines | Not recommended for routine use due to delirium risk [^1112UMPE] | - High risk of delirium <br/> - Respiratory depression <br/> - Prolonged sedation [^113PaDsw] |
| Dexmedetomidine | Preferred agent for light sedation in ICU patients [^112UPLap] | - Reduces delirium <br/> - Minimal respiratory depression <br/> - Anxiolytic properties [^1122P269] |
| Propofol | Alternative sedative for deep sedation or rapid control of severe agitation | - Rapid onset <br/> - Short half-life <br/> - Risk of hypotension and respiratory depression [^116zsNJU] |
| Antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol, quetiapine) | Short-term use for severe agitation or delirium unresponsive to other measures [^113C6stR] | - Effective for agitation <br/> - Risk of extrapyramidal symptoms <br/> - QT prolongation <br/> - Metabolic effects [^11649cwj] |

---

## Special considerations in Ogilvie's syndrome

Patients with Ogilvie's syndrome require **careful monitoring** and individualized management:

- **Gastrointestinal distension**: Avoid medications that exacerbate gastrointestinal distension or delay motility.

- **Electrolyte imbalances**: Correct electrolyte disturbances, as they can contribute to anxiety and agitation [^1141H8C2].

- **Pain management**: Adequately treat pain, as it is a common contributor to anxiety and agitation [^116C4PgQ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current ICU guidelines emphasize **minimizing sedation**, using protocolized approaches, and prioritizing nonpharmacologic interventions [^113PaDsw]. Benzodiazepines are not recommended for routine anxiety or agitation management due to their association with delirium and prolonged mechanical ventilation [^1112UMPE]. Dexmedetomidine is recommended as the preferred sedative for light sedation in ICU patients, including those with anxiety and agitation [^112UPLap].

---

## Monitoring and reassessment

Continuous monitoring and regular reassessment are essential to ensure **effective management** of anxiety and agitation. Use validated assessment tools (e.g. Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale, Confusion Assessment Method for ICU) to guide therapy and adjust interventions as needed [^113PaDsw].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

There is **no direct evidence** on managing anxiety and agitation in Ogilvie's syndrome; therefore, management should follow general critical care principles. Prioritize nonpharmacologic interventions, use the lowest effective dose of sedatives only when necessary, and prefer dexmedetomidine for light sedation. Continuously monitor and reassess the patient, addressing underlying causes and adjusting therapy as needed.

Sedation strategy research gaps — adult ICU: Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations should be incorporated in both sedative choice and delivery methods; benzodiazepine medications still form the mainstay of therapy in resource-poor areas and their risks and benefits need study in the context of cost; with increased propofol use, strategies to detect propofol-related infusion syndrome earlier are required and large-scale registry studies to characterize its prevalence and risks should be undertaken; and the role of nonpharmacologic strategies to reduce agitation, anxiety, and distress in terms of sedative choice and requirements is uncertain, and thus, no recommendations could be made in this regard.

Clinical Question Which medications are effective at decreasing agitation in patients with dementia. Evidence-Based Answer Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and risperidone are moderately effective at decreasing agitation in all types of dementia. Olanzapine and risperidone reduce dementia-related agitation much longer than placebo. Dextromethorphan/quinidine may be effective at reducing agitation in patients with dementia.

1. 1 The primary outcome was a 50% reduction in baseline agitation at eight weeks. Twenty individual medications and one combination medication were included in the analyses. Risperidone and SSRIs as a class were more effective than placebo, although no individual SSRI reached statistical significance. 3 The interventions were equally effective in treating agitation in patients with Alzheimer-type dementia and citalopram was associated with fewer adverse outcomes than quetiapine and olanzapine. The NPI scale assesses 12 items, each with a score of 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating worsening agitation. Recommendations from Others The American Psychiatric Association supports the use of nonemergency antipsychotic treatment for behavioral/psychological symptoms of dementia after assessing for pain and exhausting nonpharmacologic options, and when symptoms are severe, dangerous, or cause significant distress to the patient. They recommend starting at a low dosage and discontinuing therapy for severe adverse effects or lack of improvement at four weeks.

Even if treatment is effective, an attempt to taper should be made at four months. 5 Copyright © Family Physicians Inquiries Network. Used with permission.

### Psychotropic drug treatment for agitated behaviour in dementia: what if the guideline prescribing recommendations are not sufficient? A qualitative study [^113mXEpE]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Through qualitative exploration, we provided an extensive overview of physicians' considerations when deciding on PD treatment outside the guideline prescribing recommendations for agitated behaviour in dementia. These considerations give us a better understanding of how physicians deviate from the guideline when treatment according to the guideline prescribing recommendations is not sufficient.

Recommendations

We recommend further research into the efficacy of PD treatment in patients with agitated behaviour in dementia, when treated according to a hypothesis of underlying (psychiatric) cause(s) and guideline prescribing recommendations are not sufficient. We suggest to systematically collect and describe cases where this occurs. In addition, we recommend considering less stringent diagnostic criteria for underlying psychiatric disorders of agitated behaviour in dementia (i.e. anxiety and mood disorders), so that medication recommendations from psychiatric guidelines can be used.

Benzodiazepines for anxiety in adult ICU patients — Recommendation 1 states: "There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on the use of benzodiazepines to treat anxiety in adult patients admitted to the ICU", and the panel adds, "Due to a lack of evidence, the panel cannot currently make a recommendation regarding the use of benzodiazepines for the treatment of anxiety in ICU patients", noting that "no studies directly answered our PICO with the exception of one before-and-after cohort study conducted in burn patients which presented limited evidence". Special considerations report that "Severe anxiety is experienced by more than one quarter of intubated patients 6 hours after the interruption of midazolam or propofol, while ten of 16 patients reported anxiety about the endotracheal tube at hospital discharge regardless of sedation", and caution that "abrupt cessation of benzodiazepines prescribed for baseline chronic anxiety may precipitate acute withdrawal; hence, continuation of the chronic benzodiazepines upon admission to the ICU should be considered".

ICU anxiety, agitation/sedation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption — focused guideline update provides conditional directives for adult ICU care as follows: In adult patients admitted to the ICU, the task force issued conditional recommendations to use dexmedetomidine over propofol for sedation, provide enhanced mobilization/rehabilitation over usual mobilization/rehabilitation, and administer melatonin. The task force was unable to issue recommendations on the administration of benzodiazepines to treat anxiety, and the use of antipsychotics to treat delirium. These recommendations are intended for consideration along with the patient's clinical status.

Dexmedetomidine — special considerations highlight that costs and availability vary and thus the recommendation is conditional rather than strong, and there is no definitive evidence of age-related heterogeneity; external rapid practice guidelines recommended dexmedetomidine over other sedation medications when valuing delirium reduction over hypotension and bradycardia and did not recommend avoiding use under age 65, leaving it to practitioner discretion.

ICU enhanced mobilization/rehabilitation — compared with usual care — reduced ICU-acquired weakness (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.64–0.93; ARR, 9 fewer per 100 patients; 95% CI, 14 fewer to 3 fewer; high certainty) in a final evidence base of 58 RCTs and 8038 patients, and may slightly reduce the duration of delirium (MD, −1.34 d; 95% CI, −1.85 to −0.83 d), invasive mechanical ventilation (MD, −1.1 d; 95% CI, −1.69 to −0.51 d), ICU length of stay (MD, −1.01 d; 95% CI, −1.75 to −0.27 d), and hospital length of stay (MD, −1.16 d; 95% CI, −2.94 to −0.62 d). Enhanced mobilization/rehabilitation probably improves functional outcomes and quality of life after discharge and may increase the number of patients discharged home (RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.00–1.33). There was little to no effect on mortality at longest follow-up, and there is uncertainty surrounding effects on delirium occurrence and ICU mortality. Adverse events may slightly increase for arrhythmias (RR, 2.27; 95% CI, 0.73–7.08; ARI, one more per 100; 95% CI, 0 fewer to 3 more) but likely show little to no difference for accidental line removal (RR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.25–6.58; ARI, 0 fewer per 100; 95% CI, from 0 fewer to 1 more), unplanned extubation (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.49–1.75; ARI, 0 fewer per 100; 95% CI, from 0 fewer to 1 more), and hypotension (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.47–3.75; ARI, 1 more per 100, 95% CI, from 2 fewer to 9 more). The evidence suggests that the benefits in adult ICU patients outweigh the marginally increased risk, and "the panel issued a conditional recommendation"; because "there was insufficient data to perform a subgroup analysis of post-cardiac surgery patients", "this recommendation applies to the general medical-surgical patients".

Conclusion

While most patients with ACPO are managed successfully with conventional measures, a subset remains therapeutically challenging. This shows the importance of raising awareness of the entire scope of management options, especially with the increasing numbers of frail octogenarians and nonagenarians. The availability of guideline resources now offers comprehensive guidance for informed decision-making and the procedural aspects.

The results of our experience are in line with previous reports and suggest that PEC may become a very useful tool in the armamentarium of modalities utilized to treat ACPO. Albeit certainly not devoid of adverse events, it offers an alternative for selected patients who would otherwise linger through repeated hospitalizations, multiple decompressive colonoscopies, and for whom surgery represents a disproportionate risk. Nonetheless, large and prospective trials are required in order to truly quantify advantages, if any, over existing treatment strategies, especially in terms of efficacy and safety.

Rationale

Critically ill adults are at risk for a variety of distressing and consequential symptoms both during and after an ICU stay. Management of these symptoms can directly influence outcomes.

Objectives

The objective was to update and expand the Society of Critical Care Medicine's 2018 Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Prevention and Management of Pain, Agitation/Sedation, Delirium, Immobility, and Sleep Disruption in Adult Patients in the ICU.

Panel Design

The interprofessional inclusive guidelines task force was composed of 24 individuals including nurses, physicians, pharmacists, physiotherapists, psychologists, and ICU survivors. The task force developed evidence-based recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Conflict-of-interest policies were strictly followed in all phases of the guidelines, including task force selection and voting.

Methods

The task force focused on five main content areas as they pertain to adult ICU patients: anxiety (new topic), agitation/sedation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption. Using the GRADE approach, we conducted a rigorous systematic review for each population, intervention, control, and outcome question to identify the best available evidence, statistically summarized the evidence, assessed the quality of evidence, and then performed the evidence-to-decision framework to formulate recommendations.

Results

The task force issued five statements related to the management of anxiety, agitation/sedation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption in adults admitted to the ICU. In adult patients admitted to the ICU, the task force issued conditional recommendations to use dexmedetomidine over propofol for sedation, provide enhanced mobilization/rehabilitation over usual mobilization/rehabilitation, and administer melatonin. The task force was unable to issue recommendations on the administration of benzodiazepines to treat anxiety, and the use of antipsychotics to treat delirium.

Conclusions

The guidelines task force provided recommendations for pharmacologic management of agitation/sedation and sleep, and nonpharmacologic management of immobility in critically ill adults. These recommendations are intended for consideration along with the patient's clinical status.

Nonoperative methods of colonic decompression are generally recommended in patients who have failed supportive measures, are not candidates for conservative management, or in whom neostigmine is contraindicated or ineffective. Notably, as there are no prospective head-to-head trials between decompressive colonoscopy and neostigmine therapy, no recommendation can be made for the superiority of one of these options; the choice of treatment strategy should also depend on local expertise and situation, e.g. access to urgent colonoscopy. Nonetheless, prompt endoscopic decompression by means of colonoscopic desufflation is recommended in cecal diameter > 12 cm or if the syndrome exists longer than 4–6 days. The risk of ACPO recurrence after successful decompression varies widely in the literature, ranging from 0 to 50%, and repeated endoscopic decompressions with colonic tube placement as an alternative may be considered in these cases.

Patients that are refractory to pharmacologic and endoscopic decompression, especially those not amenable to surgical intervention due to an increased perioperative risk, should be considered for PEC. The necessary steps include good bowel cleansing, use of sedation, disinfection of the abdominal wall, transillumination, and fixation of the colon to the abdominal wall. As mortality rates are substantial in ACPO patients requiring surgical interventions, all efforts should be made to manage this patient population nonoperatively. Surgery is the most appropriate step in cases complicated by peritonitis, colonic ischemia, and/or perforation or when all other options fail, and it includes surgically placed cecostomy tube, colostomy, or subtotal colectomy.

Current guidelines

Guidelines concerning ACPO and covering the role of endoscopy were recently published by the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE), the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE), and the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS), all within the last 2 years. Figure 6 outlines the recommended treatment algorithm.

Fig. 6
Recommended treatment algorithm in patients with ACPO (adapted according to). ACPO acute colonic pseudo-obstruction, NPO nil per os, PEG polyethylene glycol, PEC percutaneous endoscopic cecostomy. No recommendation can be made for the superiority of neostigmine or decompressive colonoscopy as better initial therapy at the time; the choice of treatment strategy should also depend on local expertise and situation

Baseline laboratory analysis, including complete blood count, metabolic panel, and thyroid hormones, should be performed during the initial evaluation to look for predisposing and treatable causes. Supportive care remains the first-line therapy in patients with uncomplicated course, i.e. absence of ischemia or peritonitis and cecal diameter < 12 cm. It comprises maintaining the patient with nil per os, fluid resuscitation, correcting electrolytes, nasogastric or rectal tube insertion, ambulation, treatment of underlying disease, and avoidance of culprit medication. The pharmacologic agent of choice is neostigmine, a short-acting cholinesterase inhibitor, and it is indicated in patients in whom symptoms persist beyond 48–72 h despite supportive care. Contraindications to its use include evidence of intestinal or urinary obstruction and cardiopulmonary monitoring with immediate access to atropine in the event of bradycardia is recommended. Neostigmine is typically administered intravenously in a single bolus of 2–5 mg, with a second dose reserved for initial non-responders or partial responders. However, a consensus on dosing does not exist and routes of administration vary.

Sedation priorities include the role of dexmedetomidine in alcohol withdrawal; the role of sedative medications in an analgesia-first approach or to supplement analgesia-sedation; studies evaluating the value of patient communication with family members during ICU care and patient perceptions while on propofol vs. dexmedetomidine; the role of dexmedetomidine in patients requiring deep sedation; and RCTs addressing possible heterogeneity of dexmedetomidine treatment effect by age (over or under 65 yr old). Delirium priorities include RCTs examining the use of an antipsychotic in hypoactive delirium, hyperactive delirium, and other subtypes; RCTs examining long-term cognitive effects of antipsychotics in ICU patients with delirium; and RCTs examining the use of antipsychotics in progressive delirium severities.

Adult ICU delirium — antipsychotic agents: Panel members judged that the undesirable consequences of using either haloperidol or an atypical antipsychotic far outweighed potential benefits and issued a conditional recommendation against their routine use, while recognizing that patients who experience significant distress (e.g., anxiety, fearfulness, hallucinations, delusions) or who may be physically harmful to self/others may benefit from short-term use until distressing symptoms resolve; patients started on antipsychotics in the ICU often remain on them unnecessarily after discharge, and continued exposure can result in significant morbidity and financial cost.

Agitation and sedation in critically ill adults — sedatives are frequently administered to relieve anxiety, reduce the stress of being mechanically ventilated, and prevent agitation-related harm; if a sedative is needed, the patient's current sedation status should be assessed and then frequently reassessed using valid and reliable scales; in critically ill patients, unpredictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics secondary to drug interactions, organ dysfunction, inconsistent absorption and protein binding, hemodynamic instability, and drug accumulation can lead to adverse events; the 2013 guidelines suggested targeting light levels of sedation or using daily awakening trials and minimizing benzodiazepines to improve short-term outcomes such as duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU LOS; sedation delivery paradigms and the specific sedative medication used can impact post-ICU outcomes including 90-day mortality, physical functioning, neurocognitive, and psychologic outcomes.

### Guidelines for managing substance withdrawal in jails [^113yxytL]. BJA/NIC (2023). High credibility.

ASAM/AAAP stimulant withdrawal — medication, psychosis, agitation, benzodiazepine, and depression guidance states: No medications have been proven effective for the treatment of withdrawal from stimulants; however, it may be appropriate to use medications to relieve symptoms during the period of the withdrawal syndrome, and the use of medications should be limited to short-term treatment of withdrawal symptoms and to treat accurately and appropriately diagnosed comorbid conditions. If psychosis (beyond mild paranoia) manifests during stimulant withdrawal, it should be treated; care should be managed in consultation with a qualified mental health care professional, antipsychotic medication may be required, and if psychosis persists or is severe, an immediate assessment by a physician experienced in differential diagnosis and management of acute changes in mental status is indicated, with general psychosis management and treatment principles applied. Patients experiencing agitation that does not immediately respond to behavioral management strategies should receive an immediate medical evaluation; medications for sedation (typically benzodiazepines) may be necessary, patients whose agitation is not adequately treated with oral medication should be transferred to a hospital setting, and if medications are not available onsite to manage significant agitation, custody staff should transfer the patient to a medical setting where medications can be provided. Benzodiazepines should be avoided unless required for concomitant alcohol or sedative detoxification, or severe agitation as discussed in the preceding recommendation. While depression is common during stimulant withdrawal, it is often secondary and may not constitute a primary diagnosis, so the patient should be monitored to determine if symptoms improve as the withdrawal syndrome improves; if symptoms do not improve, it is appropriate to initiate evidence-based depression treatment, and if there is a history of depressive disorder, it may be appropriate to initiate antidepressant medication sooner.

### Diazepam (Valium) [^117GJXXv]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS

Valium is indicated for the management of anxiety disorders or for the short-term relief of the symptoms of anxiety. Anxiety or tension associated with the stress of everyday life usually does not require treatment with an anxiolytic.

In acute alcohol withdrawal, Valium may be useful in the symptomatic relief of acute agitation, tremor, impending or acute delirium tremens and hallucinosis.

Valium is a useful adjunct for the relief of skeletal muscle spasm due to reflex spasm to local pathology (such as inflammation of the muscles or joints, or secondary to trauma), spasticity caused by upper motor neuron disorders (such as cerebral palsy and paraplegia), athetosis, and stiff-man syndrome.

Oral Valium may be used adjunctively in convulsive disorders, although it has not proved useful as the sole therapy.

The effectiveness of Valium in long-term use, that is, more than 4 months, has not been assessed by systematic clinical studies. The physician should periodically reassess the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.

### Clinical review: agitation and delirium in the critically ill – significance and management [^111PeZhh]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Agitation is a psychomotor disturbance characterized by a marked increase in motor and psychological activity in a patient. It occurs very frequently in the intensive care setting. It may be isolated, or accompanied by other mental disorders, such as severe anxiety and delirium. Frequently, agitation is a sign of brain dysfunction and, as such, may have adverse consequences, for at least two reasons. First, agitation can interfere with the patient's care and second, there is evidence demonstrating that the prognosis of agitated (and delirious) patients is worse than that of non-agitated (non-delirious) patients. These conditions are often under-diagnosed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Consequently, a systematic evaluation of this problem in ICU patients should be conducted. Excellent tools are presently available for this purpose. Treatment, including prevention, must be undertaken without delay, and the ICU physician should follow logical, strict and systematic rules when applying therapy.

### Percutaneous endoscopic cecostomy for management of ogilvie's syndrome: a case series and literature review with an update on current guidelines (with video) [^113bp5TS]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Management of patients with ACPO is challenging, with the goal of maximal mitigation of symptoms and prevention of potential adverse events associated with the condition. The effectiveness of pharmacologic and endoscopic therapy has reduced the need for surgery to cases complicated by colonic ischemia, perforation, or colonic dilatation otherwise refractory to nonoperative options. The method of PEC serves as an important alternative especially in patients that are unfit for surgery. The procedure has evolved from the method of PEG and was first described in 1986. Nonetheless, its widespread use has been limited with scarce literature regarding technique, efficacy and safety, seldom indications, and a lack of awareness among physicians.

In general, studies on PEC are sparse and data collection is retrospective. Based on a recent systematic review by Khayyat on therapeutic utility of PEC in adults, the existing evidence is heterogeneous and consists mainly of case reports and case series. Up until 2020 the dedicated guideline resource on PEC placement had been the recommendations by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence published in 2006. However, according to the evidence used to support this guidance, the literature review was limited to one case series and three case reports. Several more studies reported data regarding PEC in various indications since then, however, the total number of patients with ACPO remains relatively low. Baraza and colleagues performed 35 PECs in 33 patients, of whom 4 had recurrent ACPO and were considered poor surgical candidates. Symptoms resolved in 26 patients (74%), including 3 of the 4 with ACPO. Major adverse events occurred in 4 patients (3 had peritonitis secondary to fecal contamination; 1 patient died). Another study by Lynch and colleagues reported data on PEC placement in 8 patients: 6 for ACPO and 2 for chronic constipation. Seven of the 8 cases were successful and resulted in clinical improvement, 1 patient required surgical removal of the PEC tube for fecal spillage resulting in peritonitis. Cowlam and colleagues reported their experience with an improvement in symptoms in 81% of 31 patients treated with PEC, including 5 patients with ACPO. Nonetheless, 3 of these 5 patients had to have the tube removed because of infection and 1 patient died from fecal peritonitis. Similar outcomes were reported by other authors.

### Guidelines on management of cyclic vomiting syndrome in adults by the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society and the Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome Association [^112CjRwo]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

5.6 Treatment of CVS in the emergency department

The present review evaluates the evidence for effectiveness of different drugs used in the acute care setting. The review demonstrates the paucity of Grade I evidence for the effectiveness of any one drug. It is possible that some of these drugs are more effective when used sequentially or in combination. 2, 75, 78 The literature is largely silent on the effectiveness of sequential drug regimens, combinations of drugs, or process improvement implicit in the use of treatment guidelines, order sets, or expedited treatment programs which have proven so useful in the treatment of asthma, myocardial infarction, and stroke. 93, 94, 95

Given the intrinsic inherent variation in a clinically defined entity, it is very likely that the response to individual medications will be heterogenous although possible that single drugs will work best for a well‐defined subgroup. It is likely that a combination of drugs will continue to be the preferred approach for the treatment of most of these patients. For this broad group, a combination of anti‐emetics, analgesics, and sedation are likely to be effective for symptomatic relief of rescue therapy. 96, 97 Discussions with neurologists in the drafting of this review indicated that the improper administration of nasal triptans may account for their seeming ineffectiveness. 66 A "head forward" technique vastly improves drug delivery to anteriorly placed nasal receptors. As in asthma, patient education should be included as part of the treatment approach. For patients where anxiety is a prominent feature, a medication protocol that uses anxiolytic and sedative drugs may be more effective. There is very limited data on the use of benzodiazepines in cyclic vomiting syndrome. That said they can very helpful in the short term to reduce anxiety and somatic symptoms in the setting of a vomiting episode in the emergency department or an acute care setting. The dilemma is that these medications while effective and should only be used short term tend to be used long‐term. The risks with long‐term use include tolerance, dependence, and abuse. A recent report from the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics shows that from 2011 to 2016, benzodiazepines were among the 10 most frequently cited drugs in overdose deaths. 98 Thus, for any condition where anxiety plays a pivotal role, a focused evaluation should be conducted and the medication treatment of choice, antidepressants, be considered along with cognitive behavioral treatment of any underlying anxiety disorder.

### Percutaneous endoscopic cecostomy for management of ogilvie's syndrome: a case series and literature review with an update on current guidelines (with video) [^111VeqGG]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (ACPO), more commonly known as Ogilvie's syndrome, refers to pathologic dilatation of the colon without underlying mechanical obstruction. It occurs primarily in elderly, hospitalized, or institutionalized patients with comorbid conditions, infection, metabolic imbalance, or who are recovering from surgery or trauma (Table 1). The precise pathogenesis is unknown, but evidence suggests an alteration in the autonomic nervous system resulting in colonic atony. A United States-based retrospective cohort study estimated the incidence of ACPO to approximately 100 cases of 100,000 hospital admissions per year. The main clinical features include acute massive abdominal distention and pain along with nausea, vomiting, and altered bowel function. The diagnosis is established by abdominal imaging using computed tomography (CT) or water-soluble contrast enema, showing colonic dilatation without evidence of mechanical obstruction.

Table 1
Main conditions associated with Ogilvie's syndrome (according to)

The goal of management is to decompress the distended colon to minimize the risk of mural ischemia and colonic perforation, both associated with high mortality. Supportive measures remain the first-line step and include identification and discontinuation of precipitating factors (e.g. medication), correcting fluid and electrolyte disturbances, maintaining patients with nil per os, decompressing the GI tract by nasogastric or rectal tubes, and frequent position changes. In case the condition is not improving with supportive care, both medical therapy with neostigmine and decompressive colonoscopy are considered valid options.

In patients with ACPO in whom supportive, pharmacologic, and conventional endoscopic therapies fail, percutaneous endoscopic cecostomy/colostomy (PEC) may be considered before proceeding with surgical interventions. The method was first described by Ponsky and colleagues (1986) as an alternative to surgically or radiographically placed colostomy in two patients who were unsuccessfully treated with decompressive colonoscopy. Since then, it has been gradually extending into practice, although its widespread use has been limited. Successful utilization of PEC requires local familiarity with the method, cautious indication, available expertise, and multidisciplinary support. However, our experience indicates that treating physicians and/or endoscopists are generally not acquainted with the procedure, perhaps because of its rarity due to the few defined indications, infrequent occurrence in the literature, and a relative paucity of guideline resources given the fact that major endoscopic and surgical societies published applicable recommendations just recently.

### Hyperactive delirium with severe agitation [^111P9mgz]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyperactive delirium with severe agitation is a clinical syndrome of altered mental status, psychomotor agitation, and a hyperadrenergic state. The underlying pathophysiology is variable and often results from sympathomimetic abuse, psychiatric disease, sedative-hypnotic withdrawal, and metabolic derangement. Patients can go from a combative state to periarrest with little warning. Safety of the patient and of the medical providers is paramount and the emergency department should be prepared to manage these patients with adequate staffing, restraints, and pharmacologic sedatives. Treatment with benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, or ketamine is recommended, followed by airway protection, supportive measures, and cooling of hyperthermia.

### Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome: consensus panel recommendations for clinical management and additional research [^115KGUcD]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Currently, no evidence-based guidelines exist for the management of serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) discontinuation syndrome. This article summarizes recommendations with respect to future research as well as clinical management recommendations for SRI discontinuation syndrome.

Participants

In April 2004, a panel of physicians convened in New York City to discuss recommendations for clinical management of and additional research on SRI discontinuation syndrome.

Evidence

Previous guidance for management of SRI discontinuation syndrome was proposed in 1997 in a consensus meeting also chaired by Alan F. Schatzberg. A literature search of the PubMed database was conducted to identify articles on SRI discontinuation syndrome that have been published since 1997.

Consensus Process

The 2004 panel reviewed important preclinical and clinical studies, discussed prospective investigation of this syndrome in clinical trials, and suggested the establishment of a research network to collect data in naturalistic settings. The panel also reviewed the management recommendations published in 1997 and subsequently updated the recommendations, taking into account the latest clinical data as well as the personal experience of its members with patients.

Conclusions

Additional preclinical and clinical studies are necessary to further elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms of SRI discontinuation syndrome and to identify the patient populations and agents that are most affected by this phenomenon. Management strategies include gradual tapering of doses and should emphasize clinical monitoring and patient education.

These British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines cover the range and aims of treatment for anxiety disorders. They are based explicitly on the available evidence and are presented as recommendations to aid clinical decision making in primary and secondary medical care. They may also serve as a source of information for patients and their carers. The recommendations are presented together with a more detailed review of the available evidence. A consensus meeting involving experts in anxiety disorders reviewed the main subject areas and considered the strength of evidence and its clinical implications. The guidelines were constructed after extensive feedback from participants and interested parties. The strength of supporting evidence for recommendations was rated. The guidelines cover the diagnosis of anxiety disorders and key steps in clinical management, including acute treatment, relapse prevention and approaches for patients who do not respond to first-line treatments.

The procedures were conducted with the patient lying supine and under general anesthesia in case 1, whereas cases 2 and 3 involved conscious sedation utilizing titrated doses of midazolam, with the active participation of two operators. All three cases were managed by a consistent team of two skilled advanced endoscopists. Refer to Video 1 (Online Supplementary Material), which offers a detailed demonstration of all procedural aspects from both endoscopic and external viewpoints. First, a standard adult colonoscope was advanced into the right colon with transillumination of the abdominal wall to identify a suitable puncture site (Fig. 1). Notably, appropriate attention was devoted to keep CO 2 insufflation at minimum to avoid the risk of perforation of the already distended colon. Following intubation of the cecum, the adjacent lumen was cleansed to remove fecal material. The proper position was confirmed by an indentation of the cecum with direct digital pressure on the abdominal wall. The abdominal wall was then prepared with betadine solution, anesthetized (1% trimecaine), and draped in a sterile fashion. The contents of a standard, commercially available PEG kits with 24F tubes and an anchor suture system (PEG-24-PULL-I-S and Cope Gastrointestinal Suture Anchor Set, Cook, Inc. Bloomington, IN, USA) were subsequently used. Provided that sufficient transillumination was achieved, a dedicated kit needle preloaded with the anchor system was introduced through the abdominal wall into the cecum. An intracolic position was confirmed by direct visualization and aspiration of air into a syringe. A stylet wire was then passed through the needle, advancing a T-anchor into the colon. The wire and needle were then removed, and the colon apposed anteriorly to the abdominal wall by gentle traction on the anchor suture. The cecum was gradually fixated using a total of three T-anchors in a triangular configuration approximately 3 cm apart (Fig. 2). The center of the cecopexy site was then punctured with a 19-gauge Seldinger needle. A traction wire was passed through the needle, grasped by a snare, and then withdrawn from the colon along with the colonoscope. The remainder of the procedure was analogical as for the insertion of PEG using the pull technique, with the tube slowly trailed through the anus, colon, and abdominal wall. The correct position was confirmed by reinsertion of the colonoscope (Fig. 3). Simultaneously, the wound site was covered with sterile dressing, and the tube was fastened by an external bumper. The T-anchors were removed 1–2 weeks later.

Protocol-based analgesia/analgosedation programs — pooled analysis suggests that a protocol-based pain and sedation assessment management program with usual care does not affect the incidence of nosocomial infection, constipation, hypotension, bradycardia, or opioid exposure, but does reduce sedative requirements (SMD, −0.57; 95% CI, −0.84 to −0.31; low quality), duration of mechanical ventilation (MD, −1.26 d; 95% CI, −1.81 to −0.73; moderate quality), ICU LOS (MD, −2.27 d; 95% CI, −2.96 to −1.58; moderate quality), and pain intensity (0–10 VAS or NRS) (MD, −0.35 cm; 95% CI, −0.22 to −0.49; low quality); panel members issued a conditional recommendation because the benefits of a protocol-based approach were not observed across all critical outcomes.

### Symptom assessment for mechanically ventilated patients: principles and priorities: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^116C4PgQ]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Mechanical ventilation symptom burden and assessment gaps in adult intensive care unit patients are outlined with epidemiology and guideline context: Over 1 million patients receive mechanical ventilation (MV) annually in a U.S. ICU, and patients receiving MV occupy 24–41% of ICU beds in the United States and Canada at any time. Critically ill MV patients experience substantial psychological distress, with over half reporting moderate-to-severe anxiety and more than one-third feeling afraid despite pharmacological therapies. ICU evidence-based guidelines "recommend minimizing sedation for patients receiving MV and an analgesia-first, symptom-based approach", yet "clinical assessment of symptoms other than pain, agitation, and the presence or absence of delirium is not included in the recommendations", and relying solely on unprompted self-report may miss symptoms in this nonvocal population. The report states "it is imperative that clinicians incorporate into clinical practice a comprehensive and holistic assessment of patient symptoms that extends beyond the current focus on pain, agitation, and the presence or absence of delirium", noting that attention to additional symptoms such as dyspnea and anxiety could support individualized management that further minimizes sedative and opioid use.

Cases of gastrointestinal perforation have been reported in adult patients with OIC and advanced illness with conditions that may be associated with localized or diffuse reduction of structural integrity in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., peptic ulcer disease, Ogilvie's syndrome, diverticular disease, infiltrative gastrointestinal tract malignancies or peritoneal metastases). Take into account the overall risk-benefit profile when using RELISTOR in patients with these conditions or other conditions which might result in impaired integrity of the gastrointestinal tract wall (e.g. Crohn's disease). Monitor for the development of severe, persistent, or worsening abdominal pain; discontinue RELISTOR in patients who develop this symptom [see Contraindications (4)].

5.2 Severe or Persistent Diarrhea

If severe or persistent diarrhea occurs during treatment, advise patients to discontinue therapy with RELISTOR and consult their healthcare provider.

5.3 Opioid Withdrawal

Symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal, including hyperhidrosis, chills, diarrhea, abdominal pain, anxiety, and yawning have occurred in patients treated with RELISTOR [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients having disruptions to the blood-brain barrier may be at increased risk for opioid withdrawal and/or reduced analgesia. Take into account the overall risk-benefit profile when using RELISTOR in such patients. Monitor for adequacy of analgesia and symptoms of opioid withdrawal in such patients.

### Using antipsychotic agents in older patients [^11649cwj]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

Antipsychotics are widely used in geriatric psychiatric disorders. A growing number of atypical antipsychotics are available, expanding clinical options but complicating decision-making. Many questions about use of antipsychotics in older patients remain unanswered by available clinical literature. We therefore surveyed expert opinion on antipsychotic use in older patients (65 years of age or older) for recommendations concerning indications for antipsychotics, choice of antipsychotics for different conditions (e.g., delirium, dementia, schizophrenia, delusional disorder, psychotic mood disorders) and for patients with comorbid conditions or history of side effects, dosing strategies, duration of treatment, and medication combinations.

Method

Based on a literature review, a 47-question survey with 1,411 options was developed. Approximately three quarters of the options were scored using a modified version of the RAND 9-point scale for rating appropriateness of medical decisions. For other options, experts were asked to write in answers. The survey was sent to 52 American experts on treatment of older adults (38 geriatric psychiatrists, 14 geriatric internists/family physicians), 48 (92%) of whom completed it. In analyzing responses to items rated on the 9-point scale, consensus was defined as a nonrandom distribution of scores by chi-square "goodness-of-fit" test. We assigned a categorical rank (first line/preferred, second line/alternate, third line/usually inappropriate) to each option based on the 95% confidence interval around the mean. Guidelines indicating preferred treatment strategies were then developed for key clinical situations.

Results

The expert panel reached consensus on 78% of options rated on the 9-point scale. The experts did not recommend using antipsychotics in panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, nonpsychotic major depression, hypochondriasis, neuropathic pain, severe nausea, motion sickness, or irritability, hostility, and sleep disturbance in the absence of a major psychiatric syndrome. However, antipsychotics were favored in several other disorders. For agitated dementia with delusions, the experts' first-line recommendation is an antipsychotic drug alone; they would also consider adding a mood stabilizer. Risperidone (0.5–2.0 mg/day) was first line followed by quetiapine (50–150 mg/day) and olanzapine (5.0–7.5 mg/day) as high second-line options. There was no first-line recommendation for agitated dementia without delusions; an antipsychotic alone was high second line (rated first line by 60% of the experts). The experts'first-line recommendation for late-life schizophrenia was risperidone (1.25–3.5 mg/day). Quetiapine (100–300 mg/day), olanzapine (7.5–15 mg/day), and aripiprazole (15–30 mg/day) were high second line. For older patients with delusional disorder, an antipsychotic was the only treatment recommended. For agitated nonpsychotic major depression in an older patient, the experts' first-line recommendation was an antidepressant alone (77% first line); second-line options were an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), an antidepressant plus a benzodiazepine, and an antidepressant plus a mood stabilizer. For nonpsychotic major depression with severe anxiety, the experts recommended an antidepressant alone (79% first line) and would also consider adding a benzodiazepine or mood stabilizer to the antidepressant. If an older patient with adequate dosages for adequate duration, there was limited support for adding an atypical antipsychotic to the antidepressant (36% first line after two failed antidepressant trials). Treatment of choice for geriatric psychotic major depression was an antipsychotic plus an antidepressant (98% first line), with ECT another first-line option (71% first line). For mild geriatric nonpsychotic mania, the first-line recommendation is a mood stabilizer alone; the experts would also consider discontinuing an antidepressant if the patient is receiving one. For severe nonpsychotic mania, the experts recommend a mood stabilizer alone; the experts would also consider discontinuing an antidepressant if the patient is receiving one. For severe nonpsychotic mania, the experts recommend a mood stabilizer plus an antipsychotic (57%; first line) or a mood stabilizer alone (48%; first line) and would discontinue any antidepressant the patient is receiving. For psychotic mania, treatment of choice is a mood stabilizer plus an antipsychotic (98%; first line). Risperidone (1.25–3.0 mg/day) and olanzapine (5–15 mg/day) were first-line options in combination with a mood stabilizer for mania with psychosis, with quetiapine (50–250 mg/day) high second line. If a patient has responded well, the experts recommended the following duration of treatment before attempting to taper and discontinue the antipsychotic: delirium, 1 week; agitated dementia, taper within 3–6 months to determine the lowest effective maintenance dose; schizophrenia, indefinite treatment at the lowest effective dose; delusional disorder, 6 months-indefinitely at the lowest effective dose; psychotic major depression, 6 months; and mania with psychosis, 3 months. For patients with diabetes, dyslipidemia, or obesity, the experts would avoid clozapine, olanzapine, and conventional antipsychotics (especially low- and mid-potency). Quetiapine is first line for a patient with Parkinson's disease. Clozapine, ziprasidone, and conventional antipsychotics (especially low- and mid-potency) should be avoided in patients with QTc prolongation or congestive heart failure. For patients with cognitive impairment, constipation, diabetes, diabetic neuropathy, dyslipidemia, xerophthalmia, and xerostomia, the experts prefer risperidone, with quetiapine high second line. More than a quarter of the experts considered these combinations contraindicated: clozapine + carbamazepine, ziprasidone + tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), and a low-potency conventional antipsychotic + fluoxetine. In combining antidepressants and antipsychotics, the experts would be much more cautious with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors that are more potent inhibitors of the CYP 450 enzymes (i.e., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine) and with nefazodone, TCAs, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. The experts recommended extra monitoring when combining any antipsychotic with lithium, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, or valproate (except aripiprazole, risperidone, or a high-potency conventional plus valproate) or with codeine, phenytoin, or tramadol.

Conclusions

The experts reached a high level of consensus on many of the key treatment questions. Within the limits of expert opinion and with the expectation that future research data will take precedence, these guidelines provide direction for common clinical dilemmas in the use of antipsychotics in elderly patients. Clinicians should keep in mind that no guidelines can address the complexities of an individual patient and that sound clinical judgment based on clinical experience should be used in applying these recommendations.

### ERN GENTURIS clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis, surveillance and management of people with birt-hogg-dubésyndrome [^116GNNSJ]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

BHD syndrome is a multisystem disorder and it is important that a named clinician should take responsibility for ensuring the overall coordination of surveillance and clinical management. A diagnosis of BHD syndrome may be associated with psychological challenges and socioeconomic hardships, though the occurence of these differs between individuals. Potential psychological effects can include anxiety related to uncertainty about future health problems and/or fear of developing cancer. Coping with a chronic health condition may trigger or exacerbate depression and, particularly when facial FF are numerous, there may be concerns about body image with self consciousness about physical appearance leading to social withdrawal and depression. BHD syndrome, like other inherited disorders, might impact on family relationships and dynamics. Affected parents may be anxious about their untested children and feel guilty if their children become affected. Among siblings, unaffected relatives may feel guilty if their sibling is affected. Couples may feel stress and anxiety when making plans for starting a family and there may be emotional distress if there are differing perceptions of the implications of having an affected child and a lack of consensus over their reproductive options. Therefore addressing the psychological needs of patients and families with BHD syndrome should form a key element of holistic health care for BHD syndrome. Clinicians should be sensitive to indicators of anxiety, depression, emotional distress etc, enquire about wellbeing at each clinical contact and organise appropriate referral for professional support as required. Peer-to-peer support through patient support groups can also play a key role in maintaining wellbeing.

As with many other rare diseases, a limitation to the development of consensus guidelines was the lack of research evidence for different areas of BHD syndrome management (e.g. the psychological consequences of BHD syndrome and for approaches to ameliorate them). The formulation of these guidelines for the diagnosis and management of BHD syndrome inevitably highlighted those areas in which further research is required. These are described in the full guideline document, which is available on the. Although these guidelines will inevitably require revision in the light of future new evidence, the current recommendations have high levels of agreement from clinical experts and patient representatives and should enhance the care of individuals affected by, or at risk of, BHD syndrome.

### Real-world treatment patterns and characteristics among patients with agitation and dementia in the United States: findings from a large, observational, retrospective chart review [^115SjiMt]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

In this real-world study, the clinical management of agitation in patients with dementia is further complicated by the presence of psychiatric and medical comorbidities. The most frequent psychiatric comorbidities were anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Patients in the current study were frequently being treated for medical conditions such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. At the index date, antidementia, antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, and antidepressant medications were the most frequently used medications exclusive of antipsychotics. Comorbid conditions and their associated treatments among patients with agitation symptoms and dementia require careful monitoring during antipsychotic treatment.

Discrepancies between treatment guidelines and clinical practice, in addition to a high prevalence of psychiatric and medical comorbidities, were observed in this chart analysis among dementia patients with agitation. These issues coupled with the absence of safe and effective FDA-approved pharmacological treatments and the lack of guideline recommendations for the optimal sequence of interventions (i.e. when to add or switch non-pharmacological to or from non-pharmacological therapy) adds to the challenge of optimally treating agitation in patients with dementia.

### Sequential drug treatment algorithm for agitation and aggression in Alzheimer's and mixed dementia [^116T4v32]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Step 4: citalopram

Citalopram (NbN: serotonin reuptake inhibitor) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant. SSRIs are the most widely used antidepressants and also have efficacy for most anxiety disorders. The use of citalopram in BPSD has various pros and cons. In favor of the inclusion of citalopram is the recent successful placebo-controlled randomized trial known as "CitAD" in which citalopram titrated to a target of 30 mg/day was effective in reducing BPSD symptoms and three previous trials. Against the use of citalopram are the recent concerns of QTc prolongation which prompted the US Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada to restrict its use to a maximum of 20 mg/day in people aged over 65 years. There is also the possibility that despite the data from the CitAD trial, treatment with SSRIs may initially cause increased agitation through jitteriness/anxiety syndrome. A recent analysis of CitAD data concludes that at least nine weeks are required for full response with citalopram. Thus, in the time-sensitive context of treatment of BPSD in inpatient settings, the panel consensus was that prescribers should have the option of undertaking a trial of carbamazepine, for which both benefits and adverse effects may be realized more quickly, before a trial with citalopram.

The panel considered a variety of pharmacologic agents for possible fifth and sixth steps (see below), given that some or all of the standard agents recommended for the first four steps may not be appropriate, for example through issues relating to consent, or previous intolerance to one or more of the recommended drugs prior to being admitted to an inpatient unit. It selected two agents that have different mechanisms of action: gabapentin and prazosin.

Step 5: gabapentin

Originally developed for treatment of epilepsy, gabapentin (NbN: glutamate: voltage-gated calcium channel blocker) has only case reports and case series suggesting effectiveness for BPSD symptoms, covering agitation and aggression, with or without sexual disinhibition. It was included at this point in the medication algorithm due to its versatility in treating allied conditions such as anxiety disorders, its lack of potential cytochrome P-450-based pharmacokinetic interactions (since it is excreted unchanged by the kidney), and good tolerability. Some case reports indicate a relatively rapid time to onset of effect, within two weeks although this remains to be assessed in a randomized placebo-controlled trial.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^116XKJ2F]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Dementia — agitation and aggression definition, contributors, and initial step describe that "Agitation" is an umbrella term that refers to a range of behavioral disturbances, including physical aggression, combativeness, threatening behavior, persistent or intermittent psychomotor hyperactivity, and disinhibition, and these behaviors pose a particular problem for patients cared for at home, especially by frail spouses. Agitation is more likely to occur later in the course of dementia and often has multiple causes, and new or worsened agitation can result from an occult general medical problem, medication side effects, untreated or undertreated pain, constipation, depression, psychotic symptoms, or delirium. Thus, the first priority is a careful medical evaluation.

Conveniently regarding the aforementioned, dedicated guidelines covering the role of PEC in the management of ACPO were recently published by three major societies. The aim within the ESGE guideline was for the first time to provide guidance on the technique and management of PEC placement in patients with intractable constipation and ACPO. The ASGE document updated on the role of endoscopy in the management of colonic volvulus and ACPO. The ASCRS guideline focused on the evaluation and treatment of sigmoid or cecal volvulus and ACPO.

Indications for the procedure include intermittent or continuous decompression in refractory ACPO, colon fixation in recurrent colonic volvulus, and antegrade colonic enema in selected cases of evacuatory disorder or constipation not responding to other options. Oral bowel preparation should not be used in ACPO as it may worsen colonic dilatation in the absence of bowel transit; however, it is recommended in cases of intractable constipation as abundant fecal remnants might increase the risk of septic adverse events. Even though there has been no study addressing the need for antibiotics, they have been administered in general practice in view of the potential fecal contamination. According to the ESGE guideline, antibiotic prophylaxis should follow local protocols and start 1 h prior and continue for 3 days post-procedure; the other guidelines did not report on this. In addition, the procedure should be performed with CO 2 insufflation and the patient in the left lateral or supine position.

COLONIC VOLVULUS AND PSEUDO‐OBSTRUCTION

Introduction

The term 'volvulus' is used to describe an abnormal twist of the stomach, small intestine or colon. This can lead to impaired blood supply, ischaemia, infarction and/or perforation. Volvulus of any aspect of the GI tract is a general surgical emergency. The most common area of the GI tract to develop volvulus in adults is the colon, with the sigmoid and caecum being particularly at risk. Volvulus leads to between 2% and 15% of all large bowel obstructions in the developed world but the incidence varies greatly across the globe.

The evidence base for volvulus of the colon is poor and there are few evidence‐based recommendations available to guide clinical practice. A similar lack of synthesized evidence is available for pseudo‐obstruction, a functional distention of the colon without an underlying structural blockage. There is an estimated incidence of 100 cases in 100 000 admissions to US hospitals. Pseudo‐obstruction can occur after other non‐GI insults such as burns, cardiac and orthopaedic procedures, intercurrent illnesses or after caesarean section. As such, pseudo‐obstruction, also known as Ogilvie's syndrome, is a common reason for inter‐specialty referrals to the general surgical team.

Previous literature has demonstrated variability in the clinical management of patients with these conditions and there are few UK standards or recommendations. However, there is recently published guidance from the ASCRS.

Colonic volvulus

Question 5.1

Are there any diagnostic clinical features of colonic volvulus?

Recommendation: A combination of abdominal distention, complete/absolute constipation and known risk factors (elderly, frail, comorbidity, constipation and neurological conditions) should alert the clinician to the possibility of a colonic volvulus.

Level of evidence: IV

Grade of recommendation: D

Consensus: 100% (SA 100%)

The clinical presentation of sigmoid and caecal volvulus is that of large bowel obstruction. Abdominal distention, cramping abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea are commonplace. Volvulus appears to be associated with a wide, long mesocolon compared with control patients, rendering a mesenteric twist easier to occur. The specific mechanism by which the twist occurs, however, is unclear. Sigmoid volvulus is more common than caecal and transverse colonic volvulus is rare.

### German Society of Neurology guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cognitive impairment and affective disorders in people with Parkinson's disease: new spotlights on diagnostic procedures and non-pharmacological interventions [^117JXhMh]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and objective

Cognitive impairment and dementia as well as affective disorders are common and debilitating syndromes that develop in people with Parkinson's disease (PwPD). The authors summarized recommendations for the 2023 updated German guidelines on "Parkinson's disease" from the German Neurological Society (DGN), focusing on the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.

Methods

The recommendations were based on literature reviews, other relevant guidelines, and expert opinions.

Results

Measurements to assess cognitive and affective states were reviewed for psychometric properties, use in routine clinical practice, and availability in German. To improve mild cognitive impairment, cognitive training and physical aerobic training are recommended. To treat Parkinson's disease (PD)-related dementia, cognitive stimulation (as a non-pharmacological intervention) and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs, i.e. rivastigmine) are recommended. Cognitive behavioral therapy is recommended to treat depression, anxiety, and fear of progression. Physical interventions are recommended to treat depression, fatigue, and apathy. Optimized dopaminergic treatment is the first-line pharmacological strategy recommended to manage depression, apathy, anhedonia, fatigue, and mood swings. Major depression can be additionally treated using venlafaxine or desipramine, while moderate depression can be treated pharmacologically according to its clinical phenotype (psychomotor retardation or agitation) and comorbidities (e.g. sleep disturbances, pain). Venlafaxine and nortriptyline can be used to treat anhedonia, while citalopram can be used for anxiety.

Conclusions

In addition to the updated pharmacological treatment options, new insights into recommendations for standardized diagnostics and non-pharmacological interventions were provided for the German health care system. However, more studies are needed to explore the full potential of non-pharmacological interventions to treat and prevent cognitive impairment and affective disorders.

### COVID-19 inpatients with psychiatric disorders: real-world clinical recommendations from an expert team in consultation-liaison psychiatry [^116y9aoE]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders poses several challenges, especially regarding drug interactions.

Methods

We report three representative case-scenarios on patients with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 to provide a practical approach based on the existing literature and the clinical experience of an expert team in consultation-liaison psychiatry.

Case-Centered Recommendations

Psychopharmacological ongoing treatments should be prioritized and most doses should be reduced 25–50% of original dose if the patient receives lopinavir/ritonavir, with some exceptions including quetiapine, asenapine, olanzapine, sertraline, lamotrigine, bupropion, and methadone. If the psychopharmacological usual doses are in the low-to-median range levels, a dose change during COVID-19 drugs co-administration is not recommended, but only ECG and clinical monitoring of adverse effects and drug levels if required. Furthermore, when introducing a psychopharmacological drug, dose titration should be progressive, with ECG monitoring if cardiotoxic interactions are present. (A) In agitated delirium, olanzapine is recommended as first-line antipsychotic and quetiapine should be avoided. (B) In severe mental illness (SMI), essential treatments should be maintained. (C) In non-SMI with depressive/anxiety symptoms, psychological support should be provided and symptoms identified and treated.

Limitations

Most recommendations on pharmacological interactions provide only a limited qualitative approach and quantitative recommendations are lacking.

Conclusions

Patients with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 should be managed on a personalized basis considering several clinical criteria and, should not be excluded from receiving COVID-19 treatments. Risks of pharmacological interaction are not absolute and should be contextualized, and most psychopharmacological treatments should include an ECG with special attention to QTc interval.

### Management of opioid use disorder in the emergency department: a White paper prepared for the American academy of emergency medicine [^113c9yFB]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Opioid withdrawal syndrome (OWS) — clinical features and risks include anxiety and irritability, gastrointestinal distress (abdominal cramping, vomiting, diarrhea), diffuse somatic pain, dysphoria, depression, and hopelessness; physical findings may include mydriasis, piloerection, diaphoresis, yawning, and minor autonomic excess, with normal mental status expected. Although OWS is not considered life-threatening, dangerous consequences can occur, especially when precipitated by naloxone or buprenorphine, and inadequate treatment increases risks of self-treatment with illicit opioids, overdose, and refusal of needed care.

Nonpharmacologic pain management — music therapy in critically ill postoperative pediatric patients: "We recommend" that music therapy be offered to augment analgesia for critically ill postoperative pediatric patients (strong, moderate-level evidence). Reported benefits include that "Benefits of music therapy may include reductions in pain, anxiety, medication requirements, and inflammatory markers in addition to improvements in sleep quality and ability to mobilize", with evidence that "music therapy is associated with decreased postoperative pain, anxiety and distress, and decreased opioid requirements", including in critically ill neonates where it is "associated with decreased pain during heel prick procedures". In pediatric cardiac surgical patients, prerecorded music perioperatively was "associated with reduced surgical stress response, decreased agitation in the immediate postextubation period, and improved pain scores with lower analgesic requirements compared with controls not exposed to music", and a systematic review "reported significant reductions in pain scores, anxiety scores, and opioid use in the immediate postoperative period".

### Magnitude of emergence agitation, its interventions and associated factors among paediatric surgical patients [^111opYyJ]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The concept of Emergence Agitation (EA) also known as Emergence Excitement was described in the late 1960s by Eckenhoff referring to the transient confusional state of a child associated with consciousness from general anaesthesia and surgery. In the recent studies, EA have been generally described as mental health complications observed during recovery from anaesthesia. In the literature, the concepts of EA and delirium have been used interchangeably, however there is a difference in terms of their definition and practices. Emergence delirium (ED) is complex psychiatric syndrome, while EA is a state of mild restlessness and mental distress. Unlike delirium, EA typically resolves quickly and is followed by uneventful recovery. It usually occurs within the first 30 minutes of recovery but can have late onset in children who are brought to the recovery room asleep and might lead to serious health complications if not treated. However, many children who arrive to post-anaesthetic care unit (PACU) asleep experience agitation later during recovery.

Paediatric patients after surgical operation with general anaesthesia commonly develop EA in the postoperative period. Thus, agitated patients require close follow-up, focused history, and physical examination to evaluate the development of agitation and provide management tools to control the patient's agitation. Repeated assessments of behaviour following anaesthetic recovery of patients were the requirements to define an incidence and duration of EA.

Preoperative anxiety and EA have been associated with an increased risk of transient postoperative maladaptive behaviours (PMB). Maladaptive behaviours exhibited by children can range from increased general anxiety to sleep disturbances, night-time crying, separation anxiety, temper tantrums, and enuresis. However, the relationship between the presence of EA and PMB is complex and influenced by confounding factors such as preoperative anxiety level in both the patient and the parent.

### Hydroxyzine [^116EHYc7]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Indications and Usage

The total management of anxiety, tension, and psychomotor agitation in conditions of emotional stress requires in most instances a combined approach of psychotherapy and chemotherapy. Hydroxyzine has been found to be particularly useful for this latter phase of therapy in its ability to render the disturbed patient more amenable to psychotherapy in long term treatment of the psychoneurotic and psychotic, although it should not be used as the sole treatment of psychosis or of clearly demonstrated cases of depression.

Hydroxyzine is also useful in alleviating the manifestations of anxiety and tension as in the preparation for dental procedures and in acute emotional problems. It has also been recommended for the management of anxiety associated with organic disturbances and as adjunctive therapy in alcoholism and allergic conditions with strong emotional overlay, such as in asthma, chronic urticaria, and pruritus.

Hydroxyzine hydrochloride intramuscular solution is useful in treating the following types of patients when intramuscular administration is indicated:

1. The acutely disturbed or hysterical patient.

2. The acute or chronic alcoholic with anxiety withdrawal symptoms or delirium tremens.

3. As pre- and postoperative and pre- and postpartum adjunctive medication to permit reduction in narcotic dosage, allay anxiety and control emesis.

Hydroxyzine hydrochloride has also demonstrated effectiveness in controlling nausea and vomiting, excluding nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS).

In prepartum states, the reduction in narcotic requirement effected by hydroxyzine is of particular benefit to both mother and neonate.

Hydroxyzine benefits the cardiac patient by its ability to allay the associated anxiety and apprehension attendant to certain types of heart disease. Hydroxyzine is not known to interfere with the action of digitalis in any way and may be used concurrently with this agent.

The effectiveness of hydroxyzine in long term use, that is, more than 4 months, has not been assessed by systematic clinical studies. The physician should reassess periodically the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.

### Implementation of the pain, agitation, and delirium clinical practice guidelines and promoting patient mobility to prevent post-intensive care syndrome [^112kfqfe]. Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Surviving critical illness is associated with persistent and severe physical, cognitive, and psychological morbidities. The Society of Critical Care Medicine has developed pain, agitation, and delirium guidelines and promoted mobility to improve care of critically ill patients. A task force has developed tools to facilitate and rapidly implement the translation of guideline care recommendations into practice. The Society of Critical Care Medicine has also assembled a task force to assess the long-term consequences of critical illness. This article will explore relationships between the pain, agitation, and delirium guidelines, mobility recommendations, and post-intensive care syndrome initiative. Implementation of the pain, agitation, and delirium guidelines taking into account current data regarding post-intensive care syndrome outcomes and potential interventions are an important first step toward improving outcomes for patients and their families. Research is needed to reduce the impact of long-term negative consequences of critical illness and to fully understand the best within- and post-ICU interventions, along with the optimal timing and dose of such interventions to produce the best long-term outcomes.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of pain, agitation, and delirium in adult patients in the intensive care unit [^111FEZvF]. Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To revise the "Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Sustained Use of Sedatives and Analgesics in the Critically Ill Adult" published in Critical Care Medicine in 2002.

Methods

The American College of Critical Care Medicine assembled a 20-person, multidisciplinary, multi-institutional task force with expertise in guideline development, pain, agitation and sedation, delirium management, and associated outcomes in adult critically ill patients. The task force, divided into four subcommittees, collaborated over 6 yr in person, via teleconferences, and via electronic communication. Subcommittees were responsible for developing relevant clinical questions, using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation method (http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org) to review, evaluate, and summarize the literature, and to develop clinical statements (descriptive) and recommendations (actionable). With the help of a professional librarian and Refworks database software, they developed a Web-based electronic database of over 19,000 references extracted from eight clinical search engines, related to pain and analgesia, agitation and sedation, delirium, and related clinical outcomes in adult ICU patients. The group also used psychometric analyses to evaluate and compare pain, agitation/sedation, and delirium assessment tools. All task force members were allowed to review the literature supporting each statement and recommendation and provided feedback to the subcommittees. Group consensus was achieved for all statements and recommendations using the nominal group technique and the modified Delphi method, with anonymous voting by all task force members using E-Survey (http://www.esurvey.com). All voting was completed in December 2010. Relevant studies published after this date and prior to publication of these guidelines were referenced in the text. The quality of evidence for each statement and recommendation was ranked as high (A), moderate (B), or low/very low (C). The strength of recommendations was ranked as strong (1) or weak (2), and either in favor of (+) or against (-) an intervention. A strong recommendation (either for or against) indicated that the intervention's desirable effects either clearly outweighed its undesirable effects (risks, burdens, and costs) or it did not. For all strong recommendations, the phrase "We recommend… " is used throughout. A weak recommendation, either for or against an intervention, indicated that the trade-off between desirable and undesirable effects was less clear. For all weak recommendations, the phrase "We suggest… " is used throughout. In the absence of sufficient evidence, or when group consensus could not be achieved, no recommendation (0) was made. Consensus based on expert opinion was not used as a substitute for a lack of evidence. A consistent method for addressing potential conflict of interest was followed if task force members were coauthors of related research. The development of this guideline was independent of any industry funding.

Conclusion

These guidelines provide a roadmap for developing integrated, evidence-based, and patient-centered protocols for preventing and treating pain, agitation, and delirium in critically ill patients.

Abstract

The increasing recognition of cyclic vomiting syndrome in adults prompted the development of these evidence‐based guidelines on the management ofin adults, which was sponsored by the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society and the Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome Association.(Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) framework was used and a professional librarian performed the literature search. The expert committee included the President of thewho brought a patient perspective into the deliberations. The committee makes recommendations for the prophylaxis of, treatment of acute attacks, diagnosis, and overall management of. The committee strongly recommends that adults with moderate‐to‐severereceive a tricyclic antidepressant, such as amitriptyline, as a first‐line prophylactic medication and receive topiramate or aprepitant as alternate prophylactic medications. Zonisamide or levetiracetam and mitochondrial supplements (Coenzyme Q10, L‐carnitine, and riboflavin) are conditionally recommended as alternate prophylactic medications, either alone or concurrently with other prophylactic medications. For acute attacks, the committee conditionally recommends using serotonin antagonists, such as ondansetron, and/or triptans, such as sumatriptan or aprepitant to abort symptoms. Emergency department treatment is best achieved with the use of an individualized treatment protocol and shared with the care team (example provided). The committee recommended screening and treatment for comorbid conditions such as anxiety, depression, migraine headache, autonomic dysfunction, sleep disorders, and substance use with referral to appropriate allied health services as indicated. Techniques like meditation, relaxation, and biofeedback may be offered as complementary therapy to improve overall well‐being and patient care outcomes.

### German Society of Neurology guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cognitive impairment and affective disorders in people with Parkinson's disease: new spotlights on diagnostic procedures and non-pharmacological interventions [^111kUF8k]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

Cognitive impairment and dementia as well as affective disorders are common and debilitating syndromes that develop in people with Parkinson's disease (PwPD). The authors summarized recommendations for the 2023 updated German guidelines on "Parkinson's disease" from the German Neurological Society (DGN), focusing on the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.

Methods

The recommendations were based on literature reviews, other relevant guidelines, and expert opinions.

Results

Measurements to assess cognitive and affective states were reviewed for psychometric properties, use in routine clinical practice, and availability in German. To improve mild cognitive impairment, cognitive training and physical aerobic training are recommended. To treat Parkinson's disease (PD)-related dementia, cognitive stimulation (as a non-pharmacological intervention) and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs, i.e., rivastigmine) are recommended. Cognitive behavioral therapy is recommended to treat depression, anxiety, and fear of progression. Physical interventions are recommended to treat depression, fatigue, and apathy. Optimized dopaminergic treatment is the first-line pharmacological strategy recommended to manage depression, apathy, anhedonia, fatigue, and mood swings. Major depression can be additionally treated using venlafaxine or desipramine, while moderate depression can be treated pharmacologically according to its clinical phenotype (psychomotor retardation or agitation) and comorbidities (e.g., sleep disturbances, pain). Venlafaxine and nortriptyline can be used to treat anhedonia, while citalopram can be used for anxiety.

Conclusions

In addition to the updated pharmacological treatment options, new insights into recommendations for standardized diagnostics and non-pharmacological interventions were provided for the German health care system. However, more studies are needed to explore the full potential of non-pharmacological interventions to treat and prevent cognitive impairment and affective disorders.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^115pqZHp]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) mental health — Healthcare professionals should be aware of the high prevalence of moderate to severe anxiety symptoms and anxiety disorders in adults and should screen for anxiety in all adults with PCOS, using regionally validated screening tools. If moderate or severe depressive or anxiety symptoms are detected, practitioners should further assess, refer appropriately, or offer treatment. Severity of symptoms and clinical diagnosis of depression or anxiety should guide management. The optimal interval for anxiety and depression screening is not known. A pragmatic approach could include screening at diagnosis with repeat screening based on clinical judgement, risk factors, comorbidities, and life events, including the perinatal period. Screening for mental health disorders comprises assessment of risk factors, symptoms, and risk of self-harm and suicidal intent.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^113yzmtb]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Agitation and psychosis in dementia — trazodone, buspirone, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) — Support for the use of trazodone or buspirone is limited to data from case series and small clinical trials; therefore, neither agent can be recommended for the routine treatment of agitation and psychosis in patients with dementia. Although the evidence suggesting efficacy of SSRIs is limited and further study is needed before they can be recommended for routine use, a therapeutic trial of trazodone, buspirone, or an SSRI may be appropriate for some nonpsychotic but agitated patients, especially those with relatively mild symptoms or those who are intolerant of or unresponsive to antipsychotics. When patients are taking SSRIs, clinicians need to keep in mind the serotonin syndrome from combined serotonergic medications (including buspirone and SSRIs), with symptoms including delirium, autonomic instability, and increased neuromuscular activity such as myoclonus.

### Perphenazine and amitriptyline hydrochloride [^111JYyFC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Perphenazine and amitriptyline hydrochloride tablets are recommended for treatment of (1) patients with moderate to severe anxiety and/or agitation and depressed mood, (2) patients with depression in whom anxiety and/or agitation are severe, and (3) patients with depression and anxiety in association with chronic physical disease. In many of these patients, anxiety masks the depressive state so that, although therapy with a tranquilizer appears to be indicated, the administration of a tranquilizer alone will not be adequate.

Schizophrenic patients who have associated depressive symptoms should be considered for therapy with perphenazine and amitriptyline hydrochloride tablets.

2.5 What constitutes a specialist or dementia subspecialist evaluation?

The dementia subspecialist uses a detailed behavioral neurologic or neuropsychiatric evaluation to identify key symptoms and signs of abnormal brain function, which may narrow or expand the differential diagnosis of the cognitive–behavioral syndrome and likely etiology, as detailed in Recommendation 13. This requires methodical and nuanced consideration of the exam data in the context of the history and depends on the knowledge, experience, and advanced proficiency that subspecialist training and practice confers. The clinical formulation of the patient's cognitive–behavioral syndrome sets prior probabilities on likely etiology (‐ies), and guides tiered selection of potential referrals and/or diagnostic tests — psychometric instruments, neuropsychological evaluation (Recommendation 14), CSF or other biofluid assays, brain imaging, and other studies (Recommendations 15–19) — and their interpretation.

When neuropsychiatric or sensorimotor dysfunction is a presenting or prominent feature, specialist or dementia subspecialist involvement provides added value as these problems increase the morbidity, care burden, and resource use associated with a dementia, and are important drivers of costs including emergency department visits, hospital admission, length of stay, and transfer to residential care. It is essential to capture these problems in a succinct clinical formulation and to incorporate them into an individualized care plan. For example, a patient whose cognitive functional status and syndromic formulation is mild dementia with amnesic and dysexecutive features would be expected to require a different plan of care than a patient whose formulation is partially similar (mild dementia with amnesic and dysexecutive features) but is also accompanied by anxiety, sleep disturbance, and extrapyramidal motor dysfunction.

Management of patients with atypical or more complex cognitive–behavioral syndromes is often best handled through a comprehensive and interdisciplinary team approach that may include not only a dementia subspecialist(s) (see Figure 4) but also, potentially, a neuropsychologist; a social worker, nurse, and/or case manager; a speech–language pathologist; a physical or occupational therapist; and/or a genetic counselor. The goal in every case is to devise a comprehensive and personalized clinical diagnostic formulation that then informs the implementation of a multidisciplinary care plan that appropriately uses behavioral, psychosocial, and environmental interventions, resources, and supports; pharmacologic management as warranted; and potentially rehabilitative or compensatory and supportive therapies to mitigate the impact of the illness on the patient–care partner dyad, and her/his family and community.

### Effect of level of sedation on outcomes in critically ill adult patients: a systematic review of clinical trials with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^116zsNJU]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with acute serious illnesses who require intensive care admission, also require effective treatment of associated discomfort, anxiety, agitation, and pain that occurs during the process of resuscitation, diagnostics, and subsequent management. The patient's ability to communicate discomfort and pain is often compromised by the several factors including severity of illness, altered mental status, medications, and the need for organ support. Clinical status changes frequently, so clinicians need to continuously assess patient symptoms to assure appropriate titration of sedatives and analgesics.

In the short-term, sedatives are primarily used to combat anxiety, agitation, and to prevent patient-ventilator asynchrony. They also decrease the level of consciousness and reduce the capacity of the patient to respond to stimuli and interact with the environment. Sedatives blunt the sympathetic response and may cause cardiovascular dysfunction. In the medium-to long-term, deep sedation is associated with prolonged length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay and associated complications such as delirium. Post-traumatic stress disorder is common after acute serious illness and may be related to sedative use or choice of sedative agent. By tailoring sedation to the patients' needs and circumstances, health care providers can determine appropriate level of sedation and manage adverse events. This can be achieved by considering patient-related factors such as age, gender, past medical history, the trajectory of the illness, and the pharmacological properties of the agents used.

### Should this patient receive prophylactic medication to prevent delirium? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^1132j2Jx]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

In 2015, the American Geriatrics Society released recommendations for prevention and management of postoperative delirium, based on a systematic literature review and evaluation of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches by an expert panel. The guidelines recommend an interdisciplinary focus on nonpharmacologic measures (reorientation, medication management, early mobility, nutrition, and gastointestinal motility) for prevention and consideration of this strategy for acute management. They also recommend optimizing nonopioid medication as a means to manage pain and avoiding benzodiazepines other than to treat substance withdrawal. The authors concluded that evidence to recommend antipsychotics for prevention of delirium is insufficient but that these drugs may be considered for short-term treatment in the setting of imminent harm to the patient or caregivers or severe distress due to agitation. Patients should be given the lowest possible dose for the shortest duration when other nonpharmacologic measures have failed. In this Beyond the Guidelines, a psychiatrist and a geriatrician debate whether Mr. W, a 79-year-old man at high risk for postoperative delirium, should receive prophylactic antipsychotics with his next surgery. They review risk factors, appropriate evaluation, and potential benefits and harms of the various medications often used in this setting.

### Treatment and management of mental health conditions during pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 5 [^112fwbnP]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Perinatal anxiety disorders — first-line pharmacotherapy is specified as follows: ACOG recommends that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) be used as first-line psychopharmacotherapy for perinatal anxiety, with serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) as reasonable alternatives, and pharmacotherapy individualized based on prior response; if there is no pharmacotherapy history, sertraline or escitalopram are reasonable first-line medications. Most experts recommend initiation of SSRIs or SNRIs for anxiety at half of the lowest recommended dose range to avoid early side effects such as agitation or insomnia, and treatment of anxiety and anxiety-related conditions often requires up-titration to doses that are higher than those for depression; experts also recommend that individuals with anxiety and anxiety-related conditions be in remission longer than those with an indication of depression before considering tapering or discontinuing psychopharmacotherapy.

### Epidemiology of pain, delirium, psychiatric disorders, discomfort and sedation-analgesia management in the intensive care unit: a one-day nationwide study [^113Be3Cv]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The administration of sedatives and analgesics in intensive care units (ICUs) has undergone significant evolution over the past 20 years. Deep sedation is associated with adverse effects, including prolonged ventilation duration, extended length of stay, ICU weakness, delirium, and long-term psychiatric disorders. In light of these unfavorable outcomes, numerous guidelines have aimed to standardize practices, prompting a paradigm shift from deep and prolonged sedation toward lighter and shorter sedation strategies. Deep sedation is now discouraged and should be reserved for specific clinical indications, such as brain injury with intracranial hypertension or severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Between 2000 and 2015, several practice surveys were conducted in Canada, Denmark, Spain, the United Kingdom, and France, consistently revealing marked variability in sedation practices across and within countries. In this context, the Guidelines for the Prevention and Management of Pain, Agitation/Sedation, Delirium, Immobility, and Sleep Disruption in Adult Patients in the ICU (PADIS guidelines) advocate the use of written protocols for managing sedation, targeting light to moderate sedation levels.

The shift toward lighter or no sedation has brought new challenges, notably increased patient discomfort in the ICU setting. Common sources of discomfort include pain, anxiety, mood disorders, sleep disturbances, thirst, and dyspnea. These discomforts are multifactorial in origin, influenced by environmental issues, pharmacological treatments, and underlying disease severity. Numerous studies have explored ICU patients' self-reported experiences of discomfort, with each type being well characterized independently.

Despite the clinical importance of these issues, most existing data derive from declarative surveys of clinical practices, which are prone to reporting bias and often lack granularity regarding individual patient experiences. While the Dolorea study provided valuable insights into discomfort and symptom management, it was limited to mechanically ventilated patients and did not capture the broader ICU population. The aim of this study was to gather recent epidemiological data on the assessment of sedation, pain, psychiatric symptoms and discomfort across a wide ICU population, in order to guide future improvements in patient-centered care in the ICU.

### Disparities by socioeconomic status and diagnosis of dementia in the prescribing of antipsychotics in a real-world data population over 60 years of age [^1122rG3s]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Dementia is a highly prevalent progressive disease whose expression in the cognitive, behavioral and functional dimensions changes over time. Among them, it is the behavioral one measured in terms of attention to neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) and disruptive behaviors that carries the greatest burden on caregivers that determines the prescribing of antipsychotics. Despite their notable adverse effects, they are widely used in the elderly in general and especially in patients with dementia due to the high prevalence of NPS. Non-pharmacological treatments classified as sensory stimulation interventions, cognitive/emotion-oriented interventions, behavior management techniques, and other therapies are recommended as the first option in reducing NPS. Antipsychotics are indicated when non-pharmacologic options have failed or patient behavior means substantial harm to self or others. Concern about their inappropriate use has led to government reports warning about their risks and recommending a reduction in their use for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. Although dementia with agitation and other NPS is the main indication, experts point out that they are also indicated in other diagnoses such as schizophrenia in later life, non-psychotic agitated major depression, and severe mania. On the contrary, their use is not recommended for panic disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, or irritability, hostility, and sleep disorders in the absence of a major psychiatric syndrome. The same experts also note that no guideline can address the complexities of an individual patient and that clinical experience should be used when applying these recommendations. Although there have been calls for deprescribing antipsychotics in elderly patients with dementia, the reality is that they are being used in as many as half of over-70-year-olds in some settings. A real-world data (RWD) study in the American population found that only a quarter of patients on antipsychotics had been diagnosed with one of the four indications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. While the registration of the diagnosis of dementia in databases derived from electronic medical records reaches high levels of quality and consistency in different countries, the limited coding of NPS makes it difficult to analyze the use of antipsychotics in RWD.

### Neostigmine for the treatment of pediatric acute colonic pseudo-obstruction [^117Dqji7]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (ie, Ogilvie's syndrome) is an uncommon but serious condition in the pediatric population. Definitive management traditionally has consisted of endoscopic decompression. Recent studies have documented the effectiveness of neostigmine as a pharmacologic alternative to mechanical decompression. To date, however, this literature has focused exclusively on the adult population. The authors present the first reported case of the successful administration of neostigmine to treat acute colonic pseudo-obstruction in a child.
