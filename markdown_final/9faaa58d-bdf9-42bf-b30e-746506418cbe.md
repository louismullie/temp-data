## Question

drugs thta cause thrombocytopenia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which drugs cause thrombocytopenia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the major mechanistic buckets for drug-induced thrombocytopenia. Then, I should verify which drug classes have the strongest evidence and the characteristic timelines of onset. Next, I need to check the epidemiology and scope to contextualize risk. After that, I will review diagnostic frameworks, emphasizing temporal patterns and testing strategies. Finally, I should consolidate management principles and synthesize a practical, high-priority drug list, all while cross-checking key claims against guidelines and labels.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic categories, because misclassifying immune destruction as marrow suppression can mislead both diagnosis and management. Broadly, drug-induced thrombocytopenia occurs via immune-mediated destruction, often driven by drug-dependent antibodies with abrupt onset and profound nadirs, and via decreased production from bone marrow suppression with dose-related, cumulative effects, the latter being typical of cytotoxic chemotherapy and some targeted agents [^114Mfy5w] [^112t5p6S] [^1177LPku].

> I will now examine heparin and HIT since this is the archetypal immune-mediated entity with a paradoxical thrombotic phenotype. Wait, let me verify the timing: typical onset is day 4–14 after heparin starts, with rapid-onset HIT within 24 hours in patients exposed in the prior ~100 days, and the central pathophysiology is anti-PF4/heparin immune complexes that activate platelets and monocytes to create a hypercoagulable state despite thrombocytopenia, which is why thrombosis is the rule rather than bleeding in HIT [^115asjJM] [^112Dnpev] [^114njnsk]. I should confirm the screening and testing guidance: use the 4Ts for pretest probability, obtain an immunoassay when intermediate/high probability, and consider a functional assay if the immunoassay is positive; monitoring strategies and baseline platelet counts are recommended in perioperative and recently exposed patients to catch the onset early [^115FXf6g] [^114Y4dRQ] [^115aLAfQ] [^112cqpjR] [^117EAKLe].

> Next, I should review glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors because they are high risk for abrupt, severe thrombocytopenia after the first exposure. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without checking the immediacy: abciximab, tirofiban, and eptifibatide can cause life-threatening immune-mediated thrombocytopenia within hours of the first dose, which is a distinctive feature compared with other DITPs, whereas thienopyridines cause immune thrombocytopenia only rarely around PCI care pathways [^114Mfy5w] [^115iQw5C].

> Let me consider bone marrow suppression from chemotherapy, as this is the prototypical decreased-production mechanism with predictable timing tied to treatment cycles. Chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia is common and dose-dependent; reported thrombocytopenia rates approximate 37% with gemcitabine and 31% with platinum agents, with nadirs typically 5–10 days post-dose, driving delays and dose reductions and increasingly prompting consideration of thrombopoietin receptor agonists under guideline oversight in selected settings [^112t5p6S] [^1129cViK] [^116EUdmQ] [^116jzPCP].

> I need to check targeted and RNA-based agents with prominent label warnings to prioritize them for vigilance. Ruxolitinib carries clear labeling for dose-dependent thrombocytopenia that warrants baseline and serial CBC monitoring with dose interruption or reduction when needed, selinexor has very high rates of thrombocytopenia with substantial grade 3–4 events and bleeding risk, and inotersen carries a boxed warning for sudden, unpredictable and sometimes fatal thrombocytopenia with antiplatelet antibodies documented in some cases, necessitating stringent platelet monitoring and awareness of EDTA-dependent clumping artifacts that can delay diagnosis [^1113HMHX] [^115c4Er6] [^115tiELc].

> But wait, what about antimicrobials and alkaloids that classically trigger immune thrombocytopenia, often missed without a meticulous medication history. Quinine is a classic culprit present in antimalarials and even tonic water and herbal products, producing severe immune thrombocytopenia after intermittent prior exposures, and rifampicin has well-described albeit uncommon immune thrombocytopenia with potentially life-threatening bleeding, reinforcing the need to query over-the-counter and complementary sources when counts crash unexpectedly; antibiotics and anticonvulsants are also frequent suspects in ICU populations, and immune checkpoint inhibitors can provoke an ITP-like syndrome at low incidence that is managed per immune-related toxicity algorithms with escalation to steroids, IVIG, and consideration of TPO-RAs if refractory [^114CTtvR] [^1155wQjx] [^112KLXGP] [^116ZWNeG] [^114WdTTz]. Hold on, I should verify the heparinoid nuance: fondaparinux is generally used as a non-heparin anticoagulant for HIT, with only rare case reports of antibody-mediated thrombocytopenia, so I will keep it listed as an uncommon culprit while emphasizing its therapeutic role in HIT pathways to avoid overattribution [^1163qLZb].

> I should double-check the scope of the problem to calibrate pretest probability in different settings. A comprehensive database summarized 317 drugs with published evidence across 1301 reports, and triangulation across case reports, serum antibody testing, and pharmacovigilance data indicates dozens of agents with convergent signals; clinically, up to a quarter of acutely ill patients may experience DITP and 15–58% of ICU patients develop thrombocytopenia from multifactorial causes, underscoring why careful temporal mapping to drug exposures is essential [^114Mfy5w] [^115DNAFT] [^112KLXGP].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic framework so that timing and testing are applied appropriately. Typical immune DITP emerges 5–10 days after a new drug or immediately after a single dose if previously sensitized, rapid-onset patterns occur upon re-exposure, and recovery within 4–5 drug half-lives after discontinuation supports causality; specialized testing can identify drug-dependent platelet-reactive antibodies, though access is limited and results are not timely for initial decisions, so clinical algorithms drive early discontinuation and challenge-based assessment, while HIT specifically relies on 4Ts-based pretest probability plus immunoassay and, if positive, functional testing to refine post-test probability [^116A5PDL] [^113Y8WVM] [^116masxz] [^115FXf6g] [^117Edqrs].

> I need to ensure management principles align with mechanism and urgency. Immediate discontinuation of the suspected drug is foundational, avoidance of re-exposure is critical because antibodies may persist for years, platelet transfusions are reserved for severe bleeding or very low counts recognizing limited efficacy if the culprit drug remains in circulation, high-dose IVIG can accelerate recovery in severe immune DITP or high-risk bleeding scenarios, and HIT requires prompt cessation of all heparins and initiation of a non-heparin anticoagulant at therapeutic intensity with options including direct thrombin inhibitors, danaparoid where available, fondaparinux, or DOACs per guideline context with careful peri-procedural planning and VKA timing to avoid early warfarin alone; for chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia, consider TPO-RAs within trial or guideline pathways to preserve dose intensity when appropriate [^116A5PDL] [^116masxz] [^115PV1Gh] [^1163qLZb] [^115Nxinj] [^116EUdmQ].

> Hold on, I should verify distinguishing features and correct a point before it propagates. It is correct that HIT is unique among drug-induced thrombocytopenias for its prothrombotic phenotype with arterial and venous events despite thrombocytopenia, and it is also correct that GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor–associated thrombocytopenia is characteristically immediate and severe on first exposure, and chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia is predictable and dose-dependent; however, my earlier note that TPO-RAs are "unique in being able to treat drug-induced thrombocytopenia while also causing it rarely" is not well supported, because TPO-RAs are used to treat ITP and CIT and are not recognized as causes of immune DITP, though rebound declines after discontinuation or disease fluctuations can transiently lower counts, so I should correct that misstatement here and maintain TPO-RAs in the therapeutic, not causative, category [^114njnsk] [^114Mfy5w] [^112t5p6S] [^113vnUsB] [^117MXzwT].

> Let me synthesize a practical, high-priority list to guide vigilance, while reminding myself to individualize by timing, alternative etiologies, and testing feasibility. Highest-yield culprits with strong evidence and distinctive patterns include heparins with HIT features, GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors with immediate severe immune thrombocytopenia, cytotoxic chemotherapy agents such as gemcitabine and platinums with dose-related marrow suppression, and labeled high-risk targeted or RNA therapeutics including ruxolitinib, selinexor, and inotersen, and among antimicrobials and alkaloids, rifampicin and quinine require particular scrutiny because they are often overlooked in histories; beyond these, antibiotics, anticonvulsants, thienopyridines, and immune checkpoint inhibitors contribute risk in select contexts, and an extensive literature supports more than 300 agents with varying levels of causality evidence, so a structured temporal review of all exposures is mandatory in each case [^114Mfy5w] [^115iQw5C] [^112t5p6S] [^1113HMHX] [^115c4Er6] [^115tiELc] [^1155wQjx] [^114CTtvR] [^116ZWNeG].

---

Drugs that cause **thrombocytopenia** include heparin (HIT) [^114Y4dRQ] [^115asjJM], chemotherapy (platinum agents, gemcitabine, temozolomide) [^112t5p6S], glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors [^112KLXGP], quinine [^114CTtvR], vancomycin, linezolid [^113Y8WVM], rifampin [^1155wQjx], and immune checkpoint inhibitors [^116ZWNeG]. Mechanisms include **immune-mediated platelet destruction** [^112KLXGP] [^113Y8WVM], **direct marrow toxicity** [^112t5p6S], and **impaired production** [^1177LPku]. Management is to **stop the offending drug** [^116masxz], monitor platelets [^114vWZwd], and use IVIG or corticosteroids if severe [^116A5PDL]; for HIT, start a non-heparin anticoagulant [^115PV1Gh] [^1163qLZb].

---

## Mechanisms of drug-induced thrombocytopenia

Drug-induced thrombocytopenia results from **immune-mediated destruction** [^113Y8WVM] [^112KLXGP], **direct marrow toxicity** [^112t5p6S], or **impaired production** [^1177LPku].

- **Immune-mediated destruction**: Drug-dependent antibodies target platelets, causing rapid clearance [^112KLXGP] (e.g. heparin, quinine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors) [^114CTtvR].

- **Direct bone marrow toxicity**: Chemotherapy [^112t5p6S] and some antibiotics suppress megakaryocytes, reducing platelet production.

- **Impaired platelet production**: Some drugs disrupt megakaryopoiesis [^1177LPku], lowering platelet output [^112t5p6S].

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Patients present with **petechiae, purpura, mucosal bleeding, or severe hemorrhage** [^112KLXGP]; HIT is distinguished by thrombosis [^114njnsk] [^112Dnpev]. Diagnosis relies on **clinical suspicion, a careful drug exposure history, and exclusion of other causes** [^112KLXGP]; specialized tests (e.g. drug-dependent platelet antibodies) may help but are not always available [^113Y8WVM].

---

## Management strategies

- **Immediate discontinuation**: Stop the suspected drug promptly [^116masxz] [^112KLXGP].

- **Supportive care**: Use platelet transfusions for severe bleeding; consider IVIG or corticosteroids for immune-mediated cases [^115tTyF8] [^116A5PDL].

- **Alternative anticoagulation**: For HIT, start a non-heparin anticoagulant (e.g. argatroban, bivalirudin, fondaparinux) [^11216utW] [^115PV1Gh].

- **Monitoring**: Track platelet counts and watch for bleeding or thrombosis [^114vWZwd] [^112KLXGP].

---

## Prevention and monitoring

- **Baseline platelet count**: Obtain before starting high-risk drugs (e.g. heparin, chemotherapy) [^115aLAfQ] [^114vWZwd].

- **Regular monitoring**: Check platelets during therapy, especially in high-risk patients [^114vWZwd] [^1122fUzy].

- **Patient education**: Inform patients about bleeding signs and when to seek care.

---

Drug-induced thrombocytopenia is a clinically significant adverse effect of many medications, with mechanisms including immune-mediated destruction and direct marrow toxicity [^112t5p6S]. **Management centers on stopping the culprit drug** [^116masxz], supportive care, and alternative anticoagulation for HIT [^115PV1Gh], with prevention via baseline and ongoing platelet monitoring [^115aLAfQ].

### Cases of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia elucidate the syndrome [^1145P51z]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) can have a dramatic presentation and often an unfortunate outcome. Each episode has the real potential to result in clinical catastrophe. From the more than 100 such patients we see yearly, individuals have been selected to illustrate aspects of HIT, including history, epidemiology, clinical features, and improving treatment strategies. Delayed recognition continues to contribute to the morbidity and mortality of these patients. It is not adequate to simply stop heparin therapy even with isolated HIT. Therapy with low-molecular-weight heparins is contraindicated, and care must be taken not to initiate warfarin therapy early or unopposed. A moderate suspicion for HIT should trigger the institution of therapy with an alternative anticoagulant, even before laboratory confirmation. The potential beneficial impact of therapy with direct thrombin inhibitors underscores the importance of maintaining awareness and vigilance for this syndrome.

### Drug-induced thrombocytopenia: Pathogenesis, evaluation, and management [^114Mfy5w]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2009). Low credibility.

Although drugs are a common cause of acute immune-mediated thrombocytopenia in adults, the drug etiology is often initially unrecognized. Most cases of drug-induced thrombocytopenia (DITP) are caused by drug-dependent antibodies that are specific for the drug structure and bind tightly to platelets by their Fab regions but only in the presence of the drug. A comprehensive database of 1301 published reports describing 317 drugs provides information on the level of evidence for a causal relation to thrombocytopenia. Typically, DITP occurs 1 to 2 weeks after beginning a new drug or suddenly following a single dose when a drug has previously been taken intermittently. However, severe thrombocytopenia can occur immediately after the first administration of antithrombotic agents that block fibrinogen binding to platelet GP IIb-IIIa, such as abciximab, tirofiban, and eptifibatide. Recovery from DITP usually begins within 1 to 2 days of stopping the drug and is typically complete within a week. Drug-dependent antibodies can persist for many years; therefore, it is important that the drug etiology be confirmed and the drug be avoided thereafter.

### Drug-associated thrombocytopenia [^116A5PDL]. Hematology, American Society of Hematology Education Program (2018). Low credibility.

Many drugs have been implicated in drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia (DITP). Patients with DITP develop a drop in platelet count 5 to 10 days after drug administration, with an increased risk of hemorrhage. The diagnosis of DITP is often challenging because most hospitalized patients are taking multiple medications and have comorbidities that can also cause thrombocytopenia. Specialized laboratory diagnostic tests have been developed and are helpful to confirm the diagnosis.

Treatment of DITP involves discontinuation of the offending drug. The platelet count usually starts to recover after 4 to 5 half-lives of the responsible drug or drug metabolite. High doses of intravenous immunoglobulin can be given to patients with severe thrombocytopenia and bleeding. Although in most cases DITP is associated with bleeding, life-threatening thromboembolic complications are common in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).

Binding of antiplatelet factor 4/heparin antibodies to Fc receptors on platelets and monocytes causes intravascular cellular activation, leading to an intensely prothrombotic state in HIT. The clinical symptoms include a decrease in platelet counts by more than 50% and/or new thromboembolic complications. Two approaches can help to confirm or rule out HIT: assessment of the clinical presentation using scoring systems and in vitro demonstration of antiplatelet factor 4/heparin antibodies.

The cornerstone of HIT management is immediate discontinuation of heparin when the disease is suspected and anticoagulation using a nonheparin anticoagulant.

### Jakafi [^1113HMHX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Treatment with Jakafi can cause thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

- **Thrombocytopenia management**: Reduce the dose or temporarily interrupt Jakafi. Platelet transfusions may be necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2)].
- **Anemia management**: Patients developing anemia may require blood transfusions and/or dose modifications of Jakafi.
- **Neutropenia management**: Severe neutropenia (ANC less than 0.5 × 10^9/L) was generally reversible by withholding Jakafi until recovery.

Perform a pre-treatment complete blood count (CBC) and monitor CBCs every two to four weeks until doses are stabilized, and then as clinically indicated [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

### Transitioning patients with immune thrombocytopenia to second-line therapy: Challenges and best practices [^111TE1pw]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) experience a high burden of disease, making it crucial to offer management options that improve their quality of life. Treatment choices should align with the personal preferences and lifestyle of the patient whenever possible. Some patients may prefer oral treatments taken once daily, while others might favor less frequent injections. For those looking to minimize medication and monitoring needs, splenectomy could be the most desirable option.

An in-depth understanding of second-line treatment options is essential to optimize the management of ITP and improve patient outcomes by ensuring the best use of available therapeutic strategies.

### Thrombocytopenia in cardiovascular patients: Diagnosis and management [^115iQw5C]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a common problem in cardiovascular patients, but the etiology and management of this condition may be different than those in other populations. Around the time that percutaneous coronary interventions are performed, the drugs most commonly associated with thrombocytopenia are the glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors and heparin. Thienopyridines only rarely cause thrombocytopenia. Patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes may be exposed to prolonged heparin infusions, GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, and thienopyridines. After open-heart surgery, as opposed to other surgical procedures, the platelet count falls primarily due to platelet damage and destruction in the bypass circuit and hemodilution. Heparin is the most common drug implicated in thrombocytopenia in ICU patients. Determining the etiology of the low platelet count is important for implementing appropriate management. The use of a direct thrombin inhibitor in treatment should be considered early if a diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is possible.

### Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in cancer [^115GohuS]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2011). Low credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is a common and clinically important drug-induced complication that can cause life- and limb-threatening thrombosis. Epidemiologically, the disease has been studied in many different clinical settings, but little is known about its presence in cancer patients. This is a population at increased risk for thrombosis and, consequently, exposure to heparin products. Additionally, thrombocytopenia is a common finding in cancer patients. The convergence of these variables highlights the importance of an increased understanding of the disease in cancer patients.

### Transitioning patients with immune thrombocytopenia to second-line therapy: Challenges and best practices [^114Zx88e]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

Thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) are conventionally considered to be lifelong therapies that need to be used continuously to maintain response. However, accumulating data suggest that some patients who use TPO-RAs may achieve long-term remissions that are sustained off treatment. Although randomized, placebo-controlled, long-term studies that would directly demonstrate the remission-inducing potential of TPO-RAs are not available, it appears unlikely that remissions observed in the TPO-RA discontinuation studies are purely spontaneous.

Earlier studies showed that the rate of spontaneous remissions in adult patients is only about 9%, while the overall rate of long-term (≥ 6 months) remission in TPO-RA studies is nearly 30%. Spontaneous remissions are less frequent following the first year after diagnosis, but most patients who achieved remission in TPO-RA studies had ITP for more than one year, and some had been living with ITP for much longer (up to 54 years).

The authors speculated that this putative disease-modifying activity of TPO-RAs could be linked to the TPO-RA–mediated restoration of impaired regulatory T-cell function and immune tolerance that was observed in patients with ITP.

### Quinine-induced severe thrombocytopenia: The importance of taking a detailed drug history [^114CTtvR]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Drugs can lead to severe, life-threatening thrombocytopenia. The mechanisms of drug-induced thrombocytopenia include increased destruction through immune-mediated platelet destruction or decreased platelet production due to bone marrow suppression. Quinine, a drug used for the treatment of malaria and nocturnal leg cramps, is also an important ingredient in some herbal preparations. Quinine can very rarely cause thrombocytopenia through immune-mediated platelet destruction. In a patient with thrombocytopenia, a detailed history of all medications, including over-the-counter medications and herbal preparations, is very important.

### Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: A focus on thrombosis [^112Dnpev]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2021). Low credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is an immune-mediated disorder caused by antibodies that recognize complexes of platelet factor 4 and heparin. Thrombosis is a central and unpredictable feature of this syndrome. Despite optimal management, disease morbidity and mortality from thrombosis remain high. The hypercoagulable state in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is biologically distinct from other thrombophilic disorders in that clinical complications are directly attributable to circulating ultra-large immune complexes. In some individuals, ultra-large immune complexes elicit unchecked cellular procoagulant responses that culminate in thrombosis. At the time of writing, the clinical and biologic risk factors associated with thrombotic risk in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia remain elusive. This review will summarize our understanding of thrombosis in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with attention to its clinical features, cellular mechanisms, and its management.

### Systematic literature review of treatments used for adult immune thrombocytopenia in the second-line setting [^112rVA9g]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Low credibility.

Since the publication of this systematic review, the management of ITP has evolved. Treatment decisions are less likely to be guided solely by platelet counts and more likely to rely on a combination of platelet levels, shared decision-making between the physician and the patient, and patient factors, such as insurance coverage, lifestyle, history of bleeding, occupation, comorbidities, and expectations. Thrombopoietin-receptor agonists (TPO-RAs), including eltrombopag and romiplostim, have also entered the market after undergoing rigorous randomized trials in splenectomized and non-splenectomized patients with persistent or chronic ITP. Additionally, the incidence of splenectomy has declined in recent years.

Despite these developments and trends, the International Consensus Report on the management of primary ITP (released in 2010) lists medical treatment options in the second-line setting in alphabetical order to avoid indicating a preference for a specific treatment, highlighting the lack of sufficient data to rank the treatments according to efficacy. Similarly, shortly after the publication of this report, the American Society of Hematology (ASH) published practice guidelines for ITP, concluding that there is no evidence to guide a sequence of treatment for patients who have persistent thrombocytopenia with bleeding after first-line treatment with corticosteroids, IVIg, or anti-D.

Indeed, clinical decision-making on optimal second-line ITP treatment is challenging and has been described as controversial.

### Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, including secondary forms, and selection of second-line treatment [^111d3nJz]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

What would we have liked to have been able to offer our two patients with immune thrombocytopenia?

First, it would have been beneficial to predict their course by considering factors such as the risk of bleeding, likelihood of chronicity, effectiveness of treatments, and potential toxicity.

Second, having a curative yet non-toxic treatment would have been ideal. We discussed the use of rituximab for a younger woman due to the higher likelihood of a cure given her age and gender. However, among different patients, the likelihood of cure varies, and in her case, vaccination for SARS-CoV-2 posed challenges. This consideration leaves splenectomy as a remarkably effective option; recent research suggests its continued effectiveness, even for patients who have been treated with thrombopoietin agents. Why are patients so unwilling to undergo splenectomy? The primary concerns are the uncertainty about spontaneous recovery, the success of the procedure, and its irreversible nature. Additionally, lifelong risks such as sepsis and thrombosis persist post-splenectomy. In the future, the use of combinations of agents — such as dexamethasone and rituximab, steroids and mycophenolate mofetil, or dexamethasone and eltrombopag — within one week of diagnosis may offer higher cure rates and justify the additional costs and risks associated with these interventions.

Finally, treatment selection could be more logical if data from randomized controlled trials comparing different agents and regimens were available.

### Guidelines on the diagnosis and management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: Second edition [^115C2NFY]. British Journal of Haematology (2012). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, specifically with respect to diagnosis, the BCSH 2012 guidelines recommend using the following to determine the post-test probability of HIT:

- **Estimation of pretest probability**: This involves assessing the likelihood of HIT before performing further tests.

- **Type of assay used and its quantitative result (ELISA only)**: The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the recommended method for obtaining quantitative results.

- **Information on reversal using higher doses of heparin**: This involves evaluating the response when higher doses of heparin are administered.

### Temporal aspects of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^115asjJM]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is a relatively common antibody-mediated drug reaction. We studied the temporal relation between previous or heparin therapy and the onset of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

- **Methods**: We examined the time between the start of heparin therapy and the onset of thrombocytopenia in 243 patients with serologically confirmed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. We also investigated the persistence of circulating heparin-dependent antibodies by performing a platelet serotonin-release assay and an assay for antibodies against platelet factor 4. The outcome in seven patients who had previously had an episode of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and were later treated again with heparin was also examined.

- **Results**: A fall in the platelet count beginning four or more days after the start of heparin therapy occurred in 170 of the 243 patients (70 percent); in these patients, a history of previous heparin treatment did not influence the timing of the onset of thrombocytopenia. In the remaining 73 patients (30 percent), the onset of thrombocytopenia was rapid (median time of onset, 10.5 hours after the start of heparin administration); all these patients had been treated with heparin within the previous 100 days. During recovery from thrombocytopenia, heparin-dependent antibodies in the serum fell to undetectable levels at a median of 50 to 85 days, depending on the assay performed. In the seven patients who were given heparin again after the disappearance of heparin-dependent antibodies, a new episode of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia

### Management of thrombocytopenia in cancer [^113tvaDK]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a common finding in cancer patients and can have different and/or multifactorial pathogenesis. While in solid tumors it often occurs as a consequence of chemotherapy treatment, it is frequently observed at diagnosis in patients with hematological malignancies, being aggravated to a potentially life-threatening level during chemotherapy. Other associated conditions, such as infections, drugs, and consumption coagulopathy, can add to influence the degree of thrombocytopenia and the inherent risk of bleeding. These should be recognized and corrected to improve platelet count.

Platelet transfusion remains the cornerstone of treatment, but its use should always be weighed against the actual risk of bleeding to avoid inappropriate use and the wasting of resources. While a threshold level of 10,000 platelets/μL is widely accepted in hematological malignancies as the minimal level prompting prophylactic platelet transfusion, this limit is less frequently observed in patients with solid tumors. In these cases, platelet transfusions are usually administered for a few days, possibly at a higher platelet level.

Alternative treatments for patients with solid tumors, including thrombopoietin-mimetic agents, are increasingly used and found to be promising.

### Xpovio [^115c4Er6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Xpovio can cause life-threatening thrombocytopenia, potentially leading to hemorrhage. Thrombocytopenia is the leading cause of dosage modifications [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

- **Thrombocytopenia in multiple myeloma patients**: In patients with multiple myeloma who received Xpovio 100 mg once weekly (BOSTON, n = 195), thrombocytopenia was reported in 92% of patients, and severe (Grade 3–4) thrombocytopenia was reported in 43% of patients. The median time to first onset was 22 days for any-grade thrombocytopenia and 43 days for Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia. Bleeding occurred in 16% of patients with thrombocytopenia, clinically significant bleeding (Grade ≥ 3) occurred in 4% of patients, and fatal hemorrhage occurred in 2% of patients. Permanent discontinuations of Xpovio due to thrombocytopenia occurred in 2% of patients.

- **Thrombocytopenia in different dosage**: In patients with multiple myeloma who received Xpovio 80 mg twice weekly (STORM, n = 202), thrombocytopenia was reported as an adverse reaction in 74% of patients, and severe (Grade 3–4) thrombocytopenia was reported in 61% of patients. The median time to onset of the first event was 22 days. Bleeding occurred in 23% of patients with thrombocytopenia, clinically significant bleeding occurred in 5% of patients, and fatal hemorrhage occurred in less than 1% of patients.

### Treatment of inherited thrombocytopenias [^112TSeGs]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

Treatments to prevent bleeding

As already discussed, most patients with inherited thrombocytopenias (IT) experience mild, moderate, or even absent spontaneous bleeding, and intervention is required only during hemostatic challenges.

Simple and inexpensive general measures can effectively reduce the risk of bleeding in everyday life. Preventing hemostatic challenges is an important recommendation for patients with IT. They need to be aware that many drugs inhibit platelet function and facilitate bleeding. Aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents should certainly be avoided. Furthermore, many frequently used drugs, such as some antibiotics and antidepressants, can also affect platelet function. Patients with IT should consult their physician before taking any medication and discuss the risk-to-benefit ratio of each treatment.

Oral contraceptives are usually effective in preventing or controlling menorrhagia and should be considered for women with heavy menstruation. If they develop iron deficiency anemia, it must be corrected with iron administration. This not only improves their quality of life but also addresses the suggestion that anemia facilitates bleeding. In vitro studies have shown that red blood cells push platelets toward the vessel wall, enhancing their hemostatic effect.

Dental interventions are among the most frequent hemostatic challenges. Maintaining good oral hygiene with regular dental visits are simple measures to prevent the need for these invasive procedures. Moreover, adherence to screening programs for early cancer detection is recommended.

### How to approach thrombocytopenia [^113h8nQU]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a common hematologic finding with variable clinical expression. A low platelet count may be the initial manifestation of infections such as HIV and hepatitis C virus, or it may reflect the activity of life-threatening disorders such as the thrombotic microangiopathies. Correct identification of the causes of thrombocytopenia is crucial for the appropriate management of these patients. In this review, we present a systematic evaluation of adults with thrombocytopenia. The approach is clearly different between outpatients, who are frequently asymptomatic and in whom we can sometimes indulge in sophisticated and relatively lengthy investigations, and the dramatic presentation of acute thrombocytopenia in the emergency department or in the intensive care unit, which requires immediate intervention and for which only a few diagnostic tests are available. A brief discussion of the most common etiologies seen in both settings is provided.

### Drug-induced thrombocytopenia in critically ill patients [^112KLXGP]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia occurs in 15% to 58% of intensive care unit patients. The incidence varies based upon patient population, timing and frequency of platelet monitoring, and the definition of thrombocytopenia. Up to 25% of acutely ill patients develop drug-induced thrombocytopenia. When drug-induced thrombocytopenia is suspected, non-drug-related causes must be evaluated and excluded.

Establishing the diagnosis of drug-induced thrombocytopenia is challenging, as hundreds of medications have been implicated. Medications commonly associated with drug-induced thrombocytopenia include glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, cinchona alkaloids, antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and heparin.

Once the diagnosis is suspected, clinicians should:

- **Identify the start date of medications**: To assess the timeline of development.
- **Evaluate the likelihood of each medication causing thrombocytopenia**: Assess the risk versus benefit of discontinuing the suspected medication and consider the availability of alternative medications.
- **Assess the role of corticosteroids, immune globulin, and plasmapheresis**: The role of these treatments remains uncertain.

When the offending agent has been discontinued, the overall prognosis is excellent. In cases of suspected or confirmed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, an alternative anticoagulant should be initiated. Drug-induced thrombocytopenia should be documented in the medical record and reported according to institutional and national standards.

This review focuses on immune-mediated drug-induced thrombocytopenia from medications commonly utilized in the critically ill patient.

Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia (DITP) can be triggered by a wide range of medications. Although many cases of DITP are mild, some are characterized by life-threatening bleeding symptoms. In the treatment of tuberculosis, there are special therapeutic challenges related to adverse effects of drugs, compliance with treatment, and microbial resistance. Thrombocytopenia is an uncommon but potentially fatal adverse effect of certain antituberculous drugs when the incriminating drug is taken by a susceptible individual.

### Neutrophil activation and netosis are the major drivers of thrombosis in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^117Ve5vq]. Nature Communications (2019). Low credibility.

Adverse drug effects are common in clinical practice and often have a negative impact on patient safety. Among these, adverse effects caused by anticoagulants are concerning to clinicians, particularly those caused by heparin, a widely used anticoagulant. Heparin and heparin-derived drugs, including unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, and occasionally fondaparinux, may induce an immune reaction termed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT is a hypercoagulable state that often causes severe and extensive thrombosis (both venous and arterial), resulting in high morbidity and mortality.

The thrombotic complications include severe limb thrombosis and gangrene, requiring limb amputation, life-threatening pulmonary embolism, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke. Additionally, it is associated with characteristic thrombosis at distinctive sites, such as bilateral adrenal infarct, portal and intestinal vein, and cerebral sinus thrombosis. It is ironic that patients with HIT develop severe thrombosis when they are also thrombocytopenic and are receiving heparin, a potent anticoagulant.

### Treatment of drug-induced immune thrombocytopenias [^116masxz]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

Treatment of patients suspected of having drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia involves the immediate discontinuation of the drug responsible. In patients receiving multiple medications, if feasible, all compounds started within the last 5–10 days should be stopped and replaced. Discontinuation of the drugs can also be done sequentially, possibly depending on the a priori probability that a specific drug is incriminated. It is important to consider testing for drug-dependent antibodies before any therapeutic initiative is taken; therefore, a serum sample should be collected before DITP treatment to subsequently confirm the clinical suspicion. In this context, it should be noted that intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) interferes with immunoassays that are commonly used to detect drug-dependent antibodies. Blood samples should be collected either before or at least 48 hours after IVIG administration if the patient has received this treatment.

Generally, after 4–5 half-lives of the offending drug or drug metabolite, the platelet count begins to recover once treatment has been stopped. Notably, as long as the drug or its metabolite(s) are present in plasma, transfusion of platelets is unsuccessful. Administration of high doses of IVIG (1 g/kg body weight) can be used to accelerate platelet recovery under two circumstances: in patients with severe thrombocytopenia and bleeding or in those at high risk of bleeding.

A suggested approach to manage cases of suspected DITP is reported in Figure 2. Of note, well-documented reports indicate that…

### Treatment of drug-induced immune thrombocytopenias [^116ZWNeG]. Haematologica (2022). High credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) were developed as a novel treatment approach for cancer and are currently used as immune therapy. ICI are monoclonal antibodies against proteins such as PD-L1 and CTLA4, which are used by tumor cells to escape the immunosurveillance system. Complications during immune therapy with ICI are primarily inflammatory conditions and autoimmune disorders. However, ICI-induced immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) has been observed in some cases. This condition is rare, with an incidence between 0.2% to 2.8%, and is almost never severe or fatal.

- **Pathophysiology of ICI-induced immune thrombocytopenia**: Immune-induced adverse events are thought to be triggered by a revival of exhausted T cells that can be induced on ICI administration. Whereas the exact pathomechanism of ICI-induced ITP is still unclear, it is likely that ICI trigger the expression of antiplatelet antibodies similarly to primary ITP.

- **Clinical manifestations of ICI-induced immune thrombocytopenia**: Patients who develop ICI-induced ITP show symptoms common to other types of thrombocytopenia, such as petechiae, easy bruising, spontaneous bleeding, and hematuria. However, more severe manifestations, such as cerebral hemorrhage with subsequent neurological deficits, have been reported in some rare fatal cases.

- **Diagnosis of ICI-induced immune thrombocytopenia**: Obtaining a clear diagnosis of ICI-induced ITP is complex.

### Tegsedi [^115tiELc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Tegsedi causes reductions in platelet count at any time during treatment, which may result in sudden and unpredictable thrombocytopenia that can be life-threatening. In Study 1 [see Clinical studies (14)], platelet counts below 100 x 10^9/L occurred in 25% of Tegsedi-treated patients compared with 2% of patients on placebo. Platelet counts below 75 x 10^9/L occurred in 14% of Tegsedi-treated patients, compared to no patients on placebo. In Study 1 and its extension study, 39% of Tegsedi-treated patients with a baseline platelet count below 200 x 10^9/L had a nadir platelet count below 75 x 10^9/L, compared to 6% of patients with baseline platelet counts of 200 x 10^9/L or higher.

Three Tegsedi-treated patients (3%) experienced sudden severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count below 25 x 10^9/L), which can lead to potentially fatal bleeding complications, including spontaneous intracranial or intrapulmonary hemorrhage. One patient in a clinical trial experienced a fatal intracranial hemorrhage.

In clinical trials, all three patients with severe thrombocytopenia had treatment-emergent antiplatelet IgG antibodies detected shortly before or at the time of severe thrombocytopenia. In two patients, platelet clumping caused uninterpretable platelet measurements, delaying the diagnosis and treatment of severe thrombocytopenia. Platelet clumping can be caused by a reaction between antiplatelet antibodies and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

### Introduction to a review series on the treatment of thrombocytopenic disorders: something old, something new [^1177LPku]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

Figure 1. Pathogenic mechanisms of congenital and acquired thrombocytopenia. The pathogenic mechanisms responsible for thrombocytopenia can be grouped into three categories: reduced production of platelets, increased consumption/destruction in the bloodstream, and increased destruction/entrapment in the spleen. The causes of thrombocytopenia are shown in the figure, and many of them act through more than one pathogenic mechanism. Increased awareness of the many distinct forms of thrombocytopenia is a prerequisite for appropriate prevention, such as in drug-associated thrombocytopenia, or for making a precise prognosis or planning comprehensive treatment, exploiting as best possible the limited options available for the various different types of congenital and acquired thrombocytopenia.

For most of the disorders reviewed in the series, reducing or aborting bleeding — the enemy platelets were evolved to fight against — is the primary goal that should dictate management. Whereas many agents can negatively interfere with the thrombotic potential of platelets, thus reducing platelet-dependent thrombotic risk at the cost of slightly increasing the hemorrhagic risk, there are no drugs that can augment platelet hemostatic activities without increasing thrombotic risk. Some "hemostatic" agents act in an indirect way by reducing fibrinolysis or by potentiating the clotting mechanism. These include desmopressin, which releases high molecular weight multimers of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII into the circulation, and recombinant activated factor VII, which can directly activate the clotting cascade.

### Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia: pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management [^113Y8WVM]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2009). Low credibility.

Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia (DITP) can be triggered by a wide range of medications. Although many cases of DITP are mild, some are characterized by life-threatening bleeding symptoms. The pathogenesis of DITP is complex, with at least six different mechanisms proposed by which drug-induced antibodies can promote platelet destruction. In many cases, it is possible to identify antibodies that react with platelets in the presence of the sensitizing drug; however, the required testing is technically demanding and not widely available.

- **Clinical decision-making**: A decision on whether to discontinue an implicated medication in a patient suspected of having DITP must be made on clinical grounds. An algorithm is available that can help assess the likelihood that a particular drug caused thrombocytopenia. The most important aspects of patient management are a high index of suspicion and a careful history of drug exposure in an individual who presents with acute, often severe thrombocytopenia of unknown etiology.

- **Mechanisms of action**: The process by which drugs induce platelet-reactive antibodies and how these antibodies cause platelet destruction following drug exposure is poorly understood. Further studies are needed to address these issues and to characterize more completely the range of drugs and drug metabolites that can cause DITP.

### Platelet transfusion refractoriness: How do I diagnose and manage [^113u45bB]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology Education Program (2020). Low credibility.

Platelet refractoriness continues to be a problem for thrombocytopenic patients because the risk of a major spontaneous or life-threatening bleed significantly increases when platelet counts drop below 10 × 10⁹/L. The majority of patients have nonimmune causes driving the refractoriness, such as bleeding, medications, or diffuse intravascular coagulation. However, this article is dedicated to the diagnosis and support of patients with immune-based platelet refractoriness.

Antibodies to class I HLA molecules (A and B alleles) are responsible for most immune-based refractory cases, with antibodies to platelet antigens seen much less frequently. Patients may be supported with either crossmatch-compatible or HLA-matched/compatible platelet units. When trying to select HLA units, it can be difficult to find a perfect "4 of 4" match for the patient's class IA and IB alleles. In these cases, it is better to use the antibody specificity prediction method, which identifies compatible units that lack antigens recognized by the patient's anti-HLA antibodies.

### Identifying drugs that cause acute thrombocytopenia: an analysis using 3 distinct methods [^115DNAFT]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia (DITP) is often suspected in patients with acute thrombocytopenia unexplained by other causes, but documenting that a drug is the cause of thrombocytopenia can be challenging. To provide a resource for the diagnosis of DITP and for drug safety surveillance, we analyzed three distinct methods for identifying drugs that may cause thrombocytopenia.

- **Published case reports**: DITP case reports have described 253 drugs suspected of causing thrombocytopenia. Using defined clinical criteria, 87 (34%) of these drugs were identified with evidence that the drug caused thrombocytopenia.

- **Serum sample testing**: Serum samples from patients with suspected DITP were tested for 202 drugs. Drug-dependent, platelet-reactive antibodies were identified for 67 drugs (33%).

- **FDA adverse event database analysis**: The Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System database was searched for drugs associated with thrombocytopenia using data mining algorithms. A total of 1444 drugs had at least one report associated with thrombocytopenia, and 573 (40%) drugs demonstrated a statistically significant reporting association with thrombocytopenia.

Among the 1468 drugs suspected of causing thrombocytopenia, 102 were evaluated by all three methods. Of these, 23 drugs had evidence for an association with thrombocytopenia by all three methods. Multiple methods, each with a distinct perspective, can contribute to the identification of drugs that can cause thrombocytopenia.

### Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: A comprehensive clinical review [^112thWcR]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is a profoundly dangerous, potentially lethal, immunologically mediated adverse drug reaction to unfractionated heparin or, less commonly, to low-molecular weight heparin. In this comprehensive review, the authors highlight heparin-induced thrombocytopenia's risk factors, clinical presentation, pathophysiology, diagnostic principles, and treatment. The authors place special emphasis on the management of patients requiring procedures using cardiopulmonary bypass or interventions in the catheterization laboratory. Clinical vigilance of this disease process is important to ensure its recognition, diagnosis, and treatment. Misdiagnosis of the syndrome, as well as misunderstanding of the disease process, continues to contribute to its morbidity and mortality.

### New-generation drugs that stimulate platelet production in chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura [^113vnUsB]. The Lancet (2009). High credibility.

Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is an acquired disease characterized by a low platelet count. The development of autoantibodies is a main cause of the disease. Although many patients have few symptoms, life-threatening bleeding can arise; hence, when platelet counts fall to unacceptable levels, treatment should be initiated.

However, conventional immunosuppressive approaches can fail, perhaps due to the heterogeneous nature of the disease. Newly developed agents that increase platelet production by stimulating megakaryocytes — such as drugs that bind to the thrombopoietin receptor c-MPL — offer an alternative treatment strategy. Although initial thrombopoietin analogues caused adverse immune reactions, second-generation thrombopoietin-receptor agonists that are in late-stage clinical development seem promising.

In particular, eltrombopag and romiplostim safely increase and maintain platelet production in patients with refractory disease. However, long-term side effects are being assessed, and the exact role of these agents in the overall treatment strategy for chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura remains to be established.

### Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: current status and diagnostic challenges [^114KGCNi]. American Journal of Hematology (2010). Low credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a fairly common and potentially catastrophic complication of heparin therapy. Diagnosing HIT remains a challenge, as patients at risk often have other reasons for thrombocytopenia and/or thrombosis. HIT is considered a clinicopathologic disorder whose diagnosis is generally made on the basis of both clinical criteria and the presence of "HIT antibodies" in the patient's serum or plasma.

There are two basic laboratory approaches to detect HIT antibodies. The immunoassays detect antibodies based on their binding properties, whereas the functional assays detect antibodies based on their platelet-activating properties. Prompt and accurate diagnosis of HIT is imperative, as overdiagnosis exposes patients to alternative anticoagulants and their associated bleeding risks, whereas under- or delayed diagnosis leaves patients vulnerable to the thromboembolic sequelae of HIT, which can be life-threatening.

A critical interpretation of laboratory results by the clinician is an essential component of diagnosing HIT. This requires a keen understanding of the concepts in the pathophysiologic mechanisms of the disease and the application of these concepts when interpreting the results of both the functional and immunoassays. Equally important is an awareness of the strengths and weaknesses, as well as the lack of standardization and proficiency testing, of these assays.

### Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^114njnsk]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2003). Low credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is not only a common but also potentially serious drug adverse effect. Unlike other drug-induced thrombocytopenias, HIT does not usually cause bleeding but instead causes thrombosis. Thrombosis in HIT can lead to limb gangrene, requiring leg amputation, or even death. HIT is mediated by an antibody that recognizes an epitope on the platelet factor 4 (PF4)-heparin complex. The antibody-PF4-heparin complex binds to FcγRII receptors on the platelet surface and cross-links the receptors, inducing intense platelet activation and platelet aggregation. This simultaneously activates blood-coagulation pathways, which are probably the basis of the thrombotic events in HIT.

Diagnosis of HIT should be made mainly on clinical criteria but should be confirmed whenever possible by laboratory tests, particularly in patients with comorbid conditions where the diagnosis of HIT cannot be made with certainty without testing. The tests for HIT antibodies include immunoassays (e.g. ELISA) or functional tests (e.g.^14C-serotonin release assay). Once a clinical diagnosis of HIT is made, heparin should be ceased immediately, and treatment with an alternative anticoagulant (such as danaparoid, r-hirudin, or argatroban) should commence. This treatment should continue for at least 5 days unless the diagnosis of HIT is subsequently proven to be incorrect. Warfarin should also be commenced when the patient is clinically stable and thrombosis is under control. There should be an overlap of a few days between warfarin and the alternative anticoagulant therapy.

### How I diagnose and treat thrombocytopenia in geriatric patients [^116gaxyX]. Blood (2024). High credibility.

Thrombocytopenia in older individuals is a common but diagnostically challenging condition that has a variable clinical impact on those who are affected. A diagnostic approach requires an evaluation of preexisting clinical conditions, a detailed review of medications, and an assessment for disorders that warrant urgent treatment. In this article, we describe a systematic approach to the diagnosis of thrombocytopenia and present a schematic review of management strategies.

Three clinical scenarios are presented that are relevant for their prevalence and management challenges in an older adult population:

- **Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)**: Reviews different treatment options.
- **Complications of thrombocytopenia in myelodysplastic syndrome management**: Addresses specific management challenges.
- **Drug-induced ITP**: Reviews diagnostic challenges associated with this condition.

### Drug-induced thrombocytopenia [^114smUyv]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Drug-induced thrombocytopenia was first described in the 19th century, yet our understanding of its pathogenesis continues to evolve. The list of drugs implicated in drug-induced thrombocytopenia is extensive and growing. Many, if not most, of these medications induce thrombocytopenia by immune mechanisms. Because the degree of thrombocytopenia can put patients at risk for serious bleeding, a prompt diagnosis is key to clinical management.

The laboratory approach to diagnosing drug-induced thrombocytopenia is two-pronged. First, nondrug causes of thrombocytopenia must be ruled out. Second, testing for drug-dependent platelet antibodies, available at specialized reference laboratories, often can identify the offending medication, although usually not in time for initial clinical management. Once a medication is suspected of causing thrombocytopenia, it must be discontinued promptly, and the patient should be monitored closely. Thrombocytopenia generally resolves quickly after offending medication withdrawal, and the prognosis of drug-induced thrombocytopenia is then excellent.

### Chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia: Literature review [^112t5p6S]. Discover Oncology (2023). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia:

- **Definition**: CIT is a common complication of antineoplastic therapy, characterized by a decrease in platelet count, which can lead to treatment delays, dose reductions, and discontinuation of therapy due to the risk of bleeding events.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of CIT involves the direct toxic effects of chemotherapy on bone marrow, specifically on megakaryocytes, which leads to decreased production of new platelets. Additionally, chemotherapy can increase the rate of platelet destruction, further contributing to the reduction in platelet count.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for CIT include the type of cancer, the specific chemotherapy regimen used, and individual patient characteristics. CIT is more common in patients with hematologic malignancies (approximately half of cases) than in those with solid tumors (about one-third). Thrombocytopenia is reported in 37% of patients receiving gemcitabine and 31% of those treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. Other potential risk factors are renal impairment or liver disease, advanced age, and baseline platelet count.

### How I treat heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^114FY6jz]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is a prothrombotic adverse drug effect induced by platelet-activating antibodies against multimolecular complexes of platelet factor 4 and heparin. Diagnosis rests on a clinical assessment of disease probability and laboratory testing. Management involves immediate discontinuation of heparin and initiation of an alternative anticoagulant. Because of the frequency of thrombocytopenia among heparinized patients, the limited specificity of widely available immunoassays, the limited availability of more specific functional assays, and clinicians' fears of missing a case of true disease, overtesting, overdiagnosis, and overtreatment have become common.

As a result, a substantial number of thrombocytopenic patients are unnecessarily exposed to costly alternative anticoagulants and their attendant risk of bleeding. In this review, we describe not only our approach to the evaluation and management of patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia but also the measures we use to minimize misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment of patients without the disease. In addition, we propose areas of investigation for improvement of the diagnosis and management of this potentially fatal disorder.

### Cancer, thrombosis and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^114bbC94]. Thrombosis Research (2007). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common occurrence in patients with cancer and can sometimes precede the development of clinical manifestations of cancer. The pathogenetic mechanisms of thrombosis involve a complex interaction between tumor cells and the host hemostatic system, in addition to cancer-related clinical risk factors. The risk of VTE increases in the presence of distant metastases. The development of VTE in patients with cancer is a strong predictor of decreased survival.

The most common medical situations that increase the risk of VTE in cancer patients include immobilization and chemotherapy, with or without adjuvant hormone therapy. Recent findings suggest that heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and HIT-related thrombotic complications may occur more frequently in cancer patients than in patients free from malignancy. Thromboembolism is a well-recognized complication of malignant disease. Clinical manifestations vary from venous thromboembolism (VTE) to disseminated intravascular coagulation, which is more commonly observed in patients with hematological malignancies and those with widespread metastatic cancer, to arterial embolism, more commonly observed in patients undergoing chemotherapy and in those with non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis.

### Pathogen-reduced platelets for the prevention of bleeding [^112AAi3e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Platelet transfusions are used to prevent and treat bleeding in people who are thrombocytopenic. Despite improvements in donor screening and laboratory testing, a small risk of viral, bacterial, or protozoal contamination of platelets remains. There is also an ongoing risk from newly emerging blood transfusion-transmitted infections for which laboratory tests may not be available at the time of the initial outbreak. One solution to reduce the risk of blood transfusion-transmitted infections from platelet transfusion is photochemical pathogen reduction, in which pathogens are either inactivated or significantly depleted in number, thereby reducing the chance of transmission. This process might offer additional benefits, including platelet shelf-life extension and negates the requirement for gamma-irradiation of platelets. Although pathogen-reduction technologies have been proven to reduce pathogen load in platelet concentrates, a number of published clinical studies have raised concerns about the effectiveness of pathogen-reduced platelets for post-transfusion platelet count recovery and the prevention of bleeding when compared with standard platelets. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2013.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of pathogen-reduced platelets for the prevention of bleeding in people of any age requiring platelet transfusions.

- **Search methods**: We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 9), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase.

### Introduction to a review series on the treatment of thrombocytopenic disorders: something old, something new [^116VkjRU]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

Increased awareness of the relevance of the disorders discussed in this review series may stimulate further basic and clinical research. Cutting-edge technologies and bioinformatics applied to genomics will contribute to the identification of an increasing number of inherited thrombocytopenias and make their diagnosis easier and more precise. More importantly, we need reinvigorated international collaboration to produce large cohorts of patients with long-term follow-up to better capture the most relevant outcomes of these disorders.

Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia has recently seen the unexpected emergence of thrombocytopenic disorders after COVID-19 vaccination or from an increasing list of innovative drugs, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. This situation calls for supranational pharmacovigilance systems and the creation of easily accessible, updated repertories of drugs identified or suspected to cause immune or non-immune thrombocytopenias. While waiting for artificial platelets to become available in clinical settings, potentially making platelet transfusion obsolete, the benefit of increasing natural thrombopoiesis in chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia and other thrombocytopenias needs further exploration. Well-designed prospective studies should investigate old and new TPO-RA.
