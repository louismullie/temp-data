## Question

Lifting restrictions pregnancy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about lifting restrictions during pregnancy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing occupational lifting from recreational resistance training. Then, I should review the evidence linking occupational lifting to adverse pregnancy outcomes and dose-response thresholds. Next, I will synthesize occupational lifting guidance, including practical accommodations. After that, I need to appraise the safety of recreational resistance training, including heavy loads and supine positions. Finally, I will reconcile any apparent contradictions, align with current guideline philosophies, and propose individualized counseling with clear warning signs and follow-up needs.

> Let me first confirm the critical distinction: occupational lifting typically involves repetitive, prolonged tasks with limited recovery and cumulative load, whereas recreational resistance training is structured, intermittent, and often supervised. This matters because the dose, context, and recovery profile likely alter risk, and I should be careful not to conflate the two when advising patients [^1121LaxH].

> Next, I should review the occupational lifting evidence. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — meta-analyses show that lifting ≥ 10–11 kg frequently (about ≥ 10 times/day) is associated with increased odds of miscarriage and preterm delivery, and lifting ≥ 100 kg/day cumulatively increases risks of preterm birth and low birthweight. There is also a dose-response for extremely high burdens (for example, > 1000 kg/day), with markedly higher odds of very preterm birth, which I should highlight in counseling for high-exposure jobs [^113uWBMN] [^116GaXpt] [^115KbLrs].

> Wait, let me verify musculoskeletal risks too. I need to ensure I capture pelvic girdle pain and work disability, because consistent data show that heavy lifting during pregnancy increases risks of functionally limiting pelvic girdle pain and antenatal leave, with dose-response gradients, and prolonged standing further compounds risk. This is especially relevant for workers in healthcare, retail, logistics, and similar sectors [^117GbMEY].

> I will now synthesize occupational guidance. For most pregnant workers with uncomplicated pregnancies, I should advise limiting single lifts to about 10 kg, minimizing repetitive lifts ≥ 10 kg to fewer than 10 per day, and keeping cumulative daily lifting under 100 kg when feasible. I should also counsel on ergonomic controls such as avoiding floor-to-knee and overhead lifts, using mechanical aids, adjusting workstation height, and increasing rest periods, consistent with NIOSH-informed recommendations adapted for pregnancy [^116GaXpt] [^114spjZY]. Hold on, I should verify accommodation language — yes, clinicians should document medically reasonable accommodations, including sitting stools, frequent breaks, and task redistribution, noting that the ADA and related frameworks support temporary modifications for pregnancy-related limitations [^117DqMZV] [^114BuhKK].

> Let me consider timing and cumulative exposure. I need to ensure I flag that risk rises with advancing gestation, particularly beyond 28 weeks, and that combining heavy lifting with prolonged standing, long work hours, and fatigue amplifies risk; in such settings, stricter limits or temporary duty modification are prudent, even for otherwise low-risk patients [^116GaXpt] [^114QW8mX].

> Now, shifting to recreational resistance training, I should double-check the emerging data. Large surveys and acute physiology studies of pregnant athletes suggest that heavy-load resistance training, including compound lifts at ~70–80% 1 RM, is generally well tolerated without increased rates of preterm birth or low birthweight, and fetal heart rate responses remain within normal ranges. However, I need to emphasize that much of this evidence is observational and from self-selected, experienced cohorts, so generalizability is limited and caution is warranted [^1121LaxH] [^111Vn8yp].

> Hmm, wait a minute — what about supine lifting after mid-pregnancy. Initially, I was going to say "supine exercise is absolutely contraindicated after 16 weeks", but hold on, I should verify the nuance: guidelines advise modifying supine exercises due to vena cava compression risk, and recent work suggests most pregnant individuals do not become symptomatic, though up to 10% may experience hypotensive symptoms. Thus, I should advise using an incline bench or side-lying alternatives, and if supine work is done, keep sets short and immediately change position if dizzy, lightheaded, or nauseated [^111eQmn6] [^117SQurY].

> Let me reconsider the apparent contradiction between occupational cautions and recreational tolerance. The difference appears to be dose, context, and recovery: recreational training is typically low-repetition, supervised, and interspersed with rest, whereas occupational lifting is repetitive, cumulative, and fatiguing; I should explain this explicitly to patients so they understand why I may discourage repetitive 15 kg lifts at work yet permit structured heavy training in the gym with precautions [^1121LaxH] [^116GaXpt].

> Next, I should review current guideline philosophy. I need to ensure I am aligned with the shift away from blanket activity restriction, given evidence that it does not prevent preterm birth and can cause harm. Instead, guidelines emphasize individualized risk assessment, encouraging safe physical activity while modifying strenuous occupational exposures, which fits with a more precise, risk-stratified approach to lifting in pregnancy [^113QQnBd] [^1178s7uV].

> I will now examine individualization and documentation. I should confirm baseline fitness, prior pregnancy complications, current gestational age, and job demands, and then tailor advice; for a sedentary patient, even 10 kg may be a high single-lift load, whereas a trained athlete may safely handle heavier loads with supervision, but cumulative occupational burden should still be minimized; I should document specific limits and needed accommodations in writing for employers to support legal protections and shared decision-making [^113uWBMN] [^117DqMZV].

> But wait, what if there are red flags. I need to ensure patients know to stop lifting and seek care with any bleeding, leakage of fluid, regular contractions, decreased fetal movement, dizziness, chest pain, or severe musculoskeletal pain; in high-risk conditions such as threatened preterm labor, placenta previa, or significant cervical shortening, I should advise stricter lifting limits or temporary duty restrictions while coordinating care with occupational health and the employer [^117SQurY] [^1149nUw7].

> Next, I should review implementation supports. Employers often need education and a written clinician note to operationalize accommodations. Occupational medicine clinicians can help translate medical needs into job-specific controls, and policy frameworks require reasonable accommodations unless undue hardship is demonstrated, which supports phased adjustments as pregnancy advances [^1149nUw7] [^114BuhKK].

> In summary, I need to ensure my counseling is clear: occupational lifting carries dose-related risks for miscarriage, preterm birth, low birthweight, and pelvic girdle pain, so I recommend limiting single lifts to about 10 kg, avoiding high daily repetition of heavy loads, and keeping cumulative lifting under 100 kg when possible, with ergonomic modifications and documentation of accommodations. In contrast, recreational resistance training with experienced supervision can be continued with precautions, including avoidance of symptomatic supine positions and use of load and exertion cues that respect maternal comfort and fetal well-being, acknowledging that the upper safe limit for recreational loads remains uncertain and that listening to the body is essential [^11323JUV] [^116GaXpt] [^117GbMEY] [^1121LaxH] [^117SQurY].

Lifting during pregnancy is generally safe in moderation, but **limit single lifts to ≤ 10–12 kg** and avoid cumulative loads > 100 kg/day to reduce risks of miscarriage, preterm birth, and low birth weight [^116GaXpt] [^11323JUV]. After 20 weeks, **avoid lifting > 20 kg** or > 10 kg frequently (> 10×/day). Use proper technique (bend knees, keep load close, avoid twisting), take breaks, and listen to your body; stop if you feel pain, dizziness, or contractions. High-risk pregnancies or symptoms (bleeding, preterm labor, placenta previa) warrant stricter limits or avoidance. Most guidelines do not set a single weight limit; individualize based on fitness, job demands, and medical history.

## Risks associated with lifting during pregnancy

Lifting during pregnancy can pose several risks, including:

- **Miscarriage**: Lifting ≥ 11 kg is associated with increased miscarriage risk (OR 1.31) [^116GaXpt].

- **Preterm birth**: Lifting ≥ 10 kg frequently (≥ 10×/day) increases preterm birth risk (OR 1.24) [^11323JUV].

- **Low birth weight**: Cumulative lifting ≥ 100 kg/day is linked to low birth weight (OR 2.08) [^116GaXpt].

- **Musculoskeletal pain**: Heavy lifting increases pelvic girdle pain and antenatal leave risk [^117GbMEY].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

There is **no universal weight limit** for lifting during pregnancy; guidelines are individualized:

- **General population**: Most healthy pregnant women can safely lift ≤ 10–12 kg occasionally [^notfound].

- **High-risk pregnancies**: Stricter limits or avoidance may be recommended for conditions such as placenta previa, preterm labor, or cervical insufficiency [^1178s7uV].

- **Occupational guidelines**: NIOSH suggests provisional limits of ≤ 10 kg for occasional lifts and ≤ 5 kg for frequent lifts (> 10×/day) [^notfound].

---

## Trimester-specific considerations

Lifting recommendations vary by **trimester**:

| **Trimester** | **Recommended lifting limits** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| First trimester | ≤ 10–12 kg occasionally | - Minimal fetal risk <br/> - But avoid heavy or frequent lifting |
| Second trimester | - ≤ 10 kg frequently <br/> - Avoid > 20 kg | - Growing uterus shifts center of gravity <br/> - Increases musculoskeletal strain |
| Third trimester | - ≤ 5–7 kg frequently <br/> - Avoid > 10–12 kg | - Increased risk of preterm labor <br/> - Pelvic pressure <br/> - Musculoskeletal strain |

---

## Individual factors influencing lifting capacity

Several factors influence safe lifting during pregnancy:

- **Pre-pregnancy fitness level**: Fitter individuals may safely lift more with proper technique [^1121LaxH].

- **Job demands**: Physically demanding jobs may require accommodations or restrictions [^117GbMEY].

- **Medical history**: Prior pregnancy complications or musculoskeletal conditions may necessitate stricter limits [^116vJmM1].

---

## Proper lifting techniques and precautions

To minimize risks, **use the following techniques**:

- **Proper posture**: Keep feet shoulder-width apart, bend knees, and keep the load close to the body.

- **Avoid twisting**: Turn your whole body instead of twisting at the waist.

- **Take breaks**: Frequent breaks reduce fatigue and musculoskeletal strain.

- **Use assistive devices**: Dollies, carts, or adjustable tables can reduce load.

- **Listen to your body**: Stop immediately if you experience pain, dizziness, or contractions.

---

## Potential consequences of exceeding recommended limits

Exceeding recommended lifting limits can lead to:

- **Increased risk of miscarriage**: Especially with frequent lifting ≥ 10 kg [^11323JUV].

- **Preterm labor**: Higher risk with heavy or frequent lifting [^116GaXpt].

- **Musculoskeletal injury**: Pelvic girdle pain and low back pain are common [^115jc56N].

- **Fetal growth restriction**: Associated with heavy physical workload [^114HULdp].

---

## Special considerations for high-risk pregnancies

High-risk pregnancies require additional precautions. Conditions such as placenta previa, preterm labor, cervical insufficiency, and multiple gestations may warrant **stricter lifting limits or avoidance**, and patients should follow individualized medical advice and workplace accommodations [^1178s7uV] [^1149nUw7].

---

## Legal and occupational considerations

Pregnant employees have legal protections, including **reasonable accommodations** and protection from discrimination [^114BuhKK]. Employers should conduct risk assessments and adjust workloads as needed [^112FFnEF].

---

## Summary of key recommendations

- **Limit single lifts**: ≤ 10–12 kg occasionally.

- **Avoid frequent heavy lifting**: > 10 kg > 10×/day.

- **Trimester-specific limits**: Stricter in the third trimester.

- **Use proper technique**: Bend knees, keep load close, avoid twisting.

- **Listen to your body**: Stop if you feel pain, dizziness, or contractions.

- **High-risk pregnancies**: Follow individualized medical advice.

---

Lifting during pregnancy is generally safe with **moderation and proper technique**; individualize limits based on fitness, job demands, and medical history, and avoid heavy or frequent lifting to reduce maternal and fetal risks.

### Public health guidelines for physical activity during pregnancy from around the world: a scoping review [^117SQurY]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

Despite the known health benefits of physical activity (PA), pregnancy is a time of marked decline in PA levels. To provide women with reliable and trustworthy information, and to encourage greater participation in PA during pregnancy, many governments have developed guidelines for PA during pregnancy. Our aim was to synthesise the most recent public health guidelines on PA during pregnancy from different countries in order to understand the nature and extent of advice that is available.

Design

Scoping review.

Data Sources

Search of the grey literature, direct contact with international experts, screening of relevant academic literature and citation searching.

Eligibility Criteria

Public health guidelines developed or endorsed by government departments published since 2010.

Results

Our search located 30 eligible guidelines, published in 11 different languages. There is remarkable concordance in the advice offered. For women with uncomplicated pregnancy, guidelines recommend: 150–300min/week of moderate intensity aerobic activity; pelvic floor and muscle strengthening exercises; modification of some exercises (eg, supine position); and provide lists of warning signs to cease activity (eg, persistent dizziness, vaginal bleeding) and activities that should be avoided (eg, if high risk of falling/collision). Few guidelines offer specific advice for highly active women (eg, athletes), or trimester-specific or culturally specific considerations.

Conclusions

This review provides a summary of public health recommendations for PA during pregnancy around the world. The challenge is now to ensure that all who provide healthcare for women understand the guidelines and encourage safe participation in PA during pregnancy.

### Pregnancy vs. paycheck: a qualitative study of patient's experience with employment during pregnancy at high risk for preterm birth [^113tNDJy]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Collaborative employer/employee accommodations

Some of the most positive employment experiences recounted were collaborative efforts between the participant and her employer to adjust the workplace environment and job duties allowing the participant to continue performing her job duties while feeling safe and supported. A healthcare worker described: " They were very supportive. They told me that, you know, I wanted to do night shift and I wanted to do like an easier hall, like maybe rehab or something like that, and they were completely open to it; they were fine".

Another healthcare worker, whose job required several hours of sitting and typing, described how her employer helped to make her workstation more comfortable:

"… if I need to be off or whatever, if I needed any accommodations to my workspace like, I had to buy, I didn't have to buy it, they reimbursed me for it, but just different, like back supports and footstools and stuff that I started needing later 'cause I was sitting a lot you know, they reimburse for, but anything I mean anything I needed they were onboard for".

Employer-initiated accommodations

In other situations, workplace restrictions stemmed from the employer's perception of safe working conditions during pregnancy. For example, a real estate worker explained that her manager " barely lets me carry the water " even though her medical provider had not recommended any lifting restrictions. Another participant working in food service without any provider-documented restrictions, described how her employer frequently considered her pregnancy: " They were strict with me of doing a lot of things. I couldn't lift nothing, I couldn't do too much bending like, kind of you know, they took my health into consideration, most definitely. "

### Provisional recommended weight limits for manual lifting… [^114spjZY]. stacks.cdc.gov (2014). Low credibility.

Provisional Recommended Weight Limits for Manual Lifting During Pregnancy Supporting Files 2 2014 By Waters, Thomas R.; MacDonald, Leslie A.; Hudock, Stephen D. ;. File Language: English. Details Alternative Title: Hum Factors Personal Author: Description: Objective The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Revised Lifting Equation was adapted to derive recommended weight limits for pregnant workers and to develop corresponding guidelines for clinicians. Background. In the past three decades there has been a large increase in the number of women employed outside the home and remaining in the workforce during pregnancy. Practical authoritative guidelines based on accumulated evidence are needed to inform allowable work activity levels for healthy pregnant workers. Method Empirically based lifting criteria established by NIOSH to reduce the risk of overexertion injuries in the general U. S.

working population were evaluated for application to pregnant workers. Our evaluation included an extensive review of the literature linking occupational lifting to maternal and fetal health. Decision logic and supporting literature are presented, along with computational details. Results Provisional RWLs for pregnant workers were derived from the RNLE, along with guidelines for clinicians. The guidelines advise against pregnant workers lifting below midshin and overhead. Conclusion Based on our review of the available evidence, we present lifting thresholds that most pregnant workers with uncomplicated pregnancies should be able to perform without increased risk of adverse maternal and fetal health consequences. Except for restrictions involving lifting from the floor and overhead, the provisional guidelines presented are compatible with NIOSH lifting recommendations adopted in the early 1990s for the general working population.

Application Implementation of these provisional guidelines could protect millions of female workers in the work-place from fetal and maternal lifting-related health problems.

### Reflections on workplace adjustments for pregnant employees: a qualitative study of the experiences of pregnant employees and their managers [^116vJmM1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

In Scandinavia, it is common for women to work during pregnancy. The European Union directive requires employers to assess safety measures to ensure the health of pregnant women at the workplace. Despite this, the rate of sick leave among pregnant Scandinavian women is relatively high. Two-thirds of pregnant women take 48 to 73 days of sick leave while pregnant. Sick leave has been associated with individual factors such as maternal age, being overweight, socioeconomic status, and assisted reproductive therapy. Physical work factors (e.g. heavy lifting, and night or shift work) and stressful working conditions have also been identified as factors that increase the likelihood of sick leave during pregnancy. Workplace adjustments have been found to reduce the number of days of sick leave taken by pregnant women. However, studies indicate that not all pregnant women who need such adjustments find that they are made. A review by Salihu et al. (2012) recommended that occupational risk assessments be conducted for pregnant employees. They also suggested that the assessments may be made by the employee's healthcare provider, as well as by occupational medicine clinics. This is especially important for women exposed to radiation, solvents, and chemicals at their workplaces. Moreover, Salihu et al. (2012) emphasize that even though manual labor and physically demanding jobs do not pose major risks to fetal health, a combination of significant physicality and other factors, such as long work hours, should be reduced, as a moderate, temporary reduction in physical exertion may improve maternal and fetal health. Last, they note the importance of giving attention to women with a history of pregnancy-related complications, and to the workplace culture.

### The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal healthcare costs: a time series analysis of pregnancies of multi-ethnic mothers in south london, United Kingdom [^111DB6xW]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Maternity care costs declined in association with the COVID-19 pandemic, with onset of pandemic lockdowns and then with lifting of all restrictions; however, there was no effect on the trend of rising costs seen pre-pandemic, despite the most severe public health crisis in the last century. Of importance for planning future maternity services, is our findings that virtual antenatal care appears to be more expensive than face-to-face care, and the cost-neutral nature of digital technology to support GDM self-monitoring of glycaemic control. Further research on the effects of virtual care and GDm-Health use on clinical outcomes is needed to inform future guidelines on antenatal care delivery, especially during health system shocks.

### Risk factors for pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain: a scoping review [^115gGRGr]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Risk factors for PPGP in any trimester of pregnancy/trimester not specified examined in one study

Ten studies examined 48 physical factors, 29 socio-demographic factors, and one psychological factor in relationship to PPGP in any trimester of pregnancy (Table 6). Findings are also provided in extended tabular format in additional file 4.

Table 6
Risk factor for PPGP in any trimester/trimester not specified examined in only one study

Table 7
Recommendation for future research

Low back pain during pregnancy (n = 2853; β coefficient 0.514; p < 0.001) or having a history of untreated low back pain (n = 1516; OR 1.5 [1.1–2.0]; p = 0.01) was positively associated with PPGP, but having received past treatment for low back pain from a doctor (n = 869; OR 1.6 [1.0–2.8]; p = 0.07), chiropractor (n = 1009; OR 0.8 [0.6–1.1]; p = 0.2) or physiotherapist (n = 1163; OR 0.8 [0.6–1.1]; p = 0.2) was not associated with PPGP. Low back pain (n = 306; RR 3.5 [1.7–6.8]; p = 0.0004) or pelvic girdle pain (n = 306; RR 4.7 [1.8–11.8]; p = 0.001) in the year before pregnancy were also positively associated with moderate to severe PPGP, and a history of back, bone or joint disease (n = 1516; OR 2.4 [1.6–3.5]; p < 0.0001) or previous lower abdominal pain (n = 1516; AOR 3.1 [1.9–5.15]; p < 0.01) were associated with PPGP. Women who had PPGP in their first pregnancy were more likely to have PPGP in their second pregnancy (n = 682; RR 57.3 [14.5–81.2]), but the time since the first birth was not associated with PPGP (n = 1861; AOR 0.9 [0.8–1.0]). Lifting heavy loads (n = 3284; OR 1.3 [1.0–1.7]; p = 0.04), having to carry heavy loads (n = 1516; OR 1.9 [1.4–2.6]; p < 0.0001), bending forward (n = 3062; β coefficient 0.05; p < 0.05), twisting and bending at work (n = 3062; β coefficient 0.039; p < 0.05), working in uncomfortable positions (n = 1516; AOR 1.7 [1.1–2.5]; p < 0.05), working in a draft/cold (n = 1516; AOR 2.1 [1.4–3.1]; p = 0.01), and combined oral contraceptive (n = 1684; AOR 1.7 [1.2–2.3]) all carried increased risk of PPGP, but strain at work (n = 3062; β coefficient 0.045; p > 0.05), having more than 10 steps of stairs at work (n = 1516; OR 1.1 [0.8–1.4]; p = 0.6), or working with chemicals (n = 1516; 1.1 [0.7–1.6]; p = 0.7) did not carry greater risk. Women who drank four or more cups of coffee daily were also more likely to report PPGP (n = 3286; OR 1.8 [1.3–2.4]; p = 0.0001), and mild pre-eclampsia (n = 81,142; OR 2.2 [1.2–4.0]; p = 0.01), diabetes mellitus (n = 81,142; OR 1.8 [1.1–3.0]; p = 0.02) and gestational diabetes (n = 81,142; OR 1.8 [1.0–3.2]; p = 0.03) were positively associated with symphysiolysis. Previous caesarean section (n = 81,142; OR 0.8 [0.5–1.3]; p = 0.4), recurrent abortion (n = 81,142; OR 1.4 [0.8–2.5]; p = 0.3), severe pre-eclampsia (n = 81,142; OR 0.5 [0.07–3.9]; p = 0.5), chronic hypertension (n = 81,142; OR 1.1 [0.4–3.6]; p = 0.8), pregestational diabetes mellitus (n = 81,142; OR 1.6 [0.5–5.15]; p = 0.4) and premature rupture of membranes (n = 81,142; OR 1.0 [0.6–1.8]; p = 0.9) were not associated with symphysiolysis. Women who exercised once a week (n = 1516; AOR 0.6 [0.4–0.9]; p < 0.01) or exercised at least two to three times a week before pregnancy (n = 306; OR 0.6 [0.3–0.9]; p = 0.02) were less likely to have PPGP. There was no association between the number of pregnancies and PPGP.

### Reproductive and developmental hazard management [^114BuhKK]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Legal considerations — protections and employer obligations for pregnant employees include that women who are pregnant or affected by related conditions must be treated in the same manner as other applicants or employees with similar abilities or limitations, and pregnant employees who can perform their jobs should be allowed to continue working. Determining accommodations or leave for pregnancy-related conditions may require the employee to submit physician information before granting leave or reassignment. Additional protections arise from the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the ADA Amendments Act (ADAAA) of 2008, and the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which require reasonable accommodation unless the disabled worker presents a direct threat to health and safety.

### Pushing limits: the acute effects of a heavy-load resistance protocol and supine exercise on fetal well-being [^112DsF4R]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Heavy-load resistance protocol

All participants reported being familiar with the exercises and had regularly included them in their training before and/or during pregnancy. Nevertheless, an exercise physiologist demonstrated each movement to ensure correct technique and safety. This was followed by a structured warm-up, during which the load was gradually increased to prepare for the resistance exercises and determine the appropriate weight for maintaining one repetition in reserve (RIR), meaning one repetition away from failure. This intensity was chosen as it exceeds current recommendations for resistance training during pregnancy.

After a structured warm-up, participants completed three sets of eight repetitions in sumo deadlift, bench press and incline bench press (30° bench angle). Loads were individually adjusted to maintain one RIR, ensuring high yet controlled intensity corresponding to approximately 76% of 1 RM. Each set was followed by a standardised 90 s rest period to allow partial recovery while sustaining workout intensity, in line with evidence for hypertrophic adaptations using moderate to heavy loads. All lifts were closely supervised and spotted by an exercise physiologist. While the working period was not time-restricted, on average, each set of eight repetitions took 30 s. After completing three sets of one exercise, ultrasound assessments were conducted within 30 s and lasted approximately 4 min before participants proceeded directly to the next exercise. This procedure was repeated for all three exercises.

The sumo deadlift, bench press and incline bench press were selected because they are multi-joint, compound exercises that activate multiple muscle groups and enhance muscle engagement. These exercises are commonly included in standard training routines and promote functional strength that directly translates to daily activities and sports performance. The rationale for including both the bench press and incline bench press was to examine potential differences in the occurrence of symptoms of vena cava syndrome between exercises in the supine and incline positions. This was assessed by asking the open question: "Did the exercise make you feel dizzy, light-headed, nauseous, or otherwise unwell?".

### Obstetrician practice patterns and recommendations for physical activity during pregnancy [^114YFK7B]. Journal of Women's Health (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Methods

Many women do not attain minimum American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommendations for physical activity during pregnancy. This study assessed the self-reported practice patterns and recommendations of 384 obstetricians working in Texas through a mailed survey on physical activity during pregnancy.

Results

The most common exercise elements routinely collected from pregnant women included types of exercise (81%), history of exercise before pregnancy (79%), and frequency of exercise (76%). Fewer obstetricians collected duration (68%) or intensity (69%) of exercise. The percentage of obstetricians recommending avoidance of nine household activities and exercises (including lifting groceries, starting a new exercise program, or participating in walking, jogging, or bicycling) was significantly higher with each successive trimester. Most obstetricians agreed that pregnant women would gain some benefit from mild exercise (99.5%), but fewer agreed that moderate (74%) or vigorous exercise (6%) would be beneficial. Sixty-two percent of obstetricians reported that women who have never exercised could begin an exercise program during pregnancy. Almost all participants agreed that physical activity might make a woman feel more energetic (98%) and improve her labor and delivery (89%), but fewer agreed that exercise during pregnancy causes lower weight babies (23%) or could trigger labor (18%).

Conclusions

Dissemination of current recommendations and discussion about the benefits and risks of physical activity during pregnancy, such as through continuing education, appear warranted. Future research could address the causes of disparities between self-reported practice patterns and current ACOG guidelines.

### No global consensus: a cross-sectional survey of maternal weight policies [^1122pVd9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Background

There is growing evidence that pregnancy is a critical time to establish lifelong health for the mother and her offspring, with potential to interrupt the growing worldwide epidemics of obesity and non-communicable disease. Pre-pregnancy obesity and excessive gestational weight gain increase perinatal complications, contribute to the transmission of obesity and poor health to the next generation and increase permanent adiposity and related disease outcomes in the mother. Interpregnancy weight gain, which may reflect postpartum retention of gestational weight gain or new weight gain between pregnancies, has been associated with serious adverse pregnancy outcomes, even among mothers whose pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) is in the normal range for both first and second pregnancies. Fetal growth restriction resulting from maternal pre-pregnancy underweight and inadequate gestational weight gain may also contribute to poor adult health, as low birthweight, particularly when accompanied by catch-up growth, is associated with less lean body mass, higher visceral fat and increased metabolic syndrome in adulthood. Overall, the current evidence suggests that beginning pregnancy at a healthy weight (BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m²), having an appropriate amount of gestational weight gain (GWG) and losing excess weight postpartum are beneficial for both the short and long-term health of a mother and her child.

### One-year postpartum anthropometric outcomes in mothers and children in the LIFE-moms lifestyle intervention clinical trials [^114Qr9qw]. International Journal of Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Participants

Institutional review boards for each site and the LIFE-Moms Data and Safety Monitoring Board approved and monitored the conduct of the trials and consortium activities. Study participants provided written informed consent prior to participation. Across the seven trials, recruitment occurred primarily through obstetrician-gynecologist offices between November 2012 and December 2015. As described previously, the seven trials recruited participants in the following geographical regions and academic settings: (1) Healthy Beginnings; San Luis Obispo, California; California Polytechnic State University [Cal Poly]; and, Providence, Rhode Island; Brown University; (2) Lifestyle Intervention for Two (LIFT); New York, New York; Columbia University; (3) Pregnancy and EARly Life improvement Study (PEARLS); San Juan, Puerto Rico; University of Puerto Rico; (4) Maternal-Offspring Metabolics: Family Intervention Trial (MOMFIT); Chicago, Illinois; Northwestern University; (5) PreGO; St Louis, Missouri; Washington University; (6) Expecting Success; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Pennington Biomedical Research Center, and; (7) Phoenix LIFE-Moms; Phoenix, Arizona; NIDDK/Phoenix Indian Medical Center. Common eligibility criteria across the trials included gestational age between 9 and 16 weeks assessed by ultrasound, body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m² based on study entry measured weight and height, and singleton pregnancy. Women were excluded for maternal age < 18 years, diagnosis of diabetes prior to pregnancy or study assessed HbA1c ≥ 6.5% prior to randomization, history of three or more consecutive first trimester miscarriages, current use of exclusionary medications, contraindications to aerobic exercise in pregnancy and additional exclusion criteria. Recruitment in three trials was stopped early (PEARLS, Expecting Success, and Phoenix LIFE-Moms) by the NIH based on the recommendation of the LIFE-Moms Data and Safety Monitoring Board owing to the projected unlikelihood of accruing the target sample size within the time period allowed.

Standard care

Within each trial, eligible participants were randomly assigned to the local site intervention or to a comparison standard care group. Participants in the standard care group received all aspects of usual care offered by their prenatal care providers. Six of the seven trials supplemented standard care with additional educational content about pregnancy and postpartum health; these materials were provided throughout the study mainly for retention purposes.

### Evidence-based national guidelines for the management of suspected fetal growth restriction: comparison, consensus, and controversy [^113sgT7R]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Small for gestational age is usually defined as an infant with a birthweight < 10th centile for a population or customized standard. Fetal growth restriction refers to a fetus that has failed to reach its biological growth potential because of placental dysfunction. Small-for-gestational-age babies make up 28–45% of nonanomalous stillbirths, and have a higher chance of neurodevelopmental delay, childhood and adult obesity, and metabolic disease. The majority of small-for-gestational-age babies are not recognized before birth. Improved identification, accompanied by surveillance and timely delivery, is associated with reduction in small-for-gestational-age stillbirths. Internationally and regionally, detection of small for gestational age and management of fetal growth problems vary considerably. The aim of this review is to: summarize areas of consensus and controversy between recently published national guidelines on small for gestational age or fetal growth restriction; highlight any recent evidence that should be incorporated into existing guidelines; and identify future research priorities in this field. A search of MEDLINE, Google, and the International Guideline Library identified 6 national guidelines on management of pregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction/small for gestational age published from 2010 onwards. There is general consensus between guidelines (at least 4 of 6 guidelines in agreement) in early pregnancy risk selection, and use of low-dose aspirin for women with major risk factors for placental insufficiency. All highlight the importance of smoking cessation to prevent small for gestational age. While there is consensus in recommending fundal height measurement in the third trimester, 3 specify the use of a customized growth chart, while 2 recommend McDonald rule. Routine third-trimester scanning is not recommended for small-for-gestational-age screening, while women with major risk factors should have serial scanning in the third trimester. Umbilical artery Doppler studies in suspected small-for-gestational-age pregnancies are universally advised, however there is inconsistency in the recommended frequency for growth scans after diagnosis of small for gestational age/fetal growth restriction (2–4 weekly). In late-onset fetal growth restriction (≥ 32 weeks) general consensus is to use cerebral Doppler studies to influence surveillance and/or delivery timing. Fetal surveillance methods (most recommend cardiotocography) and recommended timing of delivery vary. There is universal agreement on the use of corticosteroids before birth at < 34 weeks, and general consensus on the use of magnesium sulfate for neuroprotection in early-onset fetal growth restriction (< 32 weeks). Most guidelines advise using cardiotocography surveillance to plan delivery in fetal growth restriction < 32 weeks. The recommended gestation at delivery for fetal growth restriction with absent and reversed end-diastolic velocity varies from 32 to ≥ 34 weeks and 30 to ≥ 34 weeks, respectively. Overall, where there is high-quality evidence from randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses, eg, use of umbilical artery Doppler and corticosteroids for delivery < 34 weeks, there is a high degree of consistency between national small-for-gestational-age guidelines. This review discusses areas where there is potential for convergence between small-for-gestational-age guidelines based on existing randomized controlled trials of management of small-for-gestational-age pregnancies, and areas of controversy. Research priorities include assessing the utility of late third-trimester scanning to prevent major morbidity and mortality and to investigate the optimum timing of delivery in fetuses with late-onset fetal growth restriction and abnormal Doppler parameters. Prospective studies are needed to compare new international population ultrasound standards with those in current use.

### Why can' T I exercise during pregnancy? Time to revisit medical'absolute' and' relative' contraindications: systematic review of evidence of harm and a call to action [^1178s7uV]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinical guidelines recommend pregnant women without contraindication engage in regular physical activity. This is based on extensive evidence demonstrating the safety and benefits of prenatal exercise. However, certain medical conditions or contraindications warrant a reduction, modification or cessation of activity due to potential health risks.

Aim

To review and evaluate the evidence related to medical disorders which may warrant contraindication to prenatal exercise.

Methods

Online databases were searched up to 5 April 2019. Forty-four unique studies that reported data on our Population (pregnant women with contraindication to exercise), Intervention (subjective/objective measures of acute or chronic exercise), Comparator (not essential) and Outcomes (adverse maternal or fetal outcomes) were included in the review.

Key Findings

We found that the majority of medical conditions listed as contraindications were based on expert opinion; there is minimal empirical evidence to demonstrate harm of exercise and benefit of activity restriction. We identified 11 complications (eg, gestational hypertension, twin pregnancy) previously classified as contraindications where women may in fact benefit from regular prenatal physical activity with or without modifications. However, the evidence suggests that severe cardiorespiratory disease, placental abruption, vasa previa, uncontrolled type 1 diabetes, intrauterine growth restriction, active preterm labour, severe pre-eclampsia and cervical insufficiency are associated with strong potential for maternal/fetal harm and warrant classification as absolute contraindications.

Conclusion

Based on empirical evidence, we provide a call to re-evaluate clinical guidelines related to medical disorders that have previously been considered contraindications to prenatal exercise. Removing barriers to physical activity during pregnancy for women with certain medical conditions may in fact be beneficial for maternal-fetal health outcomes.

### Reflections on workplace adjustments for pregnant employees: a qualitative study of the experiences of pregnant employees and their managers [^113ZhApT]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Managers' perspectives: difficulties of managing the problems experienced by pregnant employees

Pregnant employees push themselves

The managers sometimes had difficulty managing the problems experienced by pregnant employees. Several managers mentioned that some pregnant employees pushed themselves too hard. In the interviews, they commented on the question of pregnant employees who they thought were too proud to ask for and accept workplace adjustments. One of the managers described an employee who was usually capable of lifting as much as the male employees in the shop, but during her pregnancy she was not able to work and do the heavy lifting as she was used to. It was difficult for her to adjust to her new situation, and therefore the manager had to be aware of this, and keep telling her to take care of herself, instead of pushing herself too hard. When pregnant employees had difficulty accepting their need for workplace adjustments, the managers felt that they had to be more attentive to their difficulties.

Difficulties planning and/or organizing work-related tasks

Managers mentioned challenges related to planning and organizing work-related tasks, because the pregnant employees' condition sometimes changed from one day to the next, and they would lack the time to make useful, alternative arrangements. Moreover, they did not always know what to expect, or how much to demand of pregnant employees. Therefore, some of them asked pregnant employees about their healthcare providers' recommendations. These recommendations were often used to justify and legitimize workplace adjustments or absences from the workplace, and they sometimes made it easier for pregnant employees and their managers to balance the workplace adjustments, and informed them about how to respond to various symptoms. Healthcare providers seemed to play a key role in offering advice about a given situation, and when consulted, they sometimes had a strong influence on future adjustments and developments in pregnant employees' work. According to the managers, pregnant employees sometimes managed to remain on the job because of guidance from these professionals; in other situations, they immediately recommended sick leave, because of the job's demands.

Finally, managers mentioned possible challenges and dilemmas related to the fact that adjustments for pregnant employees should not adversely affect other employees. One manager emphasized that "It must not be that pregnant employees are penalized It is a balance" (Manager, hotel).

These statements by managers reveal a possible challenge, as they are responsible for managing the workplace and ensuring workplace adjustments for pregnant employees, and at the same time, they must balance the probability of an increased workload for the other employees, which is often uncompensated.

### Association between distance to an abortion facility and abortion or pregnancy outcome among a prospective cohort of people seeking abortion online [^11572TgY]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Innovative approaches to abortion care can help lessen the burdens associated with distance. Medication abortion provision in the US is currently limited by laws in 33 states that require medication abortion administration by a physicianand laws in 19 states that effectively ban telehealth provision. The federal government recently permanently lifted the in-person requirement for the provision of medication abortion, thereby allowing dispensing via telehealth and mail, but individuals in those 19 states cannot avail of this evolution in access. Lifting state restrictions on telehealth could substantially improve access to abortion for people in the US, particularly individuals living 50 miles or more from an abortion facility, and is supported by current evidence for the safety, acceptability, and feasibility of expanded provision of medication abortion. Furthermore, research simulating the association of service delivery innovations with abortion rates found that making telehealth abortion widely available or integrating abortion into primary care would be associated with increased access and reduced unmet need for abortion in the US.

Given increases in the number of state-level abortion restrictions during the past decade and concerns about the continued legality of abortion across the US, travel distances to obtain abortions are likely to increase and be associated with decreases in abortion rates and increases in instances of self-managed abortion, unplanned pregnancy rates, and maternal morbidity and mortality. The outcomes associated with a persistent decline in abortion facilities warrant continued monitoring and research.

### FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) initiative on fetal growth: best practice advice for screening, diagnosis, and management of fetal growth restriction [^112uUD75]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is defined as the failure of the fetus to meet its growth potential due to a pathological factor, most commonly placental dysfunction. Worldwide, FGR is a leading cause of stillbirth, neonatal mortality, and short‐ and long‐term morbidity. Ongoing advances in clinical care, especially in definitions, diagnosis, and management of FGR, require efforts to effectively translate these changes to the wide range of obstetric care providers. This article highlights agreements based on current research in the diagnosis and management of FGR, and the areas that need more research to provide further clarification of recommendations.

The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive summary of available evidence along with practical recommendations concerning the care of pregnancies at risk of or complicated by FGR, with the overall goal to decrease the risk of stillbirth and neonatal mortality and morbidity associated with this condition. To achieve these goals, FIGO (the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) brought together international experts to review and summarize current knowledge of FGR.

This summary is directed at multiple stakeholders, including healthcare providers, healthcare delivery organizations and providers, FIGO member societies, and professional organizations. Recognizing the variation in the resources and expertise available for the management of FGR in different countries or regions, this article attempts to take into consideration the unique aspects of antenatal care in low‐resource settings (labelled "LRS" in the recommendations). This was achieved by collaboration with authors and FIGO member societies from low‐resource settings such as India, Sub‐Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America.

Aspects of FGR addressed in this article include prediction, diagnosis, investigation, management, and postpartum counselling. The main recommendations are given below and are summarized in Table 1 (section 8) and in the management algorithms for high‐resource settings (Figure 1a) and low‐resource settings (Figure 1b) (section 4).

### Impact of heavy resistance training on pregnancy and postpartum health outcomes [^111Vn8yp]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Participation in Olympic weightlifting, the Valsalva maneuver, and acute or prolonged supine weightlifting during pregnancy are cautioned against; however, these recommendations are based on expert opinions as opposed to empirical evidence. The aim of this study was to examine the training and health outcomes of individuals who engaged in heavy resistance training during pregnancy.

Methods

A total of 679 individuals who lifted at least 80% one-repetition maximum during pregnancy participated in an online survey.

Results

Participants were primarily recreational athletes (88%, 332 out of 675) engaged in CrossFit™ (61%, 410 out of 675) and/or weightlifting (49%, 332 out of 675) during pregnancy. Most participants reported no complications during pregnancy or delivery (66%, 388 out of 589), whereas 57% (241 out of 426) reported urinary incontinence following pregnancy. Participants who maintained pre-pregnancy training levels until delivery reported significantly less reproductive complications than those who ceased training levels prior to delivery (p = 0.006). Most respondents engaged in Olympic lifting (72%, 311 out of 432) and lifting in a supine position (71%, 306 out of 437), whereas fewer reported use of the Valsalva maneuver during pregnancy (34%, 142 out of 412). Most returned to weightlifting following delivery (89%, 400 out of 447, average: 3.2 ± 3.0 months), including Olympic lifting (81%, 300 out of 372, average: 4.0 ± 3.4 months) and Valsalva (62%, 213 out of 341, average: 4.5 ± 3.6 months).

Conclusions

Individuals who engaged in heavy prenatal resistance training had typical perinatal and pelvic floor health outcomes that were not altered whether they engaged in, or avoided Olympic lifting, Valsalva or supine weightlifting.

WARNING: EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY – CONTRAINDICATED IN PREGNANCY

ABSORICA/ABSORICA LD can cause life-threatening birth defects and is contraindicated in pregnancy.

There is an extremely high risk that life-threatening birth defects will result if pregnancy occurs while taking any amount of ABSORICA/ABSORICA LD even for short periods of time. Potentially any fetus exposed during pregnancy can be affected. There are no accurate means of determining prenatally whether an exposed fetus has been affected. If pregnancy occurs, discontinue ABSORICA/ABSORICA LD immediately and refer the patient to an Obstetrician- Gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Because of the risk of embryo-fetal toxicity, ABSORICA and ABSORICA LD are available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the iPLEDGE REMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Pregnant at work: time for prenatal care providers to act [^11595z1i]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Fifty years ago, when a woman became pregnant, she was expected to stop working. Today, however, most women who work are the primary, sole, or co-breadwinner for their families, and their earnings during pregnancy are often essential to their families' economic well-being. Medical data about working during pregnancy are sparse but generally show that both low-risk and high-risk women can tolerate work-related duties well, although some work accommodations (eg, providing a chair for sitting, allowing snacks, or modifying the work schedule) may be necessary. However, some employers refuse to accommodate pregnant women who need adjustments. This can result in a woman being forced to make the choice between working without accommodations and losing her income and health insurance or even her job. Prenatal care providers can play an important role by implementing changes in their own practice, shaping public policy, and conducting research to increase protections for pregnant women and to ensure that they receive medically recommended accommodations while continuing to earn income for their growing families.

### Trends and determinants of pregnancy loss in Eastern Ethiopia from 2008 to 2019: analysis of health and demographic surveillance data [^116J49Mn]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The overall rate pregnancy loss was just above 20 per 1000 births and sharply increased between 2012 and 2015 then became irregular up to 2019. Pregnancy loss was absolutely related to social factors (including haven't own financial income and being daily laborer), and pregnancy experience (including unwanted pregnancy, previous pregnancy not alive). However negatively associated with prenatal services (ANC, and TT vaccine) exposure of the mothers.

Pregnancy loss was more common among women without their own sources of income. Previous study conducted in Republic of Korea indicated the low income level is related to any negative pregnancy outcome. Mothers who generate self-income are reported to have more power to make decision on family planning, and other maternal health service utilization.

Women who worked as daily laborers had a greater odd of pregnancy loss than housewives. Although it is difficult to draw strong conclusions, because they tend to be retrospective and confounded by alternatives, occupation can affect the pregnancy in different ways. One reason of pregnancy loss among daily laborer might be from occupational and environmental exposures like smoking, alcohol, and caffeine-have. The other cause might occupational hazardous or accidents as daily laborer are expected to lift heavy materials. Studies strengthen this evidence by reporting daily laborer women are working marginal, casual jobs with little regulatory protection, they hustle from engagement to engagement, typically for as little pay or as many hours the boss wants. Hence the long working hours and physical exertion, likely affect obstetric outcomes.

### Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine consult series # 50: the role of activity restriction in obstetric management: (replaces consult number 33, August 2014) [^113QQnBd]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite current recommendations against its use, activity restriction remains a common intervention used to prevent preterm birth in multiple clinical settings. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, preterm premature rupture of membranes, multiple gestations, vaginal bleeding, short cervical length, placenta previa, and fetal growth restriction are also common reasons for antepartum hospital admission and frequently lead to a recommendation for activity restriction. However, numerous reports have shown that activity restriction does not prevent adverse obstetrical outcomes but does confer significant physical and psychosocial risks. This consult reviews the current literature on activity restriction and examines the evidence regarding its use in obstetrical management. The recommendations by the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine are as follows: (1) we recommend against the routine use of any type of activity restriction in pregnant women at risk of preterm birth based on preterm labor symptoms, arrested preterm labor, or shortened cervix (GRADE 1B); (2) we recommend against the use of routine inpatient hospitalization and activity restriction for the prevention of preterm birth in women with multiple gestations (GRADE 1A); and (3) given the lack of data definitively demonstrating that activity restriction improves perinatal outcome in pregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction, preterm premature rupture of membranes, or hypertensive diseases of pregnancy, coupled with evidence of adverse effects of activity restriction, we suggest that activity restriction not be prescribed for the treatment of pregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction, preterm premature rupture of membranes, or hypertensive disease (GRADE 2B).

### Thoracotomies in children in low to middle income countries: the indications for surgery [^114Wu3mm]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Another big discrepancy between high‐income countries and LMICs is the number of thoracotomies performed on children. In the German study there were only 49 thoracotomies performed on children over a 9‐year study span (average 5.4 per year), whilst in our study there were 182 thoracotomies performed over a 5‐year study span, average 36.4 per year. This difference is mostly due to the much larger burden of infectious and congenital indications for thoracotomy in LMIC compared to high‐income countries. Congenital lung lesions are diagnosed late in LMICs due to the lack of antenatal ultrasound during pregnancy.

COVID‐19 has also had an impact on the number of thoracotomies performed at Tygerberg Hospital. This is noticeable by 2020 (n = 28) and 2021 (n = 31), which had the least number of thoracotomies performed. The most thoracotomies were performed in 2022 (n = 46), most likely due to patients who were unable to have thoracotomies in 2020 and 2021 and only presented in 2022 when the COVID‐19 restrictions were lifted.

### Synopsis of the 2023 U.S. department of VA and U.S. DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of pregnancy [^111Bg2Rq]. Military Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Pelvic muscle function — A brief pelvic floor muscle evaluation should be conducted early in pregnancy, using a single-digit palpation to assess pelvic muscle strength, with follow-up instructions on how to properly facilitate an appropriate muscle contraction without compensatory patterns; if a patient is unable to activate their pelvic floor musculature, referral to a pelvic health rehabilitation specialist for PFMT would be appropriate. A pelvic floor muscle activation exercise involves a muscle contraction and upward/inward movement of at least the following muscles: levator ani, obturator internus, transverse perineal, bulbocavernosus, ischiocavernosus, and anal sphincters. The quality of the pelvic muscle contraction can be documented with the Laycock Pelvic Floor Manual Muscle Test Scale, which uses a 6-point Oxford scale (0 = no contraction, 1 = flicker, 2 = weak, 3 = moderate, 4 = good [with lift], and 5 = strong) during the internal examination to measure pelvic floor muscle strength in women. Defined as repeated voluntary muscle contractions, PFMT can be conducted independently or with supervision by trained providers as part of a comprehensive exercise program during pregnancy, and provider feedback training on proper pelvic floor muscle activation is critical before prescribing PFMT to patients. Providers should also screen and adhere to trauma-informed care concepts while considering a patient's receptivity to pelvic examinations; rates of sexual trauma are known to be high in military female Veterans and Service members, the recommended examination and training can be conducted easily in a short amount of time during an early pregnancy visit concurrent with a cervical cancer screening or ultrasound examination, and if the patient is unable to appropriately activate the pelvic floor musculature or has a significant weakness, referral to a pelvic health rehabilitation specialist for further evaluation and treatment would be suitable. See Table 12 and Recommendation 5 and Recommendation 6 for further details.

Carbohydrate-restricted diet — background in pregnancy highlights intake thresholds and observed patterns: the Institute of Medicine's guidelines "recommend that pregnant women supplement their daily intake for at least a total of 175 grams of carbohydrates", and "some experts suggest an even higher recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of 220 grams to account for the estimated 35 grams of carbohydrate required by the placenta in the third trimester". Risk is noted that "extreme carbohydrate restriction (< 95 g/day) during pregnancy is associated with a 20% to 100% increased risk of neural tube defects (NTDs)". Observational data report that "pregnant women with PDM consume 200 to 250 grams of carbohydrate daily (~50 g more than controls), indicating that up to a third of women could consume less than the recommended 175 grams", and a Scandinavian study "reported even lower intakes during pregnancy (159 g in T1DM and 167 g in T2DM), which translates to 40% to 50% of individuals with less carbohydrate intake than the IOM recommendation". Additionally, with adequate caloric intake, "the amount of carbohydrate intake (in the range of 100–250 g) is unrelated to ketone levels in pregnant women without obesity".

Risk factors for PPGP in the third trimester of pregnancy examined in one study

Forty-two physical factors, nine psychological factors and two socio-demographic potential risk factors for PPGP in the third trimester of pregnancy were examined in ten studies (Table 5). Findings are also provided in extended tabular format in additional file 3.

Table 5
Risk factor for PPGP in the third trimester examined in only one study

A history of postpartum low back pain, was positively associated with PPGP in the third trimester (n = 1164; OR 2.0 [1.4–2.8]; p = 0.0002). Women who had physically demanding work (4-point likert scale) were more likely to have PGS (n = 68,872; AOR 1.4 [1.4–1.5]; p < 0.001). A heavy or very heavy physical workload (n = 513; OR 1.9 [1.1–3.3]; p < 0.05) and a heavy or very heavy physical workload including lifting movements (n = 513; OR 1.9 [1.2–3.0]; p < 0.05) were also associated with an increased risk of symphysiolysis. Women with pubic symphysis pain reported higher pain (n = 268; AOR 35.5 [19.7–51.1]; p < 0.001) and disability (n = 268; AOR 11.8 [2.3–21.2]; p = 0.03) than women with posterior pain only, as did women with combined pubic symphysis and posterior PPGP (n = 268; AOR (pain) 16.5 [1.8–31.1]; p < 0.001). Kovacs et al. found women who had had instrument-assisted birth (n = 1164; OR 1.9 [1.4–2.6]; p < 0.0001) or epidural in previous birth (n = 1164; OR 1.5 [1.2–2]; p = 0.004) to be more likely to have PPGP. Disability in early pregnancy was a predictor of PPGP-related disability in the third trimester (n = 268; AOR 0.5 [0.3–0.6]; p < 0.001). Albert et al. found that a history of back trauma was positively associated (n = 2224; AOR 2.8; p < 0.001) with all subgroups of PPGP except symphysiolysis (n = 1771; p > 0.05).

Participants also described situations where their medical provider recommended modifications to their job duties. These medically recommended restrictions were met with varied reactions at the workplace. A participant working in retail described a very supportive response from her employer. She said, "They're supportive of me and they've been working with my accommodations… right now I'm on a twenty-five-pound weight restriction, so anything that would feel too heavy for me to lift, or to move, they actually do it for me". Other participants described more negative reactions from their employers upon requesting medically-recommended accommodations during the workday. Two participants recounted experiences in which they perceived that their employment was terminated due to a request for accommodations recommended by a medical provider. One participant shared her experience of being laid off from her job at a grocery store when she shared that her physician had recommended an accommodation to her job duties:

### The compliance of prescribed activity restriction in women at high risk for preterm birth [^1112itQk]. American Journal of Perinatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Despite lack of evidence to support efficacy, activity restriction is one of the most commonly prescribed interventions used for the prevention of preterm birth. We have a departmental policy against the use of activity restriction but many practitioners still prescribe it in an effort to prevent preterm birth. We sought to evaluate the rate and compliance of women who are prescribed activity restriction during pregnancy to prevent preterm birth.

Study Design

This was a single-site retrospective questionnaire study at a tertiary care, academic affiliated medical center. Women with a history of preterm delivery or short cervix were included. Once patients were identified, each patient was contacted and administered a questionnaire. We assessed the rates of activity restriction prescription and compliance. Secondary outcomes included details regarding activity restriction and treatment in pregnancy. Continuous variables were compared with t -test and categorical variables with Chi-square test. The value p < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results

Among the 52 women who responded to the questionnaire, 18 reported being placed on activity restriction by a physician, with 1 self-prescribing activity restriction, giving a rate of our primary outcome of 19 of 52 (36.5%). All women reported compliance with prescribed activity restriction (100%). Gestational age at delivery was not different in women placed on activity restriction.

Conclusion

This questionnaire suggests that approximately one in three high-risk women were placed on activity restriction during their pregnancy despite a departmental policy against its use. The 100% compliance rate in patients placed on activity restriction is a strong reminder of the impact prescribing patterns of physicians can have on patients.

Key Points

· One in three women are placed on activity restriction in pregnancy. · Women are compliant with prescribed activity restriction. · Activity restriction does not reduce rates of preterm birth.

### Reproductive and developmental hazard management [^116SgyEo]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Pre-conception occupational hazard evaluation — emergency department (ED) nurse counseling emphasizes control of workplace risks, limited use of job removal, immunization review, and contingency planning. If controls cannot achieve a safe environment, "restrictions or a temporary transfer may be required", and "Permanent removal from a job is the least desirable action". A hazard evaluation of ED nursing "may disclose a broad range of potential hazards, including exposures to infectious diseases, radiation, manual patient lifting, and traumatic injury", yet "in many cases, these hazards can be controlled or obviated to reduce risks to conception and to early pregnancy while the employee continues in productive work". "Review and updating of the employee's immunization status can prevent the transmission of many vaccine-preventable diseases, including rubella and hepatitis B", and "Workplace hazard controls, such as the use of universal precautions for the prevention of infection transmission, x-ray protection procedures, and policies to reduce workplace violence and trauma, should be reviewed and examined and compliance measures reinforced if needed". "Personal monitoring data, such as x-ray film badges, can be reviewed", and when hazards are controlled "the provider can be reassuring about continuation of work during conception and early pregnancy". During outbreaks with high exposure risk (eg, "H1N1 influenza or rubella"), "the provider should consider the possibility of job transfer or other means to reduce risk at conception or early pregnancy". The text notes that "approximately 49% of all pregnancies in the US are unintended", supporting pre-conception counseling.

### Long working hours and pregnancy complications: women physicians survey in Japan [^116ghyL8]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Physicians are susceptible to numerous unhealthy risks due to myriad occupational risk factors, such as anesthetic gases, toxic chemicals, prolonged standing, lifting heavy items, psychological stress, long working hours, and frequent on-call duty. Previous studies have demonstrated that sleep deprivation due to long working hours increases medical error rates among residents, and this finding was part of the impetus to enact ≤ 80-h/week work limits in the US. Even after these regulations were enacted, studies have showed that extended work shifts were associated with increased risk of automobile accidents and percutaneous needle-stick injuries among residents. Indeed many countries recommend maximum working hours: 40 h in Japan (Article 66 of the Labor Act) and in the US (California Labor Laws), and 48 h in the UK (Working Time Regulations) and EU countries (Directive 2003/88/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 November 2003).

Although several studies have investigated the potential association between working hours and pregnancy complications among working women, many of these studies did not take into account an occupation except for a study among physicians. The demographic characteristics of the physician workforce have changed dramatically over the past three decades. The number of women entering medicine has increased in the past several decades, reaching nearly 50% of the total medical school enrollment in the US and nearly 40% of the total number of physicians in Western countries. Thus, pregnancy during residency or fellowship is not uncommon among physicians. This demographic shift toward more women in medicine warrants research on the risks encountered by pregnant physicians, as very few recent studies have examined this important topic. Hence, we aimed to investigate the association between number of hours worked and pregnancy complications in physicians.

### Night shift work before and during pregnancy and offspring weight outcomes through adolescence [^115QuuyH]. Obesity (2018). Low credibility.

Ascertainment of covariates

Maternal age at delivery was derived calculating the difference between a mother's birth date and that of her child. We utilized maternal dietary information assessed by the well‐validated Willett food frequency questionnaire (19), using information from the 1991 NHS II questionnaire to calculate the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) (20). Physical activity was assessed in 1989 and derived as metabolic equivalent hours per week (21). Smoking status and BMI were queried biannually, and we selected the most recent value prior to conception of the first included child. Maternal chronotype was assessed in 2009. As a proxy for socioeconomic status, we used husband's education, which was assessed in 1999.

Information on the number of previous pregnancies, mode of delivery, pregnancy‐related hypertension, preeclampsia, gestational age at delivery, and pregnancy multiplicity was extracted from the lifetime pregnancy assessment in 2009. We approximated pregnancy‐related weight gain by taking the difference of the first BMI reported after delivery and the last recorded BMI before conception.

From the occupational supplemental questionnaire, we had trimester‐specific information on smoking behavior, alcohol consumption, coffee consumption, and frequency of activities involving lifting or moving a physical load of 25 lb or more during pregnancy.

Offspring Tanner stage of pubertal development was determined in 2004 on the GUTS2 baseline questionnaire, using a validated scale of pubic hair illustrations (22). Tanner stage ranges from 1 to 5, with stage 1 indicating prepubescence and stage 5 indicating maturity. Offspring sedentary behavior was summarized by the sum of the hours per week spent watching television, using the computer, surfing on the Internet, and reading or doing homework over the past year, as reported in 2004. Detailed cutoffs used in all analyses are presented in the footnotes of Tables 1 and 2.

### Pushing limits: the acute effects of a heavy-load resistance protocol and supine exercise on fetal well-being [^112Uc2qh]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Clinical implications

Current exercise guidelines recommend light-to-moderate intensity muscle-strengthening activities during pregnancy and discourage heavy-load resistance training due to fetal health concerns. However, this advice is based on limited research, as most previous studies have focused on light-to-moderate loads. Only one study with 10 pregnant participants has investigated fetal responses to heavy-load, compound, multi-joint movements. Compared with earlier studies, our study includes a larger sample, encompasses both elite and recreational athletes, focuses more on upper-body resistance exercises and incorporates additional measures such as uterine artery blood flow. Together, these enhancements contribute to a stronger foundation for evidence-based recommendations and offer more robust guidance for pregnant recreational and elite athletes who wish to continue heavy-load resistance training during pregnancy. Nonetheless, further research is needed to validate and extend our findings.

Limitations

The significantly larger sample size and direct assessments of fetal responses to heavy-load resistance training are strengths of this study. Unlike previous studies that used lighter loads, extended rest periods between sets for ultrasound assessmentsor gradual load increases, our protocol was designed to replicate the usual structure of a resistance training session, with multiple sets and rest intervals appropriate for hypertrophy training. While our study was less well-controlled than previous research, the aim was to reflect real-world training loads, to provide additional insight into the safety of heavy resistance training during pregnancy. Our estimated intensity of 76% 1 RM aligns with standard definitions of heavy lifting. In contrast, Moolyk et al used 90% of 10 RM (~67.5% 1 RM), Meah et al used 60% of 10 RM (~45% 1 RM) and Gould et al capped load at 50 lb (22.68 kg) in a supine chest press, which is lower than participants in our study lifted for eight reps at 1 RIR. While definitions vary, these differences suggest our study may better reflect true heavy-load training.

### Preliminary findings on the experiences of care for women who suffered early pregnancy losses during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study [^115827PQ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

The pandemic-related restrictions were also reported to have made accessing care more emotionally difficult after suffering a loss. Many women reported experiences marked by insensitivities, especially when forced to utilise areas in the hospital in which pregnant women and newborns were frequently present. This could be seen to demonstrate a 'double hardship' amongst women who were faced with the emotion surrounding a pregnancy loss and then felt they were left without any emotional scaffolding because of the way that services were being delivered:

The hospital where I am, they have two lifts. With COVID, that is really restricted, what you can go in and out… We sat at that lift waiting to get on, on and off, constantly seeing babies, constantly seeing pregnant people… That didn't help me… I just went really downhill after that. (P-EPL-015)

There was a distinct feeling amongst women that the staff were having to keep to strict protocol for care delivery – which jarred with the nature of their caring profession. Often, COVID-19-related restrictions were perceived as interfering with healthcare professionals' ability to deliver care as they would have wanted to:

I got the sense that people wanted to give you a hug, or just to place their hand on your arm, but they weren't allowed to do that. So, there was always a distance between you. (P-EPL-014)

When I turned up the day after I was told I'd had a missed miscarriage, I was upset and they said, "Oh I'm really sorry, I can't hug you". So just that acknowledgement of what they would like to do but that they can't, just the empathy… (P-EPL-007)

The reporting of unnaturalness about the effect of the restrictions on care delivery was common, and some women explained how the strangeness of navigating the healthcare system, with its associated restrictions, at a time of health crisis made things more difficult:

If I compare it to when I had my first pregnancy loss back in 2017 when I had to have surgery, the masks, everything felt like it was out of a sci-fi film. Yes, really strange, really surreal. (P-EPL-027)

### Mpox in pregnancy: management, risks and challenges in Africa and lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic [^1166GCXS]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Data on mpox in pregnancy are currently limited. Historically, only 65 cases in pregnancy have been reported globally since mpox was discovered in 1958. This includes 59 cases in the current outbreak. Vertical transmission was confirmed in one patient. Pregnant women are at high risk of severe disease owing to immunological and hormonal changes that increase susceptibility to infections in pregnancy. African women appear to be at higher risk of mpox infection and adverse outcomes in pregnancy for epidemiological and immunologic reasons, in addition to the background high rates of adverse feto-maternal outcomes in the region. This risk is potentially heightened during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the possibility of mpox virus exportation/importation as a result of the lifting of movement restrictions and trans-border travels between countries affected by the current outbreak. Furthermore, coinfection with mpox and COVID-19 in pregnancy is possible, and the clinical features of both conditions may overlap. Challenges of diagnosis and management of mpox in pregnancy in Africa include patients concealing their travel history from healthcare providers and absconding from/evading isolation after diagnosis, shortage of personal protective equipment and polymerase chain reaction testing facilities for diagnosis, vaccine hesitancy/resistance, and poor disease notification systems. There is a need for local, regional and global support to strengthen the capacity of African countries to address these challenges and potentially reduce the disease burden among pregnant women in the continent.

### Pregnant women doing resistance exercise training… [^11464i6o]. ClinicalTrials (2020). Medium credibility.

Pregnant Women Doing Resistance Exercise Training ClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Despite the increase in numbers of women who engage in heavy, free-weight resistance exercise training, the knowledge on how such exercise may affect fertility, pregnancy and birth outcomes is poor. Based on observational and associational studies of pregnant women in labour, recommendations are not to lift more than 11 kg in external load after mid-term, or to lift more than a total of 100 kg during a day. Ignoring such recommendations is associated to increased risk of miscarriage and preeclampsia, and of low birthweight and premature birth, respectively. As such, fit women who continue to exercise during pregnancy, are met with scepticism and warnings, resulting in shame and insecurity.

Such attitudes may also result in physical inactivity during pregnancy, being on the contrary of what is recommended for a healthy pregnancy and delivery. Elite athletes may additionally be deprived from an early return to sport if not being able to keep exercise intensity close to pre-pregnancy period. With poor knowledge on how fit, strong women respond to high external loads during pregnancy exercise, recommendations are to follow the general guidelines. The aim of this observational study, is to explore how regular resistance exercise training may affect fertility, and how high external loads in resistance exercise training during pregnancy in resistance trained women affect; a)their pregnancy and birth outcome, and b)health of the women and their children up to 12 months post-delivery.

Pregnant women who are experienced in heavy, free-weight resistance exercise training, and who choose to continue their exercise regimes during pregnancy, are recruited in social media to regularly respond to an online questionnaire on personal health, foetus development, and the newborn child health. A reference group of pregnant women being regularly physical active are concurrently recruited. Exclusion Criteria:

- Any known metabolic condition or contraindication on doing physical activity during pregnancy. Women included in "group of interest" are pregnant women who are experienced in heavy, free-weigth resistance exercise training who aim to continue exercise training during pregnancy.

Reference group are pregnant women with no experience in heavy, free-weight resistance exercise, but who are regurlarly physically active in any sport activity, and who aim to continue to exercise during pregnancy.

### Fetal growth restriction: ACOG practice bulletin summary, number 227 [^117NjDy3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Fetal growth restriction, also known as intrauterine growth restriction, is a common complication of pregnancy that has been associated with a variety of adverse perinatal outcomes. There is a lack of consensus regarding terminology, etiology, and diagnostic criteria for fetal growth restriction, with uncertainty surrounding the optimal management and timing of delivery for the growth-restricted fetus. An additional challenge is the difficulty in differentiating between the fetus that is constitutionally small and fulfilling its growth potential and the small fetus that is not fulfilling its growth potential because of an underlying pathologic condition. The purpose of this document is to review the topic of fetal growth restriction with a focus on terminology, etiology, diagnostic and surveillance tools, and guidance for management and timing of delivery.

### Implementation of antenatal lifestyle interventions into routine care: secondary analysis of a systematic review [^117XSVZi]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Methods

Search Strategy

This secondary analysis of a meta-analysis used the data sources from an original International Weight Management in Pregnancy systematic review and meta-analysis to 2017, with the protocol extended and the search updated in 2020. The primary systematic review and meta-analysis was prospectively registered in PROSPERO, and methods have been reported. Databases included MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Health Technology Assessment Database, with searches completed May 6, 2020. Language restrictions were not applied to electronic searches. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses reporting guideline. Randomized clinical trials involving diet- and/or physical activity–based lifestyle interventions, with or without behavioral modification techniques, in women with singleton pregnancies were included. Control groups included women who were pregnant with no active lifestyle intervention and with routine antenatal care as defined by local health care practice. The primary outcome was mean GWG in kilograms. Studies were excluded if they included complicated pregnancies, were animal studies, focused on non–lifestyle-based components (ie, GWG monitoring only), and were published before 1990 when the National Academy of Medicine guidelines were first introduced.

Study Selection

Two of us (M.B.K. and C.B.) independently evaluated each title and abstract for eligibility and reviewed full texts for inclusion criteria. Disagreements were resolved by another one of us (H.T.T.).

Quality and Bias Appraisal

Two of us (C.B. and an assistant) independently appraised methodologic qualityusing the Cochrane risk of bias tool, version 1.0, with a focus on 4 items: randomization, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessment, and incomplete outcome data. We ranked a study at high risk of bias if it scored high in at least 1 domain. A study was ranked as low risk of bias when all domains scored at low risk. All other studies were recorded as unclear. To assess publication bias, funnel plots were prepared, with GWG as the main outcome.

### Preexisting diabetes and pregnancy: an endocrine society and European Society of Endocrinology joint clinical practice guideline [^113VEDoo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Preexisting diabetes mellitus (PDM) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) — effects of carbohydrate restriction on pregnancy outcomes are summarized as follows: In one intervention study, carbohydrate intake remained about 190 g/day (95% CI: 163–216 g/day), and in GDM the achieved carbohydrate intakes remained around the 175-gram cutoff (165–177 g) with no harmful effect of the low-carbohydrate diet on outcomes; across studies in obesity and GDM, moderate restriction (> 130 g/day) showed no evidence of harm on LGA, SGA, neonatal hypoglycemia, or other listed maternal and perinatal measures. In PDM, there was no direct evidence and the certainty was very low, with the only indirect signal suggesting better glycemia with meal plans having fewer than 191 g/day of carbohydrates. Indirect evidence also showed a neutral effect on SGA, LGA, and neonatal hypoglycemia in GDM, while severe restriction (< 100 g/day) and the lowest fifth percentile of carbohydrate intake (< 100 g/day) were associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes including increased risk of NTDs.

### Fostering the social and physical challenges of female recreational or professional athletes in pregnancy and postpartum [^112aXDPf]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Based on the available literature, the question remains whether high-intensity exercise at > 90% of the maximal aerobic capacity or the maximum heart rate is safe for the mother and fetus. Temporary bradycardia and a decreased uterine artery pulsatility index were observed in fetuses when their mothers exercised above the exertion level of up to 90% maximal aerobic capacity. However, these parameters normalized quickly after the mother interrupted her exercise. In studies analyzing the impact of single exercise sessions and in studies on animal models, the authors did not observe any negative effects for either the mother or the fetus associated with short, high-intensity interval workouts. It should be emphasized that the safe threshold of training intensity is unknown. There is now increasing scientific evidence that well-planned and monitored high-intensity physical activity during pregnancy leads to health benefits. Nevertheless, it is necessary to conduct high-quality research on this topic. For example, whether the brief, frequently repeated bradycardia and reduced placental flow observed during maternal exercise above 90% of maximum exercise capacity may affect the fetus development in long term. There are also many open questions regarding strength training during pregnancy and postpartum. There is little evidence how the changes in blood pressure related to heavy loads can affect the well-being of the pregnant female athlete, the progression of pregnancy and the postpartum recovery. Prevett et al. studied a group of 679 pregnant women who continued weight-lifting training with at least 80% of their maximum load. Their pregnancy complication rates were not different from those of the average population of pregnant women. So far, the upper limit of safe load in strength training has not yet been determined for pregnant and postpartum women.

Therefore, scientific works in this area are extremely valuable, in the forms of biological and social sciences studies, qualitative or case studies, or experimental trials and longitudinal research covering groups of female athletes of particular sports disciplines. These works would be of utmost importance in closing the knowledge gaps of stakeholders and improving the quantity and quality of advice women receive on this topic.

The general objective of this Collection is to gain a deeper understanding of the effects of pregnancy and postpartum on female athletes, both recreational and professional, in order to improve their health and fitness outcomes and support their continued success in sports. Therefore, the relevant stakeholders are not only the women themselves and their babies and families, but also sports and exercise professionals, health care providers, sponsors, sports federations and associations, and policy makers.

a The exposed group (ARD during pregnancy = Yes) is composed of women who had ARD in pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic period (Jan 2020 to Jun 2021). The non-exposed group (ARD during pregnancy = No) comprised women who had a pregnancy before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (Jan to Dec 2019) and did not have ARD during pregnancy. These groups differ not only because of ARD during pregnancy but also because of the environmental changes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic

b Bivariate analysis

c Adjusted for ARD during pregnancy, age group, education, fetus sex, type of pregnancy, type of delivery, and HDI of the municipality of residence of pregnant women

The sensitivity analysis, restricted to COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed cases, showed that the risk of fetal death was 345% higher (aOR 4.45 CI 95% 2.41; 8.20) when compared to the unexposed group and controlled for maternal age group, maternal education, type of pregnancy, sex of the fetus and type of delivery (Table 4). Also, women who had ARD during pregnancy accompanied by vaginal delivery (aOR 7.06 CI 95% 4.21; 11.83), or by ICU admission (aOR 8.79 CI 95% 4.96; 15.58), or by use of invasive mechanical ventilation (aOR 21.22 CI 95% 9.93; 45.36), had the chance of fetal deaths lifted, controlled for the same covariables (Table 4). ARD during pregnancy combined with cesarean delivery (aOR 1.03 CI 95% 0.91; 1.17) was not associated with fetal deaths (data not show in Table).

Occupational health — surveillance for medically vulnerable workers is designed to identify and mitigate infectious risk, recognizing that immune-compromised workers are at greater risk of infection and complications from many workplace infections. Although laboratory and animal husbandry protocols should be designed to protect all staff, additional work restrictions may be appropriate in some cases, ideally developed in collaboration with the worker's other treating physicians. Similarly, pregnancy increases medical risk for pathogens, and pregnant staff should also be offered counseling and appropriate accommodation.

### Lifting and pregnancy outcomes: feasibility of a randomized controlled trial [^117NHFhh]. Occupational Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The highest incidence of preterm birth (18%) occurs in Africa but the causes are largely unknown. Some studies have reported adverse effects of maternal physical exertion on birth outcomes. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) is proposed to determine the effectiveness of an intervention reducing lifting and carrying in pregnant women in reducing preterm birth and low birthweight.

Aims

To test the feasibility and acceptability of the proposed lift-less intervention RCT.

Methods

We recruited pregnant women and midwives from antenatal clinics within the Greater Accra Region of Ghana. The midwives were trained to administer the intervention during a 5-week trial. Four intervention trial sessions were organized at weekly intervals.

Results

Seven pregnant women and six midwives participated. After piloting, we observed a reduction in participants' self-reported daily exposure to heavy lifting and carrying. The daily average frequency of lifting by a participant within the first seven days of the study was 3.5 (SD 1.7) with an estimated mean total weight of 41.1 kg (SD = 13.3 kg). This had decreased to 2.3 (SD = 1.0) and the amount to 13.4 kg (SD = 10.9) within the last seven days of the study.

Conclusions

The findings provide insight into the daily physical exertion experienced by pregnant women in Ghana. The lift-less intervention trial is feasible with modifications and has the potential to reduce excessive physical exertion among pregnant women in Ghana to improve birth outcomes.

### Reproductive services for women at high risk for maternal mortality: a report of the workshop of the Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the fellowship in family planning, and the Society of Family Planning [^111T3cxc]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

SMFM Special Report — key findings on risk assessment, counseling, and care coordination for high-risk pregnancy state that risk assessment should include an examination of factors that can exacerbate or mitigate the risk of pregnancy beyond the underlying condition, and should be initiated before pregnancy, conducted frequently as pregnancy progresses, and continue throughout the postpartum and interpregnancy periods. A shared decision-making approach should be used when counseling women about management options, which may include continuation of the pregnancy, termination, neonatal palliative care, and medical or surgical interventions, and counseling should clearly outline timing and logistical restrictions, short- and long-term implications, and health risks. Obstetrician-gynecologist specialists are integral to providing care for high-risk women and nonphysician medical personnel and community resources should be leveraged to provide continuity of care. Partner organizations and perinatal quality collaboratives should be recruited to develop cohesive messaging about risks and treatment options that can reduce maternal morbidity and mortality. The report states that racial and economic inequities must be corrected by committing to culturally competent and responsive care and advocacy, and calls for increased collaboration among maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) and family planning subspecialists and obstetrician-gynecologist specialists to eliminate institutional restrictions to abortion for high-risk women, including elimination of hospital abortion boards or committees, and a recommendation that no list of indications can sufficiently encompass all possible situations; the care team, in conjunction with the patient, must have the sole capacity to determine the course of care.

### Time restricted eating and exercise training before and during pregnancy for people with increased risk of gestational diabetes: single centre randomised controlled trial (BEFORE THE BEGINNING) [^113VXyGk]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

There were no significant between group differences in total energy intake or macronutrient distribution before or during pregnancy, which could partly explain the neutral effect of the intervention on most outcome measures. In contrast, Haganes and colleaguesreported that seven weeks of combined time restricted eating and HIIT induced a reduction in energy intake of approximately 200 kcal/day compared with the control group, along with improvements in several cardiometabolic outcomes, among reproductive aged women with overweight or obesity. Correspondingly, the combination of time restricted eating and high intensity functional training for 12 weeks resulted in a 175 kcal/day reduction in total energy intake among women with obesity. In BEFORE THE BEGINNING, we chose a modified time restricted eating regimen, allowing for unrestricted intake on two days per week. Even if such a regimen allows for more flexibility and potentially improved long term adherence than a stricter time restricted eating intervention, our intervention was not sufficiently potent to reduce energy intake. Participants undergoing dietary interventions often underreport their total energy intake, including when using the electronic application that we used. However, there is no reason to believe that such underreporting would be different between the intervention and control groups.

There is little research on the safety and acceptability of time restricted eating during pregnancy, with one previous randomised controlled trial on the effects of time restricted eating on glycaemic control. In a recent online survey study, only around half of the participants agreed that a time restricted eating pattern is safe during pregnancy and 23.7% were willing to try time restricted eating during pregnancy to improve their health. There was a gradual decrease in the adherence to time restricted eating in our study from before pregnancy and during pregnancy. In our previous study of time restricted eating in pregnancy, the participants could adhere to a 10 hour time restricted eating intervention on around five days per week for five weeks in the second or third trimester of pregnancy. However, in that study, the trial period was markedly shorter, and the participants were already pregnant at inclusion, and so likely less affected by nausea and other barriers to time restricted eating than in the BEFORE THE BEGINNING study. Collectively, the experimental evidence to date on time restricted eating during pregnancy indicates that there is no positive effect on maternal glycaemic control.

### The effects of vigorous intensity exercise in the third trimester of pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113ZskJv]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Before the search was conducted, the review was registered with PROSPERO (International Prospective Register for Systematic Reviews), under registration number CRD42018102109.

Search strategy

Electronic searching of the PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and CINAHL databases was used to conduct the search up to November 2018. The Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) database, Boolean operators and truncation were employed to establish all related articles on exercise and pregnancy. The complete search strategy for each of the databases is available in Additional file 1. Only publications in English were included.

Eligibility criteria

Studies included in the systematic review were randomised control trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental studies, cohort studies and case-control studies. The studies were required to include 1) an intervention or report of pregnant women (of any maternal age) performing vigorous exercise during gestation, 2) vigorous exercise reported in any trimester of pregnancy, 3) a comparator group of either lower intensity exercise or standard care, and 4) at least one of the following infant or maternal outcomes: birth weight, SGA, LBW, gestational age at delivery, preterm birth, or gestational weight gain. Studies reporting any type of vigorous physical activity were included in the review, including but not limited to: running, swimming, circuit training, interval training, weight lifting, or plyometrics. Studies were excluded if the sample was a population of women specifically with gestational diabetes mellitus, as infants born to women with this condition are more likely to have macrosomia. However, studies reporting gestational diabetes as an outcome were included in the study.

The secondary outcome concerning work status shows that there were no significant differences at 16 and 24 weeks of pregnancy between both groups (table 3). From 32 weeks of pregnancy, significantly fewer participants in the intervention group were on pregnancy leave (RR 0.42). During pregnancy, the participants in both groups reported an increasing number of complaints due to pregnancy, which restricted them in their work: more than 30% at 16 weeks, around 40% at 24 weeks and around 50% at 32 weeks of pregnancy (table 3).

Table 3 shows that among pregnancy women in the 'in employment' group (ie, excluding participants who were self-employed), participants in the intervention group received information from their employer, when reporting pregnancy, significantly less often at 24 weeks (RR 0.55) and at 32 weeks of pregnancy (RR 0.41). This difference concerned advice on the required work adjustments: 6% in the intervention group vs 18% in the control group at 24 weeks, 6% vs 21% at 32 weeks, and on pregnancy and maternity leave (14% vs 30%) at 32 weeks.

At 16, 24 and 32 weeks of pregnancy there is a consistent, although not significant trend of difference in realised work adjustments, 14% vs 18%, 21% vs 32% and 37 vs 45%, respectively (table 3). In both groups, pregnant women adjusted mostly physically demanding work (less standing and walking, lifting and carrying) and working hours (fewer hours and night shifts). Both groups also worked from home more often.

Intervention and control groups were comparable in most working conditions (table 4). Before 20 weeks of pregnancy, participants in the intervention group experienced less pressure at work (RR 0.55) and had less need to slow down (RR 0.62). They enjoyed their work less often (RR 0.86) and were less often satisfied with their work (RR 0.84). After 24 weeks of pregnancy, participants in the intervention group experienced less freedom in performing tasks (RR 0.57). They enjoyed their work less often (RR 0.34) and were less often satisfied with their work (RR 0.37).

### The association between pelvic girdle pain and sick leave during pregnancy; a retrospective study of a Norwegian population [^113FbMjF]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of pelvic girdle pain (PGP) in pregnancy is wide ranged depending on definition, the utilised diagnostic means, and the design of the studies. PGP during pregnancy has negative effects on activities of daily living and causes long sick leave, which makes it a major public health issue. Our objectives were to explore the frequency of sick leave in pregnancy due to PGP, assess the relationship between different types of pain-related activities of daily living, examine physical workload, type of work in relation to sick leave, and to explore factors that make women less likely to take sick leave for PGP.

Methods

All women giving birth at the maternity ward of Stavanger University Hospital, Norway, were asked to participate and complete a questionnaire on demographic features, PGP, pain-related activities of daily living, sick leave in general and for PGP, frequency of exercising before and during pregnancy. Drawings of pelvic girdle and low back area were used for the localization of pain. PGP intensity was then rated retrospectively on a numerical rating scale. Non-parametric tests, multinomial logistic regression and sequential linear regression analysis were used in the statistical analysis.

Results

PGP is a frequent and major cause of sick leave during pregnancy among Norwegian women, which is also reflected in activities of daily living as measured with scores on all Oswestry disability index items. In the multivariate analysis of factors related to sick leave and PGP we found that work satisfaction, problems with lifting and sleeping, and pain intensity were risk factors for sick leave. In addition, women with longer education, higher work satisfaction and fewer problems with sitting, walking and standing, were less likely to take sick leave in pregnancy, despite the same pain intensity as women being on sick leave.

Conclusions

A coping factor in pregnant women with PGP was discovered, most likely dependant on education, associated with work situation and/or work posture, which decreases sick leave. We recommend these issues to be further examined in a prospective longitudinal study since it may have important implications for sick leave frequency during pregnancy.

9.2 Maternal follow‐up

It is well established that women with a history of pregnancy complicated by FGR or other placenta‐mediated complications such as pre‐eclampsia are at an increased risk of future cardiovascular disease, especially in the presence of early‐onset disease. In a population‐based study that included more than 100 000 pregnancies and provided maternal follow‐up for 15–19 years, delivery of a low birth weight infant was associated with increased maternal risk of ischemic heart disease or death (aHR 1.9; 95% CI, 1.5–2.4). 417 Moreover, a combination of FGR, pre‐eclampsia, and preterm delivery amplified the risk of disease seven‐fold. For a detailed review of the evidence supporting these associations, their underlying mechanisms, and recommendations on maternal follow‐up and prevention strategies please refer to the recently published FIGO postpregnancy initiative on long‐term maternal implications of pregnancy complications and follow‐up considerations. 4

9.3 Counselling regarding future pregnancies

The most frequent and relevant question that care providers are being asked by couples whose prior pregnancy was complicated by FGR relates to the likelihood of a similar complication in subsequent pregnancies. The answer to this question is often difficult and depends on several factors, namely the underlying etiology, severity and timing of onset, and the presence or absence of modifiable risk factors (e.g. maternal medical conditions or smoking). In cases of placenta‐mediated FGR, the results of the placental histopathological examination may provide valuable information that can assist care providers in counselling patients regarding the risk of recurrence, role of further investigation, and potential preventive interventions in subsequent pregnancies.

Medication safety in pregnancy — contraindications and agent-specific cautions: Blood pressure management during pregnancy is complicated by the fact that many commonly used antihypertensive agents are contraindicated because of potential harm to the fetus, and therapeutic classes are not universally recommended or avoided because potential toxicity differs among agents within classes; atenolol has been associated with growth restriction and lower fetal weight and should be avoided in pregnancy, while other beta-1-selective agents like metoprolol have not demonstrated similar associations with growth restriction, and labetalol is a preferred agent with the most reassuring fetal safety data.

### Physical job demands in pregnancy and associated musculoskeletal health and employment outcomes: a systematic review [^117GbMEY]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

A decline in musculoskeletal health during pregnancy is an underappreciated adverse outcome of pregnancy that can have immediate and long-term health consequences. High physical job demands are known risk factors for nontraumatic musculoskeletal disorders in the general working population. Evidence from meta-analyses suggest that occupational lifting and prolonged standing during pregnancy may increase risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. This systematic review examined associations between occupational lifting or postural load in pregnancy and associated musculoskeletal disorders and related sequalae.

Data Sources

Five electronic databases (Medline, Embase, CINAHL, NIOSHTIC-2, and Ergonomic Abstracts) were searched from 1990 to July 2022 for studies in any language. A Web of Science snowball search was performed in December 2022. Reference lists were manually reviewed.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Eligible studies reported associations between occupational lifting or postural load and musculoskeletal health or sequelae (eg, employment outcomes) among pregnant and postpartum workers.

Methods

Data were extracted using a customized form to document study and sample characteristics; and details of exposures, outcomes, covariates, and analyses. Investigators independently assessed study quality for 7 risk-of-bias domains and overall utility, with discrepant ratings resolved through discussion. A narrative synthesis was conducted due to heterogeneity.

Results

Sixteen studies (11 cohort studies, 2 nested case-control studies, and 3 cross-sectional studies) from 8 countries were included (N = 142,320 pregnant and N = 1744 postpartum workers). Limited but consistent evidence with variable quality ratings, ranging from critical concern to high, suggests that pregnant workers exposed to heavy lifting (usually defined as ≥ 22 lbs or ≥ 10 kg) may be at increased risk of functionally limiting pelvic girdle pain and antenatal leave. Moreover, reports of dose-response relationships suggest graded risk levels according to lifting frequency, ranging from 21% to 45% for pelvic girdle pain and 58% to 202% for antenatal leave. Limited but consistent evidence also suggests that postural load increases the risk of employment cessation.

Conclusion

Limited but consistent evidence suggests that pregnant workers exposed to heavy lifting and postural load are at increased risk of pelvic girdle pain and employment cessation. Job accommodations to reduce exposure levels may promote safe sustainable employment for pregnant workers.

### Exercise during pregnancy. A narrative review asking: what do we know? [^116Njc9V]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Although there is no consensus as to whether exercise is beneficial during pregnancy, most studies report it poses no risk to either the mother or the fetus, and many suggest it to be beneficial to both. This review, which examines the evidence available, also reveals the many differences in study design followed, the type of exercise undertaken and the variables measured, which make it difficult to compare results. Advances in our understanding of the effects of exercise during pregnancy might best be made by undertaking randomised clinical trials with standardised protocols. However, most of the studies examining the relationship between exercise and pregnancy report no complications on maternal or fetal well-being. This is also in line with recent review studies advising that the pregnant population without obstetric contraindications should be encouraged to exercise during pregnancy. Therefore, the results of the present review stimulate those responsible for the healthcare of the pregnant woman to recommend moderate exercise throughout pregnancy without risk to maternal and fetal health.

### Pushing limits: the acute effects of a heavy-load resistance protocol and supine exercise on fetal well-being [^111eQmn6]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Supine exercises, such as bench press, are commonly discouraged after 16 weeks of gestation due to the risk of compression of the inferior vena cava by the enlarged uterus while lying on the back, a condition known as vena cava syndrome. This may reduce maternal venous return and cardiac output, potentially decreasing blood flow to the fetus. Supine rest can lead to symptomatic hypotension in up to 10% of women, with symptoms such as maternal dizziness, nausea and light-headedness. Recent reviews indicate that most do not experience hypotensive symptoms despite this compression, and current evidence remains insufficient to determine whether supine exercise is safe or should be avoided during pregnancy. To reduce risk, most guidelines advise modifying supine exercises, for example, by lying on the side.

Due to the limited research on heavy-load resistance training during pregnancy, Prevett et al conducted an online survey of pregnant women who lifted at least 80% of their 1 RM and asked about the use of the Valsalva manoeuvre and supine weightlifting. Their findings suggested no negative impact on pregnancy or delivery outcomes such as gestational hypertension, premature labour or delivery mode. However, the study relied on retrospective self-reported data, which are subject to recall bias, and there were no physiological measures. Moolyk et al examined maternal and fetal responses to acute resistance training at 70%–90% of 10 RM and concluded that the protocol was well tolerated. With only 20 participants, 10 pregnant and 10 non-pregnant, the study had limited generalisability and statistical power.

Despite this early evidence, empirical data on the safety of heavy-load resistance training during pregnancy remain sparse. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess fetal well-being and symptoms of vena cava syndrome during a heavy-load resistance protocol, including supine exercise, with a significantly larger sample size than previous research in the field.

### Providing quality family planning services in the United States: recommendations of the U.S. Office of Population Affairs (revised 2024) [^112WvCC7]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Pregnancy options counseling and referral — scope and actions for each option are outlined. Patients should be fully informed about all pregnancy options: parenting, adoption, and abortion. Providers must offer nondirective counseling and be equipped to offer factual, neutral, nonjudgmental information about each option, and providers working in communities that are in states with restrictive abortion laws may consider using third-person language to share information. Options counseling should be provided in accordance with recommendations from professional medical associations, such as AAP. For persons desiring to continue the pregnancy, affirm their decision and offer prenatal care and/or referrals; for persons interested in pursuing adoption, affirm and offer resources to support this decision, including prenatal care and/or referrals; for persons desiring to end the pregnancy, affirm this decision and offer resource information, explain what options may be available (such as medication abortion or uterine aspiration), and when considering providing abortion care on-site or referring for abortion care, providers should be aware of factors affecting abortion access — including proximity of abortion care facilities — and legal restrictions on abortion care, including state-based legal restrictions impacting individuals seeking abortion services. A person receiving options counseling does not need to declare or come to a decision by the end of the counseling session.

### Occupational stress is associated with job performance among pregnant women in Japan: comparison with similar age group of women [^114jkuKE]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

The annual economic loss of a woman retiring after giving birth was estimated to be 1174.1 billion yen ($10.8 billion). The same report also indicated that regular female employees retiring due to childbirth, even if they are re-employed afterwards, have an average difference of more than 80 million yen in their lifetime annual incomes. If a woman leave the workforce during her pregnancy, it will be a loss for both the company and the woman.

Because many women leave the workforce due to difficulties in balancing pregnancy and work or maternity harassment, providing support so that they may continue working and improving support for their physical burden can prevent them from retiring. Specifically, bosses who manage working pregnant women should be obliged to review their workload and ensure that they are not burdened with work that requires standing for a long time, handling heavy objects, and tasks that require leaning forward. Additionally, modifications to the workspace are recommended, including adding stools for sitting, stopping work every 60 min to allow for a stretching break, and providing pregnant women with supportive and shock absorbent shoes depending on the type of office flooring. With these measures, it is possible to achieve the government's target of a continuous employment rate of 70% for women before and after the birth of their first child by 2025.

### The impact of occupational activities during pregnancy on pregnancy outcomes: a systematic review and metaanalysis [^116GaXpt]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Data: An increasing number of studies suggest that exposure to physically demanding work during pregnancy could be associated with increased risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes, but the results remain conflicted and inconclusive. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of occupational activities during pregnancy on maternal and fetal health outcomes.

Study

Studies of all designs (except case studies and reviews) that contained information on the relevant population (women who engaged in paid work during pregnancy), occupational exposures (heavy lifting, prolonged standing, prolonged walking, prolonged bending, and heavy physical workload), comparator (no exposure to the listed physical work demands), and outcomes (preterm birth, low birthweight, small for gestational age, miscarriage, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, stillbirth, and intrauterine growth restriction) were included.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

Five electronic databases and 3 gray literature sources were searched up to March 15, 2019.

Results

Eighty observational studies (N = 853,149) were included. Low-to-very low certainty evidence revealed that lifting objects ≥ 11 kg was associated with an increased odds ratio of miscarriage (odds ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.58; I² = 79%), and preeclampsia (odds ratio, 1.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–1.71; I² = 0%). Lifting objects for a combined weight of ≥ 100 kg per day was associated with an increased odds of preterm delivery (odds ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.56; I² = 0%) and having a low birthweight neonate (odds ratio, 2.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–4.11; I² = 73%). Prolonged standing was associated with increased odds of preterm delivery (odds ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.22; I² = 30%) and having a small-for-gestational-age neonate (odds ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.35; I² = 41%). A heavy physical workload was associated with increased odds of preterm delivery (odds ratio, 1.23; 95%confidence interval, 1.07–1.41; I² = 32%) and having a low birthweight neonate (odds ratio, 1.79; 95% confidence interval, 1.11–2.87; I² = 87%). All other associations were not statistically significant. Dose-response analysis showed women stand for > 2.5 hours per day (vs no standing) had a 10% increase in the odds of having a preterm delivery.

Conclusion

Physically demanding work during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.

### Occupational lifting and adverse pregnancy outcome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11323JUV]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

This systematic review was conducted to help clarify the effect of lifting at work on pregnancy outcome, by focusing on specific exposure categories. A search in Medline and Embase identified 51 articles reporting association of spontaneous abortion (SA), preterm delivery (PTD) or small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infant with exposure to occupational lifting. A global validity score was assigned to each study and six potential sources of bias were considered in sensitivity analyses. For each exposure-outcome combination, a summary risk estimate (RE) was obtained from all studies and from a subset of studies with high validity score, this latter summary RE was selected as a final result. Statistical heterogeneity was measured with I 2 and Q tests and the possibility of a publication bias was also assessed. For each meta-analysis, the strength of evidence was established from explicit criteria. Heavy (or ≥ 10kg) loads often (or ≥ 10x/day) lifted were associated with increased risks of SA (summary RE = 1.31, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.47) and PTD (summary RE = 1.24, 95%CI 1.07 to 1.43), with good strength of evidence. No association was identified with SGA, nor with lower exposure levels and SA or PTD. These results are reassuring for lower levels of exposure; however, observed associations can guide health professionals' recommendations aimed at the prevention of SA and PTD for pregnant women who frequently lift (or ≥ 10x/day) heavy (or ≥ 10kg) loads at work.Résumé.

### Balancing benefits and risks of exercise in pregnancy: a qualitative analysis of social media discussion [^112gqwS1]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Intuition and listening to your body

Understanding body signals to exercise safely was a common theme. Most participants trusted that they could use this strategy effectively:

Listen to your body and remember that your body is still yours, and you know it best!

Contributors occasionally specified which body signals should be considered, citing ' DR [diastasis recti], pain, dizziness, bleeding after lifting, and braxton hicks '. One self-identified fitness professional commented that individuals should assess whether the workout made them ' feel better or depleted '.

Some women who identified as active reported that they struggled to adjust during pregnancy. One woman described pushing through pain to complete her workout. Commenters chided her, with one explaining that it could be ' very dangerous ' to ' fixat[e] on the 'plan' instead of listening to your body '.

The advice to ' listen to your body ' also came from medical professionals. This was described as ' really not comprehensive enough for pregnancy ' by one woman who felt that ' just because you can still do it, doesn't mean you should '. Another contributor was pleased with her high-risk obstetrician's advice to ' do whatever exercises I wanted as long as they felt comfortable to my body '. She passed on the advice to another contributor, clarifying that ' if you're really in tune with your body, go for it! '.

### The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal healthcare costs: a time series analysis of pregnancies of multi-ethnic mothers in south london, United Kingdom [^11275JrC]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Summary

The COVID-19 pandemic led to a drop from pre-pandemic values in maternity costs at the onset of pandemic lockdowns, and again post-lockdown when all restrictions were lifted, but there was no change in the rate of rise of costs over time within either pandemic period (with or without lockdowns). Importantly, our findings suggest that the pandemic affected minority ethnic women differently; compared with White ethnicity women, those of Black or Asian ethnicity experienced an increase (not decrease) in costs at the start of pandemic lockdowns, and their costs rose more slowly during pandemic lockdowns, with that trend continuing for Asian ethnicity women during post-lockdown.

Descriptive analyses of costs per pregnancy (resulting from aggregating monthly pregnancy costs for each woman over the duration of their pregnancy) suggest that a pregnancy was more expensive for the NHS during the pandemic than before, with (by an average of £307), or without lockdowns (by £471). However, this pattern reflects a pre-pandemic trend of rising pregnancy costs that continued at the same rate during the pandemic, and so the higher costs cannot be attributed to the pandemic per se.

In additional analyses, use of virtual care was associated with an increase in pregnancy costs. However, for women with GDM, self-monitoring through the GDm-Health app had no significant impact on pregnancy costs. There was no evidence of a differential impact of the pandemic on these costs according to ethnicity.

9.3.4 Preconception counselling and management of future pregnancies

Given the considerable risk of recurrence of FGR, efforts should be made to decrease this risk in future pregnancies. 448 Modifiable risk factors for FGR such as smoking or poor nutritional status should be identified as early as possible and managed accordingly, as discussed in section 5.5.1.

There is some evidence that administration of aspirin can reduce the risk of FGR. However, as described in section 5.5.2 most available data focused on the prevention of pre‐eclampsia as the primary outcome in women at high risk of pre‐eclampsia, with the prevention of FGR being considered a secondary outcome. Data on the prevention of recurrence of FGR in women with a history of FGR are limited. 449 Therefore, some recommend that aspirin should be considered in women with past FGR only if they have risk factors for pre‐eclampsia at the time of the next pregnancy. 450 However, we believe that given the safety of aspirin and the overlap in pathogenesis of pre‐eclampsia and FGR, it is reasonable to recommend aspirin to women with a history of placenta‐mediated FGR in the previous pregnancy, using the same regimen of aspirin used for the prevention of pre‐eclampsia. This recommendation is shared by most professional societies. 134

Data on the role of LMWH to prevent recurrence of placenta‐mediated complications including FGR are conflicting, and this topic is reviewed in section 5.5.2. Based on available data, LMWH therapy should not be used in women with a past history of FGR except in a research setting.

Given the association of insufficient gestational weight gain with FGR, we recommend monitoring of weight gain and informing women about their target weight gain range, as described in section 5.5.1. Other interventions, such as bed rest or nutritional supplements are of unproven benefit and should not be routinely offered. 451, 452 The risk of recurrence can be further stratified in early pregnancy by means of prenatal screening with biochemical markers (PAPP‐A, beta hCG, alpha‐fetoprotein, and PlGF) as well as by uterine artery Doppler, as described in section 5. Due to the increased risk of recurrence, pregnant women with a history of FGR in a previous pregnancy should be managed in a high‐risk pregnancy clinic and should receive closer antenatal surveillance, including close monitoring of fetal growth and maternal blood pressure. 453

### Clinical guidelines for occupational lifting in pregnancy: evidence summary and provisional recommendations [^113uWBMN]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Empirically based lifting criteria established by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to reduce the risk of overexertion injuries in the general US working population were evaluated for application to pregnant workers. This report proposes criteria to guide decisions by medical providers about permissible weights for lifting tasks performed at work over the course of an uncomplicated pregnancy. Our evaluation included an extensive review of the literature linking occupational lifting to maternal and fetal health. Although it has been 29 years since the American Medical Association's Council on Scientific Affairs published its report on the Effects of Pregnancy on Work Performance, these guidelines continue to influence clinical decisions and workplace policies. Provisional clinical guidelines derived from the NIOSH lifting criteria that account for recent evidence for maternal and fetal health are presented and aim to improve the standard of care for pregnant workers.

### Occupational physical activities, working hours and outcome of pregnancy: findings from the southampton women's survey [^1166X1Cg]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate risks of physical activity at work by pregnancy trimester, including the effects on head and abdominal circumference.

Method

At 34 weeks of gestation we interviewed 1327 mothers from the prospective Southampton Women's Survey (SWS); we asked about their activities (working hours, standing/walking, kneeling/squatting, trunk bending, lifting and night shifts) in jobs held at each of 11, 19 and 34 weeks of gestation, and subsequently ascertained four birth outcomes (preterm delivery, small for gestational age (SGA) and reduced head or abdominal circumference) blinded to employment history.

Results

Risk of preterm delivery was elevated nearly threefold in women whose work at 34 weeks entailed trunk bending for > 1 h/day. Small head circumference was more common in babies born to women who worked for > 40 h/week. However, no statistically significant associations were found with SGA or small abdominal circumference, and preterm delivery showed little association with long working hours, lifting, standing or shift work.

Conclusions

There is a need for more research on trunk bending late in pregnancy, and on the relationship of work to reduced head circumference. Our findings on several other occupational exposures common among pregnant workers are reassuring.

### The association between abortion restrictions and patient-centered care for early pregnancy loss at US obstetrics-gynecology residency programs [^113RJNN5]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Early pregnancy loss is a common medical problem, and the recommended treatments overlap with those used for induced abortions. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends the incorporation of clinical and patient factors when applying conservative published imaging guidelines to determine the timing of intervention for early pregnancy loss. However, in places where abortion is heavily regulated, clinicians who manage early pregnancy loss may cautiously rely on the strictest criteria to differentiate between early pregnancy loss and a potentially viable pregnancy. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also notes that specific treatment modalities that are frequently used to induce abortion, including the use of mifepristone in medical therapy and surgical aspiration in an office setting, are cost-effective and beneficial for patients with early pregnancy loss.

Objective

This study aimed to determine how US-based obstetrics and gynecology residency training institutions adhere to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommendations for early pregnancy loss management, including the timing and types of interventions, and to evaluate the relationship with institutional and state abortion restrictions.

Study Design

From November 2021 to January 2022, we conducted a cross-sectional study of all 296 US-based obstetrics and gynecology residency programs by emailing them and requesting that a faculty member complete a survey about early pregnancy loss practices at their institution. We asked about location of diagnosis, use of imaging guidelines before offering intervention, treatment options available at their institution, and program and personal characteristics. We used chi-square tests and logistic regressions to compare the availability of early pregnancy loss care based on institutional indication-based abortion restrictions and state legislative hostility to abortion care.

Results

Of the 149 programs that responded (50.3% response rate), 74 (49.7%) reported that they did not offer any intervention for suspected early pregnancy loss unless rigid imaging criteria were met, whereas the remaining 75 (50.3%) programs reported that they incorporated imaging guidelines with other factors. In an unadjusted analysis, programs were less likely to incorporate other factors with imaging criteria if they were in a state with legislative policies that were hostile toward abortion (33% vs 79%; P < .001) or if the institution restricted abortion by indication (27% vs 88%; P < .001). Mifepristone was used less often in programs located in hostile states (32% vs 75%; P < .001) or in institutions with abortion restrictions (25% vs 86%; P < .001). Similarly, office-based suction aspiration use was lower in hostile states (48% vs 68%; p = 0.014) and in institutions with restrictions (40% vs 81%; P < .001). After controlling for program characteristics, including state policies and affiliation with family planning training programs or religious entities, institutional abortion restrictions were the only significant predictor of rigid reliance on imaging guidelines (odds ratio, 12.3; 95% confidence interval, 3.2–47.9).

Conclusion

In training institutions that restrict access to induced abortion based on indication for care, residency programs are less likely to holistically incorporate clinical evidence and patient priorities in determining when to intervene in early pregnancy loss as recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Programs in restrictive institutional and state environments are also less likely to offer the full range of early pregnancy loss treatment options. With state abortion bans proliferating nationwide, evidence-based education and patient-centered care for early pregnancy loss may also be hindered.

Case #4: Lifting — pregnancy and physically demanding work is discussed using a scenario where the worker frequently lifts and stacks boxes that weigh 15 to 20 pounds across her 8-hour shift and infrequently lifts 40 pounds four to five times per day. A meta-analysis reported small but significant associations of high physical exertion, including heavy lifting, with preterm and small-for-gestational age birth, with odds ratios of 1.22 and 1.37, respectively. Prolonged standing and high cumulative work fatigue were also associated with preterm birth, although some later studies failed to confirm these findings. Leisure-time physical exertion, such as aerobic exercise, has not been found to be detrimental in pregnancy, and guidelines for lifting in pregnancy were developed using the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.

In the European Union, including the Netherlands, according to Council Directive 92/85/EEC it is the employer's responsibility to evaluate the potential risks facing pregnant employees and to subsequently take the necessary protective measures. Lack of knowledge about legal obligations of employers can cause deficiencies in the implementation of maternity protection legislation. Often no risk analysis is carried out and employers fail to give pregnant workers sufficient information about their rights and risks. A negative attitude of employers towards their pregnancy is one of the most common stressors among working women. Moreover, in our study fewer than 25% of the employers provided information to their pregnant employees about their rights, and only 12% about risks and required work adjustments even though this is a legal obligation. We do not know whether employers were aware of this legal obligation or the fact that less exposure to risks at work will reduce absenteeism among pregnant employees.

Working pregnant women, both in paid employment and self-employed, are often unaware of the risks and legal measures concerning maternity protection in the workplace, they continue to work in a hazardous workplace or decide to withdraw from work using sick leave or preventive pregnancy leave. This study shows that overall work is not sufficiently adjusted: after 24 weeks of pregnancy, 20%–30% of the participants in both groups still performed physically demanding work (prolonged standing (33%), lifting (19%), bending (22%)), they worked in an environment with a lot of noise (30%), or on which was cold (18%), hot (18%) or entailed exposure to chemicals (7%) and infectious diseases (26%). The question remains whether there has been a proper evaluation of the working conditions of these pregnant women.

### Associations with the inter-recti distance at gestation week 37: a prospective cohort study among healthy pregnant women [^113rRCaF]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Factors such as age, weight, height, waist circumference, heavy lifting, parity, IRD, hypermobility, comorbidity, stretch marks, varicose veins abdominal and pelvic floor muscle exercise, presence of urinary incontinence, pelvic girdle pain and low back pain have been suggested in the literature to be associated with increased IRD postpartum. There is however conflicting evidence for these associations. Recent studies found no associations between presence of urinary incontinence, pelvic girdle pain and low back pain and increased IRD. One study suggests that parity, body mass index (BMI) and diabetes are the most plausible risk factors for increased IRD and Boissonnault & Blaschak (1987) concludes with a strong association between advancing pregnancy and increased IRD postpartum, and that weak abdominal muscles is a contributing factor. This is in line with findings from Gluppe et al. (2021) concluding that postpartum women with DRA might have weaker abdominal muscles than postpartum women without DRA. Kaufmann et al. (2021) presents increased age, increased BMI and parity as independent risk factors for increased IRD in adults.

However, we do not know to what extent these factors are associated with IRD late in pregnancy. As the IRD usually increases during the last two trimesters of pregnancy it is important to conduct studies investigating which factors may contribute to increased IRD at 37 weeks of gestation. This will add to our knowledge of DRA and whether it can be prevented at an early stage.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 746 summary: air travel during pregnancy [^112ebAHj]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

In the absence of obstetric or medical complications, occasional air travel is safe for pregnant women. Pregnant women can fly safely, observing the same precautions for air travel as the general population. Because severe air turbulence cannot be predicted and the subsequent risk for trauma is significant should this occur, pregnant women should be instructed to use their seat belts continuously while seated. Despite a lack of evidence associating lower extremity edema and venous thrombotic events with air travel during pregnancy, certain preventive measures can be used to minimize these risks, including use of support stockings and periodic movement of the lower extremities, avoidance of restrictive clothing, occasional ambulation, and maintenance of adequate hydration. For most air travelers, the risks to the fetus from exposure to cosmic radiation are negligible. However, aircrew or frequent flyers may exceed these limits. The Federal Aviation Administration and the International Commission on Radiological Protection consider aircrew to be occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation and recommend that they be informed about radiation exposure and health risks.

3 ASSESSMENT OF QUALITY OF EVIDENCE AND GRADING OF STRENGTH OF RECOMMENDATIONS

In assessing the quality of evidence and grading of strength of recommendations, the article follows the terminology proposed by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group. 5 This system uses consistent language and graphical descriptions for the strength and quality of the recommendations and the evidence on which they are based.

Recommendations are classified as strong or conditional (weak) (Table S1). 6 The strength of recommendation is dependent not only on the quality of evidence, but also on factors such as risk–benefit, cost, resource allocation, values, and preferences. Thus, some recommendations may be based on low‐quality evidence but still represent a benefit that outweighs the risks and burdens, and therefore may be strongly recommended.

The overall quality of evidence was assessed for each of the recommendations and expressed using four levels of quality: very low, low, moderate, and high (Table S2). 7 Considerations for quality of evidence include primarily the study design and methodology. As such, evidence based on randomized controlled trials is considered high‐quality evidence, observational studies provide moderate or low quality of evidence, and all others are very low. However, other parameters must be considered while assessing the level of evidence: risk of bias, study limitations, consistency of results, precision, publication bias, indirectness of evidence, and scarcity of evidence. For the quality of evidence, cross‐filled circles are used: ⊕○○○ denotes very low‐quality evidence; ⊕⊕○○ low quality; ⊕⊕⊕○ moderate quality; and ⊕⊕⊕⊕ high‐quality evidence.

### Providing a safe pregnancy experience for surgeons: a review [^113ZiNYx]. JAMA Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Childbearing has been a particular barrier to successful recruitment and retention of women in surgery. Pregnant surgeons are more likely to have major pregnancy complications, such as preterm delivery, intrauterine growth restriction, infertility, and miscarriage, compared with nonsurgeons. The average obstetric complication rate for surgeons ranges between 25% and 82% in the literature and is considerably higher than that in the general US population at 5% to 15%.

Observations

The risks that pregnant surgeons experience were individually analyzed. These risks included missed prenatal care; musculoskeletal hazards, such as prolonged standing, lifting, and bending; long work hours; overnight calls; exposure to teratogenic agents, such as ionizing radiation, anesthetic gases, chemotherapy agents, and methyl methacrylate; and psychological stress and discrimination from the long-standing stigma associated with balancing motherhood and professional life.

Conclusions and Relevance

A clear, translatable, and enforceable policy addressing perinatal care of surgeons was proposed, citing evidence of the risks reviewed from the literature. A framework of protection for pregnant individuals is essential for attracting talented students into surgery, retaining talented surgical trainees and faculty, and protecting pregnant surgeons and their fetuses.

### Use of benefits during pregnancy: a cohort study in four organisations in Spain [^1165mGtg]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

We suggest that some, if not all, of these absences could be reduced through improvements in working conditions and/or more management effort to adapt the workplace. Such initiatives might reduce both economic and career disadvantages that derive from these absences. As initiatives to improve work outcomes, we could suggest improving occupational risk assessment and increasing workplace adaptations, such as switching to teleworking and other forms of smart working when possible, task changes, use of aids for loading weights and patients, which should be incorporated into updated guidelines. Future research might evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to reduce absences during pregnancy.

This study has strengths and limitations. Regarding strengths, the four workplaces had an OHS with protocols for the management of pregnant workers and the prevention of risks during pregnancy. They also had reliable data on each pregnancy collected over a recent, extended period that allowed us to obtain a good sample. This introduces a weakness, however, since it is possible that in organisations where these resources are not available, the use of benefits may be different from that observed in our study. Therefore further research is required.

Regarding limitations, the four organisations had different ways of recording data, and in spite of our efforts to homogenise the records, this was not always possible. For example, in one of the hospitals, lack of information on the date of the last menstrual period meant that we had to estimate the beginning of pregnancy based on the date of delivery.

The sample studied in each hospital may be biased to some extent towards those pregnancies of workers with stable contracts. Women with temporary contracts were probably left out of the study, though a proportion with a long enough temporary contract was included. Also, to be included in the study, the institutions and companies had to have an in-house OHS to provide the required data for the study. This could mean that pregnant women in these companies are working in better conditions. Equally, important job variables such as shift work, type of contract and adaptations or changes made on the job were not available in all organisations and could not be included in the analysis. We also did not have information on other non-work factors that may affect the work-life balance, such as having small children or taking care of older dependent people.

### Interventions for preventing and treating low-back and pelvic pain during pregnancy [^115jc56N]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

More than two-thirds of pregnant women experience low-back pain and almost one-fifth experience pelvic pain. The two conditions may occur separately or together (low-back and pelvic pain) and typically increase with advancing pregnancy, interfering with work, daily activities and sleep.

Objectives

To update the evidence assessing the effects of any intervention used to prevent and treat low-back pain, pelvic pain or both during pregnancy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth (to 19 January 2015), and the Cochrane Back Review Groups' (to 19 January 2015) Trials Registers, identified relevant studies and reviews and checked their reference lists.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any treatment, or combination of treatments, to prevent or reduce the incidence or severity of low-back pain, pelvic pain or both, related functional disability, sick leave and adverse effects during pregnancy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy.

Main Results

We included 34 RCTs examining 5121 pregnant women, aged 16 to 45 years and, when reported, from 12 to 38 weeks' gestation. Fifteen RCTs examined women with low-back pain (participants = 1847); six examined pelvic pain (participants = 889); and 13 examined women with both low-back and pelvic pain (participants = 2385). Two studies also investigated low-back pain prevention and four, low-back and pelvic pain prevention. Diagnoses ranged from self-reported symptoms to clinicians' interpretation of specific tests. All interventions were added to usual prenatal care and, unless noted, were compared with usual prenatal care. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to low, raising concerns about the confidence we could put in the estimates of effect. For low-back painResults from meta-analyses provided low-quality evidence (study design limitations, inconsistency) that any land-based exercise significantly reduced pain (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.64; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.03 to -0.25; participants = 645; studies = seven) and functional disability (SMD -0.56; 95% CI -0.89 to -0.23; participants = 146; studies = two). Low-quality evidence (study design limitations, imprecision) also suggested no significant differences in the number of women reporting low-back pain between group exercise, added to information about managing pain, versus usual prenatal care (risk ratio (RR) 0.97; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.17; participants = 374; studies = two). For pelvic painResults from a meta-analysis provided low-quality evidence (study design limitations, imprecision) of no significant difference in the number of women reporting pelvic pain between group exercise, added to information about managing pain, and usual prenatal care (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.23; participants = 374; studies = two). For low-back and pelvic painResults from meta-analyses provided moderate-quality evidence (study design limitations) that: an eight- to 12-week exercise program reduced the number of women who reported low-back and pelvic pain (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.97; participants = 1176; studies = four); land-based exercise, in a variety of formats, significantly reduced low-back and pelvic pain-related sick leave (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94; participants = 1062; studies = two). The results from a number of individual studies, incorporating various other interventions, could not be pooled due to clinical heterogeneity. There was moderate-quality evidence (study design limitations or imprecision) from individual studies suggesting that osteomanipulative therapy significantly reduced low-back pain and functional disability, and acupuncture or craniosacral therapy improved pelvic pain more than usual prenatal care. Evidence from individual studies was largely of low quality (study design limitations, imprecision), and suggested that pain and functional disability, but not sick leave, were significantly reduced following a multi-modal intervention (manual therapy, exercise and education) for low-back and pelvic pain. When reported, adverse effects were minor and transient.

Authors' Conclusions

There is low-quality evidence that exercise (any exercise on land or in water), may reduce pregnancy-related low-back pain and moderate- to low-quality evidence suggesting that any exercise improves functional disability and reduces sick leave more than usual prenatal care. Evidence from single studies suggests that acupuncture or craniosacral therapy improves pregnancy-related pelvic pain, and osteomanipulative therapy or a multi-modal intervention (manual therapy, exercise and education) may also be of benefit. Clinical heterogeneity precluded pooling of results in many cases. Statistical heterogeneity was substantial in all but three meta-analyses, which did not improve following sensitivity analyses. Publication bias and selective reporting cannot be ruled out. Further evidence is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect and change the estimates. Studies would benefit from the introduction of an agreed classification system that can be used to categorise women according to their presenting symptoms, so that treatment can be tailored accordingly.

### Reflections on workplace adjustments for pregnant employees: a qualitative study of the experiences of pregnant employees and their managers [^1174B81y]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

This was a qualitative study that involved semi-structured interviews with pregnant employees and their immediate managers. The interviews aimed to explore how pregnant employees and their managers experienced and managed pregnancy at the workplace, and based on this, to identify preconditions for successfully implementing workplace adjustments for pregnant women.

Study participants

We wanted to explore how pregnancy is experienced by women working in sectors with an increased likelihood of pregnancy-related sick leave. In Denmark, pregnant employees in restaurants and hotels, healthcare, travel agencies, cleaning jobs, and retail reportedly took sick leave two to three times more often than female employees who were not pregnant in these sectors. We selected a purposive sample to find participants who were employed in these fields. The goal was to include participants with diverse experiences, and to gain in-depth knowledge. The pregnant women were recruited from respondents to a survey carried out at six prenatal midwife clinics in the Central Denmark Region, from March to October 2018. The inclusion criteria for managers were at least five years of management experience with pregnant employees, and responsibility for at least thirty employees. The pregnant employees were invited by telephone after they had agreed to be contacted, and the managers were recruited by contacting their workplaces. We stopped adding participants when we reached data saturation and the interviews contributed little or no new information.

We conducted semi-structured interviews. The topics in the interview guides (one for the employees and one for the managers) were inspired by existing literature that showed that work-related factors that increased the likelihood of sick leave included psychosocial work factors (e.g. support from supervisors and colleagues) and physical work factors (e.g. heavy lifting, night or shift work, standing work). The literature also inspired us to include questions about the attitude to sick days. The topics in the interview guide were: "Pregnancy at the workplace", "Attitudes to sick leave during pregnancy", "Workplace adjustments", "Relationship to the manager", "Relationship to colleagues", "Role of physicians and midwives", and "The possibility of, and barriers to, keeping pregnant employees on the job throughout pregnancy". We attempted to balance a focused exploration of the topics in the interview guide and an open approach. Some of the subtopics that emerged during the first interviews were included in subsequent interviews (e.g. descriptions of specific challenges).

### The sedentary behavior reduction in pregnancy intervention (SPRING) pilot and feasibility randomized trial [^1114QtGw]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs), such as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) and gestational diabetes (GDM), have been increasing in prevalence in the U.S. in recent decades. For example, a 2023 U.S. Preventative Task Force report found that HDP incidence has doubled since 1993. These trends are alarming since APOs pose immediate threats to the health of the pregnant mother and her offspring, and experiencing an APO is now recognized as an important risk factor for underlying and future cardiovascular disease (CVD). Interventions that prevent APOs offer immediate and possibly lasting intergenerational benefits. However, few evidence-based approaches for preventing APOs during pregnancy are available. Participating in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity does have an established benefit, with studies of exercise interventions conferring a risk reduction of ~40% for HDP and GDM. Yet, only an estimated 1 in 4 pregnant individuals meet physical activity guidelines. The low levels of physical activity likely reflect a combination of barriers to physical activity experienced by the general population (e.g. lack of time, enjoyment, or access) overlaid upon barriers specific to pregnancy (e.g. fatigue, medical restriction, or concern for the baby). More feasible and effective lifestyle approaches to reduce APO risk are needed.

### Recommendations for weight gain during pregnancy in the context of the obesity epidemic [^113c1gXL]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

The Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council have issued new guidelines for gestational weight gain as well as recommendations for action and research that call for "a radical change in the care provided to women of childbearing age". For the first time, these guidelines consider the outcomes of both mother and child during and after delivery and the trade-offs between them. The recommendations call for women to begin pregnancy at a healthy weight and to gain within the guidelines, a goal not previously achieved. They also call for individualized preconceptional, prenatal, and postpartum care to help women attain a healthy weight, gain within the guidelines, and return to a healthy weight. Scientific evidence was inadequate to provide specific guidelines by obesity class or to support a public health recommendation to reduce the guidelines below 5–9 kg (11–20 lb) for obese women.

Preexisting diabetes mellitus (PDM) — carbohydrate-restricted diet recommendation states: "we suggest either a carbohydrate-restricted diet (< 175 g per day) or usual diet (> 175 g per day) during pregnancy (2 | ⊕⊕OO)". The clinical question posed is, "Should a carbohydrate-restricted (< 175 g per day) diet vs usual diet (> 175 g per day) during pregnancy be used in individuals with preexisting diabetes mellitus?" The systematic review "did not identify any randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of carbohydrate-restricted (< 175 g/day) vs usual (> 175 g/day) diets during pregnancy in individuals with PDM" for outcomes that include "Offspring overweight (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 85th percentile) up to age 18 years". Indirect evidence indicates "a carbohydrate intake above 191 g/day was associated with doubling the risk of hyperglycemia (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] ≥ 6.5%)" in women with T1DM, and in obesity, "The RECORD trial randomized women with obesity and less than 20 weeks' gestation to either a low-carbohydrate diet (130–150 g/day) or usual care".

Efavirenz (EFV) use in pregnancy — regulatory advice and guideline stance: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration "continues to advise women to avoid becoming pregnant while taking EFV and to advise health care providers to avoid administering EFV during the first trimester because fetal harm may occur", yet data "on more than 7,900 periconception exposures to EFV from Botswana are sufficient to rule out a threefold or greater increased risk of NTDs with the use of EFV". The Perinatal Guidelines "do not restrict the use of EFV during pregnancy or when planning to conceive", aligning with other guidelines "which note that EFV can be used throughout pregnancy", and "EFV should be continued in pregnancy when a virologically suppressive, EFV-based regimen is being received because ARV drug changes during pregnancy may be associated with loss of viral control and an increased risk of perinatal HIV transmission". Supporting registry data report "no association between first-trimester use of EFV-based ART regimens and congenital malformations".

" I was just laid off yesterday… due to my limits and restrictions from the doctors… I was put on a ten-pound lifting limit, which is very, very small and unfortunately with all the job descriptions at my employer I wasn't eligible for employment anymore. I busted my butt at that place and gave it everything that I had, even very sick and ill and not well and they, I feel like they tossed me in the trash".

When another participant started a new job as a nurse, she found her new employer was unwilling to accommodate job duty recommendations from her healthcare provider:

"I told her like maybe on day seven that I had a nurse's note and when she told me that she was not going to accommodate it, I just basically let her know like, 'well I can't continue to work here. Like I need to', you know in the note it says like okay well, 'I need to be able to take frequent breaks like to sit down, I can't stand for longer than two hours, I should be able to take water breaks, bathroom breaks and stuff like that'. She had a whole attitude about it and told me that she was not going to accommodate my nurse's note so I was like 'okay, you're not going to accommodate my nurse's note like so you want me to put myself and my baby in danger; no thank you, you can keep this job'.

Ultimately, the participant quit the new job because the employer would not accommodate the requests in her healthcare provider's note.

WARNING: EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY – CONTRAINDICATED IN
PREGNANCY

Isotretinoin capsules can cause life-threatening birth defects and is contraindicated in pregnancy. There is an extremely high risk that life-threatening birth defects will result if pregnancy occurs while taking any amount of isotretinoin capsules even for short periods of time. Potentially any fetus exposed during pregnancy can be affected. There are no accurate means of determining prenatally whether an exposed fetus has been affected. If pregnancy occurs, discontinue isotretinoin capsules immediately and refer the patient to an Obstetrician-Gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Because of the risk of embryo-fetal toxicity, isotretinoin capsules are available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the iPLEDGE REMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### 2023 HRS expert consensus statement on the management of arrhythmias during pregnancy [^115VvSfM]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Beta-blockers in pregnancy — fetal growth and continuation of therapy. Maternal therapy with beta-blockers during pregnancy has been associated with intrauterine fetal growth restriction, although many studies included patients with hypertensive disorders where growth could be affected by the underlying condition rather than the drug; a study of beta-blockers for maternal cardiac conditions showed a significant effect on fetal growth after adjusting for confounders. Atenolol had a former United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) risk category D rating for use during pregnancy, but a more recent study reported birth weight reduction associated with beta-blockers to be less than 200 grams and not of great clinical consequence in most instances. In potentially life-threatening scenarios, a maternal indication takes priority over potential fetal growth-restriction concerns, and beta-blocker therapy should be continued during pregnancy and the postpartum period.

### Pushing limits: the acute effects of a heavy-load resistance protocol and supine exercise on fetal well-being [^1121LaxH]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

While participation by women in weight-based sports, for example, CrossFit, Olympic weightlifting and powerlifting, continues to increase, research on heavy-load resistance training during pregnancy remains limited. International guidelines advise against heavy lifting, based on evidence from occupational studies linking such activity to higher risks of preterm delivery and miscarriage. However, occupational lifting differs from recreational weightlifting in load distribution, repetition, recovery and overall physical demands. Occupational lifting often involves repetitive movements with minimal rest, which can lead to physical overload and adverse health effects. In contrast, recreational weightlifting is performed in controlled sessions with adequate recovery between sets and sessions. Thus, extrapolating findings from occupational settings to heavy-load resistance training in pregnancy is problematic.

A recent online survey of 679 pregnant women who lifted a minimum of 80% of their 1 RM during pregnancy found similar or lower rates of pregnancy complications than population-based estimates. Findings from our pregnant athletes who regularly incorporate high-intensity exercise and/or heavy-load resistance training into their routines support this. Compared with data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway, our cohort had similar birthweights, gestational age at delivery and rates of post-term birth, with lower rates of pre-term births and low birth weight. These results suggest that recreational heavy-load resistance training is generally well tolerated during pregnancy, with no negative impact on maternal or neonatal outcomes.

Consistent with other research, FHR remained within the normal range for most pregnant athletes between sets of the heavy-load resistance protocol. In contrast with our protocol, which primarily involved upper-body exercises, both Moolyk et al and Avery et al focused mainly on lower-body movements, like squats, deadlifts and leg extensions, which tend to put greater strain on the cardiovascular system and involve more muscle mass. The observation that FHR remains stable during both upper- and lower-body resistance training further supports the safety of heavy-load resistance exercise for fetal well-being. Notably, fetal responses appeared slightly more stable among those who regularly engaged in heavy-load resistance training, with no notable differences between elite and recreational athletes. This suggests that training experience, rather than performance level, may be a more meaningful predictor of physiological adaptations and tolerance to exercise during pregnancy.

### Occupational lifting of heavy loads and preterm birth: a study within the Danish national birth cohort [^115KbLrs]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine the association between occupational lifting during pregnancy and preterm birth. The risk of preterm birth was estimated for total burden lifted per day and number of medium and heavy loads lifted per day.

Methods

In a study population of 62 803 pregnant women enrolled to the Danish National Birth Cohort from 1996 to 2002, the association between self-reported occupational lifting in the first part of pregnancy and preterm birth was analysed using logistic regression models with adjustment for age, parity, cervical cone biopsy, assisted reproduction and smoking. Associations between lifting and extremely (before 28 weeks), very (28–32 weeks) and moderately (33–37 weeks) preterm birth were analysed using Cox regression models.

Results

We found a dose-response relation between total daily burden lifted and preterm birth with an OR of 1.50 (95% CI 1.03 to 2.19) with loads over 1000 kg/day. No threshold value was found. The associations were strongest for extremely and very preterm birth with HRs (95% CIs) of 4.3 (1.4 to 13.8) and 1.7 (0.7 to 4.0), respectively. Lifting heavy loads (> 20 kg) more than10 times/day was associated with preterm birth up to an OR of 2.03 (95% CI 1.14 to 3.62).

Conclusion

In a society with social welfare and a highly regulated working environment, occupational lifting was associated with an increased risk of preterm birth.

5.5 Prevention of fetal growth restriction in high‐risk populations

5.5.1 Lifestyle modifications

Ideally, all women should plan their pregnancies, adopting a healthy lifestyle and optimizing any medical conditions and their body mass index. The preconception period provides an opportunity for health promotion with the aim of reducing accepted risk factors, including those associated with FGR. 123

Insufficient gestational weight gain has been associated with an increased risk of FGR, especially in women with low body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). 124 Recognizing that these associations are only based on observational data, we still believe that it would be reasonable to recommend monitoring of weight gain and informing women of the target weight gain range, as recommended by the 2009 Institute of Medicine guidelines. 125 These guidelines recommend a total gestational weight gain of 12.5–18 kg (28–40 lb) for underweight women (BMI < 18.5); 11.5–16 kg (25–35 lb) for the normal weight group (BMI 18.5–24.9); 7–11.5 kg (15–25 lb) for overweight women (BMI 25.0–29.9); and 5–9 kg (11–20 lb) for obese women (BMI ≥ 30). 126

Substance use, including smoking, alcohol, and illicit drugs, is associated with low birth weight and increased perinatal morbidity and mortality. 90 Interventions to promote smoking cessation during pregnancy have been shown to result in a reduction in low birth weight (RR 0.81) and an increase in mean birth weight (+33 g). 127 Women should be advised that smoking cessation at any point in gestation is of benefit, and that the greatest benefit is associated with cessation before 15 weeks of pregnancy. 128 The risk of SGA with alcohol intake is increased with as little as one drink per day. 129

### Blood pressure management in pregnancy: CHAP through the lens of SPRINT [^114Zsknf]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Blood pressure treatment targets during pregnancy

A wealth of epidemiologic evidence supports higher risk for adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes in the setting of chronic hypertension. However, a key challenge in managing pregnant individuals with chronic hypertension has been the uncertainty in BP treatment targets, which vary across society guidelines. This is particularly true given that there has not been good evidence to this point that treatment of mild chronic hypertension improves health outcomes and some evidence that it reduces birth weight. Thus, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines had recommended treatment when systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 110 mmHg. In contrast, the European Society of Cardiology guidelines had stricter thresholds and recommended treatment when SBP ≥ 140 mmHg or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg. In nonpregnant individuals, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines cutoffs for the management of hypertension have an entirely different strategy, recommending not only reclassification but also management of stage 1 hypertension from 140/90 mmHg to < 130/80 mmHg with antihypertensives. While treatment of BP does provide therapeutic control, the lack of data on preventing adverse pregnancy outcomes and the potential for harm related to reduced uteroplacental blood flow and fetal growth restriction has led to hesitation to lower BP treatment targets in pregnancy. Thus, the treatment thresholds of chronic hypertension in pregnancy vary from what the cardiovascular community uses in the rest of the adult population.

### Pregnancy vs. paycheck: a qualitative study of patient's experience with employment during pregnancy at high risk for preterm birth [^117DqMZV]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Simple modifications such as a sitting stool or more frequent breaks often allow a woman to safely and more comfortably complete her work duties during a high risk pregnancy.

Accommodations to limit standing and lifting may be indicated in physically demanding professions, as there are data to suggest lifting cumulative weight over 100 kg per day and standing for over three hours per day increases the risk of PTB. Many of the participants in our study reported positive experiences with employers who proactively made simple accommodations to facilitate continued safe and comfortable employment during pregnancy. Other participants described employers who were unable and/or unwilling to modify job duties, leading to loss of employment. The Americans with Disabilities Act requires employers to provide "reasonable" accommodations for pregnancy-related impairments, as long as it does not cause "undue hardship" to the employer. This legislation requires employers to provide accommodations for pregnant women that would be rendered to other employees with a time-limited medical impairment. For example, if an employee was accommodated with a sitting stool after a back injury, a pregnant women with a similar job description should also have access to a sitting stool. However, the Americans with Disabilities Act only applies to employers with 15 or more employees and is similarly challenging to enforce.
