## Question

Facial paresthesia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about facial paresthesia — what it is, how to localize it, identify likely causes, evaluate it appropriately, manage common scenarios, and plan follow-up. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and anatomic localization. Then, I should construct a prioritized differential diagnosis by temporal pattern and red flags. Next, I will map the diagnostic workup to the suspected etiologies, including when to image and what labs to order. After that, I will outline evidence-based management for the most common causes and special scenarios. Finally, I will set a follow-up and referral framework and close with a concise synthesis that ties mechanism, diagnosis, and treatment together.

> Let me first confirm the definition and neuroanatomy so I don't anchor prematurely: facial paresthesia refers to abnormal tingling, prickling, or "pins-and-needles" sensations in the face, typically reflecting trigeminal nerve involvement, whereas facial weakness reflects facial nerve motor dysfunction; distinguishing sensory from motor domains is foundational to localization and triage, and I should verify that the trigeminal nerve supplies facial sensation while the facial nerve controls facial movement, with overlap in some syndromes such as Ramsay Hunt or perineural invasion of cutaneous malignancy [^114NxbaW] [^112Yx6vW] [^112AZn7q].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check the temporal pattern and laterality because that reshapes the differential: acute unilateral paresthesia suggests Bell's palsy with sensory symptoms, zoster, trauma, or ischemia; subacute or chronic unilateral paresthesia raises concern for trigeminal neuralgia, compressive lesions such as vestibular schwannoma or meningioma, or perineural spread of malignancy; bilateral or progressive symptoms push me toward systemic or inflammatory causes like Guillain-Barré variants, sarcoidosis, or Lyme disease; I should confirm that Bell's palsy is classically unilateral and acute, whereas bifacial weakness with paresthesias is a recognized GBS subtype [^113GWcwF] [^112oMxjq] [^1173tcgD] [^111B3PrK].

> Wait, let me verify the red flags that mandate urgent imaging or specialty referral: progressive or persistent paresthesia beyond three months, new neurologic deficits, ocular symptoms, non-resolving facial weakness, or atypical features such as bilateral involvement, vesicular rash, or systemic signs warrant MRI with contrast to exclude mass lesions, demyelination, infection, or perineural spread; I should double-check that MRI outperforms CT for posterior fossa and perineural disease, and that guidelines discourage routine imaging in straightforward, acute unilateral Bell's palsy without atypical features [^112T6ec3] [^114cNCy2] [^113GWcwF].

> I will now examine the most common cause, Bell's palsy, but I need to ensure I frame it correctly as a diagnosis of exclusion: typical features include acute unilateral facial weakness reaching a nadir within 72 hours, with possible ipsilateral facial pain or paresthesia, taste disturbance, hyperacusis, and ocular surface risk; pathophysiology is thought to involve viral reactivation with facial nerve inflammation and entrapment, and I should confirm that high-dose oral corticosteroids within 72 hours improve recovery and reduce synkinesis, whereas antivirals alone are not recommended, though they may be added to steroids in select cases [^113GWcwF] [^1164UxKM] [^1171VQCw] [^113HC6M5].

> But wait, what if the paresthesia is actually herpes zoster oticus masquerading as Bell's palsy; I should check for a vesicular rash in the ear canal or oropharynx and a painful prodrome, because Ramsay Hunt syndrome requires antiviral therapy and carries a higher risk of incomplete recovery; I need to ensure I don't miss this by inspecting the pinna, external auditory canal, and oropharynx carefully at the bedside [^112Yx6vW] [^113GWcwF].

> Next, I should review trigeminal neuralgia and other trigeminal neuropathies; classic TN presents with paroxysmal, lancinating, triggerable pain in a trigeminal distribution, often without objective sensory loss, whereas secondary TN or trigeminal neuropathy may include paresthesias or numbness and requires MRI to exclude mass lesions or demyelination; I should confirm first-line therapy with carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine and escalate to surgical options such as microvascular decompression or percutaneous procedures if refractory, balancing risks of facial numbness or dysesthesia with different modalities [^111rm8nZ] [^116msAo9] [^113isByQ].

> Hold on, I should verify compressive etiologies in the cerebellopontine angle: vestibular schwannoma and meningioma can cause facial numbness or paresthesia, often with hearing changes, tinnitus, or imbalance, but atypical presentations with isolated facial sensory symptoms do occur; MRI is the modality of choice, and I need to remember that facial paresthesia can also follow stereotactic radiosurgery for vestibular schwannoma, reflecting trigeminal nerve involvement [^1173tcgD] [^114cNCy2] [^112KjK7i].

> I need to ensure I consider perineural invasion from cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma when paresthesia accompanies a head or neck lesion or scar; this is a high-risk scenario with substantial recurrence and poor outcomes, so any neurologic symptom in the territory of a cutaneous malignancy should prompt aggressive oncologic evaluation and imaging to define perineural spread [^112AZn7q].

> Let me reconsider systemic and inflammatory causes when the story is bilateral or progressive: bifacial weakness with paresthesias is a localized GBS variant characterized by acute facial diplegia with distal paresthesias, areflexia, CSF albuminocytologic dissociation, and demyelinating neurophysiology; I should confirm that IVIG is standard treatment and that COVID-19–associated cases have been reported, including post-vaccination, so I must ask about recent infections or immunizations and check reflexes and CSF if suspected [^112oMxjq] [^116uumyM] [^1121xeJb].

> I should double-check for sarcoidosis and Lyme disease in the right epidemiologic context: neurosarcoidosis can cause multiple cranial neuropathies including bilateral facial palsy, and Lyme disease is a leading cause of bilateral facial palsy in endemic regions; targeted serologies and chest imaging may be warranted when the presentation is atypical or bilateral, and I must remember that evidence is insufficient to add corticosteroids to antibiotics in Lyme-related facial palsy [^114D9vkf] [^111B3PrK] [^11776Re8].

> Next, I should review iatrogenic and traumatic causes so I don't overlook the obvious: facial paresthesia can follow dental or maxillofacial procedures, facial cosmetic injections, or facelift surgery due to direct nerve injury or compression; I need to ask about recent procedures and local anesthetics such as prilocaine, which can cause persistent paresthesia, and I should counsel that most injuries are transient, though rare deficits can persist [^11666u3o] [^112kF7oT] [^115N4ftV].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic approach for acute unilateral facial paresis with sensory symptoms: a focused history and examination to exclude identifiable causes is the critical first step, documenting onset, progression, rash, trauma, systemic symptoms, and comorbidities; routine labs are not recommended in straightforward Bell's palsy, but I should obtain targeted testing when the presentation is atypical or endemic risk exists, including Lyme serology, HIV testing, or VZV PCR as indicated [^113GWcwF] [^115LLopH].

> I should double-check imaging indications: MRI brain with contrast is indicated for atypical features, progressive symptoms, non-resolution, bilateral involvement, focal deficits, or concern for mass lesion or demyelination; CT has limited utility for posterior fossa pathology but may be used acutely if MRI is unavailable or to assess fractures; in suspected trigeminal neuralgia, MRI is recommended to exclude secondary causes and guide surgical candidacy [^114cNCy2] [^111rm8nZ].

> Next, I should review electrodiagnostics and ancillary tests: in complete facial paralysis, electroneuronography can help prognosticate, but it is not routinely indicated for incomplete palsy; EMG may assist in chronic cases to assess reinnervation; for suspected GBS variants, nerve conduction studies and CSF analysis support the diagnosis; for TN, neurophysiologic testing is not routinely required, as diagnosis remains clinical [^116neao9] [^112oMxjq] [^111rm8nZ].

> I will now examine management for Bell's palsy and ensure timing is correct: initiate high-dose oral corticosteroids within 72 hours of onset, consider adding an antiviral such as valacyclovir within 72 hours especially if a viral prodrome is present, and implement strict eye care with lubrication, taping, and shields to prevent exposure keratopathy; I should confirm that antivirals alone are not recommended and that surgical decompression remains controversial with low-certainty evidence [^1164UxKM] [^1171VQCw] [^1167Myd5].

> For Ramsay Hunt syndrome, I need to ensure antiviral therapy is started promptly and at treatment doses, typically acyclovir or valacyclovir for 7–10 days, with adjunctive corticosteroids considered; I should verify that outcomes are worse than idiopathic Bell's palsy, so early recognition matters [^notfound].

> For trigeminal neuralgia, I should confirm first-line pharmacotherapy with carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine and titrate to effect, then consider microvascular decompression for refractory cases or percutaneous rhizotomy or radiosurgery when surgery is contraindicated; I need to counsel on sensory complications, including facial numbness and dysesthesia, which vary by modality and technique [^111rm8nZ] [^113isByQ] [^112JSjqi].

> For suspected GBS variants with bifacial weakness and paresthesias, I should not delay disease-modifying therapy; initiate IVIG promptly, monitor for respiratory compromise, and arrange inpatient care with cardiopulmonary surveillance; I should double-check that CSF and nerve conduction studies support the diagnosis when feasible [^112oMxjq] [^114Ma1n4].

> For compressive lesions such as vestibular schwannoma or meningioma, I should coordinate neurosurgical and radiation oncology input; surgical resection can improve facial pain and paresthesias, particularly with complete decompression, while stereotactic radiosurgery is an alternative for selected patients, balancing risks of facial nerve injury and trigeminal paresthesia [^113XBkyd] [^112KjK7i].

> I need to ensure a robust follow-up and referral framework: reassess at about three months and refer to facial nerve or neuro-otology specialists if recovery is incomplete, new neurologic or ocular symptoms emerge, or the diagnosis proves uncertain; persistent paresthesia beyond three months warrants re-imaging and reconsideration of the differential, including perineural spread, recurrent tumor, or alternative neuropathies [^112T6ec3] [^117Td4tM].

> Let me synthesize the key principles so I don't miss anything critical: facial paresthesia localizes to trigeminal pathways and should be interpreted alongside motor findings and temporal evolution; Bell's palsy remains common but is a diagnosis of exclusion, and early corticosteroids improve outcomes; bilateral or progressive sensory-motor facial syndromes demand evaluation for GBS, sarcoidosis, Lyme disease, or compressive lesions; MRI is the imaging modality of choice when red flags are present; and management is etiology-specific, ranging from antivirals and immunotherapy to surgery or radiosurgery, with eye protection prioritized in facial palsy to prevent corneal injury [^113GWcwF] [^1164UxKM] [^112oMxjq] [^114cNCy2].

---

Facial paresthesia is most often due to **trigeminal nerve pathology** (trigeminal neuralgia, herpes zoster, multiple sclerosis, tumors) or **facial nerve disorders** (Bell's palsy, Ramsay Hunt) [^116qFQZM] [^112Yx6vW] [^1173tcgD] [^113HC6M5]. Other causes include **stroke, migraine, diabetes, and medications** [^111byo3N]. Evaluation should start with a focused history and exam, then use MRI to exclude structural causes when red flags are present [^114cNCy2]. Management is cause-specific: anticonvulsants for trigeminal neuralgia [^111rm8nZ], corticosteroids for Bell's palsy [^1164UxKM], and urgent stroke care when indicated [^112pPq2T]. Most cases improve with targeted therapy, but persistent symptoms may need neurology or pain referral [^114HHEbn].

## Common causes of facial paresthesia

Facial paresthesia arises from **diverse etiologies**, including:

- **Trigeminal neuralgia**: Paroxysmal, shock-like facial pain with paresthesia, often triggered by touch or chewing [^111rm8nZ].

- **Herpes zoster (shingles)**: Vesicular rash with facial paresthesia, often in the trigeminal distribution [^112Yx6vW].

- **Bell's palsy**: Acute unilateral facial weakness with possible paresthesia; diagnosis of exclusion [^113HC6M5].

- **Multiple sclerosis**: Demyelination causing facial paresthesia, often with other neurologic signs [^111byo3N].

- **Tumors**: Trigeminal schwannomas, meningiomas, or metastases compressing cranial nerves [^113XBkyd].

- **Stroke**: Ischemic or hemorrhagic lesions affecting facial sensory pathways [^111byo3N].

- **Migraine**: Aura with transient facial paresthesia [^notfound].

- **Diabetes**: Diabetic neuropathy causing facial sensory symptoms [^111byo3N].

- **Medications**: Drugs like prilocaine, azelastine, or chemotherapeutics can cause paresthesia [^11666u3o] [^111q7qxn] [^112n7gfb].

---

## Clinical evaluation

A thorough **clinical evaluation** is essential to identify the underlying cause:

- **History**: Onset, duration, progression, triggers, associated symptoms (pain, weakness, rash), medical history, medications, and trauma [^113GWcwF].

- **Physical examination**: Cranial nerve exam, sensory testing, motor function, and inspection for rash or lesions [^113GWcwF].

- **Neurological examination**: Assess for other neurologic deficits, including motor weakness, reflex changes, or coordination abnormalities [^112oMxjq].

---

## Diagnostic tests

Diagnostic testing should be guided by **clinical suspicion** and may include:

| **Test** | **Indication** |
|-|-|
| MRI | Structural lesions, tumors, multiple sclerosis, stroke [^117VkHF7] |
| CT scan | Acute stroke, trauma, bony abnormalities [^117VkHF7] |
| Electrodiagnostic studies | Peripheral nerve disorders, Bell's palsy [^117VkHF7] |
| Laboratory tests | Diabetes, infections, autoimmune disorders [^113GWcwF] |
| Lumbar puncture | Multiple sclerosis, infections, inflammatory disorders [^11761aab] |

---

## Treatment options

Treatment depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Trigeminal neuralgia**: Anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine), microvascular decompression, or percutaneous procedures [^111rm8nZ].

- **Herpes zoster**: Antivirals (acyclovir, valacyclovir) and analgesics [^notfound].

- **Bell's palsy**: Corticosteroids within 72 hours of onset [^1164UxKM].

- **Multiple sclerosis**: Disease-modifying therapies and symptomatic management [^notfound].

- **Tumors**: Surgical resection, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy [^113XBkyd].

- **Stroke**: Acute stroke protocols, anticoagulation, or thrombolysis [^notfound].

- **Migraine**: Triptans, beta-blockers, anticonvulsants, or calcium channel blockers [^notfound].

- **Diabetes**: Glycemic control and neuropathy management [^notfound].

- **Medication-induced**: Discontinuation or adjustment of the offending medication [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies by **cause**: trigeminal neuralgia and Bell's palsy generally have a good prognosis with treatment, whereas tumors, stroke, and multiple sclerosis may have variable outcomes depending on severity and response to therapy [^116msAo9] [^113HC6M5] [^113XBkyd].

---

## When to seek medical attention

Seek immediate medical attention for **sudden-onset facial paresthesia** with weakness or speech difficulty (possible stroke) [^112pPq2T]; progressive or persistent symptoms; accompanying severe headache, vision changes, or altered consciousness; or a rash suggestive of shingles [^112Yx6vW].

---

Facial paresthesia has a broad differential, but a focused history, exam, and **targeted MRI** [^114cNCy2] usually reveal the cause. Most patients improve with **cause-specific therapy**, though persistent symptoms may require specialist referral [^112T6ec3].

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^113GWcwF]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — diagnostic evaluation emphasizes that a minority of facial paresis/paralysis cases have identifiable causes and should not be treated as Bell's palsy; approximately 70% of facial nerve palsies are Bell's palsy and 30% have other causes, so clinicians should take a comprehensive history, confirm the acute onset of symptoms, document other cranial nerve function, inquire about viral prodrome or hyperacusis and underlying conditions (e.g., prior stroke, brain or parotid tumors, skin cancers of the head/face, trauma, recent infections), and perform a comprehensive physical examination including inspection of the ear canal, tympanic membrane, parotid gland, and head/face/cheek skin, ruling out ear infection, cholesteatoma, and vesicular rashes; atypical presentations (including bilateral facial nerve paresis/paralysis) may warrant additional specialized and more extensive laboratory testing, and clinicians should consider infrequent causes such as Lyme disease in endemic areas, sarcoidosis, Guillain–Barré syndrome, Sjögren's syndrome, and leprosy; Bell's palsy is a diagnosis of exclusion and Table 7 outlines categories and distinguishing features of other causes, with disproportionate presentation among pregnant women and people with diabetes, influenza, a cold, or other upper respiratory illness.

### Bell's palsy: a summary of current evidence and referral algorithm [^114pgtep]. Family Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Spontaneous idiopathic facial nerve (Bell's) palsy leaves residual hemifacial weakness in 29% which is severe and disfiguring in over half of these cases. Acute medical management remains the best way to improve outcomes. Reconstructive surgery can improve long term disfigurement. However, acute and surgical options are time-dependent. As family practitioners see, on average, one case every 2 years, a summary of this condition based on common clinical questions may improve acute management and guide referral for those who need specialist input. We formulated a series of clinical questions likely to be of use to family practitioners on encountering this condition and sought evidence from the literature to answer them. The lifetime risk is 1 in 60, and is more common in pregnancy and diabetes mellitus. Patients often present with facial pain or paraesthesia, altered taste and intolerance to loud noise in addition to facial droop. It is probably caused by ischaemic compression of the facial nerve within the meatal segment of the facial canal probably as a result of viral inflammation. When given early, high dose corticosteroids can improve outcomes. Neither antiviral therapy nor other adjuvant therapies are supported by evidence. As the facial muscles remain viable re-innervation targets for up to 2 years, late referrals require more complex reconstructions. Early recognition, steroid therapy and early referral for facial reanimation (when the diagnosis is secure) are important features of good management when encountering these complex cases.

### Progressive bilateral facial weakness [^114pxDCP]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Comment

Lower motor neurone facial weakness and (to a lesser extent) the absence of deep tendon reflexes are highly localising signs. The lesion explaining the facial and the limb weakness can be localised to somewhere between the peripheral nerve roots and muscles; however, there are many possible causes (table 1). Dominant sensory symptoms (paraesthesias) make either a neuromuscular junction pathology (eg, botulism or myasthenia gravis) or a myopathy (eg, polymyositis) less likely. The bilateral, although asynchronous, onset of the facial weakness suggests that generalised or multifocal disease rather than a solitary lesion. The progression over days favours an infective or inflammatory/immune cause and makes a vascular, neoplastic or degenerative process less likely.

Table 1
The differential diagnosis of acute bifacial weakness

Other possibilities include listerial rhombencephalitis, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, Sjögren's syndrome or other causes of multiple mononeuropathy, such as vasculitis, HIV, syphilis or Lyme disease. The patient had not travelled outside Australia, making Lyme disease unlikely. 'Facial-onset sensorimotor neuropathy', a novel neurodegenerative neuropathy, is also possible; however, the clinical course is usually indolent and progresses to involve other limbs. A postinfective immune phenomenon would be an alternative.

Normal or negative investigations included HIV, serum ACE, creatine kinase, C reactive protein, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, antinuclear antibody, extractable nuclear antigen, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood cultures, antiganglioside antibodies, viral serology and contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed 7 lymphocytes/µL (≤ 5), protein 1.04 g/L (0.15–0.45 g/L) and glucose 4.5 mmol/L (3.3–4.4 mmol/L). Oligoclonal bands were positive in the serum and CSF. Neurophysiology 1 week after admission showed absent sural nerve sensory potentials, with prolonged distal motor latencies, markedly reduced motor conduction velocities and prolonged and dispersed F waves bilaterally in the lower limbs, consistent with an acute demyelinating polyneuropathy.

### Treatment of soft tissue filler complications: expert consensus recommendations [^112kF7oT]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Dysesthesias, Paresthesia, and Anesthesia

Nerve damage during an esthetic procedure, although very rare, can occur as result of different causes such as direct trauma, injection of filler into the nerve, tissue compression by the product. Nerve injury may be either transient and reversible, or permanent. The most common site of dysesthesias, paresthesia, and anesthesia is the infraorbital nerve. Less commonly, a transient Bell's palsy or marginal mandibular nerve dysfunction has been seen and may last several weeks.

Although 71% of patients with Bell's palsy experience complete spontaneous resolution, the remaining 29% exhibit lifelong residual hemifacial weakness. Besides the protective strategies of the ocular surface (artificial tears, occlusion, etc.), the mainstay of acute management of Bell's palsy is a short course of high-dose (for example, 1 mg/kg) oral steroids. Surgical decompression of the meatal segment, antiviral therapy, electrotherapy, physical therapy, and acupuncture has been proposed, though the evidence does not support their use.

The panel considers it crucial to have a thorough knowledge of facial anatomy to minimize the incidence of such complications.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^116neao9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Bell's palsy, named after the Scottish anatomist, Sir Charles Bell, is the most common acute mono-neuropathy, or disorder affecting a single nerve, and is the most common diagnosis associated with facial nerve weakness/paralysis. Bell's palsy is a rapid unilateral facial nerve paresis (weakness) or paralysis (complete loss of movement) of unknown cause. The condition leads to the partial or complete inability to voluntarily move facial muscles on the affected side of the face. Although typically self-limited, the facial paresis/paralysis that occurs in Bell's palsy may cause significant temporary oral incompetence and an inability to close the eyelid, leading to potential eye injury. Additional long-term poor outcomes do occur and can be devastating to the patient. Treatments are generally designed to improve facial function and facilitate recovery. There are myriad treatment options for Bell's palsy, and some controversy exists regarding the effectiveness of several of these options, and there are consequent variations in care. In addition, numerous diagnostic tests available are used in the evaluation of patients with Bell's palsy. Many of these tests are of questionable benefit in Bell's palsy. Furthermore, while patients with Bell's palsy enter the health care system with facial paresis/paralysis as a primary complaint, not all patients with facial paresis/paralysis have Bell's palsy. It is a concern that patients with alternative underlying etiologies may be misdiagnosed or have unnecessary delay in diagnosis. All of these quality concerns provide an important opportunity for improvement in the diagnosis and management of patients with Bell's palsy.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve the accuracy of diagnosis for Bell's palsy, to improve the quality of care and outcomes for patients with Bell's palsy, and to decrease harmful variations in the evaluation and management of Bell's palsy. This guideline addresses these needs by encouraging accurate and efficient diagnosis and treatment and, when applicable, facilitating patient follow-up to address the management of long-term sequelae or evaluation of new or worsening symptoms not indicative of Bell's palsy. The guideline is intended for all clinicians in any setting who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with Bell's palsy. The target population is inclusive of both adults and children presenting with Bell's palsy. ACTION STATEMENTS: The development group made a strong recommendation that (a) clinicians should assess the patient using history and physical examination to exclude identifiable causes of facial paresis or paralysis in patients presenting with acute-onset unilateral facial paresis or paralysis, (b) clinicians should prescribe oral steroids within 72 hours of symptom onset for Bell's palsy patients 16 years and older, (c) clinicians should not prescribe oral antiviral therapy alone for patients with new-onset Bell's palsy, and (d) clinicians should implement eye protection for Bell's palsy patients with impaired eye closure. The panel made recommendations that (a) clinicians should not obtain routine laboratory testing in patients with new-onset Bell's palsy, (b) clinicians should not routinely perform diagnostic imaging for patients with new-onset Bell's palsy, (c) clinicians should not perform electrodiagnostic testing in Bell's palsy patients with incomplete facial paralysis, and (d) clinicians should reassess or refer to a facial nerve specialist those Bell's palsy patients with (1) new or worsening neurologic findings at any point, (2) ocular symptoms developing at any point, or (3) incomplete facial recovery 3 months after initial symptom onset. The development group provided the following options: (a) clinicians may offer oral antiviral therapy in addition to oral steroids within 72 hours of symptom onset for patients with Bell's palsy, and (b) clinicians may offer electrodiagnostic testing to Bell's palsy patients with complete facial paralysis. The development group offered the following no recommendations: (a) no recommendation can be made regarding surgical decompression for patients with Bell's palsy, (b) no recommendation can be made regarding the effect of acupuncture in patients with Bell's palsy, and (c) no recommendation can be made regarding the effect of physical therapy in patients with Bell's palsy.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^116Eeves]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Etiology and symptom profile — while a viral etiology is suspected, the exact mechanism of Bell's palsy is currently unknown, and facial paresis or paralysis is thought to result from facial nerve inflammation and edema with swelling in the narrow temporal bone canal leading to compression and temporary or permanent nerve damage; patients may experience dryness of the eye or mouth, taste disturbance or loss, hyperacusis, sagging of the eyelid or corner of the mouth, and ipsilateral pain around the ear or face is not an infrequent presenting symptom.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^113CiTGU]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — algorithm of guideline key action statements: For a patient presenting with acute onset, unilateral facial paresis or paralysis, assess with history & physical exam to exclude identifiable causes of facial paresis/paralysis, prescribe oral steroids, and offer oral antiviral therapy in addition to oral steroids. If the Bell's palsy patient has incomplete eye closure, implement eye protection. If the Bell's palsy patient has complete facial paralysis, offer electrodiagnostic testing. When any of the following are present — new or worsening neurologic findings at any point, ocular symptoms developing at any point, or incomplete facial recovery 3 months after initial onset — reassess or refer to a facial nerve specialist or ocular specialist for ocular symptoms; if none apply, acute management of patient complete.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^112T6ec3]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — patient follow-up: Clinicians should reassess or refer to a facial nerve specialist those Bell's palsy patients with (1) new or worsening neurologic findings at any point, (2) ocular symptoms developing at any point, or (3) incomplete facial recovery 3 months after initial symptom onset. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, Level of confidence in evidence: High, Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm, and Policy level: Recommendation. Rationale includes that based on the natural history of Bell's palsy most patients will show complete recovery 3 months after onset, that failure to recover completely within 3 months warrants reevaluation to reconsider the initial diagnosis, and that the 3-month timeframe is an appropriate window to identify other causes.

### COVID-19-associated bifacial weakness with paresthesia subtype of Guillain-Barrésyndrome [^116uumyM]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2020). Medium credibility.

We report a case of bifacial weakness with paresthesia, a recognized Guillain-Barré syndrome subtype characterized by rapidly progressive facial weakness and paresthesia without ataxia or other cranial neuropathies, which was temporally associated with antecedent coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). This case highlights a potentially novel but critically important neurologic association of the COVID-19 disease process. Herein, we detail the clinicoradiologic work-up and diagnosis, clinical course, and multidisciplinary medical management of this patient with COVID-19. This case is illustrative of the increasingly recognized but potentially underreported neurologic manifestations of COVID-19, which must be considered and further investigated in this pandemic disease.

### Isolated facial diplegia in Guillain-Barrésyndrome: bifacial weakness with paresthesias [^112oMxjq]. Muscle & Nerve (2015). Low credibility.

Bifacial weakness with paresthesias (BFP) is a subtype of Guillain-Barré syndrome defined by rapidly progressive bilateral facial weakness in the absence of other cranial neuropathies, ataxia, or limb weakness. Many patients also complain of distal limb paresthesias and display diminished or absent deep tendon reflexes. BFP is a localized form of Guillain-Barré syndrome and is thought to be caused exclusively by demyelinating- rather than axonal-type neuropathy. Patients with BFP do not display anti-ganglioside IgG antibodies. Since it is rare, many physicians are unfamiliar with BFP, as bilateral facial weakness is more commonly associated with sarcoidosis, Lyme disease, or meningeal pathology. Many patients diagnosed with bilateral Bell palsy may instead have BFP. In this review, we highlight the clinical features of BFP and outline diagnostic criteria.

### Facial pain and sensory outcomes following resection of tumors compressing the trigeminal nerve [^113XBkyd]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Tumors compressing the trigeminal nerve can cause facial pain, numbness, or paresthesias. Limited data exist describing how these symptoms change after resection and what factors predict symptom improvement. The objective of this study was to report trigeminal pain and sensory outcomes after tumor resection and identify factors predicting postoperative symptom improvement.

Methods

This retrospective study included patients with tumors causing facial pain, numbness, or paresthesias who underwent resection. Trigeminal schwannomas were excluded. Logistic regression, recursive partitioning, and time-to-event analyses were used to report outcomes and identify variables associated with facial sensory outcomes.

Results

Eighty-six patients met inclusion criteria, and the median follow-up was 3.1 years; 63 patients (73%) had meningiomas and 23 (27%) had vestibular schwannomas (VSs). Meningioma patients presented with pain, numbness, and paresthesias in 56%, 76%, and 25% of cases, respectively, compared with 9%, 91%, and 39%, respectively, for patients with VS. Most meningioma patients had symptoms for less than 1 year (60%), whereas the majority of VS patients had symptoms for 1–5 years (59%). The median meningioma and VS diameters were 3.0 and 3.4 cm, respectively. For patients with meningiomas, gross-total resection (GTR) was achieved in 27% of patients, near-total resection (NTR) in 29%, and subtotal resection (STR) in 44%. For patients with VS, GTR was achieved in 9%, NTR in 30%, and STR in 61%. Pain improved immediately after tumor resection in 81% of patients and in 92% of patients by 6 weeks. Paresthesias improved immediately in 80% of patients, increasing to 84% by 6 weeks. Numbness improved more slowly, with 52% of patients improving immediately, increasing to 79% by 2 years. Pain recurred in 22% of patients with meningiomas and 0% of patients with VSs. After resection, the Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) facial pain intensity score improved in 73% of patients. The tumor diameter significantly predicted improvement in BNI score (OR 0.47/cm larger, 95% CI 0.22–0.99; p = 0.047). Complete decompression of the trigeminal nerve was associated with qualitative improvement in pain (p = 0.037) and decreased pain recurrence (OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01–0.67; p = 0.024).

Conclusions

Most patients with facial sensory symptoms caused by meningiomas or VSs experienced improvement after resection. Surgery led to immediate and sustained improvement in pain and paresthesias, whereas numbness was slower to improve. Patients with smaller tumors and complete decompression of the trigeminal nerve were more likely to experience improvement in facial pain.

### Factors associated with facial nerve paresis following gamma knife for vestibular schwannoma [^112KjK7i]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Evaluate the incidence of and potential contributory factors to facial nerve paresis and other cranial neuropathies (CN) following stereotactic radiosurgery with Gamma Knife (GK) for primary treatment of vestibular schwannoma (VS).

Study Design

Retrospective chart review.

Setting

Tertiary referral center.

Patients

Charts were reviewed for all adult patients receiving primary GK treatment for unilateral VS between 2005 and 2013. Patients with NF2 or previous surgery were excluded from analysis.

Intervention

GK radiosurgery.

Main Outcome Measures

The incidence of new-onset facial nerve paresis after primary GK treatment of VS was evaluated. Secondary endpoints included other cranial neuropathies.

Results

One hundred thirty-three patients with VS received primary GK therapy. Posttreatment CN developed in 33 patients (24.8%). Twelve patients (9.0%) experienced trigeminal paresthesia, 11 (8.3%) developed sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) requiring steroids, and seven (5.3%) demonstrated facial paresis. The mean maximum cochlear dose was 15.49Gy in patients with facial paresis compared with 12.42Gy in subjects without facial paresis (p = 0.032). Subjects with facial paresis were more likely to have a lateral tumor without fundal fluid on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (71%) compared with subjects without facial paresis (43%).

Conclusions

In the treatment of VS with primary GK, maximum cochlear dose was significantly associated with facial paresis. Laterally extending tumors without fundal fluid on MRI experienced higher rates of facial paresis. These factors should be considered during GK treatment planning for VS.

### Neurocutaneous disease: neurocutaneous dysesthesias [^114dTRJa]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Dysesthesia is a generic term for a cutaneous symptom — such as pruritus, burning, tingling, stinging, anesthesia, hypoesthesia, tickling, crawling, cold sensation, or even pain — without a primary cutaneous condition in a well-defined location that is often caused by nerve trauma, impingement, or irritation. There are multiple types of dysesthesias depending on the body location and the nerves involved. While location, exact symptoms, and etiologies might vary, the underlying theme is that these conditions are of neurologic origin and have dermatologic consequences. For many of these conditions, the symptoms are localized to the skin, and patients frequently present to the dermatologist; it is important for dermatologists to be knowledgeable about these symptoms and their underlying causes. In part II of this continuing medical education review, the primary diagnoses associated with underlying cutaneous dysesthesias will be explored, including scalp dysesthesia, trigeminal trophic syndrome, meralgia paresthetica, notalgia paresthetica, and brachioradial pruritus. The typical demographics in terms of symptoms, location, and patient populations will be discussed in addition to the specific etiologies, workups, and possible treatment options.

### Bifacial weakness with paresthesias: serial nerve conduction studies indicate diffuse demyelinating neuropathy [^114w94Rw]. Muscle & Nerve (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Bifacial weakness with paresthesias is a rare subtype of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), characterized by facial diplegia in the absence of any other cranial neuropathies, limb weakness, or ataxia. Frequently, patients also complain of distal limb paresthesias before or at the time they develop facial weakness.

Methods

We describe a man who developed post-infective isolated symmetric facial diplegia associated with distal paresthesias. Nerve conduction studies were conducted at 4 time-points over 6 months.

Results

A monophasic disease course and presence of cerebrospinal fluid albuminocytological dissociation supported a diagnosis of bifacial weakness with paresthesias. Serial nerve conduction studies demonstrated an evolving demyelinating neuropathy with evidence of distal and proximal demyelination without conduction block, which partially resolved over time. Despite complete resolution of facial weakness within weeks, distal paresthesias persisted beyond 6 months.

Conclusions

This study suggests that neuropathy in patients with bifacial weakness and paresthesias is demyelinating and diffuse.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^112VsUuk]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy evaluation considerations — Bell's palsy is rapid in onset (< 72 hours) and is diagnosed when no other medical etiology is identified as a cause of the facial weakness. Bilateral Bell's palsy is rare, and currently no cause for Bell's palsy has been identified. Other conditions may cause facial paralysis, including stroke, brain tumors, tumors of the parotid gland or infratemporal fossa, cancer involving the facial nerve, and systemic and infectious diseases, including zoster, sarcoidosis, and Lyme disease. Bell's palsy is typically self-limited and may occur in men, women, and children but is more common in those 15 to 45 years old; those with diabetes, upper respiratory ailments, or compromised immune systems; or during pregnancy. The guideline development group (GDG) accepted the definition of "acute" or "rapid onset" to mean that the occurrence of paresis/paralysis typically progresses to its maximum severity within 72 hours of onset of the paresis/paralysis.

Squamous cell skin cancer — perineural involvement and neurologic symptoms: In tumors with perineural involvement (PNI), clinical symptoms suggesting possible involvement of sensory or motor nerves are commonly absent but may occur, and symptoms include pain, burning, stinging, anesthesia, paresthesia, facial paralysis, diplopia, and blurred vision. Any suggestion of neurologic involvement in the region of a CSCC should place that tumor in a high-risk category, as PNI is associated with recurrence, metastasis, and poor outcomes, and poorer outcomes are associated with the presence of clinical symptoms and extent of neuronal involvement.

### Bell palsy: rapid evidence review [^113HC6M5]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Bell's palsy:

- **Definition**: Bell's palsy, also known as idiopathic facial paralysis, is an acute-onset, isolated, unilateral, lower motor neurone facial weakness/paralysis.
- **Pathophysiology**: The exact cause of Bell's palsy is unknown; however, reactivation of herpes virus at the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve has been postulated.
- **Disease course**: The likely vascular distension, inflammation, and edema with ischemia of the facial nerve results in Bell's palsy, which presents with clinical manifestations of unilateral weakness/paralysis of upper and lower facial muscles, drooping of ipsilateral eyelids, dry eye due to inability to close eyes completely, epiphora, drooping of the corner of the mouth, ipsilateral impaired/loss of taste sensation, difficulty in eating, dribbling of saliva, altered sensation on the affected side of the face, pain in or behind the ear, hyperacusis on the affected side if stapedius muscle is involved. Spontaneous complete recovery occurs in 70–75% of untreated patients.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Bell's palsy is not associated with an increased risk of mortality.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^114BahYJ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Facial paralysis etiologies and clinical features — Table 7 details conditions with etiologic agents and distinguishing factors, including autoimmune, idiopathic, infectious, inherited, neoplastic, neurovascular, and traumatic causes. Autoimmune Guillain-Barré lists an etiologic agent of autoimmune/infectious with distinguishing factors of acute polyneuropathy, ascending paralysis, and weakness of hands and feet progressing to the trunk. Idiopathic acute facial nerve paresis/paralysis is noted as classic Bell's palsy with other etiologies excluded. Infectious examples include Ramsay Hunt syndrome from herpes zoster virus with a pronounced prodrome of pain and vesicular eruption in the ear canal or pharynx; Lyme disease due to the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi that may be bilateral with rash and arthralgias; human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) associated with fever, malaise, and CD4 count; and otitis media from bacterial pathogens with gradual onset, ear pain, fever, and hearing loss. Inherited heritable disorders show autosomal dominant inheritance with family history as high as 4%, and may have other neurologic disorders. Neoplastic causes such as facial nerve tumor, skin cancer, and parotid tumors involve multiple carcinomas of the head and neck and may involve only select branches of the facial nerve or other cranial nerves, presenting as multiple cranial neuropathies. Neurovascular stroke involves ischemia or hemorrhage with forehead sparing most often and extremities often involved. Traumatic injury to the facial nerve is tied to trauma, including forceps delivery, with timing of injury coinciding with the trauma.

### Numbness matters: a clinical review of trigeminal neuropathy [^116qFQZM]. Cephalalgia (2011). Low credibility.

Aim

Trigeminal neuropathies are a group of clinical disorders that involve injury to primary first-order neurons within the trigeminal nerve. We review the spectrum of etiologies underlying both painful and non-painful trigeminal neuropathies, with attention to particularly dangerous processes that may elude the clinician in the absence of a meticulous evaluation. Complications and management issues specific to patients with trigeminal neuropathy are discussed.

Methods

Retrospective literature review.

Results

Facial or intraoral numbness, the hallmark of trigeminal neuropathy, may represent the earliest symptomology of malignancy or autoimmune connective tissue disease as sensory neurons are destroyed. Such numbness, especially if progressive, necessitates periodic evaluation and vigilance even years after presentation if no diagnosis can be made.

Conclusions

In the routine evaluation of patients with facial pain, the clinician will inevitably be confronted with secondary pathology of the trigeminal nerves and nuclei. The appearance of numbness, even when pain continues to be the most pressing complaint, necessitates clinical assessment of the integrity of all aspects of the trigeminal pathways, which may also include neurophysiologic, radiographic, and laboratory evaluation.

### The etiology of Bell's palsy: a review [^111PPGVi]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Bell's palsy (BP), named after the Scottish anatomist Sir Charles Bell, is the most frequent diagnosis linked to facial nerve palsy/paralysis as well as the most frequent acute mono-neuropathy. It affects individuals across multiple ages and both sexes, with an annual incidence ranging from 11.5 to 53.3 per 100,000 persons across multiple populations. Typically, BP results in partial or complete inability to automatically move the affected side of the facial muscles. Although it usually resolves within weeks or months, BP facial paresis/paralysis may lead to severe temporary oral insufficiency and an incapability to close the eyelids in some cases, resulting in potentially permanent eye injury. In approximately 25% of patients with BP, moderate-to-severe facial asymmetry may persist, frequently impairing patients' quality of life. These are among BP's long-term adverse consequences, which can be devastating for patients.

Despite its severe effects, the exact etiology of BP remains unclear. The Guideline Development Group (GDG) has identified the diagnosis of BP as one of exclusion, requiring careful clinical elimination of other potential etiologies of facial paralysis/paresis, such as trauma, neoplasms, congenital or syndromic problems, postsurgical facial paralysis/paresis, or infection by agents including zoster and Lyme disease. This diagnosis also fails to address cases of recurrent facial paresis/paralysis. The GDG has also recognized the "acute" or "rapid onset" nature of BP and that the occurrence of paralysis /paresis usually reaches its maximum severity in less than 72 h of paralysis/paresis onset. But the current literature similarly lacks a precise etiology for the acute onset of facial palsy.

In this review, we sought to summarize potential clinical etiologies of BP, through search for eligible studies on PubMed, Embase, and the Web of Science up to 31 October 2018 using the following search terms: acute facial paresis/paralysis, Bell's palsy, idiopathic facial palsy, and/or etiology. There are five major theories regarding the causes of BP including anatomical, viral infection, ischemia, inflammation, and cold stimulation (Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).

### Medical management of acute facial paralysis [^114vpMfs]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Acute facial paralysis (FP) describes acute onset of partial or complete weakness of the facial muscles innervated by the facial nerve. Acute FP occurs within a few hours to days. The differential diagnosis is broad; however, the most common cause is viral-associated Bell Palsy. A comprehensive history and physical examination are essential in arriving at a diagnosis. Medical treatment for acute FP depends on the specific diagnosis; however, corticosteroids and antiviral medications are the cornerstone of therapy. Lack of recovery after 4 months should prompt further diagnostic workup.

Conclusion

BFP is a disturbing condition for the affected patient and contrary to UFP, it is generally attributable to a specific cause. Associated aetiologies are various and differential diagnosis is challenging. If a correct diagnosis is formulated, possibilities to recover are elevated and directly correlated to the initiation of appropriate treatment. Physicians should rule out all possible causes before claiming a BFP as idiopathic.

### Referral of adults with obstructive sleep apnea for surgical consultation: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^112N1vMD]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2021). High credibility.

AASM clinical practice guideline — adults with obstructive sleep apnea intolerant or unaccepting of positive airway pressure: We recommend that clinicians discuss referral to a sleep surgeon with adults with OSA who are intolerant of or unaccepting of PAP as part of a patient-centered discussion of alternative treatment options (STRONG). Remarks specify that the recommendation to discuss referral is not required to result in referral and does not preclude other options (eg, mandibular advancement device, positional therapy, lifestyle changes); the strong recommendation to discuss surgical referral with patients with a BMI < 40 kg/m² is not against discussion with patients with a BMI ≥ 40 kg/m², and for patients with the BMI range of 35–40 kg/m², discussion regarding a referral to both sleep and bariatric surgeons is appropriate. The TF made this strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence from 4 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 239 observational studies; meta-analyses demonstrated a clinically significant reduction in excessive sleepiness, snoring, BP, and AHI/RDI, and a clinically significant improvement in sleep-related and general QOL, while indicating a clinically significant risk of permanent dysphagia; the incidence of perioperative death was not reported. The overall quality of evidence was low due to imprecision and risk of bias, and rare but important adverse effects have been reported including dysphagia, taste alteration, mandibular paresthesias, perceived worsening of facial appearance, aspiration, hemorrhage, and globus pharyngeus, but the incidence of these is low.

Calcium-stimulated calcitonin — protocol, safety, and thresholds: Because pentagastrin is limited in Europe and unavailable in the U.S., a calcium-stimulation should be performed with calcium, which has better tolerance and a similar diagnostic efficacy. Calcium gluconate (25 mg or 2.3 mg of elemental calcium/kg of ideal body weight) is given intravenously, with calcitonin samples collected before and 2, 5, and 10 minutes after calcium injection. Potential adverse effects include flushing, feeling of warmth, and facial paresthesias with altered gustatory sensation; rare sinus bradycardia has been described, so the test should not be performed in patients with sinus bradycardia, atrioventricular block, or electrolyte imbalance, and calcium infusion should be performed with cardiac monitoring. Proposed threshold values for MTC are 79 and 79 pg/mL for females and males, respectively.

### History of facial pain diagnosis [^112GYqxD]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

There are other causes of TN. Wartenberg had previously pointed out that several cases can be associated with tumours, yet all have classical features of TN. Subsequently, it has been noted that posterior fossa meningiomas or neuromas are found in about 2% of cases presenting with a typical TN. When tumours are located more peripherally, they are likely to be associated with sensory disturbances. Multiple sclerosis is associated with TN and is seen in 2–4% of patients with MS. It can even be the first sign of MS, and some of these patients have bilateral pain.

In 1988, the first classification and diagnostic criteria for headache disorders, cranial neuralgias and facial pain was published by the International Headache Society. This classification has subsequently been revised. In the third beta version from 2013, TN is now divided into three classes: Classical TN with morphological changes in the trigeminal root by a vessel, secondary TN, where the neuralgia is secondary to an identifiable neurological disease, and idiopathic TN where the etiology is unknown.

### Cutaneous manifestations as the presenting signs of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma / high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 rearrangements [^1169GPNZ]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Although cutaneous involvement of DLBCL is rare, it is important to recognize it early because of its rapid progression. This unusual presentation as lower extremity "bug-bites", paresthesia, and edema along with systemic B symptoms may elicit a broad differential, including cellulitis, allergic reaction, or venomous insect bite. Further workup with skin biopsy would be warranted in patients that do not respond to antibiotics or antihistamines and have a rapid progression such as our patient. Systemic B symptoms and rapid cutaneous involvement of violaceous nodules and plaques should alert dermatologists and oncologists that a systemic lymphoma with cutaneous involvement may be likely. The initial presentation of skin lesions on the lower extremity may be reminiscent of the variant named primary cutaneous DLBCL, leg type. However, given the extensive systemic involvement and pathology findings in this case, the diagnosis was favored to be systemic DLBCL/HGBL-MYC/BCL2 with cutaneous manifestations, rather than primary cutaneous DLBCL, leg type with extracutaneous manifestations.

Our patient also experienced a unilateral Bell palsy. Rarely, DLBCL has been associated Guillain-Barré syndromeand cranial nerve involvementin the literature. Facial hemiplegia and paresthesia may precede cutaneous DLBCL, providing a subtle yet important clue for diagnosis.

Pathology and genetic analyses are crucial for diagnosis and prognostic assessment. Double-expressor phenotypes, overexpressing both MYC and BCL2, and rearrangements in these genes are associated with poor prognosis and poor response to traditional rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone chemotherapy. These high-risk mutations have been shown to have improved survival benefits with dose-adjusted etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin. However, HyperCVAD therapy may be more suitable for CNS involvement. This regimen may have higher complete response rates, but this must be weighed against higher complication risk.

### Microvascular decompression and radiofrequency for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia: a meta-analysis [^113wMwYN]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Facial numbness

This study found that RF had a greater association with facial numbness than MVD did, which is consistent with Tatli's findings. Compared with MVD, RF carries a specific risk of facial numbness as an extension of its therapeutic mechanism; additionally, there seems to be a correlation between pain relief and the intensity of facial numbness. The sensory branches of the trigeminal nerve are composed of different types of sensory nerve fibers, including unmyelinated c fibers, which transmit nociceptive signals, and myelinated Aα and Aβ fibers, which conduct tactile sensations. In clinical practice, it is difficult to realize the highly selective ablation of pain conduction c fibers without damaging Aα and Aβ fibers, which are the main cause of postoperative facial numbness. However, although the permanent facial numbness (mainly hypesthesia, although paresthesias have also been described) is common, it seems to be tolerable to most patients. Moreover, clinicians have found choosing an appropriate thermocoagulation temperature, can balance the intensity of RF-related facial numbness and pain relief. Therefore, we considered that the cause of facial numbness is not the most important factor in the choice of preferred treatment.

Gamma knife surgery (GKS) for trigeminal neuralgia — effectiveness, onset, and sensory adverse effects: There is one Class I randomized controlled trial comparing two different regimens, and this study showed no major differences between the gamma knife techniques used. One year after gamma knife therapy complete pain relief with no medication occurs in up to 69% of patients, falling to 52% at 3 years, and pain relief can be delayed for a mean of 1 month. In the Class III studies, sensory complications occur in an average of 6% of patients; in large Class IV series facial numbness is reported in 9 to 37% of patients and troublesome sensory loss or paresthesia in 6 to 13%, whereas anesthesia dolorosa is practically absent. Quality of life improves and 88% are satisfied with the outcome.

### Facial pain: clinical differential diagnosis [^114NxbaW]. The Lancet: Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis of pain in the face as the presenting complaint can be difficult. We propose an approach based on history and neurological examination, which allows a working diagnosis to be made at the bedside, including aetiological hypotheses, leading to a choice of investigations. Neuralgias are characterised by stabs of short lasting, lancinating pain, and, although neuralgias are often primary, imaging may be needed to exclude symptomatic forms. Facial pain with cranial nerve symptoms and signs is almost exclusively of secondary origin and requires urgent examination. Facial pain with focal autonomic signs is mostly primary and belongs to the group of the idiopathic trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, but can occasionally be secondary. Pure facial pain is most often due to sinusitis and the chewing apparatus, but also a multitude of other causes. The pain can also be idiopathic. Imaging as well as non-neurological specialist assessment is often necessary in these cases.

### Trigeminal neuralgia-diagnosis and treatment [^117BHz4f]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is characterized by touch-evoked unilateral brief shock-like paroxysmal pain in one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve. In addition to the paroxysmal pain, some patients also have continuous pain. TN is divided into classical TN (CTN) and secondary TN (STN). Etiology and pathophysiology Demyelination of primary sensory trigeminal afferents in the root entry zone is the predominant pathophysiological mechanism. Most likely, demyelination paves the way for generation of ectopic impulses and ephaptic crosstalk. In a significant proportion of the patients, the demyelination is caused by a neurovascular conflict with morphological changes such as compression of the trigeminal root. However, there are also other unknown etiological factors, as only half of the CTN patients have morphological changes. STN is caused by multiple sclerosis or a space-occupying lesion affecting the trigeminal nerve. Differential diagnosis and treatment Important differential diagnoses include trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, posttraumatic or postherpetic pain and other facial pains. First line treatment is prophylactic medication with sodium channel blockers, and second line treatment is neurosurgical intervention. Future perspectives Future studies should focus on genetics, unexplored etiological factors, sensory function, the neurosurgical outcome and complications, combination and neuromodulation treatment as well as development of new drugs with better tolerability.

### Guillain-​ barrésyndrome associated with COVID-19 vaccination [^1121xeJb]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure
Systematic review of published literature in study of Guillain-​Barré syndrome associated with coronavirus vaccination, 2021. GBS, Guillain-​Barré syndrome.

On the basis of the clinical diagnostic classification of GBS, we found that most case-patients had the classic form (22/39), followed by bilateral facial palsy with paresthesia (12/39), the paraparetic form (4/39), and GBS–Miller Fisher syndrome overlap variant (1/39). We defined all classic and paraparetic forms of GBS (26/26) as level 1 or 2 on the basis of the Brighton criteria. We identified the GBS subtype in 33/39 cases by electrophysiological examination; most reported case-patients had a diagnosis of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (23/33), followed by acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy (4/33) and acute motor axonal neuropathy (3/33). For GBS management, 33 case-patients received intravenous immunoglobulin and 2 received plasmapheresis. One case-patient died; 9 case-patients required mechanical ventilation during hospitalization. The scores on the GBS disability scale were only available for 30 cases; 12 scored > 4 (i.e. indicating bedridden or chair-bound status) during follow-up or after discharge.

Similar to previous reviews on GBS associated with COVID-19, we found that both COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination mostly cause the classic form of GBS (under the clinical diagnosis classification) and the acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy subtype (based on electrodiagnostic features) within 2 weeks of infection or vaccination. However, the bilateral facial palsy with paresthesia variant and initial onset symptoms of facial diplegia were more frequently found in GBS case-patients after COVID-19 vaccination.

Case series and reports can indicate safety issues and outline clinical features of diseases, but they cannot establish robust causal relationships between COVID-19 vaccination and GBS. Despite the benefits (e.g. increase in the number of persons not susceptible to infection and decrease in severe outcomes after infection) of COVID-19 vaccination far outweighing the potentially severe adverse events after infection, our findings highlight the need for vigilance in patients with neurologic symptoms after COVID-19 vaccination and for postvaccination surveillance programs to assess causality of GBS.

### Persistent idiopathic facial pain [^112zddzT]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

Background Persistent idiopathic facial pain (PIFP) is a chronic disorder recurring daily for more than two hours per day over more than three months, in the absence of clinical neurological deficit. PIFP is the current terminology for Atypical Facial Pain and is characterized by daily or near daily pain that is initially confined but may subsequently spread. Pain cannot be attributed to any pathological process, although traumatic neuropathic mechanisms are suspected. When present intraorally, PIFP has been termed 'Atypical Odontalgia', and this entity is discussed in a separate article in this special issue. PIFP is often a difficult but important differential diagnosis among chronic facial pain syndromes. Aim To summarize current knowledge on diagnostic criteria, differential diagnosis, pathophysiology and management of PIFP. Methods We present a narrative review reporting current literature and personal experience. Additionally, we discuss and differentiate the common differential diagnoses associated with PIFP including traumatic trigeminal neuropathies, regional myofascial pain, atypical neurovascular pains and atypical trigeminal neuropathic pains. Results and conclusion The underlying pathophysiology in PIFP is still enigmatic, however neuropathic mechanisms may be relevant. PIFP needs interdisciplinary collaboration to rule out and manage secondary causes, psychiatric comorbidities and other facial pain syndromes, particularly trigeminal neuralgia. Burden of disease and psychiatric comorbidity screening is recommended at an early stage of disease, and should be addressed in the management plan. Future research is needed to establish clear diagnostic criteria and treatment strategies based on clinical findings and individual pathophysiology.

A 55-year-old white woman was receiving rofecoxib for treatment of osteoarthritis. The patient began to have tongue numbness and hand tingling and numbness shortly after starting therapy with rofecoxib. The occurrence and resolution of her symptoms correlated with the start and end of the therapy.

Discussion

An adverse reaction with rofecoxib is a likely explanation for the patient's symptoms. Paresthesias have been reported in 0.1–1.9% of patients who took rofecoxib during premarketing studies, but no causality has been established. One case report of paresthesias occurring in a 59-year-old white man who took one 20-mg dose of piroxicam is available. Information on when the reaction occurred in relation to the dose and resolution of the reaction was not recorded in this study. Our patient's reaction is best classified as idiopathic.

Conclusions

We report the first case of a paresthesia-type reaction to rofecoxib in a patient receiving the drug in standard doses for treatment of osteoarthritis. Although the reaction is rare, clinicians should be aware of its potential.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^1166M2JK]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — clinical overview from the abstract describes that Bell's palsy is the most common acute mono-neuropathy and the most common diagnosis associated with facial nerve weakness/paralysis; it is a rapid unilateral facial nerve paresis (weakness) or paralysis (complete loss of movement) of unknown cause that leads to partial or complete inability to voluntarily move facial muscles on the affected side; although typically self-limited, it may cause significant temporary oral incompetence and inability to close the eye with potential eye injury; many available diagnostic tests are of questionable benefit, and misdiagnosis or unnecessary delay in diagnosis are concerns.

### Acoustic neuroma with orofacial paresthesia: description of an atypical presentation [^1164DxBo]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Acoustic neuroma (AN) usually manifests with asymmetric hearing loss, tinnitus, dizziness and sense of disequilibrium. About 10% of patients complain of atypical symptoms, which include facial numbness or pain and sudden onset of hearing loss. Patients with atypical symptoms also tend to have larger tumours due to the delay in investigation. We report a particularly interesting case of a patient presented to us with numbness over her right hemifacial region after a dental procedure without significant acoustic and vestibular symptoms. Physical examination and pure tone audiometry revealed no significant findings but further imaging revealed a cerebellopontine angle mass. The changing trends with easier access to further imaging indicate that the presentation of patients with AN are also changing. Atypical symptoms which are persistent should raise clinical suspicion of this pathology among clinicians.

### Advances in facial reanimation [^1141qsKZ]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Facial nerve paralysis is a debilitating clinical entity that presents as a complete or incomplete loss of facial nerve function. The etiology of facial nerve palsy and sequelae varies tremendously. The most common cause of facial paralysis is Bell's palsy, followed by malignant or benign tumors, iatrogenic insults, trauma, virus-associated paralysis, and congenital etiologies.

### Clinical reasoning: a 62-year-old woman with transient vision loss [^112hVoBu]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Transient visual loss (TVL) is a common complaint in the emergency department, with numerous possible etiologies. Prompt evaluation and management of TVL can potentially prevent progression to permanent visual loss. In this case, a 62-year-old woman presented with acute, painless, unilateral TVL. Two weeks before presentation, the patient reported bitemporal headaches and paresthesia of the distal extremities. A review of systems revealed chronic fatigue, cough, diffuse arthralgias, and decreased appetite for the previous 6 months. This case highlights the diagnostic approach to patients with TVL. Some common and rare causes associated with this clinical manifestation are briefly reviewed.

### Brain glucose metabolism in Parry-Romberg syndrome [^11639VrD]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Parry-Romberg syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by a progressive facial hemiatrophy of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, musculature, bone, and cartilage. It is often associated with neurological symptoms such as trigeminal neuropathy, paresthesia of the face, migraine, and seizures and can be paired with ocular problems and ipsilateral progressive body atrophy. Here, we present a young woman with progressive facial hemiatrophy, who was referred for FDG-PET/CT. Hypometabolism was observed in the left cingulate and postcentral gyrus, left cerebellum, and right basal ganglia. Hypometabolism may be observed before anatomical changes and therefore facilitate early diagnosis.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: current approaches and emerging interventions [^116uH2hP]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) has been described in the literature as one of the most debilitating presentations of orofacial pain. This review summarizes over 150 years of collective clinical experience in the medical and surgical treatment of TN. Fundamentally, TN remains a clinical diagnosis that must be distinguished from other types of trigeminal neuropathic pain and/or facial pain associated with other neuralgias or headache syndromes. What is increasingly clear is that there is no catch-all medical or surgical intervention that is effective for all patients with trigeminal neuralgia, likely reflective of the fact that TN is likely a heterogenous group of disorders that jointly manifests in facial pain. The first-line treatment for TN remains anticonvulsant medical therapy. Patients who fail this have a range of surgical options available to them. In general, microvascular decompression is a safe and effective procedure with immediate and durable outcomes. Patients who are unable to tolerate general anesthesia or whose medical comorbidities preclude a suboccipital craniectomy may benefit from percutaneous methodologies including glycerol or radiofrequency ablation, or both. For patients with bleeding diathesis due to blood thinning medications who are ineligible for invasive procedures, or for those who are unwilling to undergo open surgical procedures, radiosurgery may be an excellent option-provided the patient understands that maximum pain relief will take on the order of months to achieve. Finally, peripheral neurectomies continue to provide an inexpensive and resource-sparing alternative to pain relief for patients in locations with limited economic and medical resources. Ultimately, elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying trigeminal neuralgia will pave the way for novel, more effective and less invasive therapies.

### TDP43 pathology in the brain, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia of a patient with FOSMN [^112cVDGU]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Facial-onset sensory and motor neuronopathy (FOSMN) is a rare clinical syndrome characterized by asymmetric facial numbness or paresthesia, bulbar palsy, and facial weakness, which may progress to the upper limbs. The FOSMN syndrome was first described in 2006, and since then, > 40 cases have been described. Onset is typically in the fifth to seventh decade (but has been reported in patients as young as 7 years of age), and the rate of progression can vary from months to decades.

The pathogenesis of FOSMN remains controversial. Initial reports described the presence of anti-ganglioside antibodies and response to immunotherapy, whereas others have described a progressive and terminal decline, resistant to immunotherapy and suggestive of bulbar-onset amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Two of 3 postmortem studies of patients with FOSMN have revealed the presence of TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP) 43 inclusions in the brainstem nuclei and cervical motor neurons. In this article, we describe a patient with FOSMN and behavioral change in whom postmortem examination revealed frequent pathologic TDP43 inclusions in the deep cerebral nuclei, brainstem, and spinal cord and rarely in the medial temporal lobe, frontal cortex, and dorsal root ganglia (DRG).

### Facial onset sensory and motor neuronopathy (FOSMN) syndrome responding to immunotherapies [^115S8dvu]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2008). Low credibility.

We report the first non-Caucasian case of facial onset sensory and motor neuronopathy (FOSMN) syndrome partially responding to various immunotherapies. A 55-year-old man had first felt paresthesia on his right cheek at age 45. This gradually extended to the scalp. Paresthesia of bilateral fingers and dysphagia appeared 6 years later. On admission, facial sensory impairment and bulbar palsy were found. There were no sensory or motor deficits evident in any limb, except for decreased deep tendon reflex and vibratory sensation. Videofluorography (VF) revealed decreased pharyngeal clearance. The sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitudes of median and ulnar nerves were decreased. Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy and plasma exchange ameliorated his dysesthesia and dysphagia after several weeks, and resulted in improvements in VF and SNAP abnormalities. These observations suggest that FOSMN syndrome maybe, in part, immune-mediated.

### Bilateral facial paralysis: case presentation and discussion of differential diagnosis [^114D9vkf]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Bilateral facial paralysis is a rare condition and therefore represents a diagnostic challenge. We report the case of a 34-year-old healthy woman with sequential bilateral facial paralysis as a sole manifestation of sarcoidosis. She initially presented with an isolated left sided Bell's palsy without any symptoms to suggest alternative diagnoses. Within a month there was progression to peripheral facial paresis on the contra lateral side, prompting a diagnosis of Lyme disease. Her physical examination and chest x-ray did not reveal any clinical evidence of sarcoidosis. After failing to respond to an empiric trial of intravenous ceftriaxone for a presumptive diagnosis of Lyme disease, computed tomography scan of the chest was ordered which demonstrated bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. Bronchoscopic biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of sarcoidosis. The patient then made a complete recovery on steroid therapy. We discuss the differential diagnosis of facial diplegia and focus on the clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment of neurosarcoidosis.

### Real-world evaluation of botulinum toxin A in focal peripheral neuropathic pain: longitudinal outcomes [^113D5t7d]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

In early responders, the mean percentage improvement increased from 46.8% ± 3.8% at C2 to 57.6% ± 3.8%, 57.5% ± 3.8%, and 60.9% ± 4.1% at C3, C4, and C5 respectively. A clinically meaningful improvement was already present after the first injection, with the average response exceeding the 30% threshold from C2 onwards. The largest gain was observed between C2 and C3 (p = 0.006), with no statistically significant differences thereafter (Figure 4a).

In contrast, non‐early responders exhibited a different trajectory. Their mean improvement remained low at C2 (10.0% ± 4.2%) and C3 (9.8% ± 4.1%) — below the clinically relevant threshold — but increased significantly at C4 (30.7% ± 5.8%) and C5 (42.2% ± 6.6%). Statistically significant differences were observed between C3 and both C4 (p = 0.003) and C5 (p < 0.001), suggesting a delayed but clinically meaningful response initiated after the third injection (Figure 4b).

4.5 Safety/Tolerability and End‐Of‐Dose

Among the 82 patients included in the study, 62 provided evaluable data regarding treatment safety/tolerability and end‐of‐dose effect. Among them, 63.6% reported experiencing an end‐of‐dose effect, typically described as a progressive return of symptoms before the next scheduled injection. A total of 25.8% of patients reported at least one adverse event, most of which were mild and transient. The most frequently reported adverse effect was transient facial asymmetry (n = 8), followed by transient post‐injection worsening of pain (n = 4), transient paresthesias (n = 1), motor weakness (n = 1), asthenia (n = 1), and transient worsening after the first session (n = 1). One case of facial asymmetry led to treatment discontinuation. No serious adverse events were reported.

Procedural intolerance, such as discomfort or needle phobia, led to treatment discontinuation in seven patients (8.5%), representing the most frequent cause of dropout related directly to the injection procedure. Data regarding procedural intolerance after the first session (C1) were not systematically collected. Transient worsening of pain was reported by five patients (8.0%), typically within the days following injection, and resolved spontaneously without sequelae.

### Progressive bilateral facial weakness [^114Ma1n4]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Comment

In Susuki's case series, all patients reached a nadir within 4 weeks and all but one made a good recovery. Some were treated with plasma exchange or intravenous immunoglobulin, although without any firm evidence base. We treated this patient with intravenous immunoglobulin (2 g/kg) over 5 days, with regular spirometry, cardiac monitoring and deep vein thromboprophylaxis. Following a second induction course, he regained strength over a month. Two months after the onset of his illness, he is independently mobile with mild facial asymmetry.

Practice points

Guillain–Barré syndrome is a heterogeneous condition that includes rare regional variants presenting differently from typical Guillain–Barré syndrome; these risks being overlooked in the differential diagnosis.
Guillain–Barré syndrome can present in localised subtypes, the main ones being 'bifacial weakness with paraesthesias', 'pharyngeal–brachial–cervical weakness' and 'paraparetic Guillain–Barré syndrome'.
Deep tendon reflexes may be present initially in Guillain–Barré syndrome; patients with weakness of unexplained origin require repeated examination.
Guillain–Barré syndrome typically gives CSF albuminocytological dissociation and neurophysiological abnormalities but positive antiganglioside antibodies also help with diagnosis.

### A review of current perspectives on facial presentations of primary headaches [^114VNv8F]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

One hypothesis for the involvement of the non-V1 dermatome is the initiation and establishment of central sensitization, which leads to the spread of pain beyond the primary region into the lower trigeminal branches, or in some cases even outside the cranium (eg, arm). Alternatively, the neurovascular activation of the V1 branch during certain headache types may lead to coactivation of the adjacent trigeminal branches, which subsequently leads to facial pain. A third possibility is that neurovascular activation occurs in V2 and/or V3 without the involvement of V1. We aim to provide an overview of the facial presentations of primary headache disorders, including their possible pathophysiology, and how to differentiate the "facial pain presentations" of headache disorders from primary facial pain disorders.

### Management of flaccid facial paralysis of less than two years' duration [^116Aenpn]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Flaccid facial paralysis results in disfiguring facial changes. The treatment of flaccid facial paralysis is complex and treatment approaches should be determined based on duration and the causes of paralysis, status and accessibility of the affected facial nerve, medical comorbidities, and patient-specific goals. Although primary nerve repair is the preferred treatment strategy when possible, nerve substitution procedures are the mainstay of treatment for patients with flaccid facial paralysis of less than 2 years duration.

Considering permanent neuronal damage, the pooled rates were less than 0.1% for both motor and sensory damage. Metanalyses results showed a pooled 0.047% rate for permanent motor damage (Forrest plot in Figure 4, 95%CI: [0.0%; 0.1%], Z = 2.69, p = .007) and of 0.045% for permanent sensory damage (Forrest plot in Figure 5, 95%CI: [0.0%; 0.1%], Z = 2.63, p = .009). No study heterogeneity was observed for either model (I² = 0%, Q (66) = 38.8, p = 1.00 and I² = 0%, Q (66) = 28.4, p = 1.00, respectively). Permanent damage to the facial nerve for its temporal and marginal mandibular branch was described, with partial recovery on observation, while permanent sensory damage included dysesthesia with chronic pain (sensory region not specified) and paresthesia to the territory of the supraorbital/suprasupratrochlear nerve.

### Facial pain [^1158FBRs]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

There are various cranial nerve lesions that cause complex presentations of headache and facial pain, including trigeminal neuralgia, occipital neuralgia, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, and other rarer syndromes. Each present with their distinct patterns and diagnosis is reliant on a thorough history and physical examination. Diagnostic workup often involves neuroimaging modalities to rule out more common diseases. Treatment is aimed at symptomatic management, with conservative and pharmacologic therapies (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and anticonvulsants) as primary treatment. Advanced procedures and surgical intervention are typically reserved for refractory cases.

Other neuropathic symptoms

Symptoms suggestive of peripheral neuropathy such as numbness, tingling, and a pins-and-needles sensation affect 2% of COVID-19 survivors. In 1 report, a previously healthy 46-year-old man developed bilateral leg pain and hypoesthesia 53 days after COVID-19 infection. The patient experienced painful sensory symptoms followed by precipitous lower motor neuron weakness affecting all limbs, face, and respiratory muscles. However, with a single reported event, it remains unclear whether it is etiologically related to COVID-19. Neuroinflammation and demyelination induced by SARS-CoV-2 in the brain and spinal cord have similarities to those observed in multiple sclerosis and may explain some patient-reported neuropathic symptoms. Whether COVID-19 increases the risk of subsequent multiple sclerosis or other central or peripheral nervous system disorders remains to be seen.

### Corticosteroids for Bell's palsy (idiopathic facial paralysis) [^1171VQCw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Inflammation and oedema of the facial nerve are implicated in causing Bell's palsy. Corticosteroids have a potent anti-inflammatory action that should minimise nerve damage. This is an update of a review first published in 2002 and last updated in 2010.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroid therapy in people with Bell's palsy.

Search Methods

On 4 March 2016, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS. We reviewed the bibliographies of the randomised trials and contacted known experts in the field to identify additional published or unpublished trials. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials and quasi-randomised trials comparing different routes of administration and dosage schemes of corticosteroid or adrenocorticotrophic hormone therapy versus a control group receiving no therapy considered effective for this condition, unless the same therapy was given in a similar way to the experimental group.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodology. The main outcome of interest was incomplete recovery of facial motor function (i.e. residual facial weakness). Secondary outcomes were cosmetically disabling persistent sequelae, development of motor synkinesis or autonomic dysfunction (i.e. hemifacial spasm, crocodile tears) and adverse effects of corticosteroid therapy manifested during follow-up.

Main Results

We identified seven trials, with 895 evaluable participants for this review. All provided data suitable for the primary outcome meta-analysis. One of the trials was new since the last version of this Cochrane systematic review. Risk of bias in the older, smaller studies included some unclear- or high-risk assessments, whereas we deemed the larger studies at low risk of bias. Overall, 79/452 (17%) participants allocated to corticosteroids had incomplete recovery of facial motor function six months or more after randomisation; significantly fewer than the 125/447 (28%) in the control group (risk ratio (RR) 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.80, seven trials, n = 895). The number of people who need to be treated with corticosteroids to avoid one incomplete recovery was 10 (95% CI 6 to 20). The reduction in the proportion of participants with cosmetically disabling sequelae six months after randomisation was very similar in the corticosteroid and placebo groups (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.29, two trials, n = 75, low-quality evidence). However, there was a significant reduction in motor synkinesis during follow-up in participants receiving corticosteroids (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.91, three trials, n = 485, moderate-quality evidence). Three studies explicitly recorded the absence of adverse effects attributable to corticosteroids. One trial reported that three participants receiving prednisolone had temporary sleep disturbances and two trials gave a detailed account of adverse effects occurring in 93 participants, all non-serious; the combined analysis of data from these three trials found no significant difference in adverse effect rates between people receiving corticosteroids and people receiving placebo (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.51, n = 715).

Authors' Conclusions

The available moderate- to high-quality evidence from randomised controlled trials showed significant benefit from treating Bell's palsy with corticosteroids.

### Dacarbazine [^112n7gfb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Symptoms of anorexia, nausea, and vomiting are the most frequently noted of all toxic reactions. Over 90% of patients are affected with the initial few doses. The vomiting lasts 1 to 12 hours and is incompletely and unpredictably palliated with phenobarbital and/or prochlorperazine. Rarely, intractable nausea and vomiting have necessitated discontinuance of therapy with dacarbazine. Rarely, dacarbazine has caused diarrhea. Some helpful suggestions include restricting the patient's oral intake of food for 4 to 6 hours prior to treatment. The rapid toleration of these symptoms suggests that a central nervous system mechanism may be involved, and usually these symptoms subside after the first 1 or 2 days.

There are a number of minor toxicities that are infrequently noted. Patients have experienced an influenza-like syndrome of fever to 39°C, myalgias and malaise. These symptoms occur usually after large single doses, may last for several days, and they may occur with successive treatments.

Alopecia has been noted as has facial flushing and facial paresthesia. There have been few reports of significant liver or renal function test abnormalities in man. However, these abnormalities have been observed more frequently in animal studies.

Erythematous and urticarial rashes have been observed infrequently after administration of dacarbazine. Rarely, photosensitivity reactions may occur.

OVERDOSAGE

### Facial pain beyond trigeminal neuralgia [^114HHEbn]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Trigeminal neuralgia is a well-known facial pain syndrome with several treatment options. In contrast, non-neuralgiform idiopathic facial pain syndromes are relatively rare, reflected by the fact that, until 2020, no internationally accepted diagnostic classification existed. Like trigeminal neuralgia, these non-dental facial pain syndromes need to be managed by neurologists and pain specialists, but the lack of pathophysiological understanding has resulted in an underrepresented and undertreated patient group.

Recent Findings

This work provides a brief overview of the most common primary facial pain syndromes, namely, the facial attack-like facial pain, which corresponds to attack-like headache, the persistent idiopathic facial pain (formerly 'atypical facial pain'), and trigeminal neuropathy. What these disorders have in common is that they should all be treated conservatively.

Summary

On the basis of pragmatic classifications, permanent and attack-like primary facial pain can be relatively easily differentiated from one another. The introduction of the new International Classification of Orofacial Pain offers the opportunity to better coordinate and concentrate scientific efforts, so that in the future the therapy strategies that are still inadequate, can be optimized.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^11588rPP]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Table 1 definitions — key terminology for Bell's palsy is standardized as follows: Acute is defined as occurring in less than 72 hours. Bell's palsy is acute unilateral facial nerve paresis or paralysis with onset in less than 72 hours and without identifiable cause. Electromyography (EMG) testing is a needle electrode study that records spontaneous depolarizations and responses to voluntary muscle contraction. Electroneuronography (ENoG) testing is a surface electrode study to examine facial nerve integrity by recording electrical depolarization of facial muscles following electrical stimulation of the facial nerve. Facial paralysis is complete inability to move the face, whereas facial paresis is incomplete ability to move the face. Idiopathic denotes without identifiable cause.

### A new classification for facial pain [^114DJ4zT]. Neurosurgery (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

A patient-oriented classification scheme for facial pains commonly encountered in neurosurgical practice is proposed.

Concept

This classification is driven principally by the patient's history.

Rationale

The scheme incorporates descriptions for so-called "atypical" trigeminal neuralgias and facial pains but minimizes the pejorative, accepting that the physiology of neuropathic pains could reasonably encompass a variety of pain sensations, both episodic and constant. Seven diagnostic labels result: trigeminal neuralgia Types 1 and 2 refer to patients with the spontaneous onset of facial pain and either predominant episodic or constant pain, respectively. Trigeminal neuropathic pain results from unintentional injury to the trigeminal nerve from trauma or surgery, whereas trigeminal deafferentation pain results from injury to the nerve by peripheral nerve ablation, gangliolysis, or rhizotomy in an intentional attempt to treat either trigeminal neuralgia or other facial pain. Postherpetic neuralgia follows a cutaneous herpes zoster outbreak (shingles) in the trigeminal distribution, and symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia results from multiple sclerosis. The final category, atypical facial pain, is synonymous with facial pain secondary to a somatoform pain disorder. Atypical facial pain can be suspected but not diagnosed by history and can be diagnosed only with detailed and objective psychological testing.

Conclusion

This diagnostic classification would allow more rigorous and objective natural history and outcome studies of facial pain in the future.

### Comparison of stereotactic radiosurgery and rhizotomy for trigeminal neuralgia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112JSjqi]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Complications

Complication profiles of SRS and rhizotomy are important aspects of treatment planning when managing a patient with TN. Common complications of SRS when treating TN include facial sensory disturbances, with 30 ;35% of patients experiencing hypoesthesia or numbness, though severe "bothersome" numbness occurs in approximately 10% of cases. Dysesthesia is rare, and anesthesia dolorosa, a debilitating pain in a numb area, is exceedingly uncommon. Radiation-specific risks, such as brainstem edema or necrosis, are rare but more likely with repeat procedures due to cumulative radiation exposure. Notably, SRS avoids procedural risks like infection or CSF leak. Similarly, in the case of rhizotomy, moderate-to-severe hypesthesia is the most common complication, occurring in 61% of patients. Dysesthesia occurs in 10 ;20%, and anesthesia dolorosa is observed in 0.6 ;2.4%. Additionally, rare but serious risks such as carotid-cavernous fistula or meningitis may arise from needle misplacement or dural penetration.

In terms of comparison, overall facial numbness rates were lower in SRS compared to rhizotomy. Similarly, while the overall complication rate was not significantly different, the MS subgroup exhibited a significantly lower overall complication rate with SRS. These findings are supported by Lee et al. who found that rhizotomy resulted in more paresthesia compared to SRS in MS-TN. Holland et al. reported comparable initial rates of facial numbness between SRS and rhizotomy for MS-TN, but Lee et al. suggested that rhizotomy led to higher rates of sensory changes following the final treatment, possibly due to repeated procedures. Our meta-analysis provides a comparative overview across various percutaneous rhizotomy methods, but it focuses on overall rates and facial numbness specifically, which may not fully capture differences in the type or severity of complications between SRS and rhizotomy. Moreover, some discrepancies were observed in our analysis regarding facial numbness, which may be due to different thresholds and small sample sizes.

Premise Facial pain refers to a heterogeneous group of clinically and etiologically different conditions with the common clinical feature of pain in the facial area. Among these conditions, trigeminal neuralgia (TN), persistent idiopathic facial pain, temporomandibular joint pain, and trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TAC) are the most well described conditions. Conclusion TN has been known for centuries, and is recognised by its characteristic and almost pathognomonic clinical features. The other facial pain conditions are less well defined, and over the years there has been confusion about their classification.

### Trigeminal neuralgia [^111rm8nZ]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2024). High credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a facial pain disorder characterized by intense and paroxysmal pain that profoundly affects quality of life and presents complex challenges in diagnosis and treatment. TN can be categorized as classical, secondary and idiopathic. Epidemiological studies show variable incidence rates and an increased prevalence in women and in the elderly, with familial cases suggesting genetic factors. The pathophysiology of TN is multifactorial and involves genetic predisposition, anatomical changes, and neurophysiological factors, leading to hyperexcitable neuronal states, central sensitization and widespread neural plasticity changes. Neurovascular compression of the trigeminal root, which undergoes major morphological changes, and focal demyelination of primary trigeminal afferents are key aetiological factors in TN. Structural and functional brain imaging studies in patients with TN demonstrated abnormalities in brain regions responsible for pain modulation and emotional processing of pain. Treatment of TN involves a multifaceted approach that considers patient-specific factors, including the type of TN, with initial pharmacotherapy followed by surgical options if necessary. First-line pharmacological treatments include carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine. Surgical interventions, including microvascular decompression and percutaneous neuroablative procedures, can be considered at an early stage if pharmacotherapy is not sufficient for pain control or has intolerable adverse effects or contraindications.

Trigeminal nerve preservation

At DOS, 12.5% reported some degree of ipsilateral facial paresthesia. Of those with at least 1 year of toxicity-specific follow-up without initial paresthesia, there was a 92.7% (76/82) rate of trigeminal nerve preservation. Of those starting with some form of paresthesia (n = 7), the median time to recovery was 18 months. The median time to development of any reported paresthesia was 7 months. Actuarial median time to facial paresthesia was not reached (Fig 4 B). There were no significant predictors of paresthesia on UVA of 2-dimensional tumor dimensions, maximum CN V dose, or peripheral tumor dose. There was a trend for increased hazard ratio for maximum tumor dose at 1.22 (95% confidence interval, 0.95–1.56), with a mean max tumor dose at 25.5 versus 24.7 Gy (P = 0.075). There was a significantly lower selectivity index in those who never developed paresthesia at 0.62 versus 0.70 (P = 0.049). There was no significant difference in other tumor characteristics or dosimetric parameters (including peripheral tumor dose or CN V maximum/peripheral doses).

### Trigeminal neuralgia: new classification and diagnostic grading for practice and research [^112fJZyp]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is an exemplary condition of neuropathic facial pain. However, formally classifying TN as neuropathic pain based on the grading system of the International Association for the Study of Pain is complicated by the requirement of objective signs confirming an underlying lesion or disease of the somatosensory system. The latest version of the International Classification of Headache Disorders created similar difficulties by abandoning the term symptomatic TN for manifestations caused by major neurologic disease, such as tumors or multiple sclerosis. These diagnostic challenges hinder the triage of TN patients for therapy and clinical trials, and hamper the design of treatment guidelines. In response to these shortcomings, we have developed a classification of TN that aligns with the nosology of other neurologic disorders and neuropathic pain. We propose 3 diagnostic categories. Classical TN requires demonstration of morphologic changes in the trigeminal nerve root from vascular compression. Secondary TN is due to an identifiable underlying neurologic disease. TN of unknown etiology is labeled idiopathic. Diagnostic certainty is graded possible when pain paroxysms occur in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve branches. Triggered paroxysms permit the designation of clinically established TN and probable neuropathic pain. Imaging and neurophysiologic tests that establish the etiology of classical or secondary TN determine definite neuropathic pain.

### A Guillain-Barrésyndrome variant with prominent facial diplegia [^11761aab]. Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

To determine the clinical features of a Guillain-Barré syndrome variant with prominent facial diplegia, we retrospectively reviewed approximately 8,600 cases referred to our neuroimmunological laboratory for serological tests during the past seven years. Patients' histories, neurological signs, and laboratory and electrophysiological data were clarified based on their clinical records. Sera obtained during the acute phase were tested for prior infectious serology and anti-ganglioside antibodies. In 22 patients, clinical signs such as acute progressive bifacial weakness, paresthesias in the distal dominant limbs, and hypo- or areflexia, were compatible with a Guillain-Barré syndrome variant, facial diplegia and paresthesias. Other cranial nerve involvements, limb weakness, and ataxia were absent or minimal. Clinical courses were monophasic, the nadir being reached within four weeks. Eighteen patients (86%) had had infectious symptoms within the four weeks preceding the onset of neurological illness. In the infection serology tests, anti-cytomegalovirus IgM antibodies were the most frequent (35%). All the patients had cerebrospinal fluid albuminocytologic dissociation. In nerve conduction studies, 14 (64%) showed demyelination in their limbs. Anti-GM2 IgM antibodies were detected in four patients who had anti-cytomegalovirus IgM antibodies. Patients with conditions similar to facial diplegia and paresthesias, but lacking either distal paresthesias or hyporeflexia, were regarded as having marginal facial diplegia and paresthesias, because they also frequently had features of Guillain-Barré syndrome, such as an antecedent infection or cerebrospinal fluid albuminocytologic dissociation. Our findings are further evidence of a facial variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome and provide important information essential for its diagnosis.

### Surgical interventions for the early management of Bell's palsy [^1167Myd5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Bell's palsy is an acute unilateral facial paralysis of unknown aetiology and should only be used as a diagnosis in the absence of any other pathology. As the proposed pathophysiology is swelling and entrapment of the nerve, some surgeons suggest surgical decompression of the nerve as a possible management option; this is ideally performed as soon as possible after onset. This is an update of a review first published in 2011, and last updated in 2013. This update includes evidence from one newly identified study.

Objectives

To assess the effects of surgery in the early management of Bell's palsy.

Search Methods

On 20 March 2020, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP. We handsearched selected conference abstracts for the original version of the review.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs involving any surgical intervention for Bell's palsy. Trials compared surgical interventions to no treatment, later treatment (beyond three months), sham treatment, other surgical treatments or medical treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcome was complete recovery of facial palsy at 12 months. Secondary outcomes were complete recovery at three and six months, synkinesis and contracture at 12 months, psychosocial outcomes at 12 months, and side effects and complications of treatment.

Main Results

Two trials with 65 participants met the inclusion criteria; one was newly identified at this update. The first study randomised 25 participants into surgical or non-surgical (no treatment) groups using statistical charts. One participant declined surgery, leaving 24 evaluable participants. The second study quasi-randomised 53 participants; however, only 41 were evaluable as 12 declined the intervention they were allocated. These 41 participants were then divided into early surgery, late surgery or non-surgical (no treatment) groups using alternation. There was no mention on how alternation was decided. Neither study mentioned if there was any attempt to conceal allocation. Neither participants nor outcome assessors were blinded to the interventions in either study. There were no losses to follow-up in the first study. The second study lost three participants to follow-up, and 17 did not contribute to the assessment of secondary outcomes. Both studies were at high risk of bias. Surgeons in both studies used a retro-auricular/transmastoid approach to decompress the facial nerve. For the outcome recovery of facial palsy at 12 months, the evidence was uncertain. The first study reported no differences between the surgical and no treatment groups. The second study fully reported numerical data, but included no statistical comparisons between groups for complete recovery. There was no evidence of a difference for the early surgery versus no treatment comparison (risk ratio (RR) 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 11.11; P = 0.84; 33 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and for the early surgery versus late surgery comparison (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.03 to 6.60; P = 0.58; 26 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We considered the effects of surgery on facial nerve function at 12 months very uncertain (2 RCTs, 65 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Furthermore, the second study reported adverse effects with a statistically significant decrease in lacrimal control in the surgical group within two to three months of denervation. Four participants in the second study had 35 dB to 50 dB of sensorineural hearing loss at 4000 Hz, and three had tinnitus. Because of the small numbers and trial design we also considered the adverse effects evidence very uncertain (2 RCTs, 65 participants; very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There is very low-certainty evidence from RCTs or quasi-RCTs on surgery for the early management of Bell's palsy, and this is insufficient to decide whether surgical intervention is beneficial or harmful. Further research into the role of surgical intervention is unlikely to be performed because spontaneous or medically supported recovery occurs in most cases.

### Prilocaine hcl and epinephrine (citanest forte DENTAL) [^11666u3o]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Swelling and persistent paresthesia of the lips and oral tissues may occur. Persistent paresthesia lasting weeks to months, and in rare instances paresthesia lasting greater than one year have been reported.

Adverse experiences following the administration of prilocaine are similar in nature to those observed with other amide local anesthetic agents. These adverse experiences are, in general, dose-related and may result from high plasma levels caused by excessive dosage, rapid absorption or unintentional intravascular injection, or may result from a hypersensitivity, idiosyncrasy or diminished tolerance on the part of the patient. Serious adverse experiences are generally systemic in nature. The following types are those most commonly reported:

Central Nervous System

CNS manifestations are excitatory and/or depressant and may be characterized by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting, sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory depression, and arrest. The excitatory manifestations may be very brief or may not occur at all, in which case the first manifestation of toxicity may be drowsiness merging into unconsciousness and respiratory arrest.

Drowsiness following the administration of prilocaine is usually an early sign of a high blood level of the drug and may occur as a consequence of rapid absorption.

Cardiovascular System

Cardiovascular manifestations are usually depressant and are characterized by bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse, which may lead to cardiac arrest.

Signs and symptoms of depressed cardiovascular function may commonly result from a vasovagal reaction, particularly if the patient is in an upright position. Less commonly, they may result from a direct effect of the drug. Failure to recognize the premonitory signs such as sweating, a feeling of faintness, and changes in pulse or sensorium may result in progressive cerebral hypoxia and seizure or serious cardiovascular catastrophe. Management consists of placing the patient in the recumbent position and ventilation with oxygen. Supportive treatment of circulatory depression may require the administration of intravenous fluids, and, when appropriate, a vasopressor (e.g., ephedrine) as directed by the clinical situation.

Allergic

Allergic reactions are characterized by cutaneous lesions, urticaria, edema or anaphylactoid reactions. Allergic reactions as a result of sensitivity to prilocaine are extremely rare and, if they occur, should be managed by conventional means. The detection of sensitivity by skin testing is of doubtful value.

### A 42-year-old man with facial nerve weakness and multiple recurrent pleomorphic adenoma [^113zqcGs]. Otology & Neurotology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe a case and discuss the differential diagnosis of facial nerve paresis presenting years after resection of multiple recurrent parotid pleomorphic adenoma.

Patients

Case report of a patient on immunosuppressive therapy with facial nerve weakness 3 years after last resection for multiple recurrent pleomorphic adenoma.

Interventions

Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging followed by surgical exploration, resection, and reconstruction.

Main Outcome Measures

Histopathologic diagnosis and treatment outcome.

Results

Final diagnosis of recurrent pleomorphic adenoma causing compression of the facial nerve at the stylomastoid foramen.

Conclusion

Facial nerve weakness caused by a benign salivary gland tumor is rare. Although alternate diagnoses must be considered, recurrent pleomorphic adenoma alone may impair facial function by impinging on the nerve in the stylomastoid foramen.

### Facelift surgery and nerve injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115N4ftV]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Postoperative Neurologic Side Effects

All included studies described postoperative neurological damage, allowing their classification as motor or sensory deficits, as well as permanent or transient side effects. Twenty-five (37.3%) publications reported no neurological side effects due to surgical procedures, transient or permanent, while only seven studies reported permanent neural damage, with a rate ranging from 0.1 to 2%.

Table 2 resumes the results of the pooled rates for motor and sensory nerve damage after the operation, with the inclusion of all 67 studies. The estimated pooled motor nerve damage was 0.66% (Forrest plot in Figure 2, 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: [0.5%; 0.9%], Z = 6.07, p < .001), with significantly high heterogeneity between studies (I² = 59.1%, Q (66) = 161, p < .001). Motor nerve damage was mostly transient and affected different branches of the facial nerve, namely temporal, zygomatic, marginal mandibular, and buccal branches. Some publications reported only facial nerve damage, without specifying the affected branch.

For overall sensory damage, the estimated pooled rate was 0.39% (Forrest plot in Figure 3, 95%CI: [0.2%; 0.6%], Z = 4.16, p < .001), also with a significantly high heterogeneity between studies (I 2 = 74.1%, Q (66) = 255, p < .001). Postoperative sensitive changes included preauricular, retroauricular, earlobe, inferior eye lid, and midface paresthesia, upper lip, and forehead and scalp dysesthesia.

### Accidental hydroxychloroquine overdose resulting in neurotoxic vestibulopathy [^117QTVwr]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine is an oral antimalarial medication commonly used off-label for a variety of rheumatological conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome and dermatomyositis. We present a case of a 64-year-old woman who presented with acute onset headache, bilateral tinnitus, and left-sided facial numbness and tingling in the setting of accidentally overdosing on hydroxychloroquine. By the next morning, the patient began to experience worsening in the tingling sensation and it eventually spread to her left arm, thigh and distal extremities. The patient also complained of new onset blurring of her peripheral vision and feeling 'off balance'. Despite a complete neurological and ophthalmological work-up with unremarkable imaging and blood work, the patient has had no improvement in her tinnitus, left-sided paresthesias, visual disturbance or ataxia. This is a unique case of hydroxychloroquine overdose resulting in permanent neurotoxic vestibulopathy.

### Nervous system Lyme disease [^111B3PrK]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Lyme disease affects the nervous system in about 10% to 15% of infected individuals, most commonly causing lymphocytic meningitis. Cranial neuropathies, particularly facial nerve palsy, also occur frequently. Figuring prominently in the European literature, but less emphasized in the United States, is painful radiculitis, radicular pain involving a limb or trunk dermatome. Treatment of neuroborreliosis is usually straightforward; oral antibiotics may suffice in many patients. In severe cases, 2 to 4 weeks of parenteral therapy is necessary. All available evidence indicates that treatment of more than 4 weeks' duration carries substantial risk but minimal if any additional benefit.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: rapid evidence review [^116msAo9]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a chronic neuropathic pain condition that causes sudden, brief episodes of electric shock-like, lancinating pain in one or more trigeminal nerve distributions. Facial spasms may occur during intense flare-ups. Trigger zones are small areas where minimal stimulation may precipitate a painful flare-up. Painful episodes of TN are often precipitated by seemingly benign stimuli, such as talking, chewing, light touch, or even a breeze across a trigger zone. Nerve root contact, compression, and subsequent demyelination are implicated as the central underlying pathophysiology. The average age of onset is 50 to 60 years, and incidence increases with age. Diagnosis is based on International Headache Society clinical criteria distinguishing classic, secondary, and idiopathic TN. Classic TN is caused by direct neurovascular compromise due to anatomic compression. Secondary TN is caused by another condition such as multiple sclerosis or a tumor. Idiopathic TN has no identifiable etiology. Examination findings typically are normal between painful episodes. Brain magnetic resonance imaging with and without contrast media is recommended for all patients with suspected TN to rule out key differential diagnoses, such as a tumor, and to determine surgical candidacy. The International Headache Society guidelines encourage tailored treatment based on TN type and etiology. Carbamazepine is the initial drug of choice, and 75% of patients with TN achieve initial symptom control with pharmacotherapy. Refractory TN or intolerable adverse drug effects should prompt a trial of adjunctive drugs and referral for surgical evaluation. Microvascular decompression is more effective in improving or alleviating symptoms of TN than other surgical options.

During the post approval use of Azelastine HCl Nasal Spray, the following adverse reactions have been identified. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions reported include: anaphylaxis, application site irritation, atrial fibrillation, chest pain, confusion, dyspnea, facial edema, involuntary muscle contractions, nasal sores, palpitations, paresthesia, parosmia, pruritus, rash, disturbance or loss of sense of smell and/or taste, tolerance, urinary retention, vision abnormal and xerophthalmia.

### Antiplexin D1 antibodies relate to small fiber neuropathy and induce neuropathic pain in animals [^1169svC8]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Small fiber neuropathy (SFN) involving unmyelinated C-fibers and thinly myelinated Aδ-fibers presents neuropathic pain (NeP)/allodynia, paresthesia, and loss of pinprick and thermal sensation, together with a variety of autonomic symptoms. Although SFN is associated with many pathologic conditions, no identifiable cause can be found in approximately half of patients with SFN, and these cases are termed idiopathic SFN (iSFN). Recently, autoantibodies against fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) and trisulfated heparin disaccharide (TS-HDS) were reported in a fraction of patients with iSFN. However, the causative roles of these autoantibodies remain uncertain because reproducibility in animal experiments has not been demonstrated.

We reported antiplexin D1 antibody (plexin D1-immunoglobulin G [IgG]) in a fraction of patients with NeP with underlying neuroinflammatory diseases. Plexin D1-IgG specifically binds to unmyelinated small pain-conducing neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG), where the blood–nerve barrier is absent and autoantibodies have free access. Plexin D1-IgG was also detected in patients with idiopathic painful trigeminal neuropathy presenting facial pain and bound to trigeminal ganglion neurons. These observations prompted us to assess the prevalence of plexin D1-IgG in patients with SFN and to evaluate the pain-provoking effects of intrathecally-injected plexin D1-IgG in mice.

### Recognising facial onset sensory motor neuronopathy syndrome: insight from six new cases [^114CDuAH]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Facial onset sensory and motor neuronopathy (FOSMN) was first described in 2006 as an apparently sporadic neurodegenerative disease. Thirty cases have been reported to date. We summarise six new cases, highlighting the key clinical aspects of FOSMN and how to differentiate it from motor neurone disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Typically, patients present with slowly evolving numbness of the face followed by bulbar and proximal (neck and arm) weakness. However, one of our patients presented with a motor syndrome and his abnormal blink reflex studies provided a useful diagnostic clue. This extends the spectrum of the syndrome and emphasises that FOSMN should be considered in the differential diagnosis of motor neurone disease. We discuss the pathophysiology, diagnosis, prognosis and management considerations of FOSMN.

### Peripheral nervous system adverse events associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors [^112AiQwF]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Three patients developed cranial neuropathies: two presented with unilateral peripheral facial palsy, in one case associated with bilateral vestibulocochlear neuropathy, in the other with burning mouth syndrome; one patient developed bilateral vestibulocochlear neuropathy.

Three patients developed small-fiber neuropathy (SFN). Patients presented with subacute onset of painful paresthesia, anhidrosis, and reduced pain and heat sensation. Two patients were previously treated with potentially neurotoxic platinum-derived chemotherapy prior to ICI. Nevertheless, symptoms developed a long period after the completion of chemotherapy (eight months in one patient and two years in the other), thus making an etiological relationship unlikely. Electrodiagnostic studies showed absence of the skin sympathetic response and normal nerve conductions. Skin biopsy was not performed.

One patient developed right brachial plexopathy, manifesting with acute onset painless weakness of the right arm. Electrodiagnostic studies were consistent with a right brachial pan-plexopathy. CSF analysis revealed pleocytosis (white blood cells: 16/mm³) and increased protein levels (159 mg/dL).

Four (36%) patients developed a concurrent non-neurologic ir-AE (dermatitis, n = 2; thyroiditis, n = 1; enterocolitis, n = 1).

Overall, patients with ir-neuropathies had a median mRS score of 3 at disease peak (range 2–4).

In nine patients (82%), ICI treatment was discontinued after n-irAEs presentation. Among them, seven were treated with oral prednisone (0.5–1 mg/kg/die), and one was subsequently escalated to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg, 0.4 g/kg/day for five days, followed by a monthly maintenance infusion). Two patients, both with SFN, did not receive immunosuppressive therapy, as symptoms improved after ICI withdrawal and symptomatic treatment.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: current approaches and emerging interventions [^114pvhZm]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Complications of radiosurgery for TN include facial hypesthesia, dysesthesia, keratitis/corneal damage due to loss of sensation, and dry eye. The median rates of hypesthesia are 19% for GK, 29% for LINAC, and 19% for CK. The onset of these complications may range from 1 to 94 months.

Although determining the best timing of radiosurgery after pain onset still requires further study, recent work has shown that undergoing GK earlier in the course of TN pain onset may lead to improved clinical outcomes and may reduce treatment with medication.

### Clinical guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of botulism, 2021 [^114PMvJF]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for botulism, more specifically with respect to differential diagnosis, CDC 2021 guidelines recommend to suspect botulism in patients with suspected myasthenia gravis or Guillain-Barré syndrome and in patients with unexplained symmetric cranial nerve palsies, with or without paresis of other muscles.

### Diagnostic role of magnetic resonance imaging in assessing orofacial pain and paresthesia [^114cNCy2]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of CT and MRI in evaluating orofacial pain and paresthesia. A total of 96 patients with orofacial pain and/or paresthesia were included in this study. The patients who underwent CT and/or MRI examinations were assessed, and the efficacy of CT and/or MRI examinations in detecting the causative disease of the orofacial pain and paresthesia was evaluated. Seventy (72.9%) of 96 patients underwent CT and/or MRI examinations. Whereas CT examinations detected 2 diseases (4.5%) in 44 tests, 13 diseases (37.1%) were detected in 35 MRI examinations. Seven (53.8%) of 13 diseases, which were detected by MRI, were found in elderly patients. A high percentage of patients, who claimed orofacial pain and paresthesia, have other diseases in their brain, especially in elderly patients, and MRI is more useful than CT for evaluating these patients.

### A study of the clinical characteristics of benign trigeminal sensory neuropathy [^112pCcyx]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics of a series of patients presenting with benign trigeminal sensory neuropathy.

Patients and Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical and pathologic characteristics of 23 patients presenting with facial numbness of unknown etiology.

Results

Patients presented with diverse medical histories but could be grouped into those with a connective tissue disorder, neurologic disease, psychologic problems, or a medical history of unknown significance. The age of the patient, the severity and distribution of the trigeminal neuropathy, and symptoms other than neuropathy closely reflected the patient's medical history. The majority of patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging, but the results did not facilitate the diagnosis of the condition or reflect the extent and severity of the symptoms. In 60% of patients, the symptoms remained unchanged during the course of the study and outcome was not influenced by medical treatment.

Conclusions

The diagnosis and management of benign trigeminal sensory neuropathy remain a significant clinical challenge.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

There have been spontaneous reports of death, sometimes associated with dysphagia, pneumonia, and/or other significant debility or anaphylaxis, after treatment with botulinum toxin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.7)].

There have also been reports of adverse events involving the cardiovascular system, including arrhythmia and myocardial infarction, some with fatal outcomes. Some of these patients had risk factors including cardiovascular disease.

New onset or recurrent seizures have also been reported, typically in patients who are predisposed to experiencing these events.
