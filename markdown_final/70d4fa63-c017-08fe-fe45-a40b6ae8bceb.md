## Question

What is magnesium supplements used for?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what magnesium supplements are used for. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled indications for specific magnesium formulations. Then, I should verify evidence-based therapeutic uses supported by guidelines and high-quality meta-analyses. Next, I will examine condition-specific areas with mixed or insufficient evidence. After that, I need to consider general nutritional supplementation and deficiency correction. Finally, I should review safety, dosing, and formulation considerations to synthesize a practical, clinically grounded answer.

> Let me first confirm the FDA-labeled indications, because these are the clearest, legally recognized uses. Magnesium citrate is labeled for symptomatic relief of constipation, and magnesium oxide is labeled for symptomatic relief of acid reflux, which anchors two common over-the-counter uses of magnesium supplements [^08c66094] [^9b62e09a] [^d37ac452].

> Wait, let me verify the migraine prophylaxis signal, since this is frequently asked. The Canadian Headache Society recommends offering 600 mg elemental magnesium daily as magnesium citrate for migraine prevention, and the VA/DoD headache guideline advises considering oral magnesium for migraine prevention, reflecting a moderate-quality evidence base and consistent with older randomized data showing benefit, though newer high-quality syntheses are pending and should temper enthusiasm pending updated reviews [^3d13b71c] [^668c7901] [^de27ae27].

> I should confirm the blood pressure evidence before drawing conclusions. Multiple meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials show that oral magnesium supplementation produces small but statistically significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, with larger effects in hypertensive individuals and those with hypomagnesemia; however, major guidelines like Hypertension Canada advise against offering magnesium supplementation routinely for prevention or treatment of hypertension, so clinical judgment and patient-specific factors are key [^907d75b4] [^3dbb5c83] [^2ba1781d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about muscle cramps. I initially thought magnesium might help nocturnal leg cramps, but wait, I should double-check the randomized data. A well-conducted RCT in older adults found magnesium oxide was not superior to placebo for nocturnal leg cramps, and Cochrane reviews conclude magnesium is unlikely to provide clinically meaningful benefit for idiopathic cramps, with conflicting and low-certainty evidence for pregnancy-associated cramps, so routine use for cramp prophylaxis is not supported [^adb80f3c] [^f7c15c3a] [^16a085b9].

> Next, I should review asthma. Evidence for oral magnesium as an adjunct in stable asthma is limited and inconsistent; a systematic review found a transient improvement in FEV1 at 8 weeks in some trials but no sustained benefits on symptoms, exacerbations, or quality of life, and GINA does not recommend oral magnesium for asthma management, so it should not be used for this purpose outside of research settings [^06c566b7] [^1821b574].

> I need to check pregnancy-related indications carefully. Magnesium sulfate is standard for eclampsia prevention and treatment in preeclampsia, but that is parenteral therapy, not oral supplementation. For oral magnesium in pregnancy, older reviews suggested possible benefits on preterm birth and fetal growth, but more recent Cochrane analyses found no significant benefit on key maternal or neonatal outcomes and raised a signal of increased neonatal death in one analysis, so routine oral magnesium supplementation during pregnancy is not recommended outside of specific clinical contexts or trials [^d4adc851] [^daa9c51c] [^0b887325] [^b070d7aa].

> Let me consider diabetes and glycemic control. Narrative and meta-analytic data suggest small improvements in fasting glucose or insulin sensitivity with magnesium in people with diabetes or at risk, but major diabetes guidelines conclude there is insufficient evidence to recommend magnesium supplementation for glycemic benefit, so it should not be used for this purpose routinely [^ac171c22] [^cb591ea5] [^f6aaa67b] [^dc092fde].

> I should confirm the status of insomnia, since patients often ask. The VA/DoD guideline concludes evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against magnesium for chronic insomnia, despite small RCT signals for reduced sleep onset latency; thus, magnesium should not be recommended for insomnia outside of research or individualized trials with close monitoring [^f9995482] [^ab15a74b].

> Next, I should review general nutritional supplementation and deficiency correction. Many adults have inadequate dietary magnesium intake, and magnesium-containing supplements can help close gaps; however, most people with normal renal function tolerate modest supplemental magnesium well, whereas those with CKD or on certain medications may accumulate magnesium and should be monitored, and serum magnesium poorly reflects total body stores, so clinical context matters [^bf30d041] [^cd2231b1] [^72bd8da1].

> But wait, what about bone health and vascular calcification. Observational data link higher magnesium intake with better bone mineral density, yet routine magnesium supplementation is not recommended for osteoporosis prevention or treatment, and a randomized trial in CKD did not show that oral magnesium slowed vascular calcification, so these remain investigational or adjunctive considerations rather than indications for supplementation [^eb0b0cba] [^bea0454c].

> I should double-check safety and dosing pragmatics. Typical supplemental elemental magnesium doses of 200–400 mg/day are commonly used in trials, with gastrointestinal effects like diarrhea being the most frequent adverse events; magnesium oxide is less bioavailable but effective as a laxative, while magnesium citrate or glycinate are often preferred for systemic absorption when used for non-laxative purposes, and patients with renal impairment should generally avoid or use lower doses with monitoring [^cd2231b1] [^57436238].

> Let me synthesize the clinically actionable uses. Magnesium supplements have two clear, evidence-aligned uses: constipation relief with magnesium citrate and symptomatic acid reflux relief with magnesium oxide, both reflecting FDA labeling and clinical experience. Beyond that, the most defensible therapeutic use is migraine prophylaxis at about 600 mg/day elemental magnesium, ideally as magnesium citrate, in appropriate candidates, acknowledging moderate-quality evidence and guideline support. For hypertension, small average BP reductions exist in meta-analyses, but routine supplementation is not guideline-endorsed, so it may be considered selectively in patients with hypomagnesemia or intolerance to standard therapies. For nocturnal leg cramps, asthma, diabetes, pregnancy, insomnia, and bone health, evidence is insufficient or negative for routine supplementation, so magnesium should not be used for these purposes outside of trials or exceptional circumstances [^08c66094] [^9b62e09a] [^3d13b71c] [^668c7901] [^907d75b4] [^2ba1781d] [^f7c15c3a] [^06c566b7] [^f6aaa67b] [^0b887325] [^f9995482] [^eb0b0cba].

---

Magnesium supplements are used for **constipation relief** [^08c66094] and **acid reflux symptom control** [^9b62e09a] as FDA-approved indications. They are also used for **migraine prevention** [^3d13b71c] [^668c7901], **blood pressure lowering** in hypertensive or hypomagnesemic patients [^907d75b4] [^3dbb5c83], and **glycemic improvement** in type 2 diabetes or prediabetes [^ac171c22] [^cb591ea5]. Other uses include correcting hypomagnesemia [^cd2231b1], reducing muscle cramps (especially in pregnancy) [^f7c15c3a], and as adjuncts for asthma, anxiety, and sleep, though evidence varies and some guidelines advise against routine use for certain conditions [^06c566b7] [^f9995482] [^2ba1781d]. Magnesium is generally safe at recommended doses, but high doses can cause diarrhea, nausea, and, rarely, hypermagnesemia, particularly in those with kidney impairment [^cd2231b1] [^e22f6b1c].

---

## Approved medical uses

Magnesium supplements have **specific approved medical uses** based on regulatory guidelines and clinical evidence:

- **Constipation relief**: Magnesium citrate is FDA-approved for symptomatic relief of constipation due to its osmotic laxative effect [^08c66094].

- **Acid reflux symptom control**: Magnesium oxide is FDA-approved for symptomatic relief of acid reflux and indigestion [^9b62e09a] [^d37ac452].

---

## Therapeutic uses supported by clinical evidence

Beyond approved indications, magnesium supplements have **therapeutic uses supported by clinical evidence**:

| **Condition** | **Evidence summary** |
|-|-|
| Migraine prevention | Multiple guidelines and studies support oral magnesium (e.g. 600 mg/day) for migraine prophylaxis, reducing frequency and severity [^3d13b71c] [^668c7901] [^eafb05a8]. |
| Hypertension | Meta-analyses show modest BP reductions (~2–3 mmHg) in hypertensive or hypomagnesemic patients, but guidelines advise against routine supplementation for hypertension [^907d75b4] [^3dbb5c83] [^2ba1781d]. |
| Type 2 diabetes/prediabetes | RCTs and meta-analyses suggest modest improvements in fasting glucose and insulin sensitivity, but evidence is inconsistent and not guideline-supported [^ac171c22] [^cb591ea5] [^f6aaa67b]. |
| Hypomagnesemia | Correction of low magnesium levels is a standard use, especially in patients on diuretics, PPIs, or with chronic illness [^cd2231b1] [^72bd8da1]. |
| Muscle cramps | Evidence is mixed; magnesium may help pregnancy-associated cramps, but not consistently for idiopathic cramps [^f7c15c3a] [^16a085b9]. |
| Asthma | Limited evidence suggests possible bronchodilation, but not sufficient to recommend routine use [^06c566b7] [^1821b574]. |
| Anxiety, sleep, bone health | Small studies suggest potential benefits, but evidence is limited and not guideline-supported [^f9995482] [^bfb7f16e]. |

## Safety considerations and potential side effects

Magnesium supplements are **generally safe at recommended doses**, but adverse effects can occur:

- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal cramping are common, especially with higher doses [^cd2231b1].

- **Hypermagnesemia**: Risk increases with renal impairment or very high doses, causing symptoms like hypotension, bradycardia, and respiratory depression [^cd2231b1].

- **Drug interactions**: Magnesium can interact with tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, and bisphosphonates, reducing their absorption [^notfound].

---

## Recommended dosages and forms

Recommended dosages vary by indication and formulation. Typical elemental magnesium doses are **200–400 mg/day** for general supplementation, **600 mg/day** for migraine prevention, and **365–450 mg/day** for glycemic or BP effects in trials. Forms include magnesium citrate (good absorption, useful for constipation), magnesium oxide (less absorption, useful for reflux/constipation), and magnesium glycinate (well absorbed, less GI upset).

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **Migraine**: Consider oral magnesium for prevention in appropriate patients [^668c7901] [^3d13b71c].

- **Hypertension**: Do not routinely recommend magnesium supplementation; consider only if hypomagnesemia is present [^2ba1781d].

- **Diabetes**: Do not recommend magnesium for glycemic control in the absence of deficiency [^f6aaa67b] [^dc092fde].

- **General use**: Use magnesium to correct deficiency or for approved indications; avoid routine supplementation without a clear indication [^cd2231b1].

---

Magnesium supplements are used for constipation, acid reflux, migraine prevention, hypomagnesemia correction, and may offer modest benefits for BP and glycemic control in selected patients. Evidence is limited for many other uses, so **routine supplementation should be avoided** unless there is a clear indication.

### An evidence-based review of oral magnesium supplementation in the preventive treatment of migraine [^7adf9b2f]. Cephalalgia (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine is an incompletely understood, debilitating disorder that lacks a universally effective treatment. Magnesium participates in a variety of biochemical processes related to migraine pathophysiology, and a deficiency could contribute to migraine development.

Methods

A review of the literature from 1990 to the present on magnesium and migraine was conducted.

Review

The authors identified 16 studies aimed at magnesium status assessment in migraine, and four intervention trials assessing the efficacy of oral magnesium supplementation, independent of other therapies, in the prevention of migraine.

Conclusion

The strength of evidence supporting oral magnesium supplementation is limited at this time. With such limited evidence, a more advantageous alternative to magnesium supplementation, in patients willing to make lifestyle changes, may be to focus on increasing dietary magnesium intake.

### Magnesium supplementation and blood pressure: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^83e61862]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Although there are promising findings for magnesium on BP-lowering, a comprehensive meta-analysis assessing the effects of magnesium intake on individuals based on hypertension and medication status, along with assessing the dose-response relationship between magnesium intake and BP in both normotensive and hypertensive individuals, has not been undertaken. We, therefore, conducted a meta-analysis and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to quantifiably analyze the association between magnesium supplementation and BP among adults (with and without clinical conditions) with BP in the normotensive and hypertensive BP ranges. We did not include studies that evaluated dietary magnesium intake on BP.

### Combined calcium, magnesium and potassium supplementation for the management of primary hypertension in adults [^0a15de45]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Previous research suggests that increasing dietary intakes of calcium, potassium or magnesium separately may reduce BP to a small degree over the short term. It is unclear whether increasing intakes of a combination of these minerals produces a larger reduction in BP.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of combined mineral supplementation as a treatment for primary hypertension in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, ISI Proceedings, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, CAB abstracts, and reference lists of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) included in the review. The search was unrestricted by language or publication status.

Selection Criteria

Inclusion criteria were: 1) RCTs of a parallel or crossover design comparing oral supplements comprising a combination of potassium, and/or calcium, and/or magnesium with placebo, no treatment, or usual care; 2) treatment and follow-up ≥ 8 weeks; 3) participants over 18 years old, with raised systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 85 mmHg with no known primary cause; 4) SBP and DBP reported at end of follow-up. We excluded trials where participants were pregnant, or received antihypertensive medication which changed during the study.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Random effects meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted.

Main Results

We included three RCTs (n = 277) with between 24 and 28 weeks follow-up. Three combinations of minerals were investigated: potassium & magnesium, calcium & magnesium, and calcium & potassium. One trial investigated combinations of calcium & magnesium and of calcium & potassium, and for each found a statistically non-significant increase in both SBP and DBP. All three trials investigated the combination of potassium & magnesium. None of the trials provided data on mortality or morbidity. The combination of potassium & magnesium compared to control resulted in statistically non-significant reductions in both SBP (mean difference = -4.6 mmHg, 95% CI: -9.9 to 0.7) and DBP (mean difference = -3.8 mmHg, 95% CI: -9.5 to 1.8), although the results were heterogeneous (I² = 68% and 85% for SBP and DBP respectively). A sensitivity analysis using alternative reported values which accounted for missing data had very little effect on DBP but resulted in a larger, statistically significant reduction in SBP (mean difference = -5.8 mmHg, 95% CI: -10.5 to -1.0). The quality of the trials was not well reported.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no robust evidence that supplements of any combination of potassium, magnesium or calcium reduce mortality, morbidity or BP in adults. More trials are needed to investigate whether the combination of potassium & magnesium is effective.

### Magnesium supplementation for the management of essential hypertension in adults [^12185208]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Epidemiological evidence on the effects of magnesium on blood pressure is inconsistent. Metabolic and experimental studies suggest that magnesium may have a role in the regulation of blood pressure.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of magnesium supplementation as treatment for primary hypertension in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, ISI Proceedings, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, CAB abstracts, and reference lists of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) included in the review.

Selection Criteria

Inclusion criteria were: 1) RCTs of a parallel or crossover design comparing oral magnesium supplementation with placebo, no treatment, or usual care; 2) treatment and follow-up ≥ 8 weeks; 3) participants over 18 years old, with raised systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 85 mmHg; 4) SBP and DBP reported at end of follow-up. We excluded trials where: participants were pregnant; received antihypertensive medication which changed during the study; or magnesium supplementation was combined with other interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently abstracted data and assessed trial quality. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Random effects meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted.

Main Results

Twelve RCTs (n = 545) with eight to 26 weeks follow-up met our inclusion criteria. The results of the individual trials were heterogeneous. Combining all trials, participants receiving magnesium supplements as compared to control did not significantly reduce SBP (mean difference: -1.3 mmHg, 95% CI: -4.0 to 1.5, I² = 67%), but did statistically significantly reduce DBP (mean difference: -2.2 mmHg, 95% CI: -3.4 to -0.9, I² = 47%). Sensitivity analyses excluding poor quality trials yielded similar results. Sub-group analyses and meta-regression indicated that heterogeneity between trials could not be explained by dose of magnesium, baseline blood pressure or the proportion of males among the participants.

Authors' Conclusions

In view of the poor quality of included trials and the heterogeneity between trials, the evidence in favour of a causal association between magnesium supplementation and blood pressure reduction is weak and is probably due to bias. This is because poor quality studies generally tend to over-estimate the effects of treatment. Larger, longer duration and better quality double-blind placebo controlled trials are needed to assess the effect of magnesium supplementation on blood pressure and cardiovascular outcomes.

### Effects of magnesium supplementation on blood pressure: a meta-analysis of randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials [^ba888772]. Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

The antihypertensive effect of magnesium (Mg) supplementation remains controversial. We aimed to quantify the effect of oral Mg supplementation on blood pressure (BP) by synthesizing available evidence from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. We searched trials of Mg supplementation on normotensive and hypertensive adults published up to February 1, 2016 from MEDLINE and EMBASE databases; 34 trials involving 2028 participants were eligible for this meta-analysis. Weighted mean differences of changes in BP and serum Mg were calculated by random-effects meta-analysis. Mg supplementation at a median dose of 368 mg/d for a median duration of 3 months significantly reduced systolic BP by 2.00 mmHg (95% confidence interval, 0.43–3.58) and diastolic BP by 1.78 mmHg (95% confidence interval, 0.73–2.82); these reductions were accompanied by 0.05 mmol/L (95% confidence interval, 0.03, 0.07) elevation of serum Mg compared with placebo. Using a restricted cubic spline curve, we found that Mg supplementation with a dose of 300 mg/d or duration of 1 month is sufficient to elevate serum Mg and reduce BP; and serum Mg was negatively associated with diastolic BP but not systolic BP (all P < 0.05). In the stratified analyses, a greater reduction in BP tended to be found in trials with high quality or low dropout rate (all P values for interaction < 0.05). However, residual heterogeneity may still exist after considering these possible factors. Our findings indicate a causal effect of Mg supplementation on lowering BPs in adults. Further well-designed trials are warranted to validate the BP-lowering efficacy of optimal Mg treatment.

### The role of oral magnesium supplements for the management of stable bronchial asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1821b574]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, GINA guidelines defined adults as those 6 years old and above. This dichotomy is not used in many of the available studies. Clearer details regarding trial methodology, particularly about sequence generation and allocation concealment would help future systematic reviewers appraise the literature more properly. Additionally, clear stratification by oral magnesium dose and duration of therapy can help produce more precise and useful estimates. Finally, none of the RCTs provided their research protocol.

The use of magnesium supplements as an adjuvant to standard asthma treatment in mild to moderate asthmatic patients is not supported by high quality evidence. Apart from one point at week 8 where the FEV1 had significantly improved, no other benefits from oral magnesium supplements were seen. Until future higher quality evidence emerges, oral magnesium cannot be recommended for mild to moderate asthma.

### Magnesium supplementation for migraine prophylaxis [^ff4c5d6a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Measures of treatment effect

We will present binary data, such as adverse events, as a relative risk (RR) with its 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, like acute migraine attacks, we will estimate the treatment effect by calculating the mean difference (MD) with 95% CIs. If we combine data from studies that used different tools to assess the same outcome, we intend to compute standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% CIs. We will enter data presented on a scale with a uniform direction of effect and multiply the SMD by a standard deviation that is representative of the combined studies (e.g. the standard deviation from a widely recognized scale used in several studies included in the analysis that informed the result). We will multiply the mean values from studies using the opposite direction by –1 so that higher scores consistently indicate better (or worse) outcomes across studies. This standardization will allow for appropriate pooling of results in meta‐analysis. We will conduct meta‐analyses only when appropriate, that is, when the treatments, participants, and the fundamental clinical questions are sufficiently similar to allow for meaningful pooling of data.

### Magnesium supplementation and blood pressure: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^907d75b4]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND:

There are inconsistent reports regarding the effect of magnesium intake on blood pressure (BP) across hypertensive and normotensive populations.

METHODS:

We performed a meta-analysis and dose-response analysis to explore the relationship between magnesium supplementation and BP in randomized-controlled trials with a duration of ≥ 4 weeks, using a cubic spline regression model.

RESULTS:

Thirty-eight randomized controlled trials involving 2709 participants were eligible for inclusion. Studies included an elemental magnesium dose from 82.3 mg to 637 mg with a median dose of 365 mg and a median intervention period of 12 weeks. Mean differences of changes in BP were calculated by random effects meta-analysis. Magnesium intake resulted in a reduction in systolic BP of −2.81 mm Hg (95% CI, −4.32 to −1.29) and diastolic BP by −2.05 mm Hg (95% CI, −3.23 to −0.88) compared with placebo. Hypertensive individuals on BP-lowering medication and individuals with hypomagnesemia yielded greater systolic BP reductions of −7.68 and −5.97 mm Hg, respectively (P < 0.05), and diastolic BP reductions of −2.96 and −4.75 mm Hg, respectively (P < 0.05). In normotensive groups, statistical significance was not reached. We identified high heterogeneity across studies. We found no dose-response relationship between magnesium and BP changes (all P ≥ 0.20).

CONCLUSIONS:

Our findings support the beneficial effect of magnesium on reducing BP among populations with hypertension and hypomagnesemia, although effects should be interpreted with caution due to high heterogeneity of studies. Larger, well-designed studies assessing higher magnesium doses are needed to refine the dose-response relationship between magnesium intake and BP and identify potential optimal supplementation strategies for subpopulations.

### Magnesium for skeletal muscle cramps [^16a085b9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Skeletal muscle cramps are common and often presented to physicians in association with pregnancy, advanced age, exercise or disorders of the motor neuron (such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Magnesium supplements are marketed for the prophylaxis of cramps but the efficacy of magnesium for this indication has never been evaluated by systematic review.

Objectives

To assess the effects of magnesium supplementation compared to no treatment, placebo control or other cramp therapies in people with skeletal muscle cramps.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (11 October 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2011, Issue 3), MEDLINE (January 1966 to September 2011), EMBASE (January 1980 to September 2011), LILACS (January 1982 to September 2011), CINAHL Plus (January 1937 to September 2011), AMED (January 1985 to October 2011) and SPORTDiscus (January 1975 to September 2011).

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of magnesium supplementation (in any form) to prevent skeletal muscle cramps in any patient group (i.e. all clinical presentations of cramp). We considered comparisons of magnesium with no treatment, placebo control, or other therapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. Two authors assessed risk of bias. We attempted to contact all study authors and obtained patient level data for three of the included trials, one of which was unpublished. All data on adverse effects were collected from the included RCTs.

Main Results

We identified seven trials (five parallel, two cross-over) enrolling a total of 406 individuals amongst whom 118 cross-over participants additionally served as their own controls. Three trials enrolled women with pregnancy-associated leg cramps (N = 202) and four trials enrolled idiopathic cramp sufferers (N = 322 including cross-over controls). Magnesium was compared to placebo in six trials and to no treatment in one trial. For idiopathic cramps (largely older adults presumed to have nocturnal leg cramps), differences in measures of cramp frequency, magnesium versus placebo, were small, not statistically significant, and without heterogeneity (I² = 0%). This includes the primary endpoint, percentage change from baseline in the number of cramps per week at four weeks (-3.93%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -21.12% to 13.26%, moderate quality evidence) and the difference in the number of cramps per week at four weeks (0.01 cramps/week, 95% CI -0.52 to 0.55, moderate quality evidence). The percentage of individuals experiencing a 25% or better reduction in cramp rate from baseline was also no different, being 8% lower in the magnesium group (95% CI -28% to 12%, moderate quality evidence). Similarly, no statistically significant difference was found at four weeks in measures of cramp intensity (moderate quality evidence) or cramp duration (low quality evidence). Meta-analysis was not possible for trials of pregnancy-associated leg cramps. The single study comparing magnesium to no treatment failed to find statistically significant benefit on a three-point ordinal scale of overall treatment efficacy. The two trials comparing magnesium to placebo differed in that one trial found no benefit on frequency or intensity measures while the other found benefit for both. Withdrawals due to adverse events were not significantly different than placebo. While we could not determine the number of subjects with minor adverse events, studies of oral magnesium generally described potential side effects as similar in frequency to placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

It is unlikely that magnesium supplementation provides clinically meaningful cramp prophylaxis to older adults experiencing skeletal muscle cramps. In contrast, for those experiencing pregnancy-associated rest cramps the literature is conflicting and further research in this patient population is needed. We found no randomized controlled trials evaluating magnesium for exercise-associated muscle cramps or disease state-associated muscle cramps (for example amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease).

### Magnesium supplementation in pregnancy [^62c7b496]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Many women, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, have intakes of magnesium below recommended levels. Magnesium supplementation during pregnancy may be able to reduce fetal growth retardation and pre-eclampsia, and increase birth weight.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of magnesium supplementation during pregnancy on maternal, neonatal and paediatric outcomes.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. The date of the last search was June 2001.

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials of dietary magnesium supplementation during pregnancy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Suitability for inclusion and methodological quality were separately assessed by each reviewer. Data were independently extracted by the two reviewers.

Main Results

Seven trials involving 2689 women were included. Six of these trials randomly allocated women to either an oral magnesium supplement or a control group, whist the largest trial with 985 women had a cluster design where randomisation was according to study centre. The analysis was conducted with and without the cluster trial. In the analysis of all trials, oral magnesium treatment from before the 25th week of gestation was associated with a lower frequency of preterm birth, (relative risk (RR) 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.94), a lower frequency of low birth weight (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.96) and fewer small for gestational age infants (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.93) compared with placebo. In addition, magnesium treated women had less hospitalisations during pregnancy (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.89) and fewer cases of antepartum haemorrhage (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.90) than placebo treated women. In the analysis excluding the cluster randomised trial, the effects of magnesium treatment on the frequencies of preterm birth, low birth weight and small for gestational age were not different from placebo. Of the seven trials included in the review, only one was judged to be of high quality. Poor quality trials are likely to have resulted in a bias favouring magnesium supplementation.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is not enough high quality evidence to show that dietary magnesium supplementation during pregnancy is beneficial.

### Magnesium supplementation and blood pressure: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^16e5bdfe]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

There are inconsistent reports regarding the effect of magnesium intake on blood pressure (BP) across hypertensive and normotensive populations.

Methods

We performed a meta-analysis and dose-response analysis to explore the relationship between magnesium supplementation and BP in randomized-controlled trials with a duration of ≥ 4 weeks, using a cubic spline regression model.

Results

Thirty-eight randomized controlled trials involving 2709 participants were eligible for inclusion. Studies included an elemental magnesium dose from 82.3 mg to 637 mg with a median dose of 365 mg and a median intervention period of 12 weeks. Mean differences of changes in BP were calculated by random effects meta-analysis. Magnesium intake resulted in a reduction in systolic BP of -2.81 mmHg (95% CI, -4.32 to -1.29) and diastolic BP by -2.05 mmHg (95% CI, -3.23 to -0.88) compared with placebo. Hypertensive individuals on BP-lowering medication and individuals with hypomagnesemia yielded greater systolic BP reductions of -7.68 and -5.97 mmHg, respectively (P < 0.05), and diastolic BP reductions of -2.96 and -4.75 mmHg, respectively (P < 0.05). In normotensive groups, statistical significance was not reached. We identified high heterogeneity across studies. We found no dose-response relationship between magnesium and BP changes (all P ≥ 0.20).

Conclusions

Our findings support the beneficial effect of magnesium on reducing BP among populations with hypertension and hypomagnesemia, although effects should be interpreted with caution due to high heterogeneity of studies. Larger, well-designed studies assessing higher magnesium doses are needed to refine the dose-response relationship between magnesium intake and BP and identify potential optimal supplementation strategies for subpopulations.

Magnesium supplementation and monitoring — No randomized controlled study has evaluated the effect of magnesium intake on fracture risk or BMD, most people have adequate dietary intake, and individuals who are at risk for hypomagnesemia (e.g., those with GI malabsorption, chronic liver disease [including alcoholics], or renal tubular disorders; those who are taking diuretics, aminoglycoside antibiotics, calcineurin inhibitors, proton pump inhibitors, or other medications; and older adults) may benefit from evaluation of serum magnesium levels.

### Oral magnesium and vitamin C supplements in asthma: a parallel group randomized placebo-controlled trial [^9c7cc26b]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Epidemiological studies suggest that higher intakes of dietary vitamin C and magnesium may be associated with a reduced risk of asthma.

Objective

To determine whether vitamin C or magnesium supplements improve the clinical control of asthma in primary care patients.

Methods

A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind parallel group trial of 16 weeks supplementation with 1 g/day vitamin C, 450 mg/day magnesium chelate or matched placebo. Three hundred patients aged 18–60 years with physician-diagnosed asthma, controlled with at least one dose of an inhaled corticosteroid daily, were recruited from 24 primary care practices in Nottingham, UK. The main outcome measures were change in forced expiratory volume in 1 s, forced vital capacity, airway responsiveness to methacholine, mean morning and evening peak flow, symptom scores and bronchodilator use, both individually and as a combined summary statistic.

Results

There was no evidence of any beneficial effect of either supplement on any outcome measure of asthma control in the primary intention-to-treat analysis, or in an analysis restricted to participants who completed the study.

Conclusions

Regular dietary supplementation with vitamin C or magnesium adds no clinical benefit to current standard therapy of asthma in primary care patients.

### The effect of magnesium supplementation on blood pressure: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^41e5c56e]. American Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Background

An increased intake of magnesium might lower blood pressure (BP), yet evidence from clinical trials is inconsistent, perhaps as a result of small sample size or heterogeneity in study design.

Methods

We performed a meta-analysis of randomized trials that tested the effects of magnesium supplementation on BP. Twenty trials meeting the inclusion criteria were identified. Random effects models and meta-regression methods were used to pool study results and to determine the dose-response relationship of magnesium to BP.

Results

The 20 studies included 14 of hypertensive and 6 of normotensive persons totaling 1220 participants. The doses of magnesium ranged from 10 to 40 mmol/day (median, 15.4 mmol/day). Magnesium supplementation resulted in only a small overall reduction in BP. The pooled net estimates of BP change (95% confidence interval [CI]) were -0.6 (-2.2 to 1.0) mm Hg for systolic BP and -0.8 (-1.9 to 0.4) mm Hg for diastolic BP. However, there was an apparent dose-dependent effect of magnesium, with reductions of 4.3 mm Hg systolic BP (95% CI 6.3 to 2.2; P < .001) and of 2.3 mm Hg diastolic BP (95% CI 4.9 to 0.0; P = 0.09) for each 10 mmol/day increase in magnesium dose.

Conclusions

Our meta-analysis detected dose-dependent BP reductions from magnesium supplementation. However, adequately powered trials with sufficiently high doses of magnesium supplements need to be performed to confirm this relationship.

### Effect of magnesium supplementation on blood pressure: a meta-analysis [^7f2e8668]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

To date, there has been inconclusive evidence regarding the effect of magnesium supplements on blood pressure (BP). This meta-analysis was conducted to assess the effect of magnesium supplementation on BP and to establish the characteristics of trials showing the largest effect size. Primary outcome measures were systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at the end of the follow-up period. One hundred and forty-one papers were identified, of which 22 trials with 23 sets of data (n = 1173), with 3 to 24 weeks of follow-up met the inclusion criteria, with a supplemented elemental magnesium range of 120-973mg (mean dose 410mg). 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using DerSimonian and Laird's random-effects model, with effect size calculated using Hedges G. Combining all data, an overall effect of 0.36 and 0.32 for DBP and SBP, respectively, was observed (95% CI 0.27–0.44 for DBP and 0.23–0.41 for SBP), with a greater effect being seen for the intervention in crossover trials (DBP 0.47, SBP 0.51). Effect size increased in line with increased dosage. Although not all individual trials showed significance in BP reduction, combining all trials did show a decrease in SBP of 3-4mmHg and DBP of 2-3mmHg, which further increased with crossover designed trials and intake > 370mg/day. To conclude, magnesium supplementation appears to achieve a small but clinically significant reduction in BP, an effect worthy of future prospective large randomised trials using solid methodology.

### Effect of magnesium supplementation on glucose metabolism in people with or at risk of diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of double-blind randomized controlled trials [^ac171c22]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Although higher dietary intakes of magnesium (Mg) seem to correspond to lower diabetes incidence, research concerning Mg supplementation in people with or at risk of diabetes is limited. Thus, we aimed to investigate the effect of oral Mg supplementation on glucose and insulin-sensitivity parameters in participants with diabetes or at high risk of diabetes compared with placebo. A literature search in PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Clinicaltrials.gov without language restriction, was undertaken. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of oral Mg supplementation vs placebo in patients with diabetes or at high risk of diabetes. Standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used for summarizing outcomes with at least two studies; other outcomes were summarized descriptively. Eighteen RCTs (12 in people with diabetes and 6 in people at high risk of diabetes) were included. Compared with placebo (n = 334), Mg treatment (n = 336) reduced fasting plasma glucose (studies = 9; SMD = -0.40; 95% CI: -0.80 to -0.00; I² = 77%) in people with diabetes. In conditions in people at high risk of diabetes (Mg: 226; placebo = 227 participants), Mg supplementation significantly improved plasma glucose levels after a 2h oral glucose tolerance test (three studies; SMD = -0.35; 95% CI: -0.62 to -0.07; I² = 0%) and demonstrated trend level reductions in HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance; five studies; SMD = -0.57; 95% CI: -1.17 to 0.03; I² = 88%). Mg supplementation appears to have a beneficial role and improves glucose parameters in people with diabetes and also improves insulin-sensitivity parameters in those at high risk of diabetes.

Analysis According to Magnesium Supplement Type

Forest plots comparing mean changes in SBP and DBP based on magnesium supplement type are presented in, respectively. For studies that used magnesium chloride (N = 7), magnesium intervention reduced SBP by –6.28 mm Hg (95% CI, –9.95 to –2.61; P < 0.001) and reduced DBP by –5.01 mm Hg (95% CI, –7.00 to –3.03; P < 0.001). Studies using magnesium aspartate hydrochloride (N = 8) demonstrated a reduction in DBP with magnesium intervention by −1.82 mm Hg (95% CI, −3.51 to −0.13; P = 0.03) but did not report a statistically significant reduction in SBP. No statistical significance was seen for studies using alternative magnesium supplementation types.

Study Heterogeneity

We undertook a complete case multiple-adjusted mixed effects meta-regression to assess heterogeneity across studies by exploring how the proportion of male participants, mean age of participants, magnesium supplementation dose, intervention duration, and baseline SBP were associated with SBP and DBP effect sizes. In this meta-regression, SBP, sex, age, magnesium dose, intervention duration, and baseline SBP were not associated with effect size, and similarly for DBP. The meta-regression was conducted on 35 records, as 3 studies did not provide sex data, 2 did not provide age data, and 1 did not provide both sex and age data.

Dose-Response Analysis

Results for the dose-response meta-analysis demonstrating the relationship between magnesium intake and changes in SBP and DBP are presented in Figure 5. No statistically significant relationships were observed in either the linear or nonlinear models for both SBP (P = 0.67 for linear and P = 0.56 for nonlinear) and DBP (P = 0.68 for linear and P = 0.61 for nonlinear) in the magnesium intervention groups. Specifically, the change in SBP and DBP remained constant across increasing magnesium doses. Detailed results are reported in.

### Dietary supplement use is associated with higher intakes of minerals from food sources [^1dbacd63]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Dietary supplement use is extensive in US adults. Some reports suggested that supplement users had higher nutrient intakes from the diet than did nonusers, but to our knowledge this finding has not been examined in nationally representative survey data.

Objective

In this analysis, we examined mineral intakes from the diet by supplement-use categories and how these supplements contributed to meeting or exceeding Dietary Reference Intakes for selected minerals.

Design

Data from adults (≥ 19 y of age; n = 8860) who participated in NHANES 2003–2006, a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey, were examined. Supplement use was defined as the participant's self-reported use of a supplement that contained one or more selected minerals.

Results

Dietary intakes of minerals from food sources were higher for magnesium, copper, potassium, and selenium in male supplement users than in nonusers. For women, dietary intakes of minerals from food sources were higher for users than for nonusers for each mineral examined except for selenium. In women, users of calcium-containing dietary supplements were much more likely to meet the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) than were nonusers. Even after consideration of supplement use, > 14% of adults had inadequate intakes for calcium and magnesium on the basis of the percentage of adults with usual intakes less than the EAR. The prevalence of adults who exceeded the tolerable upper intake level (UL) for calcium, zinc, iron, and magnesium was higher in users than in nonusers.

Conclusions

Individuals who used mineral-containing dietary supplements had higher mineral intakes from food sources in the diet than did nonusers. For all minerals examined, and particularly for calcium and magnesium in men and women and iron in women, supplement use decreased the prevalence of intake inadequacy for each respective mineral; however, supplements contributed to risk of potentially excessive intakes for calcium, iron, zinc, and magnesium.

### Magnesium supplementation and blood pressure: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^04fbdb1c]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This review of 38 randomized controlled trials involving 2709 participants found that magnesium supplementation with a median intake of 365 mg/d for a median duration of 12 weeks led to a significant reduction in both SBP and DBP (−2.84 and −2.10 mm Hg, respectively). Although these reductions in BP were consistent, on a clinical level, the BP-lowering effect is modest. Despite evidence that magnesium intake does decrease SBP and DBP, we did not find a dose-response relationship between magnesium intake and BP, as others have reported.

Past analyses have attempted to determine dose-response relationships through a subanalysis of doses. Kass et alcompared magnesium doses of < 370 mg and ≥ 370 mg, and found that magnesium supplementation if ≥ 370 mg was associated with greater efficacy of magnesium supplementation, while a smaller effect estimates and larger variations in BP were noted with doses < 370 mg. Rosanoff et alfound that while ≥ 240 mg/d of magnesium was effective at reducing BP in treated but uncontrolled hypertensive individuals, a dose of ≥ 600 mg/d was required to lower BP among untreated hypertensive participants. However, due to the heterogeneity between studies and the narrow magnesium doses included in studies, our analysis suggests that further exploration of a dose-response relationship in subpopulations, along with the assessment of studies trialing a higher magnesium dose, may be required to better inform and guide the therapeutic benefits of magnesium.

### Decreased magnesium status may mediate the increased cardiovascular risk associated with calcium supplementation [^aaa40b29]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Balanced supplemental intakes of calcium and magnesium may be advisable

If high calcium intakes in humans can indeed impair magnesium balance when magnesium intakes are low, the clear implication is that calcium, when supplemented, should be given in conjunction with a balanced dose of magnesium; some authorities recommend a 2:1 ratio of calcium to magnesium (by weight) as most appropriate, both for supplementation and the total daily intake. This seems appropriate considering that good magnesium status also appears to favourably impact bone structure. The concept of 'balancing' calcium and magnesium in supplements has, in fact, been the accepted wisdom in 'health food' circles for decades, owing to Seelig's research and its promulgation by popular health food pundits. However, the calcium supplements featured in pharmacies and supermarkets — where most people shop — typically feature only calcium and vitamin D. Research and promotional efforts sponsored by the dairy industry have insured that calcium is highly valued by the general public, whereas magnesium, no less crucial to health, is essentially an 'orphan nutrient', lacking the advocacy of commercial interests.

It should be noted that calcium/magnesium balance may cut both ways. In China, where the use of dairy products is low, dietary calcium/magnesium ratios tend to be much lower than in the West (1.7 vs 3). A recent analysis of prospective cohort studies in Shanghai has observed that, among people with a calcium/magnesium ratio under 1.7, an increasing intake of magnesium correlates with increased total mortality, whereas in those with a calcium/magnesium ratio above 1.7, increases in intake of magnesium and/or calcium correlated with reduced mortality risk. Hence, a high supplemental intake of magnesium may be inadvisable when calcium intakes are low.

Thus, more clinical studies examining the impact of varying calcium intakes on magnesium balance in subjects with low-normal magnesium intakes are clearly needed, as is a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms, whereby calcium can both positively and negatively influence magnesium absorption and retention. Future epidemiological studies should make an effort to differentiate calcium supplementers into those who either do or do not use supplemental magnesium concurrently, and also take into consideration dietary magnesium intake. In the mean time, people (especially those consuming a relatively refined diet) who wish to supplement with calcium might be well advised to take a supplement that also includes highly bioavailable magnesium, targeting a 2:1 calcium to magnesium ratio in the overall diet.

### Magnesium supplementation and blood pressure: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^abcedc46]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

The PRISMA literature search flowchart is presented in Figure 1. Our electronic and manual search identified 1826 potential articles for screening. After excluding duplicate and irrelevant publications by screening titles and abstracts, 105 full-text articles were reviewed for eligibility. Sixty-seven articles were excluded at full-text review as they had different study designs, did not report BP outcome data, included other interventions, or included different routes of magnesium administration, had an intervention period < 4 weeks, did not have a placebo or control group, were not provided in English language, included children, or full-text articles could not be retrieved. A total of 38 randomized controlled trials from published studies met our inclusion criteria.

### Magnesium supplementation and blood pressure: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^bedc3cb0]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Several limitations should be considered when interpreting our findings. A major limitation in most studies was the lack of data on dietary intake and, therefore, the overall magnesium intake of participants. Moreover, magnesium preparations have different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic features, which influence bioavailability. Absorption of organic magnesium compounds is better than absorption of inorganic compounds. Significant heterogeneity was also present across studies, and although this was reduced when we undertook subgroup analyses, sources of heterogeneity were not identified through additional meta-regression of participant and study characteristics. Differences in study designs, BP measurement techniques, magnesium supplement composition, baseline clinical status of participants, along with small sample sizes, may have contributed, making it difficult to draw conclusions.

Most studies used a magnesium dose between 300 and 500 mg and yielded a wide range of BP responses. This limited the ability to perform a dose-response analysis across a wide range of doses to undertake a more comprehensive dose-response analysis. Dose-response analysis was also undertaken for magnesium dose, but was not completed for the dose of intervention duration, which may have increased the robustness of the analysis.

Hypomagnesemia and normomagnesemia categories were determined by studies based on reported categories of serum magnesium. However, < 1% of magnesium in the body is found in the blood, and therefore, serum magnesium concentrations may underestimate depleted intracellular stores and magnesium deficiency. For a more accurate evaluation of magnesium status, total dietary magnesium and urinary losses should be considered.

Perspectives

This meta-analysis strengthens the evidence to support the benefits of oral magnesium intake for the reduction in SBP and DBP, with potentially greater benefit for patients with hypertension using BP-lowering medication, and for patients with hypomagnesemia. We found no dose-response relationship. Importantly, the absence of a significant effect in normotensive populations and the lack of a clear dose-response relationship underscore the complexity of magnesium's physiological influence and the need for further research. The high heterogeneity across studies emphasizes the necessity for future large-scale, rigorously designed randomized controlled trials to elucidate optimal dosing thresholds and identify responsive subpopulations. These findings contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting personalized nutritional approaches in hypertension management and call for integration of micronutrient assessment in clinical practice, particularly where the hypertension burden is high.

### Magnesium supplementation in pregnancy [^0b887325]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Magnesium is an essential mineral required for regulation of body temperature, nucleic acid and protein synthesis and in maintaining nerve and muscle cell electrical potentials. Many women, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, have low intakes of magnesium. Magnesium supplementation during pregnancy may be able to reduce fetal growth restriction and pre-eclampsia, and increase birthweight.

Objectives

To assess the effects of magnesium supplementation during pregnancy on maternal, neonatal/infant and paediatric outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 March 2013).

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials assessing the effects of dietary magnesium supplementation during pregnancy were included. The primary outcomes were perinatal mortality (including stillbirth and neonatal death prior to hospital discharge), small-for-gestational age, maternal mortality and pre-eclampsia.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies.

Main Results

Ten trials involving 9090 women and their babies were included; one trial had a cluster design (with randomisation by study centre). All 10 trials randomly allocated women to either an oral magnesium supplement or a control group; in eight trials a placebo was used, and in two trials no treatment was given to the control group. In the 10 included trials, the compositions of the magnesium supplements, gestational ages at commencement, and doses administered varied, including: magnesium oxide, 1000 mg daily from ≤ four months post-conception (one trial); magnesium citrate, 365 mg daily from ≤ 18 weeks until hospitalisation after 38 weeks (one trial), and 340 mg daily from nine to 27 weeks' gestation (one trial); magnesium gluconate, 2 to 3 g from 28 weeks' gestation until birth (one trial), and 4 g daily from 23 weeks' gestation (one trial); magnesium aspartate, 15 mmol daily (three trials, commencing from either six to 21 weeks' gestation until birth, ≤ 16 weeks' gestation until birth, or < 12 weeks until birth), or 365 mg daily from 13 to 24 weeks until birth (one trial); and magnesium stearate, 128 mg elemental magnesium from 10 to 35 weeks until birth (one trial). In the analysis of all trials, oral magnesium supplementation compared to no magnesium was associated with no significant difference in perinatal mortality (stillbirth and neonatal death prior to discharge) (risk ratio (RR) 1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 1.67; five trials, 5903 infants), small-for-gestational age (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.07; three trials, 1291 infants), or pre-eclampsia (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.58 to 1.32; three trials, 1042 women). None of the included trials reported on maternal mortality. Considering secondary outcomes, while no increased risk of stillbirth was observed, a possible increased risk of neonatal death prior to hospital discharge was shown for infants born to mothers who had received magnesium (RR 2.21; 95% CI 1.02 to 4.75; four trials, 5373 infants). One trial contributed over 70% of the participants to the analysis for this outcome; the trial authors suggested that the large number of severe congenital anomalies in the supplemented group (unlikely attributable to magnesium) and the deaths of two sets of twins (with birthweights < 750 g) in the supplemented group likely accounted for the increased risk of death observed, and thus this result should be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, when the deaths due to severe congenital abnormalities in this trial were excluded from the meta-analysis, no increased risk of neonatal death was seen for the magnesium supplemented group. Magnesium supplementation was associated with significantly fewer babies with an Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (RR 0.34; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.80; four trials, 1083 infants), with meconium-stained liquor (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.99; one trial, 4082 infants), late fetal heart decelerations (RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.88; one trial, 4082 infants), and mild hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (RR 0.38; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.98; one trial, 4082 infants). Women receiving magnesium were significantly less likely to require hospitalisation during pregnancy (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.86; three trials, 1158 women). Of the 10 trials included in the review, only two were judged to be of high quality overall. When an analysis was restricted to these two trials none of the review's primary outcomes (perinatal mortality, small-for-gestational age, pre-eclampsia) were significantly different between the magnesium supplemented and control groups.

Authors' Conclusions

There is not enough high-quality evidence to show that dietary magnesium supplementation during pregnancy is beneficial.

### Magnesium for skeletal muscle cramps [^f7c15c3a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Skeletal muscle cramps are common and often occur in association with pregnancy, advanced age, exercise or motor neuron disorders (such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Typically, such cramps have no obvious underlying pathology, and so are termed idiopathic. Magnesium supplements are marketed for the prophylaxis of cramps but the efficacy of magnesium for this purpose remains unclear. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2012, and performed to identify and incorporate more recent studies.

Objectives

To assess the effects of magnesium supplementation compared to no treatment, placebo control or other cramp therapies in people with skeletal muscle cramps. SEARCH METHODS: On 9 September 2019, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL Plus, AMED, and SPORTDiscus. We also searched WHO-ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov for registered trials that might be ongoing or unpublished, and ISI Web of Science for studies citing the studies included in this review.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of magnesium supplementation (in any form) to prevent skeletal muscle cramps in any patient group (i.e. all clinical presentations of cramp). We considered comparisons of magnesium with no treatment, placebo control, or other therapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. Two review authors assessed risk of bias. We attempted to contact all study authors when questions arose and obtained participant-level data for four of the included trials, one of which was unpublished. We collected all data on adverse effects from the included RCTs.

Main Results

We identified 11 trials (nine parallel-group, two cross-over) enrolling a total of 735 individuals, amongst whom 118 cross-over participants additionally served as their own controls. Five trials enrolled women with pregnancy-associated leg cramps (408 participants) and five trials enrolled people with idiopathic cramps (271 participants, with 118 additionally crossed over to control). Another study enrolled 29 people with liver cirrhosis, only some of whom suffered muscle cramps. All trials provided magnesium as an oral supplement, except for one trial which provided magnesium as a series of slow intravenous infusions. Nine trials compared magnesium to placebo, one trial compared magnesium to no treatment, calcium carbonate or vitamin B, and another trial compared magnesium to vitamin E or calcium. We judged the single trial in people with liver cirrhosis and all five trials in participants with pregnancy-associated leg cramps to be at high risk of bias. In contrast, we rated the risk of bias high in only one of five trials in participants with idiopathic rest cramps. For idiopathic cramps, largely in older adults (mean age 61.6 to 69.3 years) presumed to have nocturnal leg cramps (the commonest presentation), differences in measures of cramp frequency when comparing magnesium to placebo were small, not statistically significant, and showed minimal heterogeneity (I² = 0% to 12%). This includes the primary endpoint, percentage change from baseline in the number of cramps per week at four weeks (mean difference (MD) -9.59%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -23.14% to 3.97%; 3 studies, 177 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); and the difference in the number of cramps per week at four weeks (MD -0.18 cramps/week, 95% CI -0.84 to 0.49; 5 studies, 307 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The percentage of individuals experiencing a 25% or better reduction in cramp rate from baseline was also no different (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.29; 3 studies, 177 participants; high-certainty evidence). Similarly, no statistically significant difference was found at four weeks in measures of cramp intensity or cramp duration. This includes the number of participants rating their cramps as moderate or severe at four weeks (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.21; 2 studies, 91 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); and the percentage of participants with the majority of cramp durations of one minute or more at four weeks (RR 1.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 4.53, 1 study, 46 participants; low-certainty evidence). We were unable to perform meta-analysis for trials of pregnancy-associated leg cramps. The single study comparing magnesium to no treatment failed to find statistically significant benefit on a three-point ordinal scale of overall treatment efficacy. Of the three trials comparing magnesium to placebo, one found no benefit on frequency or intensity measures, another found benefit for both, and a third reported inconsistent results for frequency that could not be reconciled. The single study in people with liver cirrhosis was small and had limited reporting of cramps, but found no difference in terms of cramp frequency or cramp intensity. Our analysis of adverse events pooled all studies, regardless of the setting in which cramps occurred. Major adverse events (occurring in 2 out of 72 magnesium recipients and 3 out of 68 placebo recipients), and withdrawals due to adverse events, were not significantly different from placebo. However, in the four studies for which it could be determined, more participants experienced minor adverse events in the magnesium group than in the placebo group (RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.33; 4 studies, 254 participants; low-certainty evidence). Overall, oral magnesium was associated with mostly gastrointestinal adverse events (e.g. diarrhoea), experienced by 11% (10% in control) to 37% (14% in control) of participants.

Authors' Conclusions

It is unlikely that magnesium supplementation provides clinically meaningful cramp prophylaxis to older adults experiencing skeletal muscle cramps. In contrast, for those experiencing pregnancy-associated rest cramps the literature is conflicting and further research in this population is needed. We found no RCTs evaluating magnesium for exercise-associated muscle cramps or disease-state-associated muscle cramps (for example amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease) other than a single small (inconclusive) study in people with liver cirrhosis, only some of whom suffered cramps.

Raised blood pressure (BP) is the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease and preventable deaths, contributing to 19.2% of all deaths in 2019. Lifestyle modification, including dietary interventions, is important for preventing raised BP and acting as the first line of treatment for hypertension.

Consistent evidence for dietary interventions to lower BP and prevent hypertension mostly focuses on decreasing sodium intake and increasing potassium intake. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet centers on a more holistic approach through food intake that would increase potassium, calcium, and magnesium while lowering sodium. Despite the consistent evidence on the importance of sodium, and potassium, the evidence on the impact of magnesium alone on reducing BP has been inconsistent.

Magnesium may lower BP through several mechanisms. These include regulating cardiac rhythm, reducing vascular tone, inhibiting the renin angiotensin aldosterone system, increasing nitric oxide release and endothelial prostaglandin I 2 secretion, decreasing reabsorption of sodiumand enhancing the effect of BP-lowering medication. The potential benefits of magnesium on BP may also be greater among individuals with hypomagnesemia.

Despite these potential benefits, the latest evidence review by the United States Food and Drug Association in 2022 identified supportive yet inconclusive evidence that diets with adequate magnesium reduce hypertension. Of the meta-analyses conducted to date, 2 of those reviewing randomized controlled trials found small yet significant reductions in systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP), 1 found magnesium supplementation reduced DBP but not SBP among hypertensive individuals, and 1 review found no effect of oral magnesium supplementation on BP.

The latest meta-analysis conducted in 2017 by Dibaba et alassessed the effect of magnesium supplementation on BP in those with underlying preclinical conditions (insulin resistance, prediabetes, and noncommunicable chronic disease). Eleven randomized controlled trials, with a total of 543 participants and a mean follow-up of 3.6 months, were included, which found that magnesium supplementation reduced SBP by −4.18 mm Hg and DBP by −2.27 mm Hg compared with control groups.

Supplementation

What micronutrient supplementation should be provided to the ICU patient receiving prophylaxis or treatment for alcohol withdrawal?

Recommendation

Micronutrient deficiencies are common in those with chronic or severe AUD. Thiamine (vitamin B1), magnesium, phosphorus, and folic acid (vitamin B9) should be given as supplements during the acute period of critical care, even in the absence of symptoms of AWS.

### Magnesium as an adjuvant to postoperative analgesia: a systematic review of randomized trials [^800e8a63]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Randomized trials have reached different conclusions as to whether magnesium is a useful adjuvant to postoperative analgesia.

Methods

We performed a comprehensive search (electronic databases, bibliographies, all languages, to 4.2006) for randomized comparisons of magnesium and placebo in the surgical setting. Information on postoperative pain intensity and analgesic requirements was extracted from the trials and compared qualitatively. Dichotomous data on adverse effects were combined using classic methods of meta-analysis.

Results

Fourteen randomized trials (778 patients, 404 received magnesium) tested magnesium laevulinate, gluconate or sulfate. With magnesium, postoperative pain intensity was significantly decreased in four (29%) trials, was no different from placebo in seven (50%), and was increased in one (7%); two trials (14%) did not report on pain intensity. With magnesium, postoperative analgesic requirements were significantly reduced in eight (57%) trials, were no different from placebo in five (36%), and were increased in one (7%). Magnesium-treated patients had less postoperative shivering (relative risk 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.17–0.88, number-needed-to-treat 14). Seven trials reported on magnesium serum levels. In all, serum levels were increased in patients who received magnesium; in six, serum levels were decreased in those who received placebo.

Conclusions

These trials do not provide convincing evidence that perioperative magnesium may have favorable effects on postoperative pain intensity and analgesic requirements. Perioperative magnesium supplementation prevents postoperative hypomagnesemia and decreases the incidence of postoperative shivering. It may be worthwhile to further study the role of magnesium as a supplement to postoperative analgesia, since this relatively harmless molecule is inexpensive, and the biological basis for its potential antinociceptive effect is promising.

### Therapeutic uses of magnesium… [^de27ae27]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

These processes include protein synthesis, cellular energy production and storage, cell growth and reproduction, DNA and RNA synthesis, and stabilization of mitochondrial membranes. 11–14 Magnesium is one of the minerals responsible for managing bone metabolism, nerve transmission, cardiac excitability, neuromuscular conduction, muscular contraction, vasomotor tone, and blood pressure. 11–14 Magnesium also plays a significant role in glucose and insulin metabolism, mainly through its impact on tyrosine kinase activity, phosphorylase b kinase activity, and glucose transporter protein activity. 15–19 Because of these vital roles, magnesium levels may be affected by stressors to the body, such as in certain disease states. Supplementation with magnesium may have therapeutic effects in these situations. ARRHYTHMIA A well-known use of intravenous magnesium is for correcting the uncommon ventricular tachycardia of torsade de pointes. 26 Results of a meta-analysis suggest that 1.

2 to 10 g of intravenous magnesium sulfate is also a safe and effective strategy for the acute management of rapid atrial fibrillation. 27 A six-week randomized, double-blind crossover trial showed that oral magnesium supplementation reduced the frequency of asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmia in patients with stable congestive heart failure secondary to coronary artery disease.
28. HEADACHE Studies have found that patients with cluster headaches and classic or common migraine, especially menstrual migraine, have low levels of magnesium. 33, 34 A prospective, multicenter, double-blind randomized study conducted in Germany showed that a single daily dosage of 600 mg oral trimagnesium dicitrate significantly reduced the frequency of migraine compared with placebo, whereas a lower twice daily dosage was found ineffective.

35, 36 For acute treatment of migraine, intravenous magnesium sulfate showed a statistically significant improvement in the treatment of all symptoms in patients with aura, or as an adjuvant therapy for associated symptoms in patients without aura.
37. OTHER Magnesium is associated with maintaining or improving bone mineral density as a dietary component in combination with potassium, fruits, and vegetables, or as an oral supplement. 46 A 2001 Cochrane review of three small trials showed that in patients with dysmenorrhea, magnesium was more effective than placebo for pain relief and the need for additional medication was less. 47 Studies have linked magnesium deficiency to myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, primary hypertension, and angina pectoris, 48 but evidence is still limited to recommend its use for these conditions.

### Decreased magnesium status may mediate the increased cardiovascular risk associated with calcium supplementation [^1304b783]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Consideration should, therefore, be given to the possibility that, in some individuals, high supplemental intakes of calcium may disturb magnesium balance. A great deal of recent epidemiology, including meta-analyses, points to higher dietary magnesium intakes, and/or higher serum magnesium levels, as associated with reduced risk for vascular events, arrhythmias, diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, vascular calcification and mortality. Although to some degree these observations likely reflect the benefits of consuming nutrient-rich whole foods, rather than just magnesium per se, magnesium still often emerges as protective after multiple regression analyses which try to adjust for this effect. Moreover, short-term studies of magnesium supplementation in persons at high cardiovascular risk have often found protective effects, particularly in those with low baseline magnesium status. Notably, in patients with coronary disease, magnesium supplementation has been found to decrease ex vivo platelet-dependent thrombosis, increase flow-mediated vasodilation of the brachial artery and during exercise, increase exercise tolerance, VO₂ max and left ventricular ejection fraction. A meta-analysis of placebo-controlled studies evaluating the impact of supplemental magnesium on treated hypertensives with baseline systolic pressure > 155 mm Hg, found a mean reduction of 18.7 and 10.9 mm Hg in systolic and diastolic pressures, respectively, with high statistical significance. The mechanism of the apparent benefits conferred by good magnesium status requires further study, but it is suspected that magnesium antagonises some of the proinflammatory effects of increased cytoplasmic calcium. Indeed, magnesium has sometimes been referred to as 'nature's physiological calcium blocker'. For example, in physiological intracellular concentrations, magnesium competes with calcium for binding to calmodulin and other 'EF-hand' calcium-binding proteins, such that magnesium-bound proteins assume an 'off' configuration. The apparent ability of good magnesium status to diminish risk for vascular calcification is intriguing in light of recent epidemiology pointing to increased risk of coronary calcification in people using calcium supplements. Figure 1 depicts the inverse association between total dietary magnesium intake and risk for arterial calcification.

### Magnesium supplementation: a consideration in dialysis patients [^a564de3b]. Seminars in Dialysis (2018). Low credibility.

Even though disorders of magnesium (Mg) balance are common in dialyzed patients, this cation is often neglected. Many factors interfere with serum magnesium including diet, medications (eg, antacids or phosphate binders), and the dialysis prescription. Mg supplementation may help reduce serum phosphate concentration, PTH, and interfere with vascular calcification and bone mineralization. It could also decrease the all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities, although the results of current studies are conflicting. As with many other variables that influence hard endpoints in nephrology, additional research directly targeting the role of Mg supplementation in dialyzed patients are required. Nevertheless, a current risk/benefit assessment suggests that supplementation of Mg targeting high normal serum levels may represent a plausible option to improve the outcome of dialysis patients.

### The role of oral magnesium supplements for the management of stable bronchial asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c8abaafd]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Search strategy

A medical librarian (MVN) performed a comprehensive literature search on April 2016. Searched databases were as follows: Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Embase, and on-going clinical trials. The main search concepts were asthma and oral magnesium; Boolean operators: OR (for combining synonyms), AND (to combine concepts), and truncations were used when appropriate. A review of references and a manual search of relevant articles was completed. Additionally, we contacted the authors of the trials to minimize chances of missed articles. The search was updated on May 2017. No restrictions to study type, time, or language were applied.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

We included RCTs that investigated the use of oral magnesium as an adjunct to asthma inhalers. Asthma was defined in accordance with the authors of the included trials, which were either clinically, objectively (spirometry), or both. All trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria as follows: (1) Population: mild and moderate asthmatic older than 6 years [6 years was the cut-off based on the global initiative for asthma (GINA) guidelines];(2) Intervention: all preparations of oral magnesium, regardless of name or dosage; (3) Comparisons: placebo or no treatment; (4) Outcomes: frequency of rescue asthma exacerbation, ER visits or hospital admissions, objective measures: FEV1, FVC, and PEF, daytime symptoms, daytime activity, night-time symptoms, frequency of bronchodilator use, use of oral or inhaled steroids, side effects, and mortality; (5) Timing: treatment for any duration was included; (6) Study type: RCTs, blinded or open-labeled. Crossover trials were excluded.

Study selection

Two reviewers (AA and FA) separately scanned the titles and abstracts of all articles, and when needed, the full text was retrieved and reviewed to identify all relevant articles. A third author (MF) resolved any disagreements.

Data extraction

Important data were extracted using a piloted form, which incorporated all attributes of the studies, including author, publication year, country, setting, design, sample size, intervention (dose and type), placebo, patient's age and sex, severity, study duration, inclusion and exclusion criteria, outcomes, and limitations. Data was extracted by AA and FA and reviewed by MF. We contacted the author of the study in question for any missing information.

### Subclinical magnesium deficiency: a principal driver of cardiovascular disease and a public health crisis [^30008768]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Because serum magnesium does not reflect intracellular magnesium, the latter making up more than 99% of total body magnesium, most cases of magnesium deficiency are undiagnosed. Furthermore, because of chronic diseases, medications, decreases in food crop magnesium contents, and the availability of refined and processed foods, the vast majority of people in modern societies are at risk for magnesium deficiency. Certain individuals will need to supplement with magnesium in order to prevent suboptimal magnesium deficiency, especially if trying to obtain an optimal magnesium status to prevent chronic disease. Subclinical magnesium deficiency increases the risk of numerous types of cardiovascular disease, costs nations around the world an incalculable amount of healthcare costs and suffering, and should be considered a public health crisis. That an easy, cost-effective strategy exists to prevent and treat subclinical magnesium deficiency should provide an urgent call to action.

### Effects of magnesium citrate, magnesium oxide, and magnesium sulfate supplementation on arterial stiffness: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention trial [^31f14195]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The primary aim of this study was to assess the effects of a relatively high dose of magnesium supplementation on arterial stiffness and blood pressure. A total daily dose of 450 mg/d was based on previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that suggested a greater blood pressure–lowering effect with a higher total daily dose of magnesium. Furthermore, no prior study previously compared the efficacy of different magnesium formulations to pinpoint whether vascular effects may be driven by magnesium or the accompanying anion. Therefore, the main novel aspects of this trial are the higher magnesium dose and the head‐to‐head comparison among various types of magnesium supplements.

In contrast with our hypothesis, magnesium citrate supplementation of 450 mg/d for 24 weeks did not change arterial stiffness or blood pressure. Furthermore, compared with magnesium citrate treatment, magnesium oxide and magnesium sulfate did not significantly change c‐f PWV. In a secondary analysis, magnesium sulfate supplementation significantly improved c‐f PWV at 24 weeks in a subgroup with higher arterial stiffness at baseline. Effects of magnesium citrate and oxide supplementation on c‐f PWV at 24 weeks were in a similar direction, although not significantly different from placebo in these instances. Although these subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution as it was not prespecified in the study protocol, this result suggests that oral magnesium supplementation is indeed effective to improve arterial stiffness in individuals with prevalent increased arterial stiffness. The current trial was mainly designed to confirm the previously observed effect of magnesium citrate supplementation on arterial stiffness, now with a slightly higher dose. In the previous study, we found a significant effect on c‐f PWV by 1.0 m/s after 24 weeks. Interestingly, the effect size that we observed in individuals with prevalent increased arterial stiffness in the current study is similar to what we previously found.

### Headaches in pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 3 [^b070d7aa]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Headaches in pregnancy — supplements and magnesium use for prevention are addressed with specific cautions. "Owing to lack of data, there are unknown risks associated with the use of supplements such as riboflavin, coenzyme Q10, or melatonin", and "Feverfew is associated with stimulation of uterine contractility and should not be used". Regarding magnesium, "Oral magnesium was associated with an increased risk of neonatal death (relative risk [RR] 2.21; 95% CI 1.02–4.75) in a Cochrane Review", yet given limitations, "oral magnesium remains a reasonable option for the prevention of headaches".

### Magnesium supplementation for the treatment of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder: a systematic review [^5099e70b]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Magnesium supplementation is often suggested for restless legs syndrome (RLS) or period limb movement disorder (PLMD) based on anecdotal evidence that it relieves symptoms and because it is also commonly recommended for leg cramps. We aimed to review all articles reporting the effects of magnesium supplementation on changes in RLS and/or PLMD. We conducted a systematic search looking for all relevant articles and then two reviewers read all article titles and abstracts to identify relevant studies. Eligible studies were scored for their quality as interventional trials. We found 855 abstracts and 16 of these could not be definitively excluded for not addressing all aspects of our research question. Seven full-text articles were unlocatable and one was ineligible which left eight studies with relevant data. One was a randomised placebo-controlled trial, three were case series and four were case studies. The RCT did not find a significant treatment effect of magnesium but may have been underpowered. After quality appraisal and synthesis of the evidence we were unable to make a conclusion as to the effectiveness of magnesium for RLS/PLMD. It is not clear whether magnesium helps relieve RLS or PLMD or in which patient groups any benefit might be seen.

### Leg cramps [^3d12d077]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Involuntary, localised leg cramps are common and typically affect the calf muscles at night.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for idiopathic leg cramps? What are the effects of treatments for leg cramps in pregnancy? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 12 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: analgesics, anti-epileptic drugs, calcium salts, compression hosiery, magnesium salts, multivitamin and mineral supplements, quinine alone or with theophylline, sodium chloride, and stretching exercises.

### Effect of magnesium oxide supplementation on nocturnal leg cramps: a randomized clinical trial [^adb80f3c]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Magnesium supplements are widely marketed for prophylaxis of nocturnal leg cramps (NLC) despite no evidence of significant benefit.

Objective

To determine whether magnesium oxide is better than placebo for NLC prophylaxis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 2 weeks eligibility screening followed by 4 weeks of treatment was conducted in northern Israel, from February to October 2013. An intention-to-treat data analysis was performed from March 22, 2014, to April 17, 2016. We used a volunteer sample of community-dwelling individuals experiencing NLC, 21 years or older, with 4 or more documented episodes of NLC during 2 weeks of screening.

Interventions

Capsules containing either magnesium oxide or a similar-looking placebo to be taken orally, once daily at bedtime for a period of 4 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the difference in the mean number of NLC per week between the screening and treatment phases. Secondary outcomes included severity and duration of NLC, quality of life, and quality of sleep.

Results

Of the 166 volunteers, 72 (43%) were excluded, of whom 15 declined to participate and 57 did not meet the inclusion criteria. Of the 94 individuals (39% male; mean [SD] age, 64.9 [11.1] years) randomly assigned to magnesium oxide (48) or placebo (46), 6 did not complete the study protocol (3 in each group). Mean (SD) change of NLC was -3.41 (4.05) (from 7.84 [5.68] to 4.44 [5.66]) and -3.03 (4.53) (from 8.51 [5.20] to 5.48 [4.93]) per week in the magnesium oxide and placebo groups, respectively, a difference between groups of 0.38 (0.48) NLC per week (P = 0.67 in an intention-to-treat analysis). There were no between-group differences in the severity and duration of NLC, quality of life, or quality of sleep.

Conclusions and Relevance

Oral magnesium oxide was not superior to placebo for older adults experiencing NLC. The decrease in the mean number of NLC per week, from the screening to the treatment phase in both groups, is probably a placebo effect that may explain the wide use of magnesium for NLC.

### The role of oral magnesium supplements for the management of stable bronchial asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^06c566b7]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a chronic lung disease characterized by airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness of airway smooth muscles. There is growing evidence that magnesium may have a role in managing asthma through its dual effect as an anti-inflammatory and bronchodilating agent. To assess the efficacy of oral magnesium supplements in chronic asthmatic patients. In addition to searching through Clinicaltrials.gov/ and references for oral magnesium supplement studies, we performed a database search in Medline, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and Embase. We contacted the authors of the included trials to ask for additional information. We included randomized controlled trials that compared oral magnesium supplements versus placebo, in addition to standard asthma treatment in mild-moderate asthmatic adults and children (older than 6 years). Two reviewers independently performed the study selection, data abstraction, and the assessment of the risk of bias. Eight trials at moderate risk of bias enrolling a total of 917 patients were included. Oral magnesium improved FEV1 at week 8 (5.69 (L/min); 95% CI: 1.92, 9.46; I²: 45%). There was no significant improvement in FEV1 at other follow up periods. There was no significant change in FVC, Methacholine challenge test, the frequency of bronchodilator use, or symptoms score. There were no data on mortality or quality of life. Oral magnesium supplements may lead to improvement in FEV1 that was only demonstrated at eight weeks; but no effect on any other outcome. Until future evidence emerges, oral magnesium cannot be recommended as adjuvants to standard treatment for mild to moderate asthmatic individuals.

### Magnesium supplementation and blood pressure: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^3bbe4d4f]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Characteristics of Studies

presents the characteristics of the 38 eligible randomized controlled trials, including a total of 2709 participants, 1448 who received magnesium intervention and 1392 who received the placebo (131 participants were involved in crossover studies and received both magnesium intervention and placebo control). Participant ages ranged from 18 to 77 years. Most studies were conducted on both sexes, except for 2 that were restricted to men and 4 to women.

Five trials used a crossover design, whereas the remainder used a parallel design. Study intervention periods ranged from 4 to 24 weeks with a median duration of 12 weeks. All interventions used magnesium supplementation with elemental magnesium doses ranging from 82.3 to 637 mg, with a median dose of 365 mg. Twenty-seven studies included doses above the recommended dietary intake of magnesium for women (310–320 mg/d), and 9 exceeded the recommended dietary intake for men (400–420 mg/d). Magnesium supplementation included magnesium chloride (n = 7), magnesium citrate (n = 4), magnesium oxide (n = 8), magnesium aspartate hydrochloride (n = 8), magnesium pidolate (n = 4), magnesium chelate (n = 2), magnesium lactate (n = 4), magnesium hydroxide (n = 2), magnesium sulphate (n = 2), and magnesium diclycine (n = 1).

Seventeen trials included participants with hypertension, whereas 8 included participants with normotension. Of studies involving participants with hypertension, 9 included participants not taking BP-lowering medication within at least 1 month before the trial, whereas 6 included participants on BP-lowering medication. Eight trials included participants with hypomagnesemia (serum magnesium ≤ 0.74 mmol/L). Across these trials, BP measurements were conducted while participants were seated, supine, or standing, via 24-hour ambulatory BP or a combination of methods.

Bias in Studies

Risk of bias assessments are presented in, including individual domain evaluation and overall risk of bias. Of all studies included in the meta-analysis, 9 were evaluated as low risk, 25 as some concern, and 4 as high risk. Most studies resulted in some concerns due to missing information about randomization and concealment methods.

Funnel plots for SBP and DBP are presented in, respectively, and do not demonstrate asymmetry. The Egger test was also not statistically significant (SBP, P = 0.52; DBP, P = 0.97), indicating no evidence of asymmetry or publication bias.

### The role of nutritional supplements in the treatment of ADHD: what the evidence says [^88f04bce]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common behavioral disorder in children and adolescents and may persist into adulthood. Insufficient nutritional supply of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) and other components including various minerals has been suggested to play a role in the development of ADHD symptoms. This review presents the evidence regarding the role of nutritional PUFA, zinc, iron, and magnesium supplements in the treatment of ADHD with a focus on the critical evaluation of the relevant literature published from 2014 to April 2016. The evaluation of therapeutic nutritional LC-PUFA supplementation in ADHD has shown mixed and inconclusive results and at best marginal beneficial effects. The benefits of PUFAs are much smaller than the effect sizes observed for traditional pharmacological treatments of ADHD. The effectiveness of PUFA supplements in reducing medication dosage has been suggested but needs to be confirmed. Zinc, iron, and magnesium supplementation may reduce ADHD symptoms in children with or at high risk of deficiencies in these minerals. However, convincing evidence in this regard is lacking.

### Effects of magnesium citrate, magnesium oxide, and magnesium sulfate supplementation on arterial stiffness: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention trial [^52b83567]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In this RCT conducted in 164 individuals who were overweight or slightly obese, administering 450 mg of magnesium per day in an organic form (magnesium citrate) for 24 weeks did not change arterial stiffness or blood pressure. Furthermore, the inorganic formulations magnesium oxide and magnesium sulfate had similar nonsignificant effects on arterial stiffness and blood pressure. This indicates that magnesium supplements may not have beneficial effects on arterial stiffness, at least not in subjects with normal arterial stiffness values. It should be further elucidated whether long‐term oral magnesium supplementation is effective in individuals with increased arterial stiffness, such as patients with chronic kidney disease.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic insomnia disorder and obstructive sleep apnea [^ab15a74b]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD CPG — magnesium for chronic insomnia disorder reports randomized control trials (n = 158) using magnesium oxide 414 mg BID, magnesium oxide 403mg TID, or magnesium citrate 640mg q AM and 320 mg q HS for a duration of 20 days to 8 weeks, with two of the three RCTs including objective measures and being included in the meta-analysis (n = 55). Sleep onset latency was reduced by 17.36 minutes compared to placebo and was statistically significant, while total sleep time was increased by 16.06 minutes compared to placebo but was not statistically significant. The RCTs did not systematically collect data on adverse effects, though one RCT commented on soft stool in all its participants taking magnesium; overall quality of evidence was low to very low due to moderate to high risk of bias, and there may be some benefit to magnesium for sleep onset latency, but the evidence reviewed was not sufficient to definitively support this. Herbal supplements are not FDA regulated. The Work Group categorized this as Reviewed, New-added, stated that confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low, and decided on a Neither for nor against recommendation.

### Magnesium deficit? overlooked cause of low vitamin D status? [^f2a54cf5]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Study results

Deng et al. used two large National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys data sets to assess interactions between Mg intake, vitamin D status and outcome. According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM) classification, circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), the generally accepted indicator of vitamin D status, was within the deficit range (< 12 ng/ml) in 12% of participants and the insufficiency range (12 to 20 ng/ml) in 30%. Mean energy-adjusted total Mg intake (dietary and supplemental) was clearly below the recommended daily allowance, which is between 310 and 420 mg depending on age and gender. High Mg intake was associated with reduced risk of vitamin D deficit or insufficiency. Data also indicate an inverse association between circulating 25OHD and mortality, particularly cardiovascular mortality, among those with Mg intake above the median.

### Overview of dietary supplements on patients with type 2 diabetes [^8afd0f1f]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The primary approach for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) involves lifestyle modification and diet therapy along with pharmacologic interventions. Many patients are interested to identify nutritional supplements that may provide benefit in prevention and management of diabetes. However, the efficacy and safety of nutritional supplements such as chromium, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), vitamin D, zinc and magnesium in disease treatment is a worrying and controversial matter. In this narrative review, patients and health care providers are introduced to the effects of mentioned dietary supplements that may help in choosing or not choosing these supplements in treatment of diabetes.

Methods

This review was carried out using comprehensive and systematic literature reports on the dietary supplements in the management of diabetes. Empirical searches were conducted using Google Scholar, Science Direct and PubMed databases. Searches were also undertaken using keywords, in English, such as "chromium" OR "vitamin D" OR "omega-3 fatty acids" OR "zinc" OR "magnesium" in combination with "type 2 diabetes".

Results

The available evidence is insufficient to create a definite conclusion that nutritional supplements including chromium, n-3 PUFAs, vitamin D, zinc and magnesium might be beneficial for the prevention and treatment of T2DM and therefore, the general recommendation to use these supplements in the management of diabetes cannot be justified. The results of most studies lack uniformity across multiple aspects, including different dose and formation of supplements, duration, and subjects under intervention.

Conclusions

There is a need for well-designed, high quality, large and long-term studies to strengthen the available evidence and ensure the safety and efficacy of products.

### Magnesium for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease [^259924e9]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Magnesium is an essential mineral found in the body. It is naturally present in many foods and is also available as a dietary supplement. It serves as a cofactor in more than 300 enzymatic reactions, such as those responsible for regulating blood pressure, glycaemic control and lipid peroxidation. It is therefore also critical to the cardiovascular system. The adult body contains approximately 24 g of magnesium, with 50% to 60% present in bones with the rest being contained in soft tissues. Serum magnesium represents less than 1% of total body magnesium. In industrialised western countries, a low intake of magnesium often predisposes to a high prevalence of magnesium deficiency increasing the risk of cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death. This article aims to review of effect of magnesium deficiency on the cardiovascular system.

### Effects of magnesium citrate, magnesium oxide, and magnesium sulfate supplementation on arterial stiffness: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention trial [^070b5d8a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background Magnesium supplements may have beneficial effects on arterial stiffness. Yet, to our knowledge, no head-to-head comparison between various magnesium formulations in terms of effects on arterial stiffness has been performed. We assessed the effects of magnesium citrate supplementation on arterial stiffness and blood pressure and explored whether other formulations of magnesium have similar effects. Methods and Results In this randomized trial, subjects who were overweight and slightly obese received either magnesium citrate, magnesium oxide, magnesium sulfate, or placebo for 24 weeks. The total daily dose of magnesium was 450 mg/d. The primary outcome was carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity, which is the gold standard method for measuring arterial stiffness. Secondary outcomes included blood pressure and plasma and urine magnesium. Overall, 164 participants (mean ± SD age, 63.2 ± 6.8 years; 104 [63.4%] women) were included. In the intention-to-treat analysis, neither magnesium citrate nor the other formulations had an effect on carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity or blood pressure at 24 weeks compared with placebo. Magnesium citrate increased plasma (+0.04 mmol/L; 95% CI, +0.02 to +0.06 mmol/L) and urine magnesium (+3.12 mmol/24 h; 95% CI, +2.23 to +4.01 mmol/24 h) compared with placebo. Effects on plasma magnesium were similar among the magnesium supplementation groups, but magnesium citrate led to a more pronounced increase in 24-hour urinary magnesium excretion than magnesium oxide or magnesium sulfate. One serious adverse event was reported, which was considered unrelated to the study treatment. Conclusions Oral magnesium citrate supplementation for 24 weeks did not significantly change arterial stiffness or blood pressure. Magnesium oxide and magnesium sulfate had similar nonsignificant effects. Registration URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT03632590.

### Magnesium supplementation for migraine prophylaxis [^df7cf963]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Unit of analysis issues

The participant with episodic or chronic migraine, with or without aura, will serve as the unit of analysis. The level of randomization will be a key consideration, and we will account for repeated outcome observations. In instances where a single study yields multiple eligible comparisons for a given meta‐analysis, we will either aggregate groups to form a singular pairwise comparison or implement a reduction in sample size by partitioning any shared group into two or more groups. While the latter approach provides some means of adjusting the precision of the comparison, it does not fully address the correlation arising from the inclusion of identical participant sets in multiple comparisons. If we include studies with multiple arms, we will only use the information from the arms relevant to this review.

For cluster‐randomized controlled trials, the cluster, and not the individual participant, will be treated as the unit of analysis to mitigate unit‐of‐analysis errors, as specified in Section 23.1.1 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Should the effect measure for the cluster not be determined through appropriate methodologies in the included studies, we will inflate the standard error of the effect estimate (obtained from an analysis that ignores clustering) by multiplying it by the square root of the design effect. We will calculate this design effect using an intracluster (or intraclass) correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.02, consistent with the recommendations outlined in sections 23.1.4 and 23.1.5 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

Dealing with missing data

We will prioritize obtaining any missing data by reaching out to the authors of the selected studies, if this is possible. Our assessment of the risk of bias will include a careful review of key numerical data, such as details of the screening process, the number of participants randomized, and the characteristics of intention‐to‐treat, as‐treated, and per‐protocol groups. In this process, we will analyze attrition rates (e.g. dropouts, participants lost to follow‐up, and withdrawals) and critically evaluate concerns surrounding missing data and the methods used for imputation (such as last observation carried forward). Our primary analysis will be based solely on the data we have. However, in situations where missing data cannot be obtained and are considered to introduce significant bias, we will conduct a sensitivity analysis to explore how including such studies affects the overall findings.

### Effect of oral magnesium supplementation on physical performance in healthy elderly women involved in a weekly exercise program: a randomized controlled trial [^891fca11]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Magnesium deficiency is associated with poor physical performance, but no trials are available on how magnesium supplementation affects elderly people's physical performance.

Objective

The aim of our study was to investigate whether 12 wk of oral magnesium supplementation can improve physical performance in healthy elderly women.

Design

In a parallel-group, randomized controlled trial, 139 healthy women (mean ± SD age: 71.5 ± 5.2 y) attending a mild fitness program were randomly allocated to a treatment group (300 mg Mg/d; n = 62) or a control group (no placebo or intervention; n = 77) by using a computer-generated randomization sequence, and researchers were blinded to their grouping. After assessment at baseline and again after 12 wk, the primary outcome was a change in the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB); secondary outcomes were changes in peak torque isometric and isokinetic strength of the lower limbs and handgrip strength.

Results

A total of 124 participants allocated to the treatment (n = 53) or control (n = 71) group were considered in the final analysis. At baseline, the SPPB scores did not differ between the 2 groups. After 12 wk, the treated group had a significantly better total SPPB score (Δ = 0.41 ± 0.24 points; P = 0.03), chair stand times (Δ = -1.31 ± 0.33 s; P < 0.0001), and 4-m walking speeds (Δ = 0.14 ± 0.03 m/s; P = 0.006) than did the control group. These findings were more evident in participants with a magnesium dietary intake lower than the Recommended Dietary Allowance. No significant differences emerged for the secondary outcomes investigated, and no serious adverse effects were reported.

Conclusions

Daily magnesium oxide supplementation for 12 wk seems to improve physical performance in healthy elderly women. These findings suggest a role for magnesium supplementation in preventing or delaying the age-related decline in physical performance.

### Magnesium deficit? overlooked cause of low vitamin D status? [^b61b2f99]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The present study must be praised for bringing potential interactions between individual nutrients into the focus of interest. Because the intake of Mg is often inadequate and several other factors are also known to impair Mg supply (for example, diuretics use, diabetes mellitus, chronic alcohol consumption, stress factors), more attention should in future be paid to possible consequences of insufficient or deficient Mg supply in the general population. Further studies on the interactions between Mg supply and vitamin D status should include a more detailed assessment of individual Mg status (for example, by measuring biochemical parameters of Mg status or by adjusting statistical analysis for stress factors, diuretics use, alcohol consumption and concomitant diagnoses such as diabetes); a more detailed investigation of different components of the vitamin D-parathyroid hormone axis in general populations; clarification of the dose?response relationship; and the realization of randomized controlled trials to verify whether oral Mg is indeed able to improve vitamin D status and survival.

### The effect of magnesium supplementation on blood pressure in individuals with insulin resistance, prediabetes, or noncommunicable chronic diseases: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^a160442c]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Background: To our knowledge, the effect of magnesium supplementation on blood pressure (BP) in individuals with preclinical or noncommunicable diseases has not been previously investigated in a meta-analysis, and the findings from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been inconsistent. Objective: We sought to determine the pooled effect of magnesium supplementation on BP in participants with preclinical or noncommunicable diseases. Design: We identified RCTs that were published in English before May 2017 that examined the effect of magnesium supplementation on BP in individuals with preclinical or noncommunicable diseases through PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane, clinicaltrials.gov, SpringerLink, and Google Scholar databases as well as the reference lists from identified relevant articles. Random- and fixed-effects models were used to estimate the pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% CIs in changes in BP from baseline to the end of the trial in both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between the magnesium-supplementation group and the control group. Results: Eleven RCTs that included 543 participants with follow-up periods that ranged from 1 to 6 mo (mean: 3.6 mo) were included in this meta-analysis. The dose of elemental magnesium that was used in the trials ranged from 365 to 450 mg/d. All studies reported BP at baseline and the end of the trial. The weighted overall effects indicated that the magnesium-supplementation group had a significantly greater reduction in both SBP (SMD: -0.20; 95% CI: -0.37, -0.03) and DBP (SMD: -0.27; 95% CI: -0.52, -0.03) than did the control group. Magnesium supplementation resulted in a mean reduction of 4.18 mm Hg in SBP and 2.27 mm Hg in DBP. Conclusion: The pooled results suggest that magnesium supplementation significantly lowers BP in individuals with insulin resistance, prediabetes, or other noncommunicable chronic diseases.

### Magnesium supplementation for migraine prophylaxis [^e4997db9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Critical outcomes

Acute migraine attacks/migraine frequency: number of headache days in the past three months and after one month of treatment, measured by attack report form (diary) or as defined by the study authors. We will analyze the data as continuous data, with the primary measure being the mean change in score from baseline. We will use an effect estimate of 0.5 standard deviations to establish a minimally important clinical difference (MCID).
Headache duration: defined as the length of time a migraine attack lasts, assessed by the attack report form (diary). We will analyze the data as continuous data, with the primary measure being the mean change in score from baseline.
Adverse events (AEs): defined as the number of participants with any unfavorable symptoms that occurred during the study. We will include all AEs, such as diarrhea and gastrointestinal discomfort. We will summarize the types of AEs reported narratively, in order to avoid unit‐of‐analysis errors, as study participants may experience multiple adverse events. There is no reported threshold for dichotomous outcomes; therefore, we will consider the MCID for these outcomes as a relative risk reduction of at least 25%.

### Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: micronutrient supplementation [^bf30d041]. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2018). Medium credibility.

Nutrient supplementation and usual intakes — filling dietary gaps — are characterized by NHANES findings showing a high proportion of Americans with at risk intakes (> 25% with intakes < EAR) for vitamins A, C, D, and E and for calcium and magnesium without supplements, while smaller proportions had total usual intakes below the EAR for B vitamins, zinc, folate, iron, phosphorus, copper, and selenium (< 1%-3%); when adult users and nonusers are examined separately, users tend to have a lower prevalence of inadequate intakes from diet alone, and considering total intake (diet and supplements), users were much less likely than nonusers to have inadequate intakes of minerals — magnesium (21% vs 46%), selenium (12% vs 51%), copper (< 0.5% vs 20%), zinc (6% vs 13%), and iron (< 0.5% vs 8%) — and vitamins — folate (1% vs 14%), vitamin C (3% vs 48%), vitamin A (4% vs 58%), vitamin D (25% vs 96%), and vitamin E (5% vs 96%); however, although MVMMs provide substantial amounts of some micronutrients, they often lack key minerals such as potassium, calcium, and magnesium.

### Possible roles of magnesium on the immune system [^021974c4]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

During the last few years, magnesium (Mg) has been subject of research due to its functionality in the organism. It is one of the most important micronutrients, and therefore its role in biological systems has been extensively investigated. Particularly, Mg has a strong relation with the immune system, in both nonspecific and specific immune response, also known as innate and acquired immune response. The aim of this paper is to review the state of the art about the interactions between Mg and the immune system. We discuss the link between dietary Mg and inflammation, apoptosis and alterations in number and function of innate immune cell populations, described in animal models. Furthermore, the immune system can be compromised in human populations under certain circumstances, including athletes and elderly people. The importance of a balanced Mg homeostasis and its interaction with the immune system in these groups has also been reviewed. Although emerging data support the relevant role of Mg in the immune response, further research is needed; and special efforts should be made to establish the most adequate dose in nutritional supplements to reach beneficial effects on health.

### Nutrition therapy recommendations for the management of adults with diabetes [^1c8208a6]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Micronutrients and herbal supplements

There is no clear evidence of benefit from vitamin or mineral supplementation in people with diabetes who do not have underlying deficiencies. (C) o Routine supplementation with antioxidants, such as vitamins E and C and carotene, is not advised because of lack of evidence of efficacy and concern related to long-term safety. (A) o There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of micronutrients such as chromium, magnesium, and vitamin D to improve glycemic control in people with diabetes. (C) o There is insufficient evidence to support the use of cinnamon or other herbs/supplements for the treatment of diabetes. (C) o It is recommended that individualized meal planning include optimization of food choices to meet recommended dietary allowance/dietary reference intake for all micronutrients. (E)

There currently exists insufficient evidence of benefit from vitamin or mineral supplementation in people with or without diabetes in the absence of an underlying deficiency. Because uncontrolled diabetes is often associated with micronutrient deficiencies, people with diabetes should be aware of the importance of acquiring daily vitamin and mineral requirements from natural food sources and a balanced diet. For select groups of individuals such as the elderly, pregnant or lactating women, vegetarians, and those on calorie-restricted diets, a multivitamin supplement may be necessary.

While there has been significant interest in antioxidant supplementation as a treatment for diabetes, current evidence not only demonstrates a lack of benefit with respect to glycemic control and progression of complications, but also provides evidence of potential harm of vitamin E, carotene, and other antioxidant supplements.

Findings from supplement studies with micronutrients such as chromium, magnesium, and vitamin D are conflicting and confounded by differences in dosing, micronutrient levels achieved with supplementation, baseline micronutrient status, and/or methodologies used. A systematic review on the effect of chromium supplementation on glucose metabolism and lipids concluded that larger effects were more commonly observed in poor-quality studies and that evidence is limited by poor study quality and heterogeneity in methodology and results. Evidence from clinical studies evaluating magnesium and vitamin D supplementation to improve glycemic control in people with diabetes is likewise conflicting.

### Association among dietary supplement use, nutrient intake, and mortality among U.S. adults: a cohort study [^092384ee]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The health benefits and risks of dietary supplement use are controversial.

Objective

To evaluate the association among dietary supplement use, levels of nutrient intake from foods and supplements, and mortality among U.S. adults.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) data from 1999 to 2010, linked to National Death Index mortality data.

Participants

30 899 U.S. adults aged 20 years or older who answered questions on dietary supplement use.

Measurements

Dietary supplement use in the previous 30 days and nutrient intake from foods and supplements. Outcomes included mortality from all causes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer.

Results

During a median follow-up of 6.1 years, 3613 deaths occurred, including 945 CVD deaths and 805 cancer deaths. Ever-use of dietary supplements was not associated with mortality outcomes. Adequate intake (at or above the Estimated Average Requirement or the Adequate Intake level) of vitamin A, vitamin K, magnesium, zinc, and copper was associated with reduced all-cause or CVD mortality, but the associations were restricted to nutrient intake from foods. Excess intake of calcium was associated with increased risk for cancer death (above vs. at or below the Tolerable Upper Intake Level: multivariable-adjusted rate ratio, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.07 to 2.45]; multivariable-adjusted rate difference, 1.7 [CI, -0.1 to 3.5] deaths per 1000 person-years), and the association seemed to be related to calcium intake from supplements (≥ 1000 mg/d vs. no use: multivariable-adjusted rate ratio, 1.53 [CI, 1.04 to 2.25]; multivariable-adjusted rate difference, 1.5 [CI, -0.1 to 3.1] deaths per 1000 person-years) rather than foods.

Limitations

Results from observational data may be affected by residual confounding. Reporting of dietary supplement use is subject to recall bias.

Conclusion

Use of dietary supplements is not associated with mortality benefits among U.S. adults.

### Magnesium supplementation increases urine magnesium and citrate in stone formers with hypomagnesuria [^e2b1b7ea]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To compare the effects of magnesium repletion by a foods-alone approach or by magnesium supplementation on urinary magnesium and citrate excretion in patients with urine magnesium < 70 mg/day.

Methods

We reviewed medical records of patients in our stone prevention practice who were advised to start a magnesium supplement (Sup), 250–500 mg/day, or increase dietary magnesium consumption. We included adults with 24-hour urine magnesium (UMg) < 70 mg, those who received magnesium recommendations (corroborated by the dietitian's clinical notes), and those with a follow-up 24-hour urine collection ≤ 18 months. Urine results were assessed by group.

Results

Groups [No Sup (n = 74) and Sup (n = 56)] were not different for age, gender, stone history, malabsorption, or other clinical indices. All patients raised UMg (53–69 and 47–87 mg/day for No Sup and Sup, respectively); however, the increase was significantly higher in the Sup group. Moreover, while 88% of Sup patients achieved UMg ≥ 70 mg/day, only 58% in the No Sup group did so. Within-group increases in urine citrate were significant only in the Sup group.

Conclusion

Among patients with low UMg, both higher consumption from foods and magnesium supplementation significantly increased UMg. However, those who supplemented were significantly more likely to reach or exceed UMg 70 mg/day and achieved higher mean UMg. The change in urine citrate was significant only among those in the Sup group.

### Older adults' willingness to take magnesium to treat depression [^50b14e29]. Annals of Family Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Context

Depression affects up to 15% of community-dwelling older adults. Late-life depression is frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated. When depression in older adults is identified, up to 80% of treatment occurs in primary care. Currently available treatments have significant limitations (e.g., modest effectiveness, high costs, adverse effects, poor adherence, and social stigma), therefore additional treatment options are essential. Over the counter magnesium chloride is inexpensive, widely available, generally safe, well-absorbed, and was efficacious in prior studies, often within 2 weeks.

Objective

To collect background information on magnesium supplement use and acceptability in older adults with a depression.

Study Design

Online survey.

Dataset

National sample.

Population Studied

Adults 65 and older living in the United States currently experiencing symptoms of depression based on Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ- 2) results.

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was willingness to take magnesium supplements instead of prescription medication for the treatment of depression. Secondary measures included current supplement use, comfort level with taking magnesium to treat depression, and whether they think magnesium would help improve symptoms of depression.

Results

Of 153 respondents, 97 (63%) were female, 143 (93%) identified as white, and 130 (85%) were between the ages 65 and 75 years. 112 (73%) took a supplement daily, including 15 (10%) taking magnesium. 50 (33%) were currently being treated for depression. On a 4-point Likert scale ranging from "Strongly Agree" to "Strongly Disagree", 83% of respondents "Agreed" or "Strongly Agreed" in terms of their willingness to take magnesium instead of a prescription medication. A majority also "Agreed" or "Strongly Agreed" that they were willing (89%) and comfortable (89%) with taking magnesium to treat depression and also that it would improve symptoms of depression (73%). Women were more likely to agree with these statements (p < 0.05), but there were no differences based on age or current treatment for depression.

Conclusions

A majority of older community-dwelling adults are willing to take magnesium for the treatment of depression. Many adults are already taking at least 1 over the counter supplement daily. Further research is needed to determine the efficacy of magnesium supplements as an alternative treatment option in this population.

### Decreased magnesium status may mediate the increased cardiovascular risk associated with calcium supplementation [^e06d32f9]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Can supplemental calcium increase cardiovascular risk?

A meta-analyses of randomised controlled studies of calcium supplementation (some including concurrent modest intakes of vitamin D) has observed a modest increase in risk for vascular events in the calcium-supplemented subjects. Some recent observational epidemiology in prospective cohorts has also linked supplemental calcium to increased vascular risk. Yet, rather perplexingly, relatively high dietary intakes of calcium have been associated with cardiovascular protection, or a neutral outcome in this regard. Moreover, there are theoretical grounds for expecting that superior calcium nutrition could be protective for vascular health. High-calcium diets decrease secretion of parathyroid hormone; even mild secondary hyperparathyroidism, common in the elderly, is suspected to increase vascular risk. A high calcium intake also tends to suppress absorption of dietary phosphate by forming an insoluble complex with it; emerging data suggest that high phosphate intakes may increase cardiovascular risk, even in those with normal renal function. High calcium intakes have not been found to correlate with increased risk for vascular calcification. The acute vascular impact of the modest rise in serum calcium following a bolus oral dose of calcium citrate has been studied; relative to placebo, arterial stiffness declined and myocardial perfusion increased in the calcium group. However, the diurnal decline in blood pressure was not as high in calcium-supplemented subjects and a coagulation index (thromboelastography) increased.

What could explain the increased risk for vascular events associated specifically with calcium supplementation in some controlled studies? Even if subsequent analyses fail to confirm a net negative impact of calcium supplementation on vascular health — this issue is hotly debated and cannot be considered resolvedthe fact that calcium could be expected to protect the vasculature for certain reasons suggests that it must be exerting some countervailing negative effect even if its impact on vascular health is neutral.

The acute impact of bolus calcium on coagulation mechanisms, as noted above, merits further study. Also, a high calcium intake might increase secretion of renin — which increases cardiovascular riskvia the prohypertensive, pro-oxidative effects of angiotensin II — by suppressing renal synthesis of calcitriol. Only a few pertinent clinical studies are currently available in this regard, however, and this prediction requires more verification in clinical studies using realistic supplemental intakes of calcium. Moreover, this explanation leaves unexplained the seeming discrepancy between the apparent cardioprotection of dietary calcium versus the potential cardiotoxicity of supplemental calcium.

### Magnesium intake from food and supplements is associated with bone mineral density in healthy older white subjects [^bfb7f16e]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether magnesium intake from supplemental and dietary sources is associated with bone mineral density (BMD) in older men and women.

Design

Cross-sectional.

Setting

Memphis, Tennessee, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Participants

Two thousand thirty-eight older black and white men and women aged 70 to 79 at baseline enrolled in the Health, Aging and Body Composition Study.

Measurements

Dietary intake of magnesium was assessed using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire, and supplement data were collected based on a medication inventory. BMD of the whole body was obtained using a fan-beam densitometer. Additional covariates included age, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, alcohol use, physical activity, estrogen use, and supplemental calcium (Ca) and vitamin D use.

Results

In white, but not black, men and women, magnesium intake was positively associated with BMD of the whole body after adjustment for age, self-report of osteoporosis or fracture in adulthood, caloric intake, Ca and vitamin D intake, BMI, smoking status, alcohol intake, physical activity, thiazide diuretic use, and estrogen use in women (P = 0.05 for men and P = 0.005 for women). BMD was 0.04 g/cm2 higher in white women and 0.02 g/cm2 higher in white men in the highest than in the lowest quintile of magnesium intake.

Conclusion

Greater magnesium intake was significantly related to higher BMD in white women and men. The lack of association observed in black women and men may be related to differences in Ca regulation or in nutrient reporting.

### Alternative magnesium sulphate regimens for women with pre-eclampsia and eclampsia [^daa9c51c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Magnesium sulphate is the drug of choice for the prevention and treatment of women with eclampsia. Regimens for administration of this drug have evolved over the years, but there is no clarity on the comparative benefits or harm of alternative regimens. This is an update of a review first published in 2010.

Objectives

To assess if one magnesium sulphate regimen is better than another when used for the care of women with pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, or both, to reduce the risk of severe morbidity and mortality for the woman and her baby.

We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (29 April 2022), and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials and cluster-randomised trials comparing different regimens for administration of magnesium sulphate used in women with pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, or both. Comparisons included different dose regimens, intramuscular versus intravenous route for maintenance therapy, and different durations of therapy. We excluded studies with quasi-random or cross-over designs. We included abstracts of conference proceedings if compliant with the trustworthiness assessment.

Data Collection and Analysis

For this update, two review authors assessed trials for inclusion, performed risk of bias assessment, and extracted data. We checked data for accuracy. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

For this update, a total of 16 trials (3020 women) met our inclusion criteria: four trials (409 women) compared regimens for women with eclampsia, and 12 trials (2611 women) compared regimens for women with pre-eclampsia. Most of the included trials had small sample sizes and were conducted in low- and middle-income countries. Eleven trials reported adequate randomisation and allocation concealment. Blinding of participants and clinicians was not possible in most trials. The included studies were for the most part at low risk of attrition and reporting bias. Treatment of women with eclampsia (four comparisons) One trial compared a loading dose-alone regimen with a loading dose plus maintenance dose regimen (80 women). It is uncertain whether either regimen has an effect on the risk of recurrence of convulsions or maternal death (very low-certainty evidence). One trial compared a lower-dose regimen with standard-dose regimen over 24 hours (72 women). It is uncertain whether either regimen has an effect on the risk of recurrence of convulsion, severe morbidity, perinatal death, or maternal death (very low-certainty evidence). One trial (137 women) compared intravenous (IV) versus standard intramuscular (IM) maintenance regimen. It is uncertain whether either route has an effect on recurrence of convulsions, death of the baby before discharge (stillbirth and neonatal death), or maternal death (very low-certainty evidence). One trial (120 women) compared a short maintenance regimen with a standard (24 hours after birth) maintenance regimen. It is uncertain whether the duration of the maintenance regimen has an effect on recurrence of convulsions, severe morbidity, or side effects such as nausea and respiratory failure. A short maintenance regimen may reduce the risk of flushing when compared to a standard 24 hours maintenance regimen (risk ratio (RR) 0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.93; 1 trial, 120 women; low-certainty evidence). Many of our prespecified critical outcomes were not reported in the included trials. Prevention of eclampsia for women with pre-eclampsia (five comparisons) Two trials (462 women) compared loading dose alone with loading dose plus maintenance therapy. Low-certainty evidence suggests an uncertain effect with either regimen on the risk of eclampsia (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.61 to 6.54; 2 trials, 462 women) or perinatal death (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.36; 2 trials, 462 women). One small trial (17 women) compared an IV versus IM maintenance regimen for 24 hours. It is uncertain whether IV or IM maintenance regimen has an effect on eclampsia or stillbirth (very low-certainty evidence). Four trials (1713 women) compared short postpartum maintenance regimens with continuing for 24 hours after birth. Low-certainty evidence suggests there may be a wide range of benefit or harm between groups regarding eclampsia (RR 1.99, 95% CI 0.18 to 21.87; 4 trials, 1713 women). Low-certainty evidence suggests there may be little or no effect on severe morbidity (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.29; 2 trials, 1233 women) or side effects such as respiratory depression (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.61; 2 trials, 1424 women). Three trials (185 women) compared a higher-dose maintenance regimen versus a lower-dose maintenance regimen. It is uncertain whether either regimen has an effect on eclampsia (very low-certainty evidence). Low-certainty evidence suggests that a higher-dose maintenance regimen has little or no effect on side effects when compared to a lower-dose regimen (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.01; 1 trial 62 women). One trial (200 women) compared a maintenance regimen by continuous infusion versus a serial IV bolus regimen. It is uncertain whether the duration of the maintenance regimen has an effect on eclampsia, side effects, perinatal death, maternal death, or other neonatal morbidity (very low-certainty evidence). Many of our prespecified critical outcomes were not reported in the included trials.

Authors' Conclusions

Despite the number of trials evaluating various magnesium sulphate regimens for eclampsia prophylaxis and treatment, there is still no compelling evidence that one particular regimen is more effective than another. Well-designed randomised controlled trials are needed to answer this question.

### Magnesium biology [^cd2231b1]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Bone and liver have been demonstrated to act as major Mg 2+ stores in the body. Indeed, in vitro and in vivo studies showed that osteoclast activity is increased upon decreased extracellular Mg 2+ concentrations. Moreover, recent data demonstrated that defects in liver Mg 2+ homeostasis directly affect serum Mg levels. Together these results point towards an involvement of bones and liver in the overall body Mg 2+ homeostasis, which is why there has been a long-running discussion around the ideal determination of whole-body Mg 2+ levels. Since only about 1%–2% of the whole-body Mg 2+ is present in serum, it has been suggested that soft tissues and bones can be depleted of Mg 2+, even if serum Mg 2+ is normal. However, the clinical relevance of these lower tissue Mg 2+ contents is unclear.

Consumption and supplementation of magnesium in health and disease

The daily recommended dietary allowance for Mg 2+ in adults is about 400 mg for males and 310 mg for females, which increases to 350 mg during pregnancy. According to a report from the European Food Safety Authority combining data from 13 dietary surveys conducted in the European Union, the average Mg 2+ intake in these studies ranged from 232 to 439 mg/day for adults, which suggests that the majority of the population ingests sufficient Mg 2+. Nevertheless, a trend towards the use of Mg 2+ supplementation can be observed in recent years. Many claim that Mg 2+ supplementation helps with sleep, muscle cramps and anxiety. Several meta-analyses and reviews conclude that there is not enough scientific evidence to prove that these claims are true in healthy individuals. However, Mg 2+ supplementation can be of therapeutic use in patients suffering from hypomagnesemia. In healthy individuals, increased ingestion of Mg 2+ poses little risk. In the case of increased ingestion, the intestinal absorption is decreased, while the renal excretion rate can increase up to 100% to balance Mg 2+ levels. Still, it should be noted that extremely high doses of Mg 2+ supplementation can lead to symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea and abdominal cramping, but will resolve once the Mg 2+ has been digested.

### Effects of oral magnesium supplementation on glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis of randomized double-blind controlled trials [^cb591ea5]. Diabetic Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Aims

The aim of this study was to assess the evidence on the effect of oral magnesium supplementation on glycaemic control in patients with Type 2 diabetes.

Methods

We searched the electronic databases of medline, embase and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register up to January 2005. We identified nine randomized double-blind controlled trials with a total of 370 patients with Type 2 diabetes and of duration 4–16 weeks. The median dose of oral magnesium supplementation was 15 mmol/day (360 mg/day) in the treatment groups. The primary outcome was glycaemic control, as measured by glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) or fasting blood glucose levels; the secondary outcomes included body mass index, blood pressure (BP) and lipids. Using a random-effects model, we calculated the weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI).

Results

After a median duration of 12 weeks, the weighted mean post-intervention fasting glucose was significantly lower in the treatment groups compared with the placebo groups [-0.56 mmol/l (95% CI, -1.10 to -0.01); P for heterogeneity = 0.02]. The difference in post-intervention HbA(1c) between magnesium supplementation groups and control groups was not significant [-0.31% (95% CI, -0.81 to 0.19); P for heterogeneity = 0.10]. Neither systolic nor diastolic BP was significantly changed. Magnesium supplementation increased on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels [0.08 mmol/l (95% CI, 0.03 to 0.14); P for heterogeneity = 0.36] but had no effect on total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglyceride.

Conclusions

Oral magnesium supplementation for 4–16 weeks may be effective in reducing plasma fasting glucose levels and raising HDL cholesterol in patients with Type 2 diabetes, although the long-term benefits and safety of magnesium treatment on glycaemic control remain to be determined.

### British dietetic association guidelines for the dietary management of chronic constipation in adults [^57436238]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Food Supplements

Recommendation statements were generated for magnesium oxide supplements, senna supplements, and kiwifruit supplements. No statements were generated for any vitamin supplements due to a lack of evidence.

4.1 Magnesium Oxide Supplements

Statements on magnesium oxide supplements were derived from the evidence generated in a systematic review and meta‐analysis of two RCTs that included 94 people with chronic constipation and investigated the effect of 1.5 g/day of magnesium oxide supplements for 4 weeks.

Two RCTs, including 94 people with chronic constipation, investigated the effect of magnesium oxide supplements in symptomatic response to treatment measured as a binary outcome. Overall, magnesium oxide supplements increased the likelihood of a beneficial response to treatment by 232% compared to control (RR 3.32, 95% CI 1.59, 6.92).

Two RCTs, including 93 people with chronic constipation, investigated the effect of magnesium oxide supplements on stool frequency and consistency compared to control. Overall, magnesium oxide supplements significantly increased stool frequency by 3.7 complete spontaneous bowel movements/week compared to control (95% CI 1.41, 6.03). Magnesium oxide supplements also significantly softened stool consistency as evidenced by a 1.14 point (95% CI 0.42, 1.79) increase in the Bristol Stool Form Scale. The magnitude of these effect sizes is large and clinically meaningful.

Two RCTs, including 93 people with chronic constipation, investigated the effect of magnesium oxide supplements on global symptoms of constipation using the Constipation Scoring System questionnaire, which provides scores ranging from 0 to 30 (higher score, worse symptoms). Overall, magnesium oxide supplements significantly reduced global symptoms of constipation by −3.2 points, compared to control (95% CI 1.8, 4.7 points).

Two RCTs, including 93 people with chronic constipation, investigated the effect of magnesium oxide supplements on the severity of straining and a sense of incomplete evacuation using a 5‐point scale (higher score, worse symptoms). Overall, magnesium oxide supplements significantly reduced the severity of both straining (MD −1.1, 95% CI −1.6, −0.5) and a sense of incomplete evacuation (MD −0.9, 95% CI −1.2, −0.6), compared to the control.

### Subclinical magnesium deficiency: a principal driver of cardiovascular disease and a public health crisis [^291762c4]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

'Normal' serum magnesium levels

0.75–0.95 mmol/L

A serum magnesium < 0.82 mmol/L (2.0 mg/dL) with a 24-hour urinary magnesium excretion of 40–80 mg/day is highly suggestive of magnesium deficiency.
One group of experts has recommended magnesium supplementation in subjects experiencing symptoms that reflect magnesium deficiency if the serum level is below 0.9 mmol/L, with levels less than 0.8 mmol/L necessitating magnesium.
Serum magnesium levels above 0.95 mmol/L may indicate hypermagnesaemia.

### Therapeutic uses of magnesium [^4e89ebcb]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Magnesium is an essential mineral for optimal metabolic function. Research has shown that the mineral content of magnesium in food sources is declining, and that magnesium depletion has been detected in persons with some chronic diseases. This has led to an increased awareness of proper magnesium intake and its potential therapeutic role in a number of medical conditions. Studies have shown the effectiveness of magnesium in eclampsia and preeclampsia, arrhythmia, severe asthma, and migraine. Other areas that have shown promising results include lowering the risk of metabolic syndrome, improving glucose and insulin metabolism, relieving symptoms of dysmenorrhea, and alleviating leg cramps in women who are pregnant. The use of magnesium for constipation and dyspepsia are accepted as standard care despite limited evidence. Although it is safe in selected patients at appropriate dosages, magnesium may cause adverse effects or death at high dosages. Because magnesium is excreted renally, it should be used with caution in patients with kidney disease. Food sources of magnesium include green leafy vegetables, nuts, legumes, and whole grains.

### Magnesium supplementation for migraine prophylaxis [^f61d1493]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Reporting bias assessment

To reduce reporting bias, we will perform an extensive literature search without any restrictions on publication date or language. We will also use study protocols and trial registrations to identify potential selective reporting in the studies. If an outcome is reported in at least 10 studies, we will use funnel plots to evaluate small‐study effects. Funnel plot asymmetry can be for a variety of reasons, including true variations in effect size by study size, poor study design leading to bias in smaller studies, and selective non‐reporting. Therefore, we will interpret these plots cautiously. Following the recommendations in Chapter 13 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, we will not conduct statistical tests for funnel plot asymmetry due to their typically low power.

Synthesis methods

We will conduct all data synthesis using Review Manager. We intend to perform a meta‐analysis only when we determine that the participants, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes are similar enough to yield a clinically significant result. Our main analysis will include all studies, irrespective of their assessed risk of bias. We will primarily synthesize data using the random‐effects model, given the anticipated clinical diversity. We will employ the Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) estimator to calculate the variance between trials. To determine the confidence interval for the meta‐analysis effect estimate, we will apply the Hartung‐Knapp‐Sidik‐Jonkman method when we have at least three studies and the heterogeneity estimate is greater than zero. In all other cases — for example, with pooled analyses of only two studies or a heterogeneity estimate of zero — we will use the Wald‐type method. When interpreting random‐effects meta‐analyses, we will consider the entire distribution of effects and present confidence intervals. Our statistical analyses will adhere to the guidelines outlined in Chapter 10 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. If a meta‐analysis is not feasible, we will summarize the findings using narrative synthesis, following the Synthesis Without Meta‐analysis guidelines, rather than a pooled statistical approach. We will follow Chapter 12 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We will perform subgroup analyses using the methodology described by Deeks and colleagues, as recommended in Section 10.11.3 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

### Nonprescription magnesium supplement use and risk of heart failure in patients with diabetes: a target trial emulation [^28c7b683]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Third, given the vast spectrum of magnesium supplements available in the market, we cannot ascertain the amount of elemental magnesium contained in the supplement being consumed by the patient. Besides, our study generalizability may be limited to older men with diabetes given the demographics of the veteran population.

Conversely, the strengths of the study include using a national electronic clinical database that contains a large, ethnically diverse veteran patient population with an extensive list of clinical and laboratory covariates that provided a comprehensive clinical picture of the study cohort, which allowed us to detect small but meaningful associations related to magnesium supplement use.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our study showed that long‐term magnesium supplementation was associated with a lower risk of HF and MACE in patients with diabetes. The potential benefits of magnesium supplement use should be further confirmed in an RCT.

### Possible effects of the dietary supplement magnesium… [^14d66791]. ClinicalTrials (2024). Medium credibility.

Possible Effects of the Dietary Supplement Magnesium Compared to PlaceboClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview The goal of this clinical trial was to investigate possible outcomes of the nutritional supplement magnesium compared to placebo in healthy, working adults. The main questions it aimed to answer were:

- Are there differences in ratings of health, stress, well-being and work environment indicators between individuals intaking 375 mg magnesium compared to placebo.
- Are there differences in hearing, measured with hearing tests between those receiving 375 mg magnesium compared to placebo. Participants were asked to ingest 375 mg magnesium or placebo daily for 3 months. Researchers compared the group ingesting magnesium with the group ingesting placebo pills to see if there were any differences in for example self-rated health, recovery, wellbeing, etc.

Summary: The aim of the sub-study was to investigate possible beneficial effects of magnesium as a nutritional supplement regarding self-reported health, ill-health, pain, hearing, fatigue, signs of long term stress and more. The study was designed as a double-blind placebo-randomized controlled study, meaning that each enrolled individual was randomized to either 375 mg magnesium or placebo pills. Clinical hearing tests, blood pressure, pulse and creatinine were conducted and collected. Extensive questionnaires were distributed at baseline and after approximately 3 months of daily pill intake in order to evaluate possible effects. All participants were adults and healthy enough to work. Previous research studies have shown that magnesium has promising effects to counteract or mitigate for instance headache/migraine, muscle cramps, high blood pressure, asthma as well as hearing problems such as tinnitus and sound sensitivity.

Magnesium deficiency is related to reduced immune function and physical symptoms such as migraine, muscle cramps, osteoporosis and high blood pressure/metabolic syndrome. The primary objective with the study was to investigate if there were differences between the treatment group and the control group over time in health-related outcomes, recovery and well-being. The present study was conducted as a separate study within a larger intervention study for employees at 21 schools in Stockholm, Sweden. The purpose of the larger intervention study was to evaluate possible effects of systematic interventions for health promotion and work environment improvements, as well as to counteract harmful stress and long-term sick-leave. Employees could choose to participate in the larger intervention study, the sub study about magnesium/placebo, both or none of them.

### Magnesium intake and incidence of pancreatic cancer: the VITamins and lifestyle study [^1a6dae0c]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Supplement use assessment

Data on supplement use were collected using items of the VITAL questionnaire that covered supplement use during the 10 years before baseline. For multivitamin use, participants were asked about frequency (times per week) and duration of use over the previous 10 years, and either selected one of 16 common brand names or provided dose information on vitamins and minerals in the brand they used. For individual supplements and other combinations (e.g. magnesium plus calcium), closed-ended questions were used to enquire about current vs past use, frequency and duration of use, and average dose per day. The 10-year average daily supplemental intake of each nutrient was computed as (dose used per day) × (number of days used per week/7) × (number of years used/10), and summed over multivitamin intake and individual nutrient supplemental intake.

The VITAL supplement study questionnaire was validated by a study of 220 participants by comparing it with repeated administration of the questionnaire 3 months after baseline and a detailed home interview and supplement inventory. Excellent reliability of the questionnaire on mean supplementary magnesium intake over the past 10 years administered at baseline and 3 months later was documented with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.74 and a correlation of 0.69 for current supplemental magnesium intake from the questionnaire compared with the in-home interview and transcription of supplement bottle labels.

Covariate assessment

Participants provided information on personal characteristics including age, gender, ethnicity (White and non-White), education, BMI, recreational physical activity, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, family history of pancreatic cancer, and medical history as part of the baseline questionnaire. The average total metabolic equivalent (MET) hours per week over the past 10 years were estimated based on duration, frequency, and published energy expenditure for different activities in the Compendium of Physical Activities. Smokers were classified as never, current, quit 10 years ago or longer, or quit < 10 years ago. Duration and doses of smoking were estimated by the reported number of years of smoking and by the usual number of cigarettes smoked per day, respectively. Pack-years were computed as duration × cigarettes per day/20. Alcohol consumption and intakes of energy, total calcium, selenium, and long-chain omega-3 fatty acids were categorised into tertiles. Diabetes mellitus status, family history of pancreatic cancer, and NSAID use were dichotomised (yes or no).

### Magnesium deficit? overlooked cause of low vitamin D status? [^825668ff]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Vitamin D status and its predictors

The present data are consistent with the assumption that deficient vitamin D levels are an important health issue that may affect not only musculoskeletal health but also a wide range of acute and chronic diseases. The high prevalence of deficient 25OHD blood levels in the population is believed to be primarily due to inadequate vitamin D synthesis in the skin, together with inadequate dietary intake. However, circulating 25OHD levels also depend on body weight and genetic factors, and a significant portion of the variance in circulating 25OHD remains unexplained at present. Therefore, Deng et al. are to be commended for investigating potential interactions between Mg and vitamin D status. Especially with regard to vitamin D, there is still ongoing debate regarding the optimal oral intake and the adequate circulating 25OHD level. The IOM recommends a daily vitamin D intake of 600 international units and considers circulating 25OHD levels of 20 to 50 ng/ml as adequate, and 25OHD levels above 50 ng/ml as potentially harmful. However, according to the Endocrine Society, the circulating 25OHD level should be within the range of 30 to 100 ng/ml. To raise the 25OHD level consistently above 30 ng/ml, they recommend a daily vitamin D intake of 1,500 to 2,000 international units.

Treatment of magnesium deficiency

One group of authors concluded: 'When magnesium substitution is started, the minimum dose to be applied is 600 mg magnesium per day. The therapy should proceed for more than one month, and then continue with a dose that holds the serum value not lower than 0.9 mmol/L magnesium'. The authors noted that using a cut-off of 0.75 mmol/L for magnesium deficiency misses 50% of those with true magnesium deficiency.

### The effect of magnesium supplementation on vascular calcification in CKD: a randomized clinical trial (MAGiCAL-CKD) [^bea0454c]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Significance Statement

Magnesium prevents vascular calcification in animals with CKD. In addition, lower serum magnesium is associated with higher risk of cardiovascular events in CKD. In a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, the authors investigated the effects of magnesium supplementation versus placebo on vascular calcification in patients with predialysis CKD. Despite significant increases in plasma magnesium among study participants who received magnesium compared with those who received placebo, magnesium supplementation did not slow the progression of vascular calcification in study participants. In addition, the findings showed a higher incidence of serious adverse events in the group treated with magnesium. Magnesium supplementation alone was not sufficient to delay progression of vascular calcification, and other therapeutic strategies might be necessary to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in CKD.

Background

Elevated levels of serum magnesium are associated with lower risk of cardiovascular events in patients with CKD. Magnesium also prevents vascular calcification in animal models of CKD.

Methods

To investigate whether oral magnesium supplementation would slow the progression of vascular calcification in CKD, we conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, clinical trial. We enrolled 148 subjects with an eGFR between 15 and 45 ml/min and randomly assigned them to receive oral magnesium hydroxide 15 mmol twice daily or matching placebo for 12 months. The primary end point was the between-groups difference in coronary artery calcification (CAC) score after 12 months adjusted for baseline CAC score, age, and diabetes mellitus.

Results

A total of 75 subjects received magnesium and 73 received placebo. Median eGFR was 25 ml/min at baseline, and median baseline CAC scores were 413 and 274 in the magnesium and placebo groups, respectively. Despite plasma magnesium increasing significantly during the trial in the magnesium group, the baseline-adjusted CAC scores did not differ significantly between the two groups after 12 months. Prespecified subgroup analyses according to CAC > 0 at baseline, diabetes mellitus, or tertiles of serum calcification propensity did not significantly alter the main results. Among subjects who experienced gastrointestinal adverse effects, 35 were in the group receiving magnesium treatment versus nine in the placebo group. Five deaths and six cardiovascular events occurred in the magnesium group compared with two deaths and no cardiovascular events in the placebo group.

Conclusions

Magnesium supplementation for 12 months did not slow the progression of vascular calcification in CKD, despite a significant increase in plasma magnesium.

### Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: micronutrient supplementation [^e22f6b1c]. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2018). Medium credibility.

Upper intake level exceedance with supplementation — adults and children — shows that adults typically do not have usual intakes that exceed the UL from foods alone; however, micronutrient supplement users have an increased likelihood of intakes above the UL for iron (9%), zinc (9%), folic acid (7%), calcium (6%), magnesium (6%), vitamin B-6 (3.5%), vitamin A (3%), and vitamin C (1.6%); among children, use of dietary supplements in general increases the prevalence of usual nutrient intakes above the UL for iron, zinc, copper, selenium, folate, and vitamins A and C, and of most concern are 2- to 8-year-old micronutrient supplement users who exceeded the UL for zinc (28%), folic acid (71%), and vitamin A (72%).

### Magnesium supplementation and blood pressure: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^3dbb5c83]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Pooled results from 17 studies in participants with hypertension showed a −2.96/−2.10 mm Hg reduction in SBP and DBP. The results demonstrated that while untreated hypertensive participants achieved significant reductions in DBP (1.88 mm Hg), only those on BP-lowering medication achieved significant reductions in both SBP and DBP, with reductions of −7.68 and −2.96 mm Hg, respectively, at the magnesium dose provided. The reduction, particularly in SBP among this population, is clinically important, with a recent meta-analysis finding that a 5 mm Hg reduction in SBP reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events by ≈10%.

Although the benefits of magnesium were demonstrated in participants with hypertension on BP-lowering medication, the meta-analysis found that magnesium intake was not effective at reducing SBP and DBP among participants with normotension. This builds on the categorization systematic review of 49 studies by Rosanoff et althat found similar results, including that magnesium therapy decreased BP in treated hypertensive participants, although no changes were observed in normotensive individuals. Unlike the current meta-analysis, the previous review did not quantifiably determine BP changes.

It is suggested that systemic magnesium depletion promotes increased BP in patients with hypertension through increasing vascular and sympathetic tone, altering sodium and potassium handling, enhancing the inflammatory process, and impairing vascular cell metabolism and dysfunction. Diuretics, prescribed as a first-line pharmacological therapy for hypertension, have been shown to exacerbate magnesium depletion among patients with hypertension through increased renal magnesium loss. Of the 6 studies included in this review that assessed patients with hypertension on BP-lowering medication, 4 studies (Paolisso et al, Saito et al, Guerrero-Romero et al, and Henderson et al) included participants on diuretics (n = 66). This may explain why participants with hypertension taking BP-lowering medication demonstrated greater BP benefits of −7.68/−2.96 mm Hg when receiving magnesium treatment.

### Hypomagnesemia and cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes [^43d28d5a]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Challenges of magnesium supplementation

To obtain beneficial CVD effects of Mg 2+ supplementation, serum Mg 2+ needs to increase in people who have hypomagnesemia and stay within the physiological range between 0.7 and 1.05 mmol/L. In people with diabetes who were screened for hypomagnesemia (serum Mg 2+ ≤ 0.74 mmol/L), Mg 2+ increased by 0.18 mmol/L (from baseline 0.62 to 0.81 mmol/L), whereas controls increased 0.08 mmol/L (from baseline 0.61 to 0.68 mmol/L) after 4 months of magnesium chloride (equivalent to 40 mg/day elemental Mg 2+) supplementation. In another clinical trial, consisting of 47 T2D with hypomagnesemia (serum levels < 0.74 mmol/L) Mg 2+ increased only by 0.02 mmol/L (from baseline 0.71 to 0.73 mmol/L). In studies that were not selected for hypomagnesemia, serum/plasma Mg 2+ levels were not affected or increased with a maximum of 0.08 mmol/L (0.2 mg/dL) by Mg 2+ supplementation. The clinical studies that show a small but significant increase in serum/plasma Mg 2+ did result in a beneficial effect on CVD markers. This suggests that even Mg 2+ supplementation that causes a small increase in serum/plasma Mg 2+ may result in favorable outcomes. In theory, Mg 2+ supplementation in people with hypomagnesemia could result in more pronounced changes, but studies that specifically target people with low Mg 2+ levels are lacking.
