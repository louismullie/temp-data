## Question

Pseudo barter like syndrome drug induced

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about drug-induced pseudo-Bartter syndrome, including its definition, pathophysiology, implicated agents, clinical presentation, diagnostic approach, management, prognosis, and prevention, with explicit self-verification throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining pseudo-Bartter syndrome and distinguishing it from genetic Bartter syndromes. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology, especially RAAS activation and renal tubular effects. Next, I will enumerate the drugs most convincingly implicated and double-check FDA labeling. After that, I need to characterize the clinical and laboratory phenotype. Then, I should construct a diagnostic algorithm and explicitly check for pitfalls and mimics. Next, I will outline management principles, including electrolyte correction, drug withdrawal, and adjuncts, and I should confirm whether NSAIDs are appropriate here. Finally, I will review prognosis, prevention, and special populations, and close with a concise synthesis that ties mechanism to management.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't conflate entities. Pseudo-Bartter syndrome is an acquired, drug-induced renal tubulopathy that mimics genetic Bartter syndromes, presenting with hypokalemia, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, and secondary hyperaldosteronism, but without intrinsic tubular channel mutations, and it typically resolves after removal of the offending agent, which distinguishes it from hereditary Bartter/Gitelman syndromes that reflect fixed transporter/channel defects [^112EH5sv] [^113LiTPe] [^115N8VZf] [^111c5Vj5].

> Now, I need to check the pathophysiology carefully. The unifying mechanism is drug-induced renal salt wasting that triggers volume depletion, activating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which drives kaliuresis and hydrogen ion secretion, producing hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. In some cases, direct tubular toxicity impairs electrolyte reabsorption, amplifying the salt-wasting phenotype, and this is well described with polymyxins and loop diuretics in particular [^112EH5sv] [^113LiTPe] [^115N8VZf] [^114bcob6].

> Hold on, let me verify which drugs are most solidly implicated. Polymyxins are repeatedly linked: colistin and polymyxin B both have FDA labeling explicitly warning about renal tubulopathy with a pseudo-Bartter phenotype characterized by hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and normal blood pressure, with resolution after drug discontinuation; case reports show recurrence on rechallenge, strengthening causality, and loop diuretics can precipitate a similar picture via chronic natriuresis and RAAS activation, with an autopsy case documenting pseudo-Bartter physiology from furosemide plus diet pills, and aminoglycosides are also recognized precipitants in the literature [^112EH5sv] [^113LiTPe] [^115N8VZf] [^1167sVc5] [^116kivnC] [^1133Geru].

> I will now examine the clinical phenotype to ensure I'm not missing atypical features. Patients typically present with muscle weakness, fatigue, polyuria, and thirst, with laboratory studies showing hypokalemia, hypochloremia, metabolic alkalosis, elevated renin and aldosterone, and often hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia. Blood pressure is usually normal or low, and urine studies may show inappropriate renal potassium wasting with high urine NaCl excretion, consistent with tubulopathy rather than extrarenal losses [^112EH5sv] [^113LiTPe] [^115N8VZf] [^1167sVc5].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach so I don't overcall genetic testing prematurely. The key is to correlate clinical features with labs showing hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis and high RAAS activity, then actively search for culprit drugs. Urine chloride helps distinguish chloride-responsive from chloride-unresponsive alkaloses, and in suspected Bartter/Gitelman mimics, a thiazide test can help differentiate Gitelman (blunted response) from Bartter or pseudo-Bartter (preserved or augmented response), though I should confirm that this test is validated in the right phenotypic context and not overinterpreted in atypical cases. Ultimately, if the phenotype persists after drug withdrawal, targeted genetic testing for Bartter/Gitelman genes is reasonable to exclude hereditary disease [^112ayWDV] [^111c5Vj5] [^112jD7gh] [^114bcob6].

> Hold on, I should verify common mimics and pitfalls so I don't anchor on a single diagnosis. Cystic fibrosis can produce a pseudo-Bartter picture via sweat chloride losses and pendrin-mediated renal chloride wasting, congenital chloride diarrhea can mimic Bartter/Gitelman but shows high fecal chloride, and surreptitious diuretic use can reproduce the same labs. Careful history, stool chloride, and, when needed, CFTR testing help avoid misclassification, and I need to remember that pseudo-Bartter from eating disorders reflects chronic vomiting/laxative abuse rather than a primary drug effect, which is pathophysiologically related but etiologically distinct [^114bcob6] [^114DTuFs] [^116rxHin] [^113Ey4rK].

> Next, I should review management and make sure I'm not missing a critical step. The cornerstone is immediate discontinuation of the offending drug, followed by aggressive correction of volume and electrolytes, typically with isotonic saline and potassium chloride, plus magnesium and calcium as indicated; I initially thought NSAIDs might be helpful given their use in genetic Bartter/Gitelman, but wait, let me verify — NSAIDs are used in hereditary salt-losing tubulopathies to blunt prostaglandin-driven salt wasting, yet in drug-induced pseudo-Bartter the primary driver is the offending agent rather than endogenous prostaglandin excess, so NSAIDs are not routinely indicated and may add nephrotoxic risk; thus, the emphasis should remain on drug cessation and electrolyte repletion, with close monitoring until RAAS activity normalizes and electrolytes stabilize [^112EH5sv] [^113LiTPe] [^115N8VZf] [^1167sVc5] [^115bhrBv].

> I should double-check prognosis and prevention so counseling is accurate. Most cases resolve fully within days to weeks after stopping the culprit drug and correcting electrolytes, though persistence should prompt reconsideration of incomplete withdrawal, ongoing losses, or an underlying genetic tubulopathy. Prevention hinges on judicious use of high-risk agents, baseline and serial electrolyte monitoring during therapy, and early recognition of the syndrome to avoid delays in withdrawal and correction [^112EH5sv] [^113LiTPe] [^115N8VZf].

> But wait, what about special populations and edge cases. In pediatrics, cystic fibrosis–related pseudo-Bartter is a key consideration and may be the presenting manifestation of CF, so sweat testing and CFTR genetics are important when the phenotype appears in infants or young children. In adults with eating disorders, pseudo-Bartter physiology from purging can lead to marked edema on refeeding, which requires anticipatory guidance and careful electrolyte management rather than diuretic escalation. And in critically ill patients on polymyxins, proactive electrolyte surveillance is essential given the frequency and severity of tubulopathy [^115N8VZf] [^1139VgkX] [^113Ey4rK] [^112EH5sv] [^113LiTPe] [^115N8VZf].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure internal consistency. Drug-induced pseudo-Bartter syndrome is best understood as an iatrogenic mimic of inherited salt-losing tubulopathies, driven by drug effects that cause renal salt wasting, volume depletion, and RAAS activation, producing hypokalemia, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, and secondary hyperaldosteronism. Diagnosis relies on recognizing the pattern, identifying the culprit drug, and excluding hereditary causes when the phenotype persists. Management is straightforward — stop the drug and replete electrolytes — with an excellent prognosis if addressed promptly, whereas delays risk morbidity and diagnostic confusion [^112EH5sv] [^113LiTPe] [^115N8VZf] [^111c5Vj5].

Pseudo-Bartter syndrome is a drug-induced mimic of Bartter syndrome, characterized by **hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and secondary hyperaldosteronism** without intrinsic renal tubular defects [^1133Geru] [^1143JZm6]. The most common causes are **loop and thiazide diuretics**, laxatives, and polymyxins (colistin, polymyxin B) [^114bcob6] [^114DTuFs] [^112EH5sv] [^115N8VZf]. Management centers on **stopping the offending drug**, correcting electrolytes, and supportive care; most cases resolve with removal of the causative agent [^112EH5sv] [^116kivnC].

---

## Pathophysiology

Pseudo-Bartter syndrome arises from **renal electrolyte losses** that activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), causing secondary hyperaldosteronism and a Bartter-like phenotype [^114bcob6]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Diuretics**: Loop and thiazide diuretics increase renal sodium, chloride, and potassium losses, causing volume depletion and RAAS activation [^114bcob6].

- **Laxatives**: Chronic stimulant laxative use causes gastrointestinal chloride and potassium losses, leading to metabolic alkalosis and secondary hyperaldosteronism [^114bcob6].

- **Polymyxins**: Colistin and polymyxin B can cause renal tubulopathy with electrolyte losses mimicking Bartter syndrome [^112EH5sv] [^113LiTPe].

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients typically present with:

- **Hypokalemia**: Muscle weakness, cramps, arrhythmias [^115NmFW3].

- **Metabolic alkalosis**: Nausea, vomiting, confusion [^notfound].

- **Polyuria and polydipsia**: From renal salt and water losses [^111NaycH].

- **Normal or low blood pressure**: Despite hyperaldosteronism [^111c5Vj5].

---

## Diagnostic criteria

Diagnosis relies on **clinical and laboratory features**, with exclusion of intrinsic renal tubular defects:

- **Laboratory findings**: Hypokalemia, hypochloremia, metabolic alkalosis, elevated renin and aldosterone, normal or low blood pressure [^111c5Vj5].

- **Exclusion of intrinsic renal tubular defects**: Normal renal imaging and absence of genetic mutations causing Bartter or Gitelman syndromes [^111EuLrC].

- **Identification of causative drug**: Detailed medication history, including diuretics, laxatives, and polymyxins [^112EH5sv] [^113LiTPe].

---

## Drugs commonly associated with pseudo-Bartter syndrome

| **Drug class** | **Examples** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|-|
| Loop diuretics | - Furosemide <br/> - Bumetanide | Increased renal sodium, chloride, and potassium losses [^112RRyxD] [^113BeD5t] [^113RQ1Gz] |
| Thiazide diuretics | - Hydrochlorothiazide <br/> - Chlorthalidone | Increased renal sodium, chloride, and potassium losses [^112ayWDV] [^113BeD5t] [^113RQ1Gz] |
| Laxatives | - Stimulant laxatives (senna, bisacodyl) | Gastrointestinal chloride and potassium losses [^113Ey4rK] |
| Polymyxins | - Colistin <br/> - Polymyxin B | Renal tubulopathy with electrolyte losses [^112EH5sv] [^113LiTPe] |

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on **stopping the offending drug**, correcting electrolytes, and supportive care:

- **Discontinuation of causative drug**: Immediate cessation of diuretics, laxatives, or polymyxins [^112EH5sv] [^113LiTPe].

- **Electrolyte correction**: Potassium and magnesium supplementation; sodium chloride for chloride-responsive alkalosis [^111MtwNJ] [^114bcob6].

- **Supportive care**: Fluid management, monitoring for complications (e.g. arrhythmias, neuromuscular symptoms) [^114bcob6] [^111NaycH].

- **Monitoring**: Regular electrolyte checks until stabilization after drug withdrawal [^112EH5sv] [^113LiTPe].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis is **generally favorable** with timely drug withdrawal and electrolyte correction; most patients recover fully. Complications can occur if untreated, including arrhythmias, rhabdomyolysis, and renal impairment [^111NaycH].

---

## Prevention

Prevention centers on **judicious use** of diuretics and laxatives, with close monitoring of electrolytes during therapy. Educate patients on risks of chronic laxative or diuretic use and maintain a high index of suspicion for pseudo-Bartter syndrome in patients with unexplained hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis on these agents [^114DTuFs] [^113Ey4rK].

---

Pseudo-Bartter syndrome is a reversible, drug-induced mimic of Bartter syndrome; **prompt recognition, withdrawal of the causative drug, and electrolyte correction** are the keys to management.

### Extrarenal manifestations in inherited kidney diseases [^111NaycH]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

TUBULOPATHIES

The term tubulopathy refers to the disruption of the normal physiological function of kidney tubules, responsible for regulating acid-base balance, fluid, and electrolyte homeostasis through active and passive processes. Tubulopathies are pathophysiologically mostly genetic in nature (> 60 genes known to date, Tables 1 and 2), can affect any part of the kidney tubule, and often present with a spectrum of non-specific clinical features, making diagnosis challenging. To diagnose a suspected tubulopathy a thorough workup of urine and serum samples is mandatory, but imaging techniques and genetic evaluation have become more important in the last decades. Prominent aspects in these patients as a consequence of the kidney involvement are polyuria, polydipsia, irritability, growth impairment, variations in blood pressure, and nephrocalcinosis, thereby making an overlap with kidney stone diseases and metabolic kidney diseases already apparent (Table 2). Despite the intrarenal impairment leading to tubulopathies, there are a multitude of extrarenal manifestations in these diseases, most of them unspecific (not directly related to the altered gene). More specific extrarenal manifestations may guide the clinician in diagnosing the underlying disease (e.g. sensorineural hearing loss, ophthalmologic issues, and developmental delay; Fig. 1). One important extrarenal manifestation of Bartter syndrome, which can also be classified as a kidney stone disease, is the complications of chronic hypokalemia including rhabdomyolysis and cardiac arrhythmias making a timely diagnosis a prerequisite in the management of individuals suffering from tubulopathies (Table 2).

### Bartter syndrome-like phenotype in a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^114Dacbp]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Bartter syndrome (BS) is a rare genetic tubulopathy affecting the loop of Henle leading to salt wasting. It is commonly seen in utero or in the early neonatal period. Rare cases of acquired BS are reported in association with infections like tuberculosis, granulomatous conditions like sarcoidosis, autoimmune diseases and drugs. The mainstay of management includes potassium, calcium and magnesium supplementation. We report the case of a woman in her 50s with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for the last 10 years, who presented with diabetic foot ulcers and generalised weakness with ECG changes suggestive of hypokalaemia. She had severe hypokalaemia with high urine potassium excretion and hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis. She poorly responded to intravenously administered potassium supplements and had persistent hypokalaemia. On further evaluation of the persistent hypokalaemia, a diagnosis of idiopathic Bartter-like phenotype was made. She responded well to tablet indomethacin and is presently asymptomatic and is being maintained on tablet indomethacin after 6 months of follow-up.

### Colistimethate (coly-mycin) [^112EH5sv]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Maximum daily dose calculated from colistin base activity should not exceed 5 mg/kg/day with normal renal function.

Transient neurological disturbances may occur. These include circumoral paresthesia or numbness, tingling or formication of the extremities, generalized pruritus, vertigo, dizziness, and slurring of speech. For these reasons, patients should be warned not to drive vehicles or use hazardous machinery while on therapy. Reduction of dosage may alleviate symptoms. Therapy need not be discontinued, but such patients should be observed with particular care.

Nephrotoxicity can occur and is probably a dose-dependent effect of colistimethate sodium. These manifestations of nephrotoxicity are reversible following discontinuation of the antibiotic.

Electrolyte and Acid/Base Abnormalities

Postmarketing cases of renal tubulopathy (i.e. Pseudo-Bartter syndrome) have been identified with the use of intravenous colistimethate sodium (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). All cases reported hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Other common findings included hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, increased potassium in the urine, normal serum creatinine, and normal blood pressure. Consider electrolyte monitoring during treatment. Normalization of electrolyte abnormalities may require drug discontinuation.

Overdosage can result in renal insufficiency, muscle weakness, and apnea (see OVERDOSAGE section). See PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions subsection for use concomitantly with other antibiotics and curariform drugs.

### Clinical and genetic spectrum of bartter syndrome type 3 [^113rr29e]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Bartter syndrome type 3 is a clinically heterogeneous hereditary salt-losing tubulopathy caused by mutations of the chloride voltage-gated channel Kb gene (CLCNKB), which encodes the ClC-Kb chloride channel involved in NaCl reabsorption in the renal tubule. To study phenotype/genotype correlations, we performed genetic analyses by direct sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and retrospectively analyzed medical charts for 115 patients with CLCNKB mutations. Functional analyses were performed in Xenopus laevis oocytes for eight missense and two nonsense mutations. We detected 60 mutations, including 27 previously unreported mutations. Among patients, 29.5% had a phenotype of ante/neonatal Bartter syndrome (polyhydramnios or diagnosis in the first month of life), 44.5% had classic Bartter syndrome (diagnosis during childhood, hypercalciuria, and/or polyuria), and 26.0% had Gitelman-like syndrome (fortuitous discovery of hypokalemia with hypomagnesemia and/or hypocalciuria in childhood or adulthood). Nine of the ten mutations expressed in vitro decreased or abolished chloride conductance. Severe (large deletions, frameshift, nonsense, and essential splicing) and missense mutations resulting in poor residual conductance were associated with younger age at diagnosis. Electrolyte supplements and indomethacin were used frequently to induce catch-up growth, with few adverse effects. After a median follow-up of 8 (range, 1–41) years in 77 patients, chronic renal failure was detected in 19 patients (25%): one required hemodialysis and four underwent renal transplant. In summary, we report a genotype/phenotype correlation for Bartter syndrome type 3: complete loss-of-function mutations associated with younger age at diagnosis, and CKD was observed in all phenotypes.

### Late diagnosis of congenital chloride diarrhea mimicking Hirschsprung's disease [^1158FLoo]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

At the time of admission, she had severe watery diarrhea, mild dehydration, and severe malnutrition (weight: 4700 g, < −3 standard deviation; height 63 cm, −1.22 standard deviation). Venous blood gas, serum, urine, stool electrolytes analyses, renin, and aldosterone levels were studied. The results of the patient's initial laboratory examinations are shown in Table 1.

Table 1.
The Results of the Patient's Initial Laboratory Examinations.

Bartter syndrome was excluded with inappropriate plasma renin, aldosterone levels, and low urinary electrolytes; cystic fibrosis was excluded with a normal sweat chloride level and negative genetic testing. The absence of conditions that could lead to Pseudo Bartter syndrome, such as diuretic drug use, long-term chlorine-poor diet, cyclic vomiting attacks, and long-term laxative drug use, and the exclusion of cystic fibrosis led us to consider the diagnosis of CCD. We double-checked for CCD (although the results are shown normally in the first stool sample taken from the diaper), and a second examination of the liquid stool sample was obtained by entering the rectum with a feeding tube. In this sample, stool chloride was 145.5 mmol/L, stool sodium was 107 mmol/L, stool potassium was 28 mmol/L, and stool osmolar gap was 20, supporting the diagnosis of CCD. In our patient, a heterozygous mutation detected between nucleotides 2024 and 2026 in exon 18 (c.2024_2026dup TCA) of the SLC26A3 gene that was characterized by duplication of 3 nucleotides (thymidine, cytosine, and adenine). This pathogenic mutation was also present in our patient's mother. However, a rare heterozygous mutation in the SLC26A3 (c.1954G > A), which was characterized by the replacement of a guanine by an adenine at nucleotide 1954 in exon 17, was also detected in our patient and her father.

She was primarily treated with intravenous fluids and then started on oral sodium chloride (5 mmol/kg/day), potassium chloride (2 mmol/kg/day), and lansoprazole (1 mg/kg/day). Her condition improved, and the frequency of diarrhea decreased. The patient is about to turn 3 years old, has an average weight, and takes oral supplements of sodium chloride and potassium. She regularly attends outpatient clinic appointments.

### Contradiction between genetic analysis and diuretic loading test in type I bartter syndrome: a case report [^115AFyA1]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 5-year-old Japanese boy was referred to our hospital by a family doctor. The day before hospitalization, he had pain in both knees, lower extremity weakness, and difficulty walking. Over the previous 6 months, he had had episodes of dorsal foot pain that recurred about once a month and spontaneously abated 1 to 2 days after onset; however, this time, his symptoms had not improved. Blood tests showed pottasium levels of 1.8 mEq/L and creatine kinase levels of 4598 U/L. He was admitted with suspected a recurrent episode of muscle weakness.

The patient had been born without polyhydramnios at a gestational age of 39 weeks and 0 days. His birth length was 52 cm and his birth weight was 3150 g. He screened negative for congenital metabolic abnormalities and had a normal growth and development history. However, he had been prone to polydipsia-polyuria syndrome since birth. His mother had a history of hyperthyroidism and a paternal uncle had a history of nephrotic syndrome.

### Disorders of sodium [^113Bapty]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Sodium imbalances are a common occurrence in the emergency department. Although recognition and diagnosis are relatively straightforward, discovering the cause and management should be approached systematically. The most important history items to ascertain is if the patient has symptoms and how long this imbalance has taken to develop. Treatment rapidity depends on severity of symptoms with the most rapid treatment occurring in only the severely symptomatic. Overcorrection has dire consequences and must be approached in a careful and systematic fashion in order to prevent these devastating consequences.

### Bartter syndrome [^114MMbns]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review describes recent advances in our understanding of the genetic heterogeneity, pathophysiology and treatment of Bartter syndrome, a group of autosomal recessive disorders that are characterized by markedly reduced or absent salt transport by the thick ascending limb of Henle. Consequently, individuals with Bartter syndrome exhibit renal salt wasting and lowered blood pressure, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis and hypercalciuria with a variable risk of renal stones.

Recent Findings

Previously, three genes (SLC12A2, the sodium-potassium-chloride co-transporter; KCNJ1, the ROMK potassium ion channel; ClC-Kb, the basolateral chloride ion channel) had been identified as causing antenatal and 'classic' Bartter syndrome. Two additional genes have now been identified. Barttin is a beta-subunit that is required for the trafficking of CLC-K (both ClC-Ka and ClC-Kb) channels to the plasma membrane in both the thick ascending limb and the marginal cells in the scala media of the inner ear that secrete potassium ion-rich endolymph. Loss-of-function mutations in barttin thus cause Bartter syndrome with sensorineural deafness. In addition, severe gain-of-function mutations in the extracellular calcium ion-sensing receptor can result in a Bartter phenotype because activation of this G protein-coupled receptor inhibits salt transport in the thick ascending limb (a furosemide-like effect).

Summary

Five genes have been identified as causing Bartter syndrome (types I-V), with the unifying pathophysiology being the loss of salt transport by the thick ascending limb. Phenotypic differences in Bartter types I-V relate to the specific physiological roles of the individual genes in the kidney and other organ systems.

### Pseudo gitelman syndrome associated with pregnancy [^111Nm9CF]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Gitelman syndrome is a rare inherited renal tubulopathy associated with metabolic alkalosis and electrolyte disorders. Pseudo Gitelman syndrome presents with the same clinical characteristics as Gitelman syndrome, yet without genetic mutations in SLC12A3.

Case

A 32-year-old woman with no remarkable medical and family history developed hypokalemia at 32 weeks of gestation. Laboratory findings were consistent with Gitelman syndrome and potassium supplementation was initiated. The patient delivered a healthy neonate at 40 weeks of gestation and the electrolyte disorders drastically improved. After delivery, genomic analysis revealed no evidence of mutations in SLC12A3, and pseudo Gitelman syndrome was finally diagnosed.

Conclusion

Pseudo Gitelman syndrome, presenting with Gitelman syndrome-like renal tubulopathy without mutations in SLC12A3, can cause a temporary electrolyte imbalance based on the physiologic changes of pregnancy. Although pregnant women with isolated hypokalemia need not be evaluated for Gitelman or pseudo Gitelman syndrome, if it is accompanied by metabolic alkalosis, hypocalciuria, hypomagnesia, and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system without hypertension, this evaluation should be considered.

### Understanding the mechanisms of angiotensin II signaling involved in hypertension and its long-term sequelae: insights from Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes, human models of endogenous angiotensin II signaling antagonism [^111GaNjG]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Angiotensin II (Ang II) plays a key role in hypertension, renal and cardiovascular pathophysiology via intracellular pathways that involve the activation of a multiplicity of signaling mechanisms. Although experimental and genetic animal models have been developed and used to explore Ang II signaling's role in hypertension, a complete understanding of the processes mediating Ang II signaling in hypertension in humans remains elusive. One impediment is that these animal models do not exhibit all the traits of human hypertension, making it impossible to extrapolate from them to humans. To overcome this issue, we have used patients with Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes, a human model of endogenously blunted and blocked Ang II signaling that presents a constellation of clinical findings which manifest themselves as the opposite of hypertension. This article reviews the aspects of the pathophysiology of human hypertension and its short and long term sequelae, and uses the results of our studies in Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes along with those of others to gain better insight and understanding of the role of Ang II signaling in these processes.

### Characteristics of electrolyte imbalance and pseudo-bartter syndrome in hospitalized cystic fibrosis children and adolescents [^115TggEy]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pseudo-Bartter syndrome (PBS) is a rare manifestation of Cystic fibrosis (CF) and can often be the initial presentation in these patients, however, due to significantly overlapping symptoms it is often misdiagnosed as simple dehydration or Bartter syndrome. The objective of our study was to highlight the key features of PBS and electrolyte imbalance in CF patients helping in early and prompt diagnosis.

Method

We performed a retrospective study from January 2015 to December 2019 at the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), Pakistan. CF patients aged from 1–18 years, admitted at AKUH were enrolled and their laboratory data and individual charts were reviewed. Patients were categorized into three groups based on their serum electrolyte profile and their clinical findings were compared.

Result

We enrolled 72 CF patients, out of which 42 (58%) were categorized into the Normal Electrolyte (NE) group, 19 (26%) into the Electrolyte Imbalance (EI) group and 11 (15%) in the PBS group. Out of 11 cases, 6 (54.54%) patients in PBS group presented with features consistent with PBS leading to CF diagnosis labeled as "early presenters". Mean age of patients in the PBS group was 3.81 ± 0.86 years and their age at diagnosis were significantly lower as compared to other groups. Gastrointestinal disturbances including diarrhea, vomiting and constipation were more common in the EI and PBS groups. Polyuria was most common in the PBS (72%) group. Length of hospital stay showed no significant difference.

Conclusion

Pseudo-Bartter syndrome can be a presenting feature of cystic fibrosis. Electrolyte imbalance should be anticipated in hospitalized CF children and adolescent.

### Late diagnosis of congenital chloride diarrhea mimicking Hirschsprung's disease [^114DTuFs]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Congenital chloride diarrhea can easily be misdiagnosed as Bartter syndrome due to similar laboratory findings. However, the primary defect in Bartter syndrome is in the triple electrolyte cotransporter (Na/K/2Cl) in the thick ascending arm of Henle. Bartter syndrome is characterized by polydipsia, polyuria, increased excretion of sodium and chloride in urine, and dehydration, accompanied by vomiting and constipation. Laboratory tests show hypochloremic hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis and increased aldosterone and renin levels. Our patient was referred to us after being misdiagnosed with Bartter syndrome 5 days prior. At our hospital, we excluded Bartter syndrome through normal urinary electrolytes and serum aldosterone levels. A slightly elevated renin level was attributed to mild dehydration in the patient. When Bartter syndrome is ruled out, Pseudo Bartter syndrome may be considered due to similar clinical presentation. It differs from Bartter syndrome because biochemical changes occur without tubular dysfunction in Pseudo Bartter syndrome. The leading cause of Pseudo Bartter syndrome is cystic fibrosis. Still, it can also result from CCD, Gitelman syndrome, diuretic drug use, long-term chlorine-poor diet, cyclic vomiting attacks, and long-term laxative drug use. In our patient, CCD was diagnosed and confirmed by examinations after excluding cystic fibrosis and other etiological causes of Pseudo Bartter syndrome.

Patients with CCD may experience chronic diarrhea, failure to thrive, acute dehydration attacks in infections, psychomotor delay, chronic kidney disease, male subfertility, and inflammatory bowel disease. The most critical points to prevent the development of all these negative prognostic pictures are regular NaCl/KCl supplementation, periodic evaluation of serum electrolytes, renin and aldosterone, growth parameters, renal functions, and psychomotor development, vaccination compliance, and intermittent examination for infertility.

### Epidemiology and health-related quality of life in hypoparathyroidism in Norway [^111Zfy84]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Primary hypoparathyroidism (HP) is caused by a group of heterogeneous diseases in which hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia occur as a result of insufficient PTH secretion or receptor dysfunction in target organs. The most common etiologies among adults are surgical damage to the parathyroid glands. Nonsurgical HP can be either autoimmune or genetic (Table 1), but in many cases the cause remains unknown, and is referred to as idiopathic HP.

Table 1.
Causes of Hypoparathyroidism

Epidemiological studies on HP are sparse and mostly cover certain subgroups. In Denmark, the prevalence of postsurgical HP was 220 per million inhabitants, nonsurgical HP 23 per million, and pseudohypoparathyroidism (PTH resistance; pseudo-HP) 11 per million, totaling 254 per million. An estimate among insured people from the United States revealed that about 77 000 have chronic HP of all causes, which translates into an approximate prevalence of 250 per million. In Japan and Israel, the prevalence numbers of idiopathic HP were 7 and 9 per million, respectively, and of pseudo-HP in Japan 3 per million.

Patients with pseudo-HP and vitamin D resistance have elevated PTH, in contrast to classical HP. The clinical picture in pseudo-HP and vitamin D resistance is equal to other forms of HP and is therefore included as a subgroup of HP. Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia (ADH) is probably the most common genetic cause of HP, usually caused by an activating mutation in the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR), termed ADH type 1, or rarely in guanine nucleotide binding protein, alpha 11 (GNA11), termed ADH type 2. Occasionally, CASR mutations induce polyuria and hypokalemic alkalosis, called ADH with mild Bartter syndrome type 5. The severity of ADH is highly variable, and asymptomatic patients and those who exhibit mild symptoms can often go undiagnosed.

Autoimmune HP is mainly seen as part of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS-1), in which it is present in about 80%. About one-half of the APS-1 patients with HP have autoantibodies against NACHT leucine-rich repeat protein 5 (NALP5), an intracellular protein with unknown function highly expressed in parathyroid tissue. Autoantibodies against interferon omega (IFN-ω) can be detected in nearly all APS-1 patients regardless of organ involvement. Autoantibodies that activate CaSR have also been described as an autoimmune cause of HP.

### Drug-induced pseudo-sezary syndrome: a case report and literature review [^11459FPC]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2015). Low credibility.

Pseudo-Sezary syndrome is a benign lymphoproliferative disorder, which clinically and pathologically mimics true Sezary syndrome. In this article, a case of pseudo-Sezary syndrome and review the literature has been reported. The patient was a 51-year-old man who developed erythroderma and palmoplantar keratoderma. The patient's medication history included fosinopril and combination metoprolol/hydrochlorothiazide. Flow cytometry showed a population of 2500 "Sezary-like" CD4726 T cells per microliter in the peripheral blood. Skin biopsy showed numerous atypical lymphocytes with epidermotropism, and there was matching dominant T-cell clonality in the skin and peripheral blood. After stopping all antihypertensive medications, the eruption resolved in its entirety.

### Chlorpromazine (chlorproMAZINE hydrochloride) [^113uGMhZ]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

If these symptoms become too troublesome, they can usually be controlled by a reduction of dosage or change of drug. Treatment with anti–parkinsonian agents, benzodiazepines or propranolol may be helpful.

Pseudo–parkinsonism: Symptoms may include: mask-like facies, drooling, tremors, pillrolling motion, cogwheel rigidity and shuffling gait. In most cases these symptoms are readily controlled when an anti–parkinsonism agent is administered concomitantly. Anti–parkinsonism agents should be used only when required. Generally, therapy of a few weeks to 2 or 3 months will suffice. After this time patients should be evaluated to determine their need for continued treatment. (Note: Levodopa has not been found effective in antipsychotic–induced pseudo–parkinsonism.) Occasionally, it is necessary to lower the dosage of chlorpromazine or to discontinue the drug.

Tardive Dyskinesia: As with all antipsychotic agents, tardive dyskinesia may appear in some patients on long-term therapy or may appear after drug therapy has been discontinued. The syndrome can also develop, although much less frequently, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. This syndrome appears in all age groups. Although its prevalence appears to be highest among elderly patients, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict at the inception of antipsychotic treatment which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. The symptoms are persistent and in some patients appear to be irreversible. The syndrome is characterized by rhythmical involuntary movements of the tongue, face, mouth or jaw (e.g., protrusion of tongue, puffing of cheeks, puckering of mouth, chewing movements). Sometimes these may be accompanied by involuntary movements of extremities. In rare instances, these involuntary movements of the extremities are the only manifestations of tardive dyskinesia. A variant of tardive dyskinesia, tardive dystonia, has also been described.

### Dominant role of prostaglandin E2 EP4 receptor in furosemide-induced salt-losing tubulopathy: a model for hyperprostaglandin E syndrome / antenatal bartter syndrome [^112RRyxD]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

Increased formation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a key part of hyperprostaglandin E syndrome/antenatal Bartter syndrome (HPS/aBS), a renal disease characterized by NaCl wasting, water loss, and hyperreninism. Inhibition of PGE2 formation by cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors significantly lowers patient mortality and morbidity. However, the pathogenic role of PGE2 in HPS/aBS awaits clarification. Chronic blockade of the Na-K-2Cl co-transporter NKCC2 by diuretics causes symptoms similar to HPS/aBS and provides a useful animal model. In wild-type (WT) mice and in mice lacking distinct PGE2 receptors (EP1-/-, EP2-/-, EP3-/-, and EP4-/-), the effect of chronic furosemide administration (7 d) on urine output, sodium and potassium excretion, and renin secretion was determined. Furthermore, furosemide-induced diuresis and renin activity were analyzed in mice with defective PGI2 receptors (IP-/-). In all animals studied, furosemide stimulated a rise in diuresis and electrolyte excretion. However, this effect was blunted in EP1-/-, EP3-/-, and EP4-/- mice. Compared with WT mice, no difference was observed in EP2-/- and IP-/- mice. The furosemide-induced increase in plasma renin concentration was significantly decreased in EP4-/- mice and to a lesser degree also in IP-/- mice. Pharmacologic inhibition of EP4 receptors in furosemide-treated WT mice with the specific antagonist ONO-AE3–208 mimicked the changes in renin mRNA expression, plasma renin concentration, diuresis, and sodium excretion seen in EP4-/- mice. The GFR in EP4-/- mice was not changed compared with that in WT mice, which indicated that blunted diuresis and salt loss seen in EP4-/- mice were not a consequence of lower GFR. In summary, these findings demonstrate that the EP4 receptor mediates PGE2-induced renin secretion and that EP1, EP3, and EP4 receptors all contribute to enhanced PGE2-mediated salt and water excretion in the HPS/aBS model.

### Differential diagnosis of bartter syndrome, gitelman syndrome, and pseudo-bartter / gitelman syndrome based on clinical characteristics [^114LPDwr]. Genetics in Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Phenotypic overlap exists among type III Bartter syndrome (BS), Gitelman syndrome (GS), and pseudo-BS/GS (p-BS/GS), which are clinically difficult to distinguish. We aimed to clarify the differences between these diseases, allowing accurate diagnosis based on their clinical features.

Methods

A total of 163 patients with genetically defined type III BS (n = 30), GS (n = 90), and p-BS/GS (n = 43) were included. Age at diagnosis, sex, body mass index, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and serum and urine electrolyte concentrations were determined.

Results

Patients with p-BS/GS were significantly older at diagnosis than those with type III BS and GS. Patients with p-BS/GS included a significantly higher percentage of women and had a lower body mass index and estimated glomerular filtration rate than did patients with GS. Although hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria were predominant biochemical findings in patients with GS, 17 and 23% of patients with type III BS and p-BS/GS, respectively, also showed these abnormalities. Of patients with type III BS, GS, and p-BS/GS, 40, 12, and 63%, respectively, presented with chronic kidney disease.

Conclusions

This study clarified the clinical differences between BS, GS, and p-BS/GS for the first time, which will help clinicians establish differential diagnoses for these three conditions.

### Contradiction between genetic analysis and diuretic loading test in type I bartter syndrome: a case report [^117NiDkH]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Our experience shows that in BS, the genotype of BS cannot always be diagnosed from the phenotype. Other recent reports and review have also indicated that the genotype-phenotype correlation is not always exact. Conventionally, type I BS in neonates is regarded as serious, but there are reports of a milder "diuresis-only" phenotype among babies delivered at full term with normal birth weight and normal development. In addition, type III BS was hitherto regarded as a relatively mild form; however, recent data indicate that approximately 30% of cases progress to kidney failure. It thus appears likely that cases of BS, such as ours, in which the genotype does not correlate with the phenotype and diuretic loading are in fact quite common; this makes diagnosis using the conventional five-type classification very problematic. Therefore, in order to make a proper diagnosis of the disease BS, we should consider all variations of the disorder as a single disorder (i.e. salt-losing tubulopathy) and genetic testing should be performed aggressively. To better understand the relationship between genotype, phenotype, and tubular channel function, the results of the diuretic loading test should be collected.

To summarize: in many situations, including mild cases of type I BS such as ours, diuretic loading test results may not correlate with BS genotype; this exposes the limited usefulness of the conventional classification system. The diuretic loading test has limited utility for diagnosis especially in atypical cases. On the other hand, this test, which allows assessment of channel function, is useful for better understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlation. Given the lack of standard protocols and interpretation guidelines for diuretic loading tests, the further data collection of the test could be required.

### Unexpected clinical sequelae of gitelman syndrome: hypertension in adulthood is common and females have higher potassium requirements [^114aunW1]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

Symptom onset

Twenty-nine patients ascribed a definite age to symptom onset, at median 29 years (range 3–62, Table 1). Of the remaining seven, most subjectively felt that they had been unwell for many years, but this could not be detailed more objectively. Of the six who presented in childhood (some with symptom onset in infancy), four were male (P = 0.67). Three of these individuals were initially diagnosed with Bartter syndrome before a genetic diagnosis of GS was made, and as a result were prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs during childhood.

Blood pressure

Surprisingly, 16 of the 36 (44%) have developed hypertension, as defined by BP > 130/80 mmHg on at least three occasions, or a diagnosis of hypertension prior to referral, now treated (Table 1). Median systolic and diastolic BP readings were both significantly higher (Figure 1): 138 (133–143) versus 116 (109–122) and 86 (77–88) versus 73 (64–77) mmHg (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0007, respectively). All but two of these 16 have had clinic BPs > 130/80 despite being on potassium-conserving agents that have antihypertensive action, suggesting that their untreated BP would have been higher. The hypertensive subgroup was more likely to be male: 13 versus 3 females (P = 0.018) but of similar current age (median 53 versus 57 years, P = 0.95) and was significantly older than normotensive subjects: median 55 versus 36.5 years (P = 0.005). However, one female was already hypertensive by the age of 23 years. Patient 32's initial presentation was with hypertension at age 58 years; secondary hyperaldosteronism was discovered and the diagnosis of GS followed, other causes having been excluded.

### Transient hyponatremia of prematurity caused by mild bartter syndrome type II: a case report [^114QReea]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Bartter syndrome was initially described in 1962 by Bartter et al. as a renal tubular disorder characterized by hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, a low or normal blood pressure and elevated renin. The hyperreninemia and hyperaldosteronism occur due to volume depletion activating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Bartter syndrome can also involve polyuria, polydipsia, normal to increased urinary calcium excretion, normal or mildly decreased serum magnesium, and occasionally hypophosphatemia. It is categorized into five types each with specific associated mutations and clinical presentations.

Variability in Bartter syndrome presentations are seen even within subtypes. A few cases of transient Bartter syndrome have been reported with mutations located in the melanoma-associated antigen D2 (MAGE-D2) gene located on the X-chromosome. Bartter syndrome type II (MIM #241200) is caused by mutations in the renal outer medullary potassium channel (ROMK) potassium channel gene (KCNJ1) (MIM *600359), can manifest in the neonatal period with hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, and typically requires lifelong electrolyte supplementation. We are aware of a single case of transient Bartter syndrome in a preterm patient who was compound heterozygous for pathogenic variants in the KCNJ1 gene: a paternally inherited Arg338Stop variant and a maternally inherited Met357Thr variant. The patient's symptoms resolved by age three after 1 year of indomethacin treatment, possibly fitting the diagnosis of transient Bartter syndrome.

Here we describe another patient with compound heterozygous variants in the KCNJ1 gene, who exhibited the features of neonatal Bartter syndrome but showed spontaneous resolution of electrolyte abnormalities by 3 months of age while continuing to have polyuria and hypercalciuria.

### A novel MAGED2 variant in a Chinese preterm newborn with transient antenatal Bartter's syndrome with 4 years follow-up [^1151gcD4]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Antenatal Bartter's syndrome is an inherited disorder, characterized by polyuria, failure to thrive, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, hyperreninemia and renal salt wasting which need lifelong fluid and electrolyte supplementation as well as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Some severe cases show mental retardation. The defective chloride transport in the loop of Henle leads to fetal polyuria resulting in severe hydramnios and premature delivery.

However, some case reports described male infants' antenatal Bartter's syndrome spontaneously resolved within several weeks after birth. Laghmani et al. identified a genetic cause of this transient antenatal phenotype, MAGED2 mutations by whole-exome sequencing of the suspected X chromosome. The transient antenatal Bartter's syndrome patients present with polyhydramnios, prematurity and renal salt tubular function, but these clinical manifestations disappeared completely in a few months after birth. Most patients reported were infants, and the long-term influence on kidney function was still unknown.

We identified a novel variant (c.1598C > T, p. Ala533Val) in MAGED2 by next generation sequencing in a Chinese preterm neonate with transient antenatal Bartter's syndrome phenotype. This patient was followed up in clinic for 4 years with regular test of kidney function and ultrasound.

### Contradiction between genetic analysis and diuretic loading test in type I bartter syndrome: a case report [^115WKiXb]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In typical cases of Bartter syndrome (BS), assessing response to diuretics (furosemide and thiazide), hereinafter referred to as diuretic loading test, may be used to diagnose the type by detecting which part of the kidney tubule is not functioning correctly. However, the diuretic loading test may not always agree with the results of genetic analyses.

Case presentation

A 5-year-old boy was admitted due to lower extremity weakness and abnormal gait. He had a recurrent episode of muscle weakness and laboratory results showed severe hypokalemia. The direct genomic sequencing of the case revealed a new mutation in the SLC12A1 gene, which is associated with type I Bartter syndrome. Because there was the difference between the phenotype and genotype, we conducted a diuretic loading test to confirm the diagnosis. However, the results showed a clear increase in urine excretion of Na and Cl. These results were not consistent with typical type I BS, but consistent with the patient's phenotype.

Conclusion

The diuretic loading test has limited utility for diagnosis especially in atypical cases. On the other hand, this test, which allows assessment of channel function, is useful for better understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlation.

### Pseudo-bartter syndrome: a CFTR-related disorder? [^112dCPBF]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2025). Medium credibility.

This case report presents a 14-month-old boy with a history of cystic fibrosis (CF) carrier status, diagnosed following a positive newborn screening for CF (CF-NBS), who developed symptoms suggestive of Pseudo-Bartter syndrome (PBS). Despite initial evaluations not meeting CF diagnostic criteria, subsequent investigations revealed an intermediate sweat chloride concentration, a second CFTR mutation, and CFTR dysfunction through rectal organoid morphology analysis (ROMA) consistent with CFTR-related disorder (CFTR-RD). This case raises important considerations regarding the diagnosis and management of CFTR-RD. PBS can be considered as a rare presentation of CFTR-RD and can occur in children with sweat chloride below the CF range. Functional testing of CFTR by ROMA enabled a more accurate diagnosis. Despite the negative work-up after CF-NBS, this infant developed CFTR-RD, but this should not be considered as a screen failure. Follow-up of children with CFTR-RD at a CF centre is preferred, because of the risk of developing CF.

### A novel SLC12A3 homozygous c2039delG mutation in gitelman syndrome with hypocalcemia [^111MtwNJ]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of GS includes diuretic, specifically thiazide abuse and chronic vomiting. Additionally some disorders affecting the kidneys or the gastrointestinal tract can also result in hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis with hyperreninemic secondary aldosteronism. It has been reported that GS-like manifestations could be a rare complication of cisplatin. Autoimmune diseases, Sjögren syndrome, for example, was reported to cause renal tubular disorders, and cause typical features of GS. Among various differential diagnosis, classical Bartter syndrome (type III) is the most indistinguishable, though it usually has early onset, and normal plasma magnesium. However, Mutations in the HNF1β gene can mimic the electrolyte abnormalities of GS, approximately 50% of patients develop hypomagnesemia because of renal magnesium wasting, often accompanied by hypocalciuria. Therefore genetic test is crucial. According to the consensus and guidance from KDIGO, the use of a next generation sequencing–based gene panel to parallel sequence all genes that are relevant in the differential diagnosis of GS is recommended. Besides, GS can be accompanied with other diseases, making differential diagnosis difficult. In some GS cases, thyrotoxicosis coexsits. Although Sjögren syndrome can cause GS-like symptoms, sometimes they may be comorbidities, again making gene sequencing much more important.

### Should isolated pseudo-bartter syndrome be considered a CFTR-related disorder of infancy? [^11325ck8]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Infants that are negative to cystic fibrosis (CF) newborn screening (NBS) programs, or in countries without NBS, may present with metabolic alkalosis and severe salt depletion, a well-known clinical manifestation of CF termed Pseudo-Bartter syndrome (PBS). Here, we report the cases of three CF-negative children, who carry rare mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, and, for whom, PBS was the only manifestation of CFTR protein dysfunction. There is no diagnostic label for these cases.

Methods

Medical records of patients followed at our Cystic Fibrosis Centre were revised and data were collected for all patients who presented with an isolated PBS. The syndrome was defined as an episode of dehydration with low levels of serum sodium (< 134mmol/L), potassium (< 3.4mmol/L), and chloride (< 100mmol/L), with metabolic alkalosis (bicarbonatemia > 27mmol/L) in the absence of renal tubulopathy.

Results

Three out of 73 (4%) CF infants presented with a severe metabolic alkalosis with salt depletion; two of these required admission to the intensive care unit. Two infants had a negative NBS, and one was identified as a CF carrier. Sweat test was repeatedly in the negative/borderline ranges for all patients. Less than two CF causing mutations were identified (F508del/R1070W, F508del; L467F/P5L, R1066H/P5L). During a mean follow-up of 9 years, the children had no other CF manifestations.

Conclusion

We suggest that PBS as the sole manifestation of CFTR dysfunction might be considered a CFTR-related disorder of infancy.

Fig. 1
Chest Radiographs: A At admission, B Pulmonary oedema, C Post treatment

Our impression was severe hypokalaemia and hypertension with metabolic alkalosis secondary to hyperaldosteronism. Differential diagnoses included primary hyperaldosteronism, secondary hyperaldosteronism, or due to medications/food. Further workup was sent including; plasma renin, serum aldosterone, urinary electrolytes. She was managed with aggressive potassium replacement, requiring 80 mmol i.v. potassium chloride (KCl) daily for four days (total 240 mmol i.v. KCl) to achieve a serum potassium level above 3.5 mmol/L. Her systolic blood pressure settled below 150mmhg.

On day five of her admission, our patient developed a hypertensive emergency (BP 239/114 mmHg) with acute pulmonary oedema requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Chest X-ray demonstrated bilateral air space opacifications and perihilar haze, with bilateral pleural effusions in keeping with pulmonary oedema (Fig. 1). She was managed with i.v. Furosemide 160 mg/24 h, Isosorbide dinitrate infusion 2.5 mg/hr for 8 h, and oral spironolactone 50 mg once daily. Pulmonary oedema resolved within 24 h and blood pressure improved to 130/55 mmHg. She was changed from i.v. furosemide to oral Furosemide/Amiloride 40/5 mg. Echocardiogram showed normal left ventricle size and function, paradoxical septal motion consistent with left bundle branch block, mildly dilated left atrium, and right ventricular systolic pressure less than 35 mmHg. On review of her imaging, a recent CT thorax was noted to include the adrenal glands. This was reviewed and reported no evidence of adrenal adenomas or hyperplasia Fig. 2.

### Central pontine myelinolysis associated with hypokalaemia in anorexia nervosa [^116WRZqL]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

A 31-year-old man was admitted to hospital with of anorexia, binge eating, and self induced vomiting. On admission, he showed a pronounced low weight and disturbance of the body image and was diagnosed as having anorexia nervosa. In addition, electrolyte abnormalities, mainly hypokalaemia, and increased serum renin and aldosterone concentrations were recorded, suggesting pseudo-Bartter syndrome as a complication. Under frequent monitoring of the serum potassium and sodium concentrations, serum electrolytes were gradually corrected, but brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed reversible central pontine myelinolysis (CPM). Although attention has been mainly paid to the association of CPM with rapid correction of hyponatraemia and abnormal osmolality, this case report strongly suggested the involvement of hypokalaemia in the pathogenesis of CPM.

### Effective medical treatment strategies to help cessation of purging behaviors [^112Zuyuh]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Herein we review the major medical issues involved in the "detoxing" of patients who engage in purging behaviors and the pathophysiology of why they occur.

Methods

Given a limited evidence base of randomized controlled trials, we conducted a thorough qualitative review to identify salient literature with regard to the medical issues involved in "detoxing" patients from their purging behaviors.

Results

Pseudo Bartter's Syndrome is the root cause of much of the medical difficulties which can arise when purging behaviors are abruptly discontinued. However, this is imminently treatable and even preventable with a judicious medical treatment plan which targets the increased serum aldosterone levels which would otherwise promote salt and water retention and a propensity towards severe edema formation. Effective recommendations are provided which can make this process much less vexing for patients attempting to cease their purging behaviors.

Conclusions

"Detoxing" from purging behaviors can be fraught with medical complications which frustrate these patients and can lead to unsuccessful outcomes. Medical providers should become familiar with the pathophysiology which is the basis for Pseudo Bartter's Syndrome and the effective medical treatments which can lead to a successful outcome.

### Persistent renal dysfunction post-chemotherapy: a diagnostic conundrum in pediatric cancer survivorship-a case report [^114z6Yf7]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

When investigating the causes of hypokalemia, as illustrated in Fig. 2, it's crucial to distinguish renal potassium wasting from other conditions. This can be accomplished by examining urine potassium-creatinine ratios or transtubular potassium gradients. Low renal K + excretion can be caused by two primary conditions: extrarenal potassium loss or intracellular potassium shifting. High renal K + excretion can be further classified into hypertensive and normotensive hypokalemia. High renal K + excretion with hypertension can result from conditions with hyperaldosteronism or aldosterone-like effects, such as cortisol and its analogs. High renal K + excretion with normotension can be further divided into those with metabolic acidosis and those with metabolic alkalosis. Common etiologies of high renal K + excretion with normotension and metabolic acidosis include renal tubular acidosis, profound diarrhea, and toluene abuse. Differentiating the causes of high renal K + excretion with normotension and metabolic alkalosis necessitates measuring spot urine for Na + and Cl -. High urine Na + and Cl - excretion may be due to congenital or drug-induced Gitelman/Bartter-like syndromes. High urine Na + with low Cl - excretion suggests gastric juice loss or the presence of non-absorbable anions. Low urine Na + with high Cl - excretion is associated with specific types of diarrhea. Low levels of both urine Na + and Cl - indicate recovery from previous vomiting or diuretic use, or the presence of chloride-losing diarrhea.

### Persistent renal dysfunction post-chemotherapy: a diagnostic conundrum in pediatric cancer survivorship-a case report [^117LErC5]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Diagnostic flowchart of hypokalemia

The patient's clinical presentation, high renal K + excretion, normal blood pressure, metabolic alkalosis, and elevated urinary excretion of Na +, Cl − were suggestive of inherited or drug-induced Gitelman/Bartter-like nephropathy. Given his previous history of cisplatin therapy, a well-known nephrotoxic agent known to mimic Bartter syndrome (BS), our initial approach was to manage him for cisplatin-induced kidney tubulopathy. However, the patient's enduring kidney function deterioration and proteinuria contradicted the usual stabilization of renal function observed in cisplatin-induced kidney tubulopathy cases. This prompted us to consider the possibility of an underlying inherited kidney disease. Considering the patient's age, the absence of polyhydramnios and nephrocalcinosis, and high renal excretion of Ca 2+ and Mg 2+, we initially suspected type III classic BS. However, direct CLCNKB sequencing revealed no pathogenic variants. Further investigation involving whole exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing identified compound heterozygous variants, c.562delA (p.K187fs) and c.941 A > C (p.Y314S), in the KCNJ1 gene, which are both novel variants. Further Sanger sequencing of his parents confirmed that his father carried p.K187fs and mother carried p.Y314S variants. According to the ACMG guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants, the K187fs and Y314S variants in the KCNJ1 gene, which encodes the Kir1.1 potassium channel, are likely pathogenic for Bartter syndrome. The frameshift variant K187fs is predicted to result in a truncated, non-functional protein, consistent with a loss-of-function mechanism for Bartter syndrome (PVS1 criterion). The Y314S missense variant affects a critical residue in the IgLD core of Kir1.1, and computational analysis suggests that it disrupts channel stability similar to the known pathogenic Y314C variant (PP3 criterion). The presence of these two variants together in a patient suspected to have Bartter syndrome provides strong evidence for a molecular diagnosis of the disease (PM2 and PP4 criteria). In conclusion, based on the ACMG guidelines and the available evidence, the K187fs and Y314S variants are classified as likely pathogenic for Bartter syndrome.

### Gitelman or bartter type 3 syndrome? A case of distal convoluted tubulopathy caused by CLCNKB gene mutation [^1168t7ne]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 32-year-old woman with no significant medical history was sent to our consultation due to hypokalaemia (< 3.0 mmol/l). Her main complaints were longstanding polyuria and nocturia. Physical examination was normal. Basic investigations showed normal renal function, low serum potassium (2.7 mmol/l) and magnesium (0.79 mmol/l), metabolic alkalosis (pH 7.54; bicarbonate 32.5 mmol/l), elevated urinary potassium (185 mmol/24 h) and normal urinary calcium (246 mg/24 h). Thiazide test revealed blunted response. Chronic vomiting and the abuse of diuretics were excluded. Genetic tests for SLC12A3 gene mutation described in Gitelman syndrome (GS) came negative. CLCNKB gene mutation analysis present in both GS and Bartter (BS) type 3 syndromes was positive. The patient is now being treated with potassium and magnesium oral supplements, ramipril and spironolactone with stable near-normal potassium and magnesium levels. This article presents the case of a patient with hypokalaemia caused by CLCNKB gene mutation hard to categorise as GS or BS type 3.

### A syndrome resembling Bartter's syndrome in sarcoidosis [^113FjuwS]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2009). Low credibility.

Acquired Bartter-like syndrome, albeit rare, has not been reported to be associated with sarcoidosis. We describe the case of a 32-year-old male patient who presented with progressive muscular weakness of both lower extremities. Profound hypokalaemia associated with renal (K(+)) wasting, bilateral nephrocalcinosis and high plasma renin activity resembled Bartter's syndrome (BS). Both mediastinal lymph node and renal biopsy demonstrated sarcoidosis with non-caseating granuloma. Genetic testing responsible for hereditary BS or Gitelman's syndrome (GS) was negative. Hypokalaemia was well controlled with the administration of spironolactone with oral steroids and KCl. Early recognition and prompt treatment of sarcoidosis-associated Bartter-like syndrome avoids unnecessary complications.

In clinical practice, GS most often requires differentiation with classical Bartter syndrome (BS). The constellations of the metabolic disturbances found in these tubulopathies are similar to the side effects of diuretics. Regarding GS, it corresponds to the disorders found in patients using thiazide diuretics, while in BS, the symptoms are similar to the use of loop diuretics. In both syndromes, patients present similar metabolic disorders such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and metabolic alkalosis. In typical cases, they are distinguished by the presence of hypercalciuria in BS and hypocalciuria in GS. Clinical manifestations of GS are associated with high phenotypic variability. Even concerning an identical NCCT mutations, clinical features of typical GS (with hypocalciuria) were present in women whereas features of typical BS were present in men (without hypocalciuria). Authors have suspected that differences in sex may explain this phenotype variability.

We present, a case of Caucasian woman with genetically confirmed GS and atypical clinical manifestation with normocalciuria.

### A serum potassium level above 10 mmol / L in a patient predisposed to hypokalemia [^115YCYRh]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2006). Medium credibility.

Background

A 58-year-old man, previously diagnosed with Bartter's syndrome, presented with a short history of vomiting, diarrhea and weakness. He had severe hyperkalemia (serum potassium levels > 10 mmol/l), which was successfully managed. Post hoc investigation suggested that the patient had Gitelman's rather than Bartter's syndrome.

Investigations

Physical examination, urine and blood analyses, chest radiography, electrocardiogram, renal ultrasound, and genetic analysis focusing on the SLC12A3 gene, which encodes the thiazide-sensitive Na/Cl cotransporter.

Diagnosis

Gitelman's syndrome and hyperkalemia secondary to acute renal failure plus exogenous potassium supplementation.

Management

Intravenous calcium gluconate, insulin and dextrose administration. Temporary continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration. Genetic confirmation of the underlying molecular defect. Long-term treatment for Gitelman's syndrome with oral potassium and magnesium supplements and epithelial sodium channel-blocking drugs. Review of patient education regarding renal salt-wasting syndromes.

### Buspirone hydrochloride [^114ZCpJE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance

Studies indicate that buspirone hydrochloride tablets, USP are less sedating than other anxiolytics and that it does not produce significant functional impairment. However, its CNS effects in any individual patient may not be predictable. Therefore, patients should be cautioned about operating an automobile or using complex machinery until they are reasonably certain that buspirone treatment does not affect them adversely.

While formal studies of the interaction of buspirone hydrochloride, USP with alcohol indicate that buspirone does not increase alcohol-induced impairment in motor and mental performance, it is prudent to avoid concomitant use of alcohol and buspirone.

Potential for Withdrawal Reactions in Sedative/Hypnotic/Anxiolytic Drug-Dependent Patients

Because buspirone hydrochloride tablets, USP do not exhibit cross-tolerance with benzodiazepines and other common sedative/hypnotic drugs, it will not block the withdrawal syndrome often seen with cessation of therapy with these drugs. Therefore, before starting therapy with buspirone hydrochloride tablets, USP, it is advisable to withdraw patients gradually, especially patients who have been using a CNS-depressant drug chronically, from their prior treatment. Rebound or withdrawal symptoms may occur over varying time periods, depending in part on the type of drug, and its effective half-life of elimination.

The syndrome of withdrawal from sedative/hypnotic/anxiolytic drugs can appear as any combination of irritability, anxiety, agitation, insomnia, tremor, abdominal cramps, muscle cramps, vomiting, sweating, flu-like symptoms without fever, and occasionally, even as seizures.

Possible Concerns Related to Buspirone's Binding to Dopamine Receptors

Because buspirone can bind to central dopamine receptors, a question has been raised about its potential to cause acute and chronic changes in dopamine-mediated neurological function (e.g., dystonia, pseudo-parkinsonism, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia). Clinical experience in controlled trials has failed to identify any significant neuroleptic-like activity; however, a syndrome of restlessness, appearing shortly after initiation of treatment, has been reported in some small fraction of buspirone-treated patients. The syndrome may be explained in several ways. For example, buspirone may increase central noradrenergic activity; alternatively, the effect may be attributable to dopaminergic effects (i.e., represent akathisia). See ADVERSE REACTIONS, Postmarketing Experience.

### Congenital chloride diarrhea needs to be distinguished from bartter and gitelman syndrome [^116rxHin]. Journal of Human Genetics (2018). Low credibility.

Pseudo-Bartter/Gitelman syndrome (p-BS/GS) encompasses a clinically heterogeneous group of inherited or acquired disorders similar to Bartter syndrome (BS) or Gitelman syndrome (GS), both renal salt-losing tubulopathies. Phenotypic overlap frequently occurs between p-BS/GS and BS/GS, which are difficult to diagnose based on their clinical presentation and require genetic tests for accurate diagnosis. In addition, p-BS/GS can occur as a result of other inherited diseases such as cystic fibrosis, autosomal dominant hypocalcemia, Dent disease, or congenital chloride diarrhea (CCD). However, the detection of the variants in genes other than known BS/GS-causing genes by conventional Sanger sequencing requires substantial time and resources. We studied 27 cases clinically diagnosed with BS/GS, but with negative genetic tests for known BS/GS genes. We conducted targeted sequencing for 22 genes including genes responsible for tubulopathies and other inherited diseases manifesting with p-BS/GS symptoms. We detected the SLC26A3 gene variants responsible for CCD in two patients. In Patient 1, we found the SLC26A3 compound heterozygous variants: c.354delC and c.1008insT. In Patient 2, we identified the compound heterozygous variants: c.877G > A, p.(Glu293Lys), and c.1008insT. Our results suggest that a comprehensive genetic screening system using targeted sequencing is useful for the diagnosis of patients with p-BS/GS with alternative genetic origins.

### Contradiction between genetic analysis and diuretic loading test in type I bartter syndrome: a case report [^117Dmw8D]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

We had experienced a case of genetically type I BS, but the clinical phenotype was mild, and the diuretic loading test results reflected the clinical phenotype. In some atypical cases of BS, the genotype may appear to diverge from the phenotype. For instance, in this case, the diuretic loading test was unable to confirm the results of genetic analysis with regard to BS type. Type I BS (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man [OMIM] 601,678) is caused by a mutation in the SLC12A1 gene that encodes the apical furosemide-sensitive Na–K–2Cl cotransporter (NKCC2). In type I BS, as a result of NKCC2 damage, urine excretion of Na and Cl generally does not increase with the administration of furosemide. However, our results showed a clear increase in these markers. We reasoned that as ours was a mild case, NKCC2 dysfunction might be only partial, resulting in a modest response to furosemide. Up to now, diuretic loading tests have generally been considered useful in diagnosing type I BS. However, in fact, there have been no large-scale studies involving diuretic loading tests in patients genetically diagnosed with type I BS; therefore, the usefulness of diuretic loading tests in mild cases such as ours remains open to question.

Another reason for the discrepancy we observed between genetic and diuretic loading tests might be the lack of standard protocols and interpretation guidelines for diuretic loading tests. In many previous studies, patients preparing for such tests were administered fresh water or a dilute saline solution to ensure sufficient urinary flow. However, in our case, blood potassium levels were low, and we were concerned that the test might trigger severe hypokalaemia, so we changed the protocol to include oral administration of KCl and an infusion of electrolytes prior to the test. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility of potassium and chloride affecting the diuretic test results. Furthermore, there are currently no clear standards for the dose of diuretics to be administered or for the definition of a reaction. We therefore need to continue gathering data on how the results of diuretic loading tests are affected by individual patient characteristics.

### Serum chloride levels in critical illness-the hidden story [^113BeD5t]. Intensive Care Medicine Experimental (2018). Low credibility.

Among other possible causes, decreased serum chloride can be caused by Bartter's syndrome, post-hypercapnic alkalosis, cystic fibrosis, milk-alkali syndrome, Cushing's syndrome, villous adenoma, fluid overload, Addison's disease, beer potomania, tea and toast syndrome, vomiting, nasogastric suction-induced fluid loss, psychogenic polydipsia, acute diarrhea, hypothyroidism, Gitelman's syndrome, high-output ileostomy drainage, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretions, adrenal insufficiency, gastric fistula, hyperaldosteronism, water intoxication and salt-losing nephropathy. In addition, decreased serum chloride can be caused by medications such as sodium bicarbonate, dextrose 50%, nadolol / bendroflumethiazide, imipenem / cilastatin, oxycodone, chlorthalidone, bumetanide, indapamide, ziprasidone, furosemide, decitabine and oxycodone ER.

### Polymyxin B [^115N8VZf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Polymyxin B for Injection, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

Electrolyte and Acid/Base Abnormalities

Postmarketing cases of renal tubulopathy (i.e. Pseudo-Bartter syndrome) have been identified with the use of intravenous polymyxins, including polymyxin B (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). All cases reported hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Other common findings included hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, increased potassium in the urine, normal serum creatinine, and normal blood pressure. Consider electrolyte monitoring during treatment. Normalization of electrolyte abnormalities may require drug discontinuation.

### Antenatal bartter syndrome: a new compound heterozygous mutation in exon 2 of KCNJ1 gene [^111doJQJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 30+6/7-week infant was born by vaginal delivery to a 21-year-old primigravida with pregnancy complicated by polyhydramnios. The infant developed polyuria and significant weight loss in the first 2weeks of life despite appropriate fluid management. He developed hyponatraemia, hypochloraemia, transient hyperkalaemia and prerenal azotaemia with metabolic acidosis. On further evaluation, he had elevated plasma renin and aldosterone levels. Bartter syndrome was considered in the differential diagnosis. Bartter syndrome gene panel revealed a rare compound heterozygous mutation in exon 2 of the KCNJ1 gene (Lys186Glu/Thr71Met), suggesting antenatal Bartter syndrome (type 2). The infant developed late-onset hypokalaemia and metabolic alkalosis by week 4 of life. He regained birth weight by week 3 of life but failed to thrive (10–20g/kg/day) despite high caloric intake (140 kcal/kg/day). His electrolyte abnormalities gradually improved, and he was discharged home without the need for electrolyte supplements or medications.

### Diagnosis and management of bartter syndrome: executive summary of the consensus and recommendations from the European Rare Kidney Disease Reference Network working group for tubular disorders [^111c5Vj5]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

Bartter syndrome is a rare inherited salt-losing renal tubular disorder characterized by secondary hyperaldosteronism with hypokalemic and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis and low to normal blood pressure. The primary pathogenic mechanism is defective salt reabsorption predominantly in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. There is significant variability in the clinical expression of the disease, which is genetically heterogenous with 5 different genes described to date. Despite considerable phenotypic overlap, correlations of specific clinical characteristics with the underlying molecular defects have been demonstrated, generating gene-specific phenotypes. As with many other rare disease conditions, there is a paucity of clinical studies that could guide diagnosis and therapeutic interventions. In this expert consensus document, the authors have summarized the currently available knowledge and propose clinical indicators to assess and improve quality of care.

### Persistent renal dysfunction post-chemotherapy: a diagnostic conundrum in pediatric cancer survivorship-a case report [^115JXiet]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Summary of reported cases with late-onset type II bartter syndrome

ACEI, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; CKD, chronic kidney disease; ESKD, end-stage kidney disease, NSAIDs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; MRAs, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists

The mainstay treatment of Bartter syndrome involves correcting volume depletion and electrolyte imbalances, preventing nephrocalcinosis, and avoiding nephrotoxic agents. To maintain fluid status, patients are encouraged to consume adequate amounts of water, and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors could be considered for severe polyuria. Potassium supplementation is typically necessary to prevent severe hypokalemia, and potassium-sparing diuretics help raise serum K + levels and reverse metabolic alkalosis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) may be used if the presence of proteinuria. We delivered oral potassium supplementation (5 mEq/kg/day) to maintain serum potassium levels, spironolactone to decrease renal K + excretion and reverse metabolic alkalosis, along with ACEI to control proteinuria. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug was discontinued due to concerns regarding advanced chronic kidney disease.

The strengths of this case report lie in its detailed description of a rare presentation of late-onset type II Bartter syndrome in a pediatric patient with a history of chemotherapy, adding to the limited literature on this topic. However, the limitations of this report include its single case nature, which may limit the generalizability of the findings, and the speculative nature of the exact mechanisms by which the identified variants and previous chemotherapy exposure contributed to the atypical presentation and rapid progression of chronic kidney disease.

This case emphasizes the need for close monitoring and management of electrolyte imbalances and renal function in pediatric cancer survivors, particularly those with a history of nephrotoxic chemotherapy. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for rare inherited renal tubular disorders when faced with persistent electrolyte abnormalities and renal dysfunction in this patient population. Early recognition and appropriate management of these conditions are crucial to prevent further kidney damage and optimize patient outcomes.

Colistin-induced nephrotoxicity is commonly associated with elevation of serum creatinine level or a reduction of urine output. Uncommonly, tubulopathy associated with colistin has been reported. Here we present a unique case of a 46-year-old man who developed polyuria, hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia, hypomagnesemia and metabolic alkalosis after 3days of therapy with intravenous colistimethate sodium. After ruling out other causes, a diagnosis of colistin-induced acquired Bartter syndrome was made. The patient required daily aggressive intravenous repletion of fluids and electrolytes. However, polyuria and metabolic abnormalities abated only after drug discontinuation.

### Identification of compound mutations of SLC12A3 gene in a Chinese pedigree with gitelman syndrome exhibiting bartter syndrome-liked phenotypes [^111ub7zU]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with Gitelman syndrome have a tendency of glucose intolerance and impaired insulin secretion. Potassium plays an important role in the regulation of insulin release. Reduced extracellular potassium ion concentration could suppress the insulin secretion and release via ATP-sensitive potassium channel on beta-cells. Long-term low potassium and magnesium level is one of the factors for diabetes development. In addition, hyperaldosteronism was also reported to promote insulin resistance. Studies have indicated that Gitelman syndrome can be combined with autoimmune diseases such as Graves' disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, IgA nephropathy, Sjogren's syndrome, or latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA).

The therapeutic strategy for Gitelman syndrome focuses on the correction of electrolyte disturbance, especially potassium and magnesium replacement. The level of serum magnesium may affect the severity and effect of potassium supplement. Other therapeutic options include the inhibitors of the secondary elevated RAAS, such as using non-selective or selective aldosterone antagonist spironolactone or eplerenone, or NaCl transporter blockers such as potassium-sparing diuretic aminophenidine. The loss-of-function mutations in the SLC12A3 gene result in Gitelman syndrome. Thus, the thiazide diuretics should be avoided for Gitelman syndrome patients as long-term treatment option. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NASIDs) such as indomethacin can suppress renin secretion by inhibiting renal prostaglandin E2 (PGE 2) synthesis, and ameliorate the up-regulation of aldosterone level induced by potassium supplement. It also could increase potassium level without worsening sodium and volume depletion in Gitelman syndrome patients. However, the gastrointestinal side effect and interstitial renal damage make the application to be limited.

### Clinical features and accompanying findings of pseudo-bartter syndrome in cystic fibrosis [^1139VgkX]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pseudo-Bartter syndrome (PBS) is a rare complication of cystic fibrosis (CF) and there are limited data in the literature about it. We aimed to compare clinical features and accompanying findings of patients with PBS in a large patient population.

Methods

The data were collected from the Cystic Fibrosis Registry of Turkey where 1170 CF patients were recorded in 2017. Clinical features, diagnostic test results, colonization status, complications, and genetic test results were compared in patients with and without PBS.

Results

Totally 1170 patients were recorded into the registry in 2017 and 120 (10%) of them had PBS. The mean age of diagnosis and current age of patients were significantly younger and newborn screening positivity was lower in patients with PBS (P < .001). There were no differences between the groups in terms of colonization status, mean z-scores of weight, height, BMI, and mean FEV 1 percentage. Types of genetic mutations did not differ between the two groups. Accompanying complications were more frequent in patients without PBS.

Conclusion

PBS was detected as the most common complication in the registry. It could be due to warm weather conditions of our country. It is usually seen in younger ages regardless of mutation phenotype and it could be a clue for early diagnosis of CF.

### Identification of compound mutations of SLC12A3 gene in a Chinese pedigree with gitelman syndrome exhibiting bartter syndrome-liked phenotypes [^115Pqcbb]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we reported a Chinese pedigree of Gitelman syndrome with heterozygous compound mutations of SLC12A3, exhibiting hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. However, the proband exhibited hypercalciuria and renal calcification, which made it difficult to differentiate from Bartter syndrome (especially type III). We identified variants of SLC12A3, c.433C > T (p. Arg145Cys), c.1077C > G (p. Asn359Lys), and c.1666C > T (p. Pro556Ser), but no mutations found in CLCNKA/CLCNKB, BSND, KCNJ1, CASR that are known causing Batter syndrome. Therefore, clinical diagnosis of Gitelman syndrome was made, and the identified SLC12A3 variations were predicted to contribute clinical features of Gitelman syndrome. With administration of aldosterone antagonist spironolactone, potassium and magnesium supplement, the serum potassium and magnesium was maintained in nearly normal range during fellow-up. The phenotype variability may be associated with the pathogenic variabilities of SLC12A3 mutations. Genetic analysis is a useful tool for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of such similarly-presenting diseases as Gitelman syndrome and Bartter syndrome. Further investigation is needed to provide better understanding of genotype-phenotype association of NCCT dysfunction in Gitelman syndrome.

Gitelman syndrome is a salt-losing tubulopathy with the clinical features of hypokalemic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria. Chronic hypokalemia leads to symptoms of weakness, fatigue, thirst, and paralysis. Severe cases can cause rhabdomyolysis, ventricular arrhythmias, or even sudden cardiac arrest. Gitelman syndrome is associated with dysfunction of NCCT protein encoded by SLC12A3 gene in the renal DCT. The decreased reabsorption of Na + and Cl − leads to compensatory excessive exchange through Na + /K + and Na + /H + pumps, resulting in excessive K + and H + excretion and hypokalemic alkalosis. In a small minority of Gitelman syndrome patients, mutations in the CLCNKB gene encoding the chloride channel ClC-Kb have been identified.

### Parathyroid hormone and phosphate homeostasis in patients with bartter and gitelman syndrome: an international cross-sectional study [^113kCpCo]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

In our study, high PTH levels in type I and II Bartter syndrome patients were not associated with lower serum phosphate or with higher urinary excretion of phosphate, as also observed by Landau et al. Taken together, these findings raise the possibility of renal hyporesponsiveness to PTH, which could contribute to PTH secretion. Yet, with renal hyporesponsiveness increased serum phosphate could be expected, which we did not observe.

Hyperparathyroidism in Bartter syndrome could also be secondary to prostaglandin secretion. Patients with type I and II disease produce large amounts of prostaglandins due to decreased intracellular NaCl concentration in the macula densa caused by impaired salt reabsorption via the NKCC2 pathway. Treatment of Bartter syndrome patients with NSAIDs reduces renal calcium excretion and in one report, reduces PTH levels. It is unclear in this latter study, if NSAIDs directly inhibit the parathyroid glands, or reduce PTH secretion indirectly, by inhibiting renal calcium excretion. In our study, we did not observe an association between NSAID prescription and PTH levels, nor between NSAID prescription and urinary calcium excretion.

It has also been hypothesized that higher PTH secretion in Bartter syndrome may be secondary to hyperaldosteronism. Parathyroid glands express mineralocorticoid receptors allowing stimulation of PTH secretion by aldosterone. Accordingly, mild hyperparathyroidism has been reported in patients with primary hyperaldosteronism and PTH levels in these patients decrease after adrenalectomy. This hypothesis seems unlikely in patients with salt-losing tubulopathies since patients with Gitelman syndrome, who typically have very high aldosterone levels, do not develop hyperparathyroidism. In addition, PTH levels in our cohort were not associated with treatment with aldosterone antagonists.

Finally, it has been suggested that hypokalaemia could cause hyperparathyroidism and that potassium supplementation could normalize PTH. Here again, we did not observe an inverse correlation between serum potassium and PTH. Moreover, Bartter and Gitelman syndromes are both characterized by hypokalaemia, whereas we observed hyperparathyroidism primarily in patients with Bartter syndrome.

### Severe edema after cessation of laxative abuse and use of a loop diuretic: case report [^112QiKyV]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Stimulant laxatives are the class of laxatives most often abused by patients with eating disorders. The abrupt cessation of high-dose stimulant laxatives is known to cause edema. We present the case of a patient with anorexia nervosa with binge-purge subtype who was taking ∼100 stimulant laxatives per day. Upon discontinuation of stimulant laxatives, she experienced severe peripheral edema with rapid gain of 11.6 kg over 1 week. Unique features of this case include the high quantity of stimulant laxatives consumed per day, the amount of weight gained due to edema, and the 3 month duration of edema after laxative cessation. This case report details the time course of development of edema after abrupt laxative cessation. It also details the dosing and duration of furosemide used for diuresis in order to provide a precedent to inform future care. This case calls into question the best treatment approach for patients with severe edema after laxative cessation who do not meet criteria for Pseudo Bartter syndrome.

### Chlorpromazine [^116Jve8b]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

If these symptoms become too troublesome, they can usually be controlled by a reduction of dosage or change of drug. Treatment with anti-parkinsonian agents, benzodiazepines or propranolol may be helpful.

Pseudo-parkinsonism: Symptoms may include: mask-like facies, drooling, tremors, pill rolling motion, cogwheel rigidity and shuffling gait. In most cases these symptoms are readily controlled when an anti-parkinsonism agent is administered concomitantly. Anti-parkinsonism agents should be used only when required. Generally, therapy of a few weeks to 2 or 3 months will suffice. After this time patients should be evaluated to determine their need for continued treatment. (Note: Levodopa has not been found effective in antipsychotic-induced pseudo-parkinsonism.) Occasionally, it is necessary to lower the dosage of chlorpromazine or to discontinue the drug.

Tardive Dyskinesia: As with all antipsychotic agents, tardive dyskinesia may appear in some patients on long-term therapy or may appear after drug therapy has been discontinued. The syndrome can also develop, although much less frequently, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. This syndrome appears in all age groups. Although its prevalence appears to be highest among elderly patients, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict at the inception of antipsychotic treatment which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. The symptoms are persistent and in some patients appear to be irreversible. The syndrome is characterized by rhythmical involuntary movements of the tongue, face, mouth or jaw (e.g., protrusion of tongue, puffing of cheeks, puckering of mouth, chewing movements). Sometimes these may be accompanied by involuntary movements of extremities. In rare instances, these involuntary movements of the extremities are the only manifestations of tardive dyskinesia. A variant of tardive dyskinesia, tardive dystonia, has also been described.

### Case of bartter syndrome presenting with hypokalemic periodic paralysis [^112L7EpB]. Journal of Child Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Hypokalemic periodic paralysis can occur secondarily to excessive potassium loss. Thyrotoxicosis, diuretic ingestions, hyperaldosteronism, barium poisoning, Gitelman syndrome, and Bartter syndrome are among the disorders causing secondary hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Clinical presentation of Bartter syndrome with hypokalemic periodic paralysis is rare. A 12-year-old boy was admitted to our hospital because of transient paralysis. He had been suffering from transient weakness attacks for 2 years and had had a total of 10 attacks, lasting 1 to 3 days. He had growth retardation, polyuria, and polydipsia. Laboratory examinations revealed hypokalemic alkalosis, normomagnesemia, hypercalciuria, and hyperaldosteronism. The clinical and laboratory findings were in accordance with Bartter syndrome. He has been followed up for 6 months and has suffered no further paralytic attacks under indomethacin therapy. This case highlights the importance of blood pH measurement in patients with hypokalemic periodic paralysis; it might prevent misdiagnosis and mismanagement in such diseases.

### Metabolic alkalosis pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment: core curriculum 2022 [^114bcob6]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

The patient in case 3 exhibits signs of volume depletion, along with hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. In addition, she displays inability to conserve chloride. Common causes of volume contraction with metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia include vomiting, excessive use of loop or thiazide diuretics, or an inordinate consumption of laxatives. It can also be caused by genetic disorders such as congenital chloride-losing diarrhea, Gitelman syndrome, or Bartter syndrome. This patient does not fit into any of these categories. Loss of electrolytes in sweat, specifically in hot weather, can lead to significant volume depletion and RAAS activation, leading to hypokalemia and alkalosis. The urine chloride in nonrenal causes of volume depletion and metabolic alkalosis should be very low. However, the urine chloride in this patient is elevated, meaning option (a) is not correct for Question 6.

Salt wasting due to excessive consumption of electrolyte-containing solutions should not lead to volume depletion and metabolic alkalosis, so option (b) is not correct. This patient's history did not support the presence of respiratory acidosis before or on admission, and she was not treated for it before the admission to the hospital, ruling out option (c).

Recent studies have identified kidney-specific mechanisms that contribute to the generation of metabolic alkalosis in the setting of volume contraction. These reports demonstrated that pendrin, which is critical to Cl − absorption (and HCO 3 − secretion) by B-intercalated cells in volume-depleted states, is profoundly downregulated in cystic fibrosis. a Pendrin downregulation impairs the ability of the kidney collecting duct to absorb salt and enhance HCO 3 − secretion (Fig 1). This further exacerbates the magnitude of volume contraction and metabolic alkalosis due to renal Cl − loss and impaired HCO 3 − secretion into the collecting duct, respectively. The loss of Cl − in the urine consequent to the inactivation of pendrin in the setting of volume depletion mimics a pseudo-Bartter picture, which has been described in cystic fibrosis patients, thus option (d) is the best answer to Question 6. The patient was admitted for the evaluation and treatment of hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis with volume contraction, and received 6 liters of saline along with 120 mEq of KCl over 48 hours. She was discharged with a serum HCO 3 − of 27 and K + of 3.8 mEq/L, and a venous blood gas of 7.41.

### Episodic seasonal pseudo-bartter syndrome in cystic fibrosis [^117UNo3b]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Pseudo-Bartter syndrome (PBS) describes an uncommon but well recognised complication of cystic fibrosis leading to hypochloraemic, hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis. Pseudo-Bartter syndrome is usually seen at initial presentation or within the first two years of life in children with cystic fibrosis. Risk factors for development of PBS include warm weather conditions, severe respiratory or pancreatic disease and gastrointestinal losses (e.g. vomiting and diarrhoea). PBS is rare in older children and adolescents although epidemics have been associated with heat wave conditions in warmer climates. In this era of climate change, it is crucial that clinicians consider Pseudo-Bartter syndrome when patients with cystic fibrosis present unwell during summer.

### Pathophysiology of antenatal Bartter's syndrome [^114Rac1T]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Antenatal Bartter syndrome (aBS) is a heterogenous disease resulting from defective ion transport in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. Novel insights into the pathophysiology, as well as the recent identification of a novel genetic cause of aBS, merit an update on this topic.

Recent Findings

In aBS, severe salt losing is further aggravated by defective salt sensing in the macula densa, where a reduced tubular salt concentration is perceived and glomerular filtration is increased instead of decreased. As patients with aBS come of age, there is an increased incidence of proteinuria and impaired renal function. Moreover, we recently reported a new form of aBS. Indeed, we described a series of nine families in whom pregnancies with male fetuses where complicated by acute polyhydramnios, preterm delivery and with severe but transient polyuria. We identified mutations in melanoma-associated antigen D2 in all study participants and showed, in vivo and in vitro, reduced expression of the furosemide and thiazide sensitive transporters sodium-potassium-2-chloride cotransporter and sodium chloride cotransporter, respectively.

Summary

Genetic studies revealed the complexity of ion transport in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle and will help to clarify the pathophysiology, which is essential to design new therapies.

### Classic bartter syndrome: a rare cause of failure to thrive in a child [^115o7hVq]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Bartter syndrome is a group of rare autosomal-recessive disorders caused by a defect in distal tubule transport of sodium and chloride. Blood gases and plasma electrolytes raise suspicion of this diagnosis and the definitive diagnosis is made by genetic study. Early treatment improves prognosis. The authors present the case of an 11-month-old child with early failure to thrive and severe regurgitation. Blood gases revealed hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis, hyponatraemia and hypokalaemia. Blood pressure was normal and polyuria was documented. She began therapy with potassium chloride supplementation and indomethacin. There was clinical improvement and plasma potassium and bicarbonate normalised. The molecular study confirmed it was the classic form of Bartter syndrome. Despite being rare in clinical practice, which may lead to unnecessary medical investigation and diagnosis delay, in a child with failure to thrive, hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis and hypokalaemia, this diagnosis must be considered.

### PseudoBartter syndrome in eating disorders [^113Ey4rK]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

PseudoBartter's syndrome, a complex pattern of seemingly unrelated metabolic abnormalities, is frequently seen in patients with eating disorders, particularly those who indulge in purging behaviors. We present two cases that, despite divergent background histories and clinical presentations, possess the unifying pathophysiology that ultimately leads to this syndrome.

Method

Case report and review of literature pertaining to Bartter's and PseudoBartter's syndromes.

Results

Purging behaviors commonly result in a state of profound dehydration and chloride depletion that leads to the metabolic abnormalities characteristic of inheritable sodium and chloride renal tubular transport disorders. In the eating disorder patient, these abnormalities lead to a propensity towards marked edema formation.

Discussion

The metabolic and clinical manifestations of PseudoBartter's syndrome are seen more commonly than previously thought. It is important to appreciate that a complex self-perpetuating pathophysiology leads to the hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis characteristic of PseudoBartter syndrome. The metabolic abnormalities characteristic of this phenomenon should therefore be viewed in this context and the resulting predilection towards marked edema formation should be borne in mind.

### Pseudo-bartter syndrome as the initial presentation of cystic fibrosis in children: an important diagnosis not to be missed [^1143JZm6]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Pseudo-Bartter syndrome (PBS) is characterised by hyponatraemic, hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis that mimics Bartter syndrome, without renal tubular disease. We present a case of an infant with a positive cystic fibrosis (CF) newborn screening, hospitalised during the summer with dehydration, oliguria and apathy. Blood analysis revealed hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis, hypokalaemia and hyponatraemia. Urine analysis showed leucocyturia with reduced sodium and chloride excretion fraction, and urinary culture was positive for Citrobacter koseri After antibiotherapy and intravenous rehydration with additional supplementation of sodium and chloride, the patient recovered completely. PBS is one of CF complications that is especially prevalent in infants and young children with increased sweating and/or other causes of additional loss of sodium and chloride. Clinical awareness of this syndrome and its strong clinical suspicion are extremely important for an early diagnosis and treatment of CF, particularly in countries where the universal screening of CF is not routinely performed.

### Future considerations based on the information from barrter's and Gitelman's syndromes [^112FSr2X]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Bartter and Gitelman syndromes are typical normotensive salt losing hypokalaemic tubulopathies. Their pathogenesis was gradually deciphered in the past 5 decades, first by typical salt balance studies and histopathology, followed by genetic characterization and discovery of the affected different ion channels. Although the different genotypic subtypes were originally thought to show a similar phenotype, important clinical and biochemical differences can now be found. New findings on the regulation of these channels, as well as the recent discovery of newly affected genes, merit an update on this topic.

Recent Findings

Na-K-2CL cotransporter and NaCl cotransporter, the two main luminal channels in the thick ascending limb and distal convoluted tubule were found to be regulated by Ste 20-related proline alanine-rich kinase and oxidative stress response kinase. Knockout mice to these channels express a Bartter-like phenotype. MAGE-D2 is new gene found to cause severe polyhydramnios and transient postnatal Bartter-like syndrome. Variants in the different channels causing Bartter syndromes/Gitelman syndromes may also confer susceptibility for hypertension or protect against it.

Summary

It remains to be determined if polymorphism or epigenetic changes in these genes and proteins may affect salt handling, explaining, apart from Bartter syndromes and Gitelman syndromes, also hypertension or stroke tendency, or both.

### Contradiction between genetic analysis and diuretic loading test in type I bartter syndrome: a case report [^111feVQ9]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

After admission, KCL was administered 5 mEq/kg/day as oral and intravenous infusion therapy for hypokalaemia. About 3 days after admission, he showed an improvement in potassium level associated with the disappearance of lower extremity pain. Blood pressure was consistently normal. Serum potassium levels were normalized on oral therapy of K 2 mEq/kg/day and spironolactone 1.5 mg/kg/day.

As he had hypokalaemia, hypercalciuria, and metabolic alkalosis caused by kidney excretion but showed normal blood pressure and Mg level (2.8 mg/dL), BS was suspected. Because of his age at onset and the mildness of his symptoms, he was first suspected to have type III BS, but a new mutation (c.2762G > T p. Gly921Val, c.3233C > A p. Thr1078Lys) in the SLC12A1 gene, which is associated with type I BS, was detected by targeted sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Furthermore, The PolyPhen-2 and SIFT programs both predicted that this mutation would cause disease. Based on these results, we diagnosed type I BS associated with a compound heterozygous mutation.

Because the onset and clinical course of this case was different from a typical case of type I BS, the patient underwent a diuretic loading test according to a protocol described elsewhere to confirm the clinical phenotype in terms of tubular function. If this case was a typical case of type I BS, the patient showed no response to furosemide; however, response to furosemide was normal, which was inconsistent with type I BS. The response to thiazide was also normal, which ruled out GS and inconsistent with type III BS (Table 1).

Table 1
Results of diuretic loading tests a

However, the response to furosemide and thiazide was normal in this case, which was inconsistent with type I BS and type III BS and ruled out GS

### Salt-losing tubulopathies in children: what's new, what's controversial? [^1166MPZ1]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Renal tubulopathies provide insights into the inner workings of the kidney, yet also pose therapeutic challenges. Because of the central nature of sodium in tubular transport physiology, disorders of sodium handling may affect virtually all aspects of the homeostatic functions of the kidney. Yet, owing to the rarity of these disorders, little clinical evidence regarding treatment exists. Consequently, treatment can vary widely between individual physicians and centers and is based mainly on understanding of renal physiology, reported clinical observations, and individual experiences. Salt-losing tubulopathies can affect all tubular segments, from the proximal tubule to the collecting duct. But the more frequently observed disorders are Bartter and Gitelman syndrome, which affect salt transport in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop and/or the distal convoluted tubule, and these disorders generate the greatest controversies regarding management. Here, we review clinical and molecular aspects of salt-losing tubulopathies and discuss novel insights provided mainly by genetic investigations and retrospective clinical reviews. Additionally, we discuss controversial topics in the management of these disorders to highlight areas of importance for future clinical trials. International collaboration will be required to perform clinical studies to inform the treatment of these rare disorders.

### An improved terminology and classification of bartter-like syndromes [^114uNrFe]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2008). Medium credibility.

This Review outlines a terminology and classification of Bartter-like syndromes that is based on the underlying causes of these inherited salt-losing tubulopathies and is, therefore, more clinically relevant than the classical definition. Three major types of salt-losing tubulopathy can be defined: distal convoluted tubule dysfunction leading to hypokalemia (currently known as Gitelman or Bartter syndrome), the more-severe condition of polyuric loop dysfunction (often referred to as antenatal Bartter or hyperprostaglandin E syndrome), and the most-severe condition of combined loop and distal convoluted tubule dysfunction (antenatal Bartter or hyperprostaglandin E syndrome with sensorineural deafness). These three subtypes can each be further subdivided according to the identity of the defective ion transporter or channel: the sodium-chloride cotransporter NCCT or the chloride channel ClC-Kb in distal convoluted tubule dysfunction; the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter NKCC2 or the renal outer medullary potassium channel in loop dysfunction; and the chloride channels ClC-Ka and ClC-Kb or their beta-subunit Barttin in combined distal convoluted tubule and loop dysfunction. This new classification should help clinicians to better understand the pathophysiology of these syndromes and choose the most appropriate treatment for affected patients, while avoiding potentially harmful diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

### A physiologic-based approach to the evaluation of a patient with hyperkalemia [^114dKtnY]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia generally is attributable to cell shifts or abnormal renal potassium excretion. Cell shifts account for transient increases in serum potassium levels, whereas sustained hyperkalemia generally is caused by decreased renal potassium excretion. Impaired renal potassium excretion can be caused by a primary decrease in distal sodium delivery, a primary decrease in mineralocorticoid level or activity, or abnormal cortical collecting duct function. Excessive potassium intake is an infrequent cause of hyperkalemia by itself, but can worsen the severity of hyperkalemia when renal excretion is impaired. Before concluding that a cell shift or renal defect in potassium excretion is present, pseudohyperkalemia should be excluded.

### Metabolic alkalosis pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment: core curriculum 2022 [^111EuLrC]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Some important causes of metabolic alkalosis with variable volume status include hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, refeeding syndrome, alkali loading in individuals with reduced GFR, and nonreabsorbable anions such as penicillin and carbenicillin.

Patients suspected of having primary aldosteronism require measurements of renin and aldosterone at baseline and, if necessary, following the saline suppression test. The diagnosis of Bartter, Gitelman, cystic fibrosis, and Pendred syndromes necessitates genetic testing. Diagnosing congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11β- or 17α-hydroxylase deficiency requires specific tests measuring the blood concentration of 11-deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, renin, and aldosterone, as well as cortisol and its 17-hydroxylated precursors.

Returning to case 2, thiazide overuse can produce hypercalcemia due to increased calcium reabsorption in the proximal tubule, but will also cause other electrolyte disturbances such as profound hypokalemia and hyponatremia, which are not observed in this patient. Further, the magnitude of hypercalcemia by thiazides is not expected to exceed levels above 14 mg/dL. Thus, option (a) is not the correct answer to Question 3.

Because the patient's PTH level is borderline low, primary hyperparathyroidism as a cause of hypercalcemia is unlikely. Further, a majority of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism develop nongap metabolic acidosis due to the direct inhibitory effects of PTH on proximal tubule function, hence option (b) is not correct. In hypercalcemia caused by granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis, vitamin D levels are significantly increased, which is not the case in this patient; thus, option (c) is not correct. Because the PTH-related peptide levels are undetectable, option (e) is incorrect.

The patient's findings of hypercalcemia (PTH-independent), metabolic alkalosis, and decreased kidney function are most likely caused by calcium alkali (milk alkali) syndrome. This condition is triggered by the ingestion of calcium along with an absorbable alkali. The disease was initially described in patients treated for peptic ulcer disease who used milk and sodium bicarbonate for symptomatic relief, but the current dominant etiology is associated with the use of over-the-counter calcium-containing medications for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis or heartburn. Because of the change in the causative agents over the years, several scholars have suggested changing the name to calcium-alkali syndrome to accurately reflect the current pathogenesis of this disorder. Thus, the correct answer to Question 3 is (d).

### Bartter syndrome as natural experiment if furosemide (re) opens the ductus arteriosus [^116PDe2s]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Impact

Furosemide increases renal prostaglandin synthesis and animal studies show reopening of the ductus arteriosus in rats exposed to furosemide. Nevertheless, large cohort studies in preterm infants do not support this hypothesis. Bartter syndrome, a rare genetic renal disorder with excessive fluid and salt-loss, is similar to continuous furosemide exposure. We hypothesize that Bartter syndrome could be considered as a natural experiment. Although most infants with Bartter syndrome are born prematurely, there are no cases found in literature with a patent ductus arteriosus which suggest that the contribution of furosemide to (re)opening of the ductus arteriosus in humans might be negligible.

### Rare co-occurrence of severe vitamin A deficiency in an early adolescent girl with bartter syndrome [^11599HiY]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

We report a rare case of an early adolescent girl with Bartter syndrome presenting with severe vitamin A deficiency, characterised by decreased visual acuity, xerophthalmia and corneal ulceration. The deficiency appears to have resulted from poor nutritional intake due to a restricted diet, unhealthy dietary choices compounded by gastrointestinal discomfort and the challenges posed by Bartter syndrome. The patient, diagnosed in her early infancy with Bartter syndrome, exhibited features typical of this inherited renal tubular disorder, including electrolyte imbalance, polyuria and failure to thrive. Her long-standing gastrointestinal discomfort, likely related to high-dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (indomethacin) and oral potassium supplements, further compromised her nutritional intake. She was managed with high-dose vitamin A supplementation, resulting in partial visual recovery. This case underscores the importance of monitoring fat-soluble vitamin levels in Bartter syndrome patients, who are at risk for malabsorption and dietary deficiencies. We suggest that routine screening for Vitamin A deficiency in patients with Barter syndrome may be beneficial, though this recommendation is derived from our observation from this case rather than established evidence.

### A thiazide test for the diagnosis of renal tubular hypokalemic disorders [^112ayWDV]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Although the diagnosis of Gitelman syndrome (GS) and Bartter syndrome (BS) is now feasible by genetic analysis, implementation of genetic testing for these disorders is still hampered by several difficulties, including large gene dimensions, lack of hot-spot mutations, heavy workup time, and costs. This study evaluated in a cohort of patients with genetically proven GS or BS diagnostic sensibility and specificity of a diuretic test with oral hydrochlorothiazide (HCT test). Forty-one patients with GS (22 adults, aged 25 to 57; 19 children-adolescents, aged 7 to 17) and seven patients with BS (five type I, two type III) were studied; three patients with "pseudo-BS" from surreptitious diuretic intake (two patients) or vomiting (one patient) were also included. HCT test consisted of the administration of 50 mg of HCT orally (1 mg/kg in children-adolescents) and measurement of the maximal diuretic-induced increase over basal in the subsequent 3 h of chloride fractional clearance. All but three patients with GS but no patients with BS and pseudo-BS showed blunted (< 2.3%) response to HCT; patients with BS and the two patients with pseudo-BS from diuretic intake had increased response to HCT. No overlap existed between patients with GS and both patients with BS and pseudo-BS. The response to HCT test is blunted in patients with GS but not in patients with BS or nongenetic hypokalemia. In patients with the highly selected phenotype of normotensive hypokalemic alkalosis, abnormal HCT test allows prediction with a very high sensitivity and specificity of the Gitelman genotype and may avoid genotyping.

### Persistent renal dysfunction post-chemotherapy: a diagnostic conundrum in pediatric cancer survivorship-a case report [^113yUFK7]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Late-onset type II Bartter syndrome is an exceedingly rare condition, with only six documented cases presenting symptoms and signs beyond infancy. We report a unique case of late-onset type II Bartter syndrome with an atypical presentation and clinical course following chemotherapy treatment during childhood.

Case presentation

A 10-year-old boy, diagnosed with hepatoblastoma at age 2 and treated with cisplatin and epirubicin, presented with polyuria, polydipsia, failure to thrive, and electrolyte imbalances. He exhibited hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and elevated urinary excretion of sodium, chloride, calcium, and magnesium. Whole exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing identified compound heterozygous variants in the KCNJ1 gene, confirming the diagnosis of type II Bartter syndrome. The patient's clinical presentation was distinct from previously reported cases, with an absence of nephrocalcinosis, unusually small and hyperechoic kidneys, and a substantial decline in kidney function. Treatment included oral potassium supplementation, spironolactone, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.

Conclusions

This case highlights the importance of considering late-onset Bartter syndrome in patients with a history of chemotherapy presenting with persistent electrolyte imbalances and ongoing renal dysfunction. The atypical features and rapid progression of chronic kidney disease in this patient may be attributed to the deleterious nature of the identified variants and the potential impact of previous chemotherapy on kidney susceptibility to damage. Careful monitoring and management of electrolyte imbalances and renal function are crucial in such cases.

### Association between activating mutations of calcium-sensing receptor and Bartter's syndrome [^1149qGoL]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

Bartter's syndrome is a heterogeneous disorder characterised by deficient renal reabsorption of sodium and chloride, and hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis with hyper-reninaemia and hyperaldosteronaemia. Mutations in several ion transporters and channels have been associated with the pathogenesis of Bartter's syndrome. We describe two hypocalcaemic patients with deficient parathyroid hormone secretion who also showed characteristics of Bartter's syndrome. We found activating mutations of the gene for the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) in both patients. Activation of this calcium-sensing receptor inhibits the activity of a renal outer-medullary potassium channel that is mutated in type 2 Bartter's syndrome. We therefore suggest that some activating mutations of CASR could provide new mechanisms for the development of Bartter's syndrome.

### Chlorpromazine hci [^112R3d33]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

If these symptoms become too troublesome, they can usually be controlled by a reduction of dosage or change of drug. Treatment with anti-parkinsonian agents, benzodiazepines or propranolol may be helpful.

Pseudo-parkinsonism

Symptoms may include: mask-like facies, drooling, tremors, pillrolling motion, cogwheel rigidity and shuffling gait. In most cases, these symptoms are readily controlled when an anti-parkinsonism agent is administered concomitantly. Anti-parkinsonism agents should be used only when required. Generally, therapy of a few weeks to 2 or 3 months will suffice. After this time, patients should be evaluated to determine their need for continued treatment. (Note: Levodopa has not been found effective in antipsychotic-induced pseudo-parkinsonism.) Occasionally it is necessary to lower the dosage of chlorpromazine or to discontinue the drug.

Tardive Dyskinesia

As with all antipsychotic agents, tardive dyskinesia may appear in some patients on long-term therapy or may appear after drug therapy has been discontinued. The syndrome can also develop, although much less frequently, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. This syndrome appears in all age groups. Although its prevalence appears to be highest among elderly patients, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict at the inception of antipsychotic treatment which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. The symptoms are persistent and in some patients appear to be irreversible. The syndrome is characterized by rhythmical involuntary movements of the tongue, face, mouth or jaw (e.g., protrusion of tongue, puffing of cheeks, puckering of mouth, chewing movements). Sometimes these may be accompanied by involuntary movements of extremities. In rare instances, these involuntary movements of the extremities are the only manifestations of tardive dyskinesia. A variant of tardive dyskinesia, tardive dystonia, has also been described.

### Neonatal pseudo-bartter syndrome due to maternal eating disorder [^115bqf17]. Journal of Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

A total of 4 of 153 low birth weight infants at our hospital were found to have pseudo-Bartter syndrome in 2005 and 2006. The neonates (two of whom were twins; light for gestational age 2, appropriate for gestational age 1 and small for gestational age 1) showed symptoms of apnea and/or poor feeding or patent ductus arteriosus, which disappeared by day 4. Hypokalemia, hypochloremia and metabolic alkalosis normalized by day 8. The mothers had repeatedly rushed to the restroom after eating while in hospital, and were lighter at delivery than before pregnancy; however, vomiting was not observed. The mothers had several stress factors related to pregnancy, and all recovered from the eating disorder after delivery. Urinary Cl/creatinine (mequiv. mg(-1)) and serum Mg in the infants were < 0.1 and 1.6 to 2.3 mg per 100 ml, respectively. Eating disorder during pregnancy may have caused Bartter-like syndrome and weight loss, and led to the same syndrome and intrauterine growth retardation in the offspring. Therefore, a hidden maternal eating disorder may underlie neonatal pseudo-Bartter syndrome.

### Polymyxin B-induced bartter syndrome [^116kivnC]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Bartter syndrome is a genetic disorder characterised by chloride-unresponsive metabolic alkalosis, hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia and hypercalciuria. While it commonly presents antenatally or in early infancy, sometimes, drugs can induce a state similar to Bartter syndrome in any age group, called acquired Bartter syndrome. Polymyxins and aminoglycosides are the most commonly implicated drugs. Polymyxin B and polymyxin E (popularly known as colistin) are the two chemically similar polymyxins that are commonly used clinically. While colistin is frequently associated with nephrotoxicity, polymyxin B is generally considered less nephrotoxic. This difference is due to the way these two drugs are handled by the kidneys. In this case report, we discuss a middle-aged male who developed Bartter syndrome due to polymyxin B, which resolved on discontinuation of the drug, and re-appeared after its re-introduction later. This case exemplifies the nephrotoxicity caused by polymyxin B and the need for vigilance when using this drug.

### Autopsy report on pseudo-bartter syndrome with renal calcification induced by diuretics and diet pills [^1133Geru]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

A woman in her mid-forties had repeated vomiting and diarrhoea accompanied by muscle weakness soon after she started taking seven different diet pills imported from Thailand. After she had taken the pills for 8 days, respiratory depression progressed rapidly to arrest. Blood tests at the Emergency Department showed severe hypokalaemia with metabolic alkalosis. We diagnosed that she had developed pseudo-Bartter syndrome from the findings based on ionic abnormalities and high renin and aldosterone levels, and hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular apparatus. A postmortem blood analysis indicated subtherapeutic levels of furosemide. We concluded that the patient died from pseudo-Bartter syndrome, which was triggered by chronic self-administration of furosemide and aggravated by the diet pills. This is the first pseudo-Bartter syndrome autopsy report to show histological localisation of calcification in the kidneys.

### Hyperkalemia: pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences [^116K12bP]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications

These molecular processes explain why hyperkalemia invariably occurs in response to stimuli that limit any of five key parameters (Figure 1): (i) glomerular filtration rate, (ii) tubular flow rate, (iii) sodium delivery to the distal nephron, (iv) the expression of potassium and sodium channels in the apical cell membrane and the sodium–potassium pump in the basolateral membrane (controlled by aldosterone signalling) and (v) urinary pH.

FIGURE 1
Pathogenesis of hyperkalemia: mechanisms in the distal nephron. Factors that can cause hyperkalemia are in red text. These perturb one or more of five key variables: glomerular filtration, urine flow, sodium delivery to the distal nephron, expression of aldosterone-sensitive ion channels and transporters and urinary pH. PHAI, type I pseudohypoaldosteronism; CNI, calcineurin inhibitor.

In clinical practice, the first three of these are frequently encountered together, explaining the pathogenesis of hyperkalemia in acute kidney injury (AKI). The normal physiological response to volume depletion drives upregulation of aldosterone synthesis, so that any reductions in (i)–(iii) are offset by increases in (iv), maintaining potassium homoeostasis. Hyperkalemia ensues when this response is prevented, for example, by renin–angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors or MR blockers.

Hyperkalemia can occur when NCC activity is stimulated, leading to reduced reabsorption of sodium through the electrogenic pathway. The archetypal example of this is type II pseudohypoaldosteronism (Gordon's syndrome), in which inherited mutations in the Wnk-SPAK kinase cascade or the KLHL3–CUL3 ubiquitin ligase complex that regulates it lead to the constitutive phosphorylation (and therefore activation) of NCC. More commonly, this syndrome, characterized by hypertension, hyperkalemia and hyperchloremic acidosis, may be acquired by renal transplant recipients taking the calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus. Tacrolimus indirectly activates NCC by inactivating negative regulators in the KLHL3–CUL3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Alternatively, hyperkalemia may occur when ENaC activity is inhibited by drugs (e.g. amiloride, trimethoprim and pentamidine) in adrenal disease (because of impaired aldosterone synthesis) or by heritable mutations inactivating ENaC or MR (type I pseudohypoaldosteronism).

Learning Points

A pseudo-Cushing syndrome should always be considered in patients with endogenous hypercortisolism
Patients with a pseudo-Cushing syndrome can have symptoms associated with endogenous hypercortisolism resembling true Cushing syndrome
The results of first-line screening tests for Cushing syndrome can be influenced by the use of concomitant medication (eg, antiepileptic drugs can cause a false-positive DST)
Midnight salivary cortisol levels and the second-line dexamethasone-CRH test can be useful to differentiate pseudo-Cushing syndrome from ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome

### Genetic testing in the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease: recommendations for clinical practice [^112jD7gh]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical benefit of genetic testing

In patients with a clinical diagnosis of tubulopathy, genetic testing establishes a precise diagnosis, which has high relevance for clinical management and prognosis and in some cases can end diagnostic odysseys. The importance in clinical management is particularly true for diseases with a perinatal presentation with life-threatening situations (antenatal Bartter syndrome, type 1 pseudohypoaldosteronism, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and recessive distal renal tubular acidosis) in which an adapted treatment is necessary. Specific therapies can be proposed, such as thiazides in pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2 or amiloride in Liddle syndrome.

A precise diagnosis allows focused screening for extrarenal manifestations in some tubulopathies (Supplementary data, Table S2); important examples are sensorineural hearing loss (antenatal Bartter type 4, renal tubular acidosis, East syndrome); ocular abnormalities (FHHNC type 2, Lowe syndrome, proximal tubular acidosis); dental abnormalities (FHHNC, enamel renal syndrome); neurological manifestations (Lowe syndrome, proximal tubular acidosis, mixed tubular acidosis and East syndrome); or cutaneous and exocrine gland abnormalities (HELIX syndrome).

There are also some long-term benefits in having a definite genetic diagnosis: most of the tubulopathies affect the quality of life (e.g. failure to thrive and severe polyuria in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus) and close follow-up is important, particularly in children. For diseases with an evolution towards CKD (e.g. Dent disease and FHHNC), the introduction of nephroprotective therapy is crucial. Even for diseases with a relatively good prognosis, such as Gitelman syndrome, genetic confirmation could be helpful to guide care and to survey and prevent specific chronic complications such as chondrocalcinosis.

Genetic counselling

For families with hereditary tubulopathies, genetic counselling is important to evaluate the risk for future pregnancies and support decision making concerning prenatal or pre-implantation testing when indicated. For X-linked diseases, genetic counselling and screening allow the identification of female carriers, which can provide information for reproductive decision making and neonatal management (e.g. nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and Dent disease).

In some genetic diseases, such as FHHNC and infantile hypercalcaemia or hypophosphataemic rickets with hypercalciuria, heterozygous relatives could develop hypercalciuria and nephrolithiasis. Finally, a reliable diagnosis is crucial to evaluate the eligibility of living kidney donors.

NONGENETIC CAUSES OF GITELMAN-LIKE ELECTROLYTE ABNORMALITIES

Although it goes beyond the scope of this review to discuss all noninherited conditions that can mimic the presentation of Gitelman syndrome, it is important to consider alternative causes of Gitelman syndrome in clinical practice. In particular, abuse of diuretics (most notably thiazides) may result in an identical presentation. In addition, chronic use of proton-pump inhibitors, aminoglycosides or laxatives is accompanied by hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, although metabolic alkalosis is generally absent. Other causes of hypokalemia may include chronic vomiting and primary hyperaldosteronism, but the latter condition is associated with hypertension and a suppressed RAAS. Further guidance on the clinical workup and treatment of Gitelman syndrome is provided by KDIGO.

CLCNKB – BARTTER TYPE 3

Although recessive CLCKNB mutations have originally been described to cause classic Bartter syndrome (type 3), a systematic analysis of a large cohort of patients demonstrates that 25% of all patients present with a Gitelman syndrome phenotype. In fact, some patients may initially show symptoms of Bartter syndrome and develop a typical Gitelman phenotype in later childhood or adolescence. Consequently, genetic screening of patients with a clinical diagnosis of Gitelman syndrome quite regularly turn out to have CLCKNB mutations upon genetic screening. As large deletions account for up to 40% of all cases of Bartter syndrome type 3, testing for structural variations by MLPA or other means is advised. Compared with classic Gitelman syndrome, patients with CLCKNB mutations have generally an earlier age of initial presentations and slightly higher serum Mg 2+ and urinary Ca 2+ concentrations. Patients with CLCKNB mutations may additionally develop chronic kidney disease (up to 25%), nephrocalcinosis (10–20%) or growth retardation.

CLCKNB encodes the ClC Kb Cl − channel that is expressed in the TAL, DCT and collecting duct. Loss-of-function mutations in ClC Kb result in an increased intracellular Cl − concentration. As Cl − inhibits WNK kinases, an increased Cl − concentration causes reduced NCC activity by inhibition of the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 pathway (Fig. 1). A similar regulatory mechanism of NKCC2 exists in the TAL, which explains why ClC Kb mutations may result in both Bartter-like and Gitelman-like syndromes. In general, hypochloremia and increased fractional excretions of Na + and Cl − are more severe in Bartter syndrome type 3 than in Gitelman syndrome, which may reflect that both TAL and DCT are affected by CLCKNB mutations.

### Bartter syndrome and gitelman syndrome [^115bhrBv]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Bartter and Gitelman syndromes are conditions characterized by renal salt-wasting. Clinical presentations range from severe antenatal disease to asymptomatic with incidental diagnosis. Hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis is the common feature. Bartter variants may be associated with polyuria and weakness. Gitelman syndrome is often subtle, and typically diagnosed later life with incidental hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. Treatment may involve fluid and electrolyte replenishment, prostaglandin inhibition, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system axis disruption. Investigators have identified causative mutations but genotypic-phenotypic correlations are still being characterized. Collaborative registries will allow improved classification schema and development of effective treatments.

### Contradiction between genetic analysis and diuretic loading test in type I bartter syndrome: a case report [^117KeYte]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Bartter syndrome (BS) and Gitelman syndrome (GS) are closely related diseases involving congenital kidney tubular dysfunction characterized by volume depletion, hypokalaemia, and metabolic alkalosis. Owing to recent advances in genetic analysis, the classic classification of BS types, based on clinical symptoms and course, has been superseded by a classification of I to V types, depending on the responsible genes. However, a certain latitude is observed in phenotypes even within the same genotype and no one-to-one correspondence has been found between type and clinical manifestation. In typical cases of BS, assessing response to diuretics (furosemide and thiazide), hereinafter referred to as diuretic loading test, may be used to diagnose the type by detecting which part of the kidney tubule is not functioning correctly. However, such tests may not always correspond to the results of genetic analyses. We describe a case of BS diagnosed as type I through genetic analysis that produced a diuretic loading test result apparently inconsistent with this diagnosis.

INTRODUCTION

Gitelman syndrome is a recessive salt-wasting disorder characterized by hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, hypocalciuria and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Patients often present in late childhood or early adulthood with nonspecific symptoms, including muscle weakness, tetany, hypotension and fatigue. Typical complaints may also include salt craving and thirst as a reflection of salt-wasting. Gitelman syndrome is not a benign condition and may cause chondrocalcinosis due to hypomagnesemia, prolonged QTc interval and arrhythmias due to hypokalemia, glucose intolerance and immunodeficiencies. The disease was first described in 1966 by Hillel Gitelman as a subtype of Bartter syndrome. However, typical Bartter symptoms such as polyhydramnios, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, failure to thrive and an antenatal presentation are rare in Gitelman syndrome. Indeed, genetic investigations in the 1990 s revealed that Bartter and Gitelman syndrome are separate clinical entities.

Classic Gitelman syndrome is caused by biallelic mutations in solute carrier 12 subtype 3 (SLC12A3) encoding the Na + -Cl − -co-transporter (NCC), which is exclusively expressed in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). The NCC facilitates apical Na + and Cl − transport in the DCT and is the therapeutic target of thiazide diuretics. As a consequence of impaired NCC-mediated Na + reabsorption in the DCT, the Na + delivery to the collecting duct is increased. Accompanied by RAAS activation, the high Na + delivery results in increased K + secretion in the collecting duct explaining the hypokalemia in Gitelman patients. The metabolic alkalosis develops secondary to hypokalemia. The hypomagnesemia is less well understood (extensively reviewed in), but it is generally thought that a reduced DCT mass is a major contributor to this defect. However, human data supporting this hypothesis are scarce.

In recent years, several seminal discoveries have been made to resolve the missing heritability in Gitelman syndrome. This review, therefore, provides an overview of all known genetic causes of Gitelman-like syndromes. The differences in clinical presentation, genetic inheritance and molecular disease mechanism will be discussed.

### Prochlorperazine (Compro) [^112LpvwQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pseudo-parkinsonism:

Symptoms may include: mask-like facies; drooling; tremors; pillrolling motion; cogwheel rigidity; and shuffling gait. Reassurance and sedation are important. In most cases these symptoms are readily controlled when an anti-parkinsonism agent is administered concomitantly. Anti-parkinsonism agents should be used only when required. Generally, therapy of a few weeks to 2 or 3 months will suffice. After this time patients should be evaluated to determine their need for continued treatment. (Note: Levodopa has not been found effective in pseudo-parkinsonism.) Occasionally it is necessary to lower the dosage of prochlorperazine or to discontinue the drug.

Tardive Dyskinesia:

As with all antipsychotic agents, tardive dyskinesia may appear in some patients on long-term therapy or may appear after drug therapy has been discontinued. The syndrome can also develop, although much less frequently, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. This syndrome appears in all age groups. Although its prevalence appears to be highest among elderly patients, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict at the inception of neuroleptic treatment which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. The symptoms are persistent and in some patients appear to be irreversible. The syndrome is characterized by rhythmical involuntary movements of the tongue, face, mouth or jaw (e.g., protrusion of tongue, puffing of cheeks, puckering of mouth, chewing movements). Sometimes these may be accompanied by involuntary movements of extremities. In rare instances, these involuntary movements of the extremities are the only manifestations of tardive dyskinesia. A variant of tardive dyskinesia, tardive dystonia, has also been described.

There is no known effective treatment for tardive dyskinesia; anti-parkinsonism agents do not alleviate the symptoms of this syndrome. It is suggested that all antipsychotic agents be discontinued if these symptoms appear.

Should it be necessary to reinstitute treatment, or increase the dosage of the agent, or switch to a different antipsychotic agent, the syndrome may be masked.

It has been reported that fine vermicular movements of the tongue may be an early sign of the syndrome and if the medication is stopped at that time the syndrome may not develop.

### Different roles of the RAAS affect bone metabolism in patients with primary aldosteronism, gitelman syndrome and bartter syndrome [^113DQCzZ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

This study is based on a female patient treated by us recently who had hyperparathyroidism caused by parathyroid cancer. She developed severe osteoporosis with multi-bone fractures. We measured her renin and aldosterone levels since she had hypo-potassium and normal blood pressure. Surprisingly, renin was more than 500 (normal 2.8–39.9uIU/ml) and aldosterone was also significantly increased. The blood potassium, renin and aldosterone of the patient returned to normal 1 week after the operation without other interventions. We were impressed by this strong interaction between PTH and RAAS. We wonder what PTH level and bone mineral density would be in patients with persistent disordered RAAS?

Primary aldosteronism (PA), Bartter syndrome (BS) and Gitelman syndrome (GS) are three endocrine diseases with disordered RAAS. Primary aldosteronism (PA) as primary hyperaldosteronism or Conn's syndrome, is characterized by hypertension and hypokalemia, while Bartter syndrome (BS) and Gitelman syndrome (GS) as secondary hyperaldosteronism, characterized by hypokalemia, normal to low blood pressure, and metabolic alkalosis. Hypomagnesemia is less frequent than hypercalciuria in BS, while hypomagnesemia is an essential feature of GS, accompanied by hypocalciuria. The RAAS is disordered in PA, BS and GS; however, the pathogenesis is not the same. Elevated aldosterone in PA is from the proliferation of the adrenal gland or adrenal adenoma, and the increased aldosterone in turn inhibits the secretion of renin. Renal tubular ion exchange channel mutations are found in GS and BS patients, and this may induce the proliferation of juxtaglomerular cells and the elevation of renin secretion, followed by increased aldosterone secretion.

The interaction between the components of RAAS and PTH is well reviewed in the literature. It was found that plasma aldosterone level and ARR ratio were positively associated with plasma PTH level. High plasma PTH level can inactivate the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and increase the expression of renin, which can also directly affect the synthesis and release of aldosterone in plasma. It has also been reported that a high level of aldosterone may have a negative effect on bone. However, there are few studies on whether the elevated aldosterone by different mechanisms may have the same effects on bone as PA, and whether this effect is mediated by PTH or other pathway. Therefore, we review the clinical data of Bartter and Gitelman syndrome patients and hope to answer the question.

### A life-threatening case of pseudo-aldosteronism secondary to excessive liquorice ingestion [^114Fg7mQ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2

We revisited the clinical history. On further questioning, she reported struggling with nicotine cravings since quitting smoking two months earlier. She began eating excessive amounts of liquorice sweets to satisfy her nicotine cravings. The liquorice sweets she was eating contained 4% liquorice root extract. The estimated intake was 1.14gm-2.28gm liquorice extract per day for the previous two months. She continued to eat liquorice while in hospital until admission to the ICU. She was advised to stop consuming liquorice once the medical team became aware.

Further investigations returned. Her urinary potassium was noted to be inappropriately normal [24 h Urinary Potassium: 57.3 (25–125) mmol/24 h] in the setting of severe hypokalaemia with high urinary sodium [24 h Urinary Sodium: 353.4 pg/ml(40–220 pg/ml)]. Elevated urinary sodium excretion was likely due to diuretic therapy and the production of natriuretic peptides in response to hypervolemia. Plasma renin and serum aldosterone taken day three of admission were both suppressed [Plasma renin 4.4 pg/ml(< 20 pg/ml), Serum Aldosterone < 26 pg/ml (42–209 pg/ml)] suggestive of an extra-adrenal mimic causing a pseudo-aldosteronism. This was in keeping with a diagnosis of acquired apparent mineralocorticoid excess secondary to excessive Liquorice ingestion. Her serum potassium and systolic blood pressure began to normalise following the cessation of Liquorice. Furosemide/Amiloride was reduced to 20 mg/5 mg during admission and was discontinued 10 days after discharge. Her serum potassium remained within the normal range in the following weeks and her blood pressure normalised. Her follow-up ECG demonstrated sinus rhythm with left axis deviation and left bundle-branch block, and QTc improved to 458 ms.

### Identification of compound mutations of SLC12A3 gene in a Chinese pedigree with gitelman syndrome exhibiting bartter syndrome-liked phenotypes [^114qPqmi]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patient recruitment

Participants were recruited from a Chinese pedigree. The diagnosis of Gitelman syndrome was based on clinical symptoms, biochemical parameters and genetic analysis of SLC12A3 mutations. All participants denied a history of laxatives, diuretics, or other agents including insulin, β-receptor activator or Chinese herbal medicine. This study was approved by the ethics committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University.

Biochemistry tests

The peripheral blood sample and urine sample were collected. The blood and urine electrolytes were measured with an automatic biochemical analyzer. Plasma renin activity, plasma angiotensin, and plasma aldosterone were measured using a radioimmunoassay.

Genetic analysis

Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples collected from participants using the QIAamp Blood DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After amplification using 2X polymerase chain reaction (PCR) MasterMix polymerase (Tiangen, China) by ABI9700 PCR (Life technology, USA), the products were captured and purified with Panel probe (Illumine Inc. USA), then directly sequenced on the ABI 3500 automated DNA sequencer (Life technology, USA). Mutations were detected using next generation sequencing (NGS) and subsequently confirmed using Sanger sequencing. We investigated 40 genes reported to be associated with Gitelman syndrome or Bartter syndrome, including CLCNKA, CLCNKB, BSND, LAMC, LAMB, ALMS, EDAR, CASR, DSP, BFSP2, TMEM67, PLEC, KIF7, SLC12A3, KRT9, KRT10, KRT14, PNPLA6 and so on. To assess the pathogenicity of the variants, those variants were analyzed with PolyPhen-2, Mutation Taster, PROVEAN and SIFT as alignment reference databases. Gene mutation databases such as 1000 Genomes, dbSNP, and Uniprot were used for reference genome alignment.
