## Question

Treatment for left knee giving out?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to treat a left knee that is "giving out" (instability/buckling). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to frame the symptom and structure the initial history and physical exam. Then, I should verify the appropriate imaging sequence. Next, I will map a focused differential diagnosis with key distinguishing features. After that, I need to align treatment pathways to the underlying etiology, including ACL-related instability, patellofemoral instability, and osteoarthritis-related instability. Finally, I should integrate fall-risk mitigation, shared decision-making, follow-up milestones, and red flags to close the loop on reassessment and safety monitoring.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct: "knee giving out" refers to perceived instability or buckling during weight-bearing, often signaling ligamentous insufficiency, patellofemoral maltracking, or pain-mediated quadriceps inhibition rather than a single diagnosis, so I need to ensure a structured history focused on onset/mechanism, frequency, associated swelling, mechanical symptoms, activity level, prior injuries, and comorbid risk factors, followed by a targeted exam including Lachman and pivot-shift for ACL, patellar tracking and apprehension testing, quadriceps strength, dynamic movement testing such as squats or step-downs, and gait analysis; I should double-check that current guidelines emphasize a strong recommendation for a focused MSK exam and function-based testing to reproduce symptoms and classify impairments, which they do [^111Sgngp] [^112yesad] [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging pathway before jumping to MRI; at first glance, I was inclined toward early MRI for instability, but I should correct that impulse because the ACR recommends radiography as the initial study for chronic knee pain and for many acute presentations, reserving MRI for persistent mechanical symptoms, effusion, or when radiographs are normal yet clinical suspicion remains high or the diagnosis is unclear, and considering aspiration or advanced imaging if degenerative changes or chondrocalcinosis are present; in acute twisting trauma without red flags, knee radiographs are again the initial step per the ACR [^112U1Un6] [^111KaZah] [^1162rmm9] [^112Z8Gt3].

> Next, I should review the differential diagnosis with pattern recognition: ACL-related instability typically follows a pivoting injury in a younger active patient, with giving-way during cutting and a positive pivot shift or Lachman; patellofemoral instability often presents with anterior knee pain, episodic giving way, positive apprehension, maltracking signs like a J-sign, and predisposing dysplasia or patella alta; osteoarthritis-related instability tends to occur in older adults with pain, stiffness, and episodes of buckling that raise fall risk and functional limitations; I need to ensure each category is supported by data and guideline-based descriptors, which they are [^111g6MvF] [^115db8Rn] [^111fexRo].

> I will now examine ACL-directed management decisions: Hold on, let's not jump to reconstruction for everyone — AAFP criteria support a conservative trial when giving-way episodes are few, ROM is near normal, meniscal damage is minimal, quadriceps is strong, and hop testing is satisfactory, recognizing "coper" versus "non-coper" trajectories; indications that push toward reconstruction include recurrent instability affecting ADLs despite rehab, desire to return to pivoting/cutting sports, younger or highly active patients, and concomitant meniscal or collateral injuries; the AAOS notes only limited-strength recommendations for some long-term outcomes, so I need to weigh patient preferences and emerging evidence; autograft is generally preferred over allograft in young/active patients; and I should remember high-quality trials and reviews indicate that rehab-first and surgical strategies can yield comparable medium-term outcomes for some, underscoring shared decision-making and careful selection [^112pxgXc] [^111g6MvF] [^1115Sc7A] [^116b14zM] [^1141dqkv] [^115XL5ib] [^114crzEC].

> But wait, what if the instability is patellofemoral rather than tibiofemoral; I should confirm first-line conservative care emphasizing hip and quadriceps strengthening, movement retraining, and symptom-modulating bracing or taping when helpful; if instability recurs or high-risk anatomic features are present, MPFL reconstruction becomes reasonable, with risk tools like the RIP score aiding stratification and reports suggesting low pooled recurrence after MPFL in selected populations, though anatomical drivers may still necessitate bony realignment for some; I need to ensure that exercise remains foundational and that surgical candidacy follows failure of structured rehab or a clearly high-risk profile [^116rojEy] [^112yesad] [^114FopkC] [^116NoGhW] [^113bHFDN] [^1176A5my] [^116t7uJC].

> Let me consider osteoarthritis-related instability carefully: core nonpharmacologic interventions include a tibiofemoral unloading brace if ambulation, stability, or pain are significantly affected and the patient can tolerate bracing, a walking cane as appropriate, targeted neuromuscular and strengthening exercise with balance and coordination training, and weight management as part of symptom control; I need to avoid reflexively recommending knee arthroscopy for degenerative disease with or without meniscal tears because high-level guidance shows no meaningful long-term benefit on pain or function for most patients; for advanced disease with persistent instability and functional compromise, arthroplasty may be considered, while recognizing that a substantial minority report residual instability post-TKA and that instability remains a leading cause of revision, reinforcing careful patient selection and expectations [^111dWkiw] [^114V8CPB] [^115V8PpE] [^117MPXkT] [^113USf6U] [^113g8W3s].

> Hold on, I should verify downstream risks and associated conditions: in OA cohorts, knee buckling and perceptions of instability are strongly associated with fear of falling, reduced balance confidence, activity limitation, and increased fall risk over time, which means my plan must include fall-prevention strategies such as balance training and home safety review; I should also keep an eye out for confounders like saphenous neuritis when medial pain clouds the picture and for unrecognized posterolateral corner injury in persistent instability, especially after ACL reconstruction, as missing these can derail outcomes [^111fexRo] [^112YtgD9] [^1135EDze] [^114j5f1U].

> I need to ensure shared decision-making is explicit and documented: AAOS guidance stresses that management should be evidence-informed yet individualized by patient preferences, values, and functional goals, with the limited strength of some recommendations implying substantial clinical judgment; decisions about ACL surgery are driven by instability burden and activity demands as much as by exam findings, and the "coper/non-coper" framework helps structure nonoperative trials while defining thresholds for escalation; I should confirm that we review benefits, trade-offs, timelines, and realistic return-to-activity expectations together [^111Sgngp] [^1115Sc7A] [^113dERa5] [^1147Nj6b] [^112yWK6S].

> Next, I should review monitoring and reassessment: an initial 6-week checkpoint after conservative measures assesses symptom trajectory and function, around 3 months I should repeat functional stability tests and movement assessments, and by 6 to 12 months I should evaluate return-to-activity status and durability of gains; if a tense, painful effusion develops after injury, aspiration can be considered despite limited direct evidence; red flags for urgent reevaluation include worsening frequency of giving way, new mechanical locking or catching, progressive effusion, and falls or near-falls, prompting expedited imaging and specialist referral when indicated [^112yesad] [^113zippB] [^112U1Un6] [^111KaZah].

> To summarize the decision flow without oversimplifying, let me think it through aloud: start with targeted history and exam to localize the pattern of instability, obtain radiographs first-line and escalate to MRI if mechanical symptoms, effusion, or unclear diagnosis persist, then stratify into ACL-related, patellofemoral, or OA-related pathways; for ACL, attempt structured rehabilitation in likely copers and proceed to reconstruction for persistent functional instability, high-demand sport goals, or concomitant intra-articular injury, using autograft in young/active patients; for patellofemoral instability, emphasize hip and quad strengthening and movement retraining with selective bracing, reserving MPFL reconstruction for recurrent or high-risk cases; for OA-related instability, prioritize bracing, assistive devices, neuromuscular training, and risk-factor modification, avoid routine arthroscopy, and consider arthroplasty for advanced, function-limiting disease; throughout, address fall risk, clarify goals, and revisit decisions iteratively as the clinical picture evolves [^112U1Un6] [^111g6MvF] [^112yesad] [^111dWkiw] [^116b14zM] [^117MPXkT].

---

The most effective treatment for a left knee that "gives out" is a **structured rehabilitation program** focused on quadriceps and hip strengthening, balance, and neuromuscular training [^112pxgXc] [^115V8PpE], with bracing or assistive devices as needed [^111dWkiw] [^114V8CPB]. Surgery is reserved for **persistent instability** despite rehabilitation, high-demand athletes, or **significant ligament/meniscal injury** [^1115Sc7A] [^111g6MvF] [^115XL5ib]. Early diagnosis and individualized care are essential to **restore stability** and **prevent further injury**.

---

## Clinical evaluation and diagnosis

A thorough clinical evaluation is essential to identify the underlying cause of **knee instability**. The evaluation should include:

- **Detailed history**: Onset, frequency, and circumstances of instability episodes; associated symptoms (pain, swelling, locking); previous injuries or surgeries; activity level; and occupational demands [^111DwH59] [^1115Sc7A].

- **Physical examination**: Inspection, palpation, range of motion assessment, and specific ligamentous tests (Lachman, anterior/posterior drawer, varus/valgus stress tests) to identify ligamentous laxity or injury [^111SApYb] [^1115Sc7A].

- **Imaging studies**: MRI is the gold standard for evaluating soft tissue injuries (ACL, PCL, menisci), while X-rays are useful for detecting fractures or degenerative changes [^111KaZah] [^112U1Un6].

---

## Non-surgical treatment options

Non-surgical management is the **first-line approach** for most patients with knee instability, particularly those with mild-to-moderate instability or lower activity demands. Key components include [^1147Nj6b]:

---

### Physical therapy and rehabilitation

- **Quadriceps strengthening**: Emphasizing quadriceps strengthening, particularly the vastus medialis oblique (VMO), is critical for improving knee stability [^112pxgXc] [^116rojEy].

- **Neuromuscular training**: Balance, proprioception, and agility exercises enhance dynamic stability and reduce instability episodes [^112pxgXc] [^112qNmCa].

- **Functional rehabilitation**: Progressive rehabilitation programs tailored to patient-specific goals and activity levels are essential for successful outcomes [^112pxgXc] [^115uFp6Q].

---

### Bracing and assistive devices

Knee braces provide **external support**, reduce **instability episodes**, and improve confidence during activities [^111dWkiw]; **assistive devices** such as canes or crutches may be used temporarily to reduce load and prevent falls in patients with significant instability [^114V8CPB].

---

### Pharmacological management

Pharmacological management may include **NSAIDs** to manage pain and inflammation associated with knee instability.

---

## Surgical treatment options

Surgical intervention is indicated for patients with **persistent instability** despite conservative management, high-demand athletes, or those with **significant ligamentous or meniscal injuries** [^1115Sc7A] [^111pYZ78]. Common surgical procedures include:

---

### Ligament reconstruction

- **ACL reconstruction**: Indicated for patients with ACL tears and persistent instability, particularly those wishing to return to high-level activities [^111g6MvF] [^1115Sc7A].

- **PCL reconstruction**: Indicated for significant posterior instability or combined ligamentous injuries [^115NMNu7].

- **Collateral ligament reconstruction**: Medial or lateral collateral ligament reconstruction may be necessary for chronic instability [^114j5f1U].

---

### Meniscal repair or partial meniscectomy

**Meniscal repair** is preferred for reparable meniscal tears to preserve meniscal function and prevent osteoarthritis progression, whereas **partial meniscectomy** is indicated for irreparable tears causing mechanical symptoms.

---

### Patellar stabilization procedures

Patellar stabilization procedures include **medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction**, indicated for recurrent patellar instability or dislocation, and **tibial tubercle osteotomy**, indicated for patellar maltracking or instability associated with abnormal patellar alignment [^1176A5my] [^113bHFDN].

---

## Rehabilitation protocols

Rehabilitation protocols vary depending on the underlying cause of instability and the chosen treatment approach. General principles typically progress from an early phase focusing on **pain and swelling control**, restoration of **range of motion**, and initiation of **quadriceps activation** exercises; to an intermediate phase emphasizing **progressive strengthening**, balance, and proprioception; and finally to an advanced phase centered on **functional training**, sport-specific drills, and a gradual **return to activities** [^115uFp6Q].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

The prognosis for patients with **knee instability** varies by underlying cause, severity, and adherence to treatment protocols. Non-surgical management is effective for mild-to-moderate instability with good outcomes among patients who adhere to rehabilitation programs; surgical management demonstrates high success rates for ligament reconstruction and meniscal repair, particularly in active individuals. Persistent instability increases the risk of falls, reduces quality of life, and may lead to osteoarthritis if left untreated [^112YtgD9] [^111fexRo] [^115XL5ib].

---

## Preventive measures

Preventive strategies to reduce recurrence of knee instability include **neuromuscular training programs** that incorporate balance, proprioception, and agility to improve dynamic stability [^1147Nj6b] [^114a7fe7]. Additional measures include regular quadriceps and hip strengthening and activity modification, such as avoiding high-risk activities or using protective equipment during sports.

---

## Patient education and self-management

Patient education should ensure understanding of the underlying cause of instability and the importance of adhering to **treatment protocols**. Self-management focuses on symptom control, prevention of recurrence, and recognition of worsening instability, including lifestyle modifications such as weight management, regular exercise, and avoidance of high-risk activities [^111Sgngp].

---

## Complications and risks

Potential complications include **persistent instability** with increased risk of falls [^112YtgD9], reduced quality of life, and progression to osteoarthritis. Additional risks are surgical complications — such as infection, graft failure, stiffness, or persistent instability — and rehabilitation challenges, where non-compliance or inadequate rehabilitation may result in suboptimal outcomes [^1115Sc7A].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up is essential to assess **treatment effectiveness**, detect **complications**, and adjust plans as needed [^111DwH59]. Typical visits include clinical assessment of stability, range of motion, and functional status; imaging with MRI or X-rays as indicated to assess healing and detect complications [^111KaZah]; and collection of patient-reported outcomes using validated questionnaires (e.g. KOOS, IKDC) to evaluate satisfaction and quality of life [^1141dqkv].

The most effective treatment for a left knee that "gives out" is a **structured rehabilitation program** focused on quadriceps and hip strengthening, balance, and neuromuscular training, with bracing or assistive devices as needed [^112pxgXc] [^111dWkiw]. **Surgery is reserved** for persistent instability despite rehabilitation, high-demand athletes, or significant ligament/meniscal injury [^111g6MvF] [^1115Sc7A]. Early diagnosis and individualized care are essential to restore stability and prevent further injury.

### Activity demands and instability are the most important factors for recommending to treat ACL injuries with reconstruction [^112yWK6S]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Patient instability is reported in several contexts: despite an adequate rehabilitation period, during working situations, and in activities of daily living. The patient's wishes and motivation for ACL-R are critical, as are their experiences of affected or lowered quality of life. Symptoms such as pain and/or swelling, along with the desire to return to high knee impact activities or high activity levels, play a role. There's also a risk of involuntarily lowered activity and new injuries or symptoms, like meniscal tears or developing early osteoarthritis. Associated injuries on the meniscus or ligaments, young age, female sex, and knee laxity tests measured in a clinical setting are additional considerations.

Three hundred and thirty-seven of the 391 physical therapists (86%) answered the open-ended question. Comments often addressed specific activities, such as recommending ACL-R for patients involved in alpine skiing, gymnastics, or young women playing soccer or floorball. Terms like "instability in relation to the demands of the knee" or "return to activity with high risks or knee-demanding activity" were used, particularly when instability was mentioned alongside the desire to return to the activity.

Orthopaedic surgeons and physical therapists provided closely aligned ratings regarding the influence of their assessments and the patient's wishes in the decision-making process for recommending ACL-R.

In Figure 1, orthopaedic surgeons and physical therapists provided ratings on the degree to which they believe the decision to treat a patient with ACL-R is influenced by their own assessments, each other's assessments, and the patient's wishes.

### Joint stability in total knee arthroplasty: What is the target for a stable knee [^113g8W3s]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2017). Low credibility.

Instability remains a common cause of failure in total knee arthroplasty. Although approaches for surgical treatment of instability exist, the target for initial stability remains elusive, increasing the likelihood that failures will persist because adequate stability is not restored when performing the primary arthroplasty. Although the mechanisms that stabilize the knee joint — contact between the articular surfaces, ligamentous constraints, and muscle forces — are well-defined, their relative importance and the interplay among them throughout functions of daily living are poorly understood. The problem is exacerbated by the complex multiplanar motions that occur across the joint and the large variations in these motions across the population, suggesting that stability targets may need to be patient-specific.

### Saphenous neuritis: A poorly understood cause of medial knee pain [^1135EDze]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2002). Low credibility.

Saphenous neuritis is a painful condition caused by either irritation or compression at the adductor canal or elsewhere along the course of the saphenous nerve. The condition may also be associated with surgical or nonsurgical trauma to the nerve, particularly at the medial or anterior aspect of the knee. Saphenous neuritis can imitate other pathologies around the knee, such as a medial meniscal tear or osteoarthritis. Unrecognized saphenous neuritis can confuse the patient's clinical picture, complicate treatment, and compromise results.

As an isolated entity, saphenous neuritis may appear in conjunction with other common problems, such as osteoarthritis and patellofemoral pain syndrome, and it can have an indolent and protracted course. Its clinical appearance is characterized by allodynia along the course of the saphenous nerve. The diagnosis is confirmed by relief of symptoms after injection of the affected area with a local anesthetic.

Initial treatment can include non-surgical symptomatic care, treatment of associated pathology, and diagnostic or therapeutic injections of local anesthetic. In recalcitrant cases, surgical decompression and neurectomy are potential options. The key to treatment is prompt recognition; palpation of the saphenous nerve should be part of every routine examination of the knee.

### Patellofemoral pain [^112yesad]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for patellofemoral pain syndrome, particularly concerning classification, the APTA 2019 guidelines recommend using the proposed impairment/function-based PFPS classification system to guide management:

- **Overuse/overload without other impairment**: Patients present with a history suggesting an increase in the magnitude and/or frequency of patellofemoral joint loading, exceeding the capacity for recovery of patellofemoral joint tissues.

- **Muscle performance deficits**: Patients present with lower extremity muscle performance deficits in the hip and quadriceps. These patients may respond favorably to hip and knee resistance exercises.

- **Movement coordination deficits**: Patients exhibit excessive or poorly controlled knee valgus during dynamic tasks, not necessarily due to weakness of the lower extremity musculature. These patients may benefit from gait retraining and movement re-education interventions, leading to improvements in lower extremity kinematics and pain. This suggests the importance of assessing dynamic knee valgus during movement.

- **Mobility impairments**: Patients present with higher than normal foot mobility and/or flexibility deficits in one or more of the following structures.

### Consensus methods in patellofemoral pain: How rigorous are they? A scoping review [^1139FfeB]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Using a novel tool to assess methodological rigour, our original protocol outlined data charting but did not include a process of appraisal. Scoping reviews have been criticized for not including a quality assessment, which makes interpretation of the data challenging. Deviating from our protocol, we decided to perform a qualitative content analysis.

There is currently no known quality-rating system designed to judge consensus-based methods. The reporting guideline for consensus-based methods in biomedical research was published following the completion of our work. In the absence of a reporting or quality guideline with which to describe or assess a consensus development process and its subsequent statement, we used four sets of questions as a lens through which to view existing statements. These four sets of questions were previously described as supporting an evidence-informed appraisal of the conduct of consensus development in sport and exercise medicine. Critically, the four sets of questions were based on both the Conducting and Reporting Delphi Studies guideline and critiques from the literature on consensus development processes.

- **Synthesis of the results**: Data are grouped into both narrative summaries and summary tables of the extracted data. Part A presents the data on participants on the consensus panel.

### Recurrent patellofemoral instability rates after MPFL reconstruction techniques are in the range of instability rates after other soft tissue realignment techniques [^1176A5my]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Low credibility.

Recurrent patellofemoral instability is a common knee injury in skeletally immature patients. Many surgical techniques have been described in the literature, all with different success rates. The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available literature to assess recurrent patellofemoral instability rates after surgical treatment using MPFL reconstruction techniques and other soft tissue realignment techniques in skeletally immature patients.

PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and The Cochrane Library were searched to identify all original articles concerning the surgical treatment for patellofemoral instability in skeletally immature patients, which reported post-operative recurrent patellofemoral instability rates. Subsequently, a risk of bias assessment was conducted, and a meta-analysis was performed on reported post-operative recurrent patellofemoral instability rates after MPFL reconstruction techniques and other soft tissue realignment techniques.

Of the 21 eligible studies (448 knees in 389 patients), 10 studies reported on MPFL reconstruction techniques using different grafts and fixation techniques, and 11 reported on other soft tissue realignment procedures. In total, 62 of the 448 (13.8%) treated knees showed recurrent patellofemoral instability during follow-up. The overall pooled recurrent patellofemoral instability rate was estimated to be 0.08 (95% CI 0.02–0.16). For MPFL reconstruction techniques, the pooled recurrent patellofemoral instability rate was estimated to be 0.02 (95% CI 0.00–0.09).

### Evolving evidence in the treatment of primary and recurrent posterior cruciate ligament injuries, part 2: Surgical techniques, outcomes and rehabilitation [^115NMNu7]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

Recently, remnant preservation in single bundle (SB) and double bundle (DB) transtibial posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (PCL-R) has gained increasing interest. Preservation of the remnant PCL fibers and meniscofemoral ligaments is believed to provide graft protection by stabilizing the graft and reducing the killer-turn effect by cushioning the graft at the proximal aperture of the tibial tunnel. Improved graft healing and maturation are assumed to occur through enhanced revascularization and regeneration of mechanoreceptors.

A study reported improved patient-reported outcomes, extensor and flexor muscle peak torque, functional performance, and decreased posterior tibial translation (PTT) based on posterior sagittal stress radiographs in 52 isolated SB transtibial PCL-R with remnant preservation following a mean follow-up of 30 months. In this study cohort, acute PCL-R (mean time from injury to surgery, 2.4 months) enabled remnant preservation, which resulted in normal graft appearance (signal intensity, gross appearance) in almost 79% of patients as assessed by postoperative MRI (mean time from surgery to MRI, 15.8 months). Similar results have also been shown for combined PCL and posterolateral corner reconstruction.

### When polyethylene exchange is appropriate for prosthetic knee instability [^112cZWQA]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Prosthetic knee instability is a common cause of patient dissatisfaction and early failure after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Technical considerations account for most of these problems. The symptoms of prosthetic knee instability include catching, giving way, anterior knee pain, pes bursitis, and the inability to trust the knee in daily activities. Recurrent effusions are common, with a predominance of red blood cells on aspiration. Whereas prosthetic knee instability is a common cause of patient dissatisfaction after knee replacement, strategies to manage such instability are dependent on recognizing the presenting instability pattern. Some instability patterns require full revision, whereas others can be managed by polyethylene exchange (PE) only.

Whether PE only is ever appropriate in the treatment of such patients remains controversial. Babis et al. reviewed 27 cases of isolated poly exchange for periprosthetic knee instability and found that 12 of these 27 cases had persistent pain. They concluded that "isolated tibial insert exchange should be undertaken with caution". Jensen et al. reported on 27 patients, quoting 80% survival, whereas Brooks et al. and Konrads et al. reported success rates of 71% and 72%, respectively.

Such mediocre results with isolated poly exchange were echoed by Baker et al, who reviewed 45 knees treated with isolated poly exchange for prosthetic instability. At an average follow-up of nearly 5 years, only 58% had successful clinical results. They concluded that "if selected appropriately, isolated liner exchange can significantly improve the outcomes", although the text was cut off and did not provide a complete conclusion.

### The impact of knee instability with and without buckling on balance confidence, fear of falling and physical function: The multicenter osteoarthritis study [^111fexRo]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2014). Low credibility.

Knee buckling, in which a knee gives way during weight-bearing, is common in people with knee pain and knee osteoarthritis (OA). However, little is known about the prevalence of sensations of knee instability, slipping, or shifting in which the knee does not actually buckle, or of the psychosocial and physical consequences of these symptoms.

- **Design**: We asked participants in the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST) separately about episodes of knee buckling and sensations of knee instability without buckling in the past three months. We assessed fear of falling, poor balance confidence (Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale ≤ 67/100), activity limitation due to concern about buckling, and poor physical function (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) physical function ≥ 28/68). We used Poisson regression to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs) for cross-sectional associations of buckling and sensations of instability without buckling with these outcomes, adjusting for confounders.

- **Results**: Of 2,120 participants (60% female, 40% ≥ 65 years, mean body mass index (BMI): 31 kg/m²), 18% reported buckling, 27% had sensations of knee instability without buckling, and 9% reported both symptoms. Buckling and sensations of instability without buckling were each significantly associated with fear of falling, poor balance confidence, activity limitations, and poor WOMAC physical function. Subjects who reported both buckling and instability without buckling and those with at least two buckling episodes (15%) had the strongest association with these outcomes.

### Review for the generalist: Evaluation of anterior knee pain [^112sFoE7]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

The basic anatomy of the knee is shown in Figure 2. The knee is the largest joint in the body and is comprised of the patellofemoral joint, medial tibiofemoral joint, lateral tibiofemoral joint, and superior tibiofibular joint. It is a modified hinge joint with primary motion in the sagittal plane (flexion–extension). During the clinical assessment, the physician should try to reproduce the patient's knee pain through palpation as well as biomechanical evaluation. Biomechanical examination is important in determining any potential predisposing or contributing factors. This should include an assessment for genetic predisposing factors such as excessive stiffness, loose-jointedness, and/or poor muscle tone. Functional biomechanics should be assessed by evaluation of gait, and maneuvers such as jumping, hopping (single and double-leg), and squatting. Knee swelling is unusual in anterior knee pain and generally implies intra-articular pathology, synovitis, or loose body. The contralateral knee and ipsilateral hip should always be examined.

- **Anterior anatomy of the knee**:
	- Observation of standing pelvis heights, lower limb alignment, and "Q" quadriceps angle. This angle is formed by the intersection of the line drawn from the anterior superior iliac spine to the center of the patella and the line drawn from the center of the patella to the tibial tuberosity. Normal Q angles are 8 to 12° for males and 15 to 18° for females.

### Current concepts review: Comprehensive physical examination for instability of the knee [^111SApYb]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

A careful history and physical examination are cornerstones of orthopedic sports medicine. When evaluating a patient for ligamentous instability of the knee joint, understanding the contribution of anatomic structures to stability enhances a practitioner's ability to achieve an accurate clinical diagnosis. This article reviews the various types of knee instability and the associated anatomic structures. Ultimately, information must be obtained from multiple tests to reach the final diagnosis. We describe in detail the pathologic and biomechanical basis of the tests for both tibiofemoral and patellofemoral instability of the knee joint and provide recommendations for performance and interpretation of these physical examinations.

### Treatment for acute anterior cruciate ligament tear: Five year outcome of randomised trial [^1141dqkv]. BMJ (2013). High credibility.

The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear treatment study reported outcomes using the knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS), where higher scores indicate better results. The KOOS consists of four subscales: pain, symptoms, function in sports and recreation, and knee-related quality of life, with scores ranging from 0 to 100. It also assesses activity levels emphasizing the knee, scored from 1 (least strenuous) to 10 (high knee-demanding activities on a professional sports level).

Patient outcomes indicated those with scores at five years matching or exceeding their pre-injury scores. Anteroposterior laxity of the knee was measured at rest in a semiflexed position, with results ranging from 0 (normal laxity) to 3 (severely increased laxity). Data included knees with normal laxity. Additionally, knee rotational stability was assessed at rest, with results ranging from 0 (normal stability) to 3 (severely increased instability), also including knees with normal stability.

### Review for the generalist: Evaluation of anterior knee pain [^115db8Rn]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Patellofemoral dysplasia, whether congenital or acquired, represents a spectrum of disorders characterized by static and dynamic malalignment of the patella relative to the distal femur. This malalignment results in maltracking of the patella, which leads to instability and potential osteochondral injury. Four clinical subtypes are recognized based on the degree of malalignment: mild dynamic imbalance of the patella with excessive loading of the lateral patellar and femoral facets (lateral patellar compression syndrome), chronic subluxing patella, patellar dislocation, and chronic (or obligatory) dislocation of the patella.

Patients with patellofemoral instability may complain of anterior knee pain, episodic giving way, and locking and catching sensations associated with re-effusions. On examination, findings are similar to patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFP). Observations may include patella alta, tenderness over the medial patella femoral ligament, a positive patellar apprehension test, or frank lateral dislocation. Treatment includes stretching tight lateral structures (vastus lateralis, iliotibial band), strengthening medial structures (vastus medialis oblique - VMO), using knee orthoses for patellar stabilization, and employing foot orthoses to correct excessive subtalar pronation. Orthopedic referral and possible surgical management are recommended for recurrent and chronic obligatory patellar dislocations.

- **Patellar tendinopathy**: "Jumper's knee" or patellar tendinopathy is a common cause of infrapatellar pain. Pain is usually maximal at the patellar attachment and proximal tendon and is aggravated by activities that involve jumping or repetitive knee extension.

### Management of first-time patellar dislocation: The ESSKA 2024 formal consensus-part 1 [^116t7uJC]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Low credibility.

Part 1 of the consensus focuses on clinical presentation, symptoms, diagnosis, evaluation, imaging, and complications, covering questions 1–9 and 27–29. Question 2 is divided into two questions and two statements, each with different grades. Part II addresses nonoperative treatment, bracing, rehabilitation, indications, and surgical strategies, encompassing questions 10 to 26.

Each question was categorized based on its scientific level: Grade A indicating a high scientific level, B indicating scientific presumption, C indicating a low scientific level, and D representing expert opinion.

- **Rating group**: The statements were evaluated by a group of 24 patellofemoral surgeons across European countries. Each expert assessed all pairings using a 1- to 9-point Likert grading scale, where values of 2–8 represented possible intermediate situations. A proposal was considered appropriate if the median value was ≥ 7 and each rater's score was ≥ 5, indicating relative agreement, and strong agreement if the median value was ≥ 7 with no individual rater scoring < 7. In cases of diversity, questions and statements were revised based on the comments from the rating group and subjected to a second round. In the first round, 32 questions were presented to the group, and 12 required revisions after the first round. The revised questions and statements were then rated again in the second round, with six of the 12 questions belonging to Part 1.

### The posterolateral corner of the knee: Anatomy, biomechanics and management of injuries [^114j5f1U]. Injury (2004). Low credibility.

The structures within the posterolateral corner of the knee have recently been "re-discovered", highlighting their critical role in maintaining knee stability. Injury to the posterolateral corner is not common, but neither is it rare; it typically occurs in combination with rupture of one of the cruciate ligaments during direct and indirect trauma to the knee. When reconstructing a knee to restore stability following such injuries, it is important to recognize damage to the posterolateral corner so that it can be corrected. Ignored damage in this region may result in continued knee instability and subsequent failure of cruciate ligament reconstruction.

We present a review of the anatomy and biomechanics of the structures in the posterolateral corner. This is then related to the diagnosis of injuries in the region via history, examination, and imaging. We also discuss the management of injuries to the posterolateral corner, describing our preferred method of repair.

### Consensus methods in patellofemoral pain: How rigorous are they? A scoping review [^112wYyqE]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Clinicians and researchers have sought consensus with increasing frequency on topics related to patellofemoral pain (PFP). However, consensus statements on PFP have often failed to rigorously develop consensus recommendations concerning the four questions we outlined in this review. The lack of systematic searching to identify potential evidence gaps may have resulted in statements focusing on areas with well-established research evidence or missing important topics where no information exists. Given the potential for consensus to direct whole bodies of research, it is perhaps most concerning that the patient voice has been almost totally absent.

Future consensus statements that are rigorous, representative (of all interested or impacted parties), and clearly report their development processes could be seen as more credible.

### Rehabilitation versus surgical reconstruction for non-acute anterior cruciate ligament injury (ACL SNNAP): A pragmatic randomised controlled trial [^114crzEC]. Lancet (2022). High credibility.

Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is often associated with symptoms such as knee instability, positive pivot shift test, and issues with sports participation. It can also lead to medial collateral ligament tear, knee tenderness, hemarthrosis, knee pain, knee effusion, knee hemarthrosis, gait disturbance, and knee swelling. Additional consequences of an ACL tear include inability to walk, a positive anterior drawer test, decreased knee range of motion (ROM), meniscal tear, and conditions affecting adolescents like Segond fracture and genu valgum. Diagnostic tests like the positive patellar glide test and the positive Lachman test further indicate the presence of ACL injury. The management of such injuries can often inspire a debate between opting for rehabilitation versus surgical reconstruction, with this study exploring the impacts and outcomes of each approach.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary: Management of anterior cruciate ligament injuries [^111Sgngp]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

This summary of recommendations from the AAOS Management of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries: Evidence-based Clinical Practice Guideline contains a list of evidence-based prognostic and treatment recommendations. Discussions of how each recommendation was developed and the complete evidence report are contained in the full guideline. Readers are urged to consult the full guideline for a comprehensive evaluation of available scientific studies.

The recommendations were established using methods of evidence-based medicine that rigorously control for bias, enhance transparency, and promote reproducibility. An exhaustive literature search was conducted, initially resulting in more than 1,100 papers for full review. The papers were then graded for quality and aligned with the work group's patients, interventions, and outcomes of concern.

- **CPG PICO**: For population, intervention, comparison, and outcome questions that returned no evidence from the systematic literature review, the work group used the established AAOS CPG methodology to generate one companion consensus statement. Physicians may consider aspirating painful, tense effusions after knee injury with likely or confirmed ACL tear.

The summary of recommendations is not intended to stand alone. Medical care should be based on evidence, a physician's expert judgment, and the patient's circumstances, values, preferences, and rights. A patient-centered discussion, understanding an individual patient's values and preferences, can inform appropriate decision-making.

### Activity demands and instability are the most important factors for recommending to treat ACL injuries with reconstruction [^111pYZ78]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Orthopaedic surgeons and physical therapists rated patients' wishes to return to contact/pivoting sports, knee joint instability in physical activity or activities of daily living despite adequate rehabilitation, physically demanding occupation, and young age as important factors for their decision to recommend ACL-R. The most prominent single factor influencing the decision was "knee instability". Both professions consider their own and each other's assessment as important for the decision to recommend ACL-R.

### Arthroscopic surgery for degenerative knee arthritis and meniscal tears: A clinical practice guideline [^117MPXkT]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The infographic provides an overview of the benefits and harms of arthroscopy in standard GRADE format. Estimates of baseline risk for effects come from the control arms of the trials; for complications, comparator risk was assumed to be nil.

The panel is confident that arthroscopic knee surgery does not, on average, result in an improvement in long-term pain or function. Most patients will experience a significant improvement in pain and function without arthroscopy. However, in less than 15% of participants, arthroscopic surgery resulted in a small or very small improvement in pain or function three months after surgery; this benefit was not sustained at one year. In addition to the burden of undergoing knee arthroscopy, there are rare but important harms, although the precision in these estimates is uncertain (low quality of evidence).

It is unlikely that new information will change the interpretation of the key outcomes of pain, knee function, and quality of life (as implied by high to moderate quality of evidence).

The panel is confident that the randomized controlled trials included adequate representation from groups commonly cited to derive benefit from arthroscopic knee surgery for degenerative knee disease — notably those with meniscal tears, no or minimal radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis, and those with sudden but non-traumatic symptom onset. Thus, the recommendation applies to all or almost all patients with degenerative knee disease. Further, the evidence applies to patients with any severity of mechanical symptoms.

### Outcomes after isolated medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction for recurrent patellar instability: Influence of persistent postoperative apprehension and J-sign [^113bHFDN]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Patients with recurrent instability underwent isolated medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction regardless of anatomic risk factors within the confines of strict exclusion criteria. Previous publications from this cohort have been limited in identifying risk factors for failure of isolated MPFL reconstruction when recurrent instability was defined as the only mode of failure, likely because of the small patient numbers who experienced this outcome.

- **Purpose**: To investigate whether the persistence of postoperative apprehension and J-sign indicate suboptimal outcomes after isolated MPFL reconstruction and to determine if these factors may help identify patients who need bony realignment in addition to soft tissue stabilization.

- **Study design**: This case series, with a level of evidence of 4, involved patients with recurrent patellar instability who were prospectively enrolled from March 2014 to December 2019. They underwent primary, unilateral MPFL reconstruction by the senior author within the confines of strict exclusion criteria. Imaging measurements were obtained at baseline. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were collected at baseline and annually. Recurrent instability events (patellar dislocations or subluxations), return-to-sport (RTS) rates, and the presence of postoperative apprehension and J-sign were collected at 1- and 2-year follow-ups.

- **Results**: A total of 138 knees (72% female; mean age, 20.1 ± 6.1 years) underwent isolated MPFL reconstruction between March 2014 and December 2019. The mean Beighton score was 5.3 ± 3.0, and knee hyperextension beyond 0° was 5.

### Anterior cruciate ligament surgery: Optimize return to activity and minimize risk of a second injury [^115uFp6Q]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

A torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) can be a devastating injury for active individuals and athletes. After the injury, some individuals will recover with a good rehabilitation program and will not need surgery. However, if the injured knee feels unstable or gives way, surgery to "reconstruct" the ACL may be required. After surgery, returning to pre-injury activities can be challenging. In a review article published in the November 2013 issue of JOSPT, researchers provide new insights and research-based strategies to help enhance performance and limit the risk of reinjury after ACL surgery.

### Dynamic knee stability: Current theory and implications for clinicians and scientists [^112qNmCa]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2001). Low credibility.

We will discuss the mechanisms by which dynamic knee stability may be achieved and relate this to issues that interest clinicians and scientists concerned with dynamic knee stability. Emphasis is placed on the neurophysiologic evidence and theory related to neuromuscular control. Specific topics discussed include the ensemble firing of peripheral mechanoreceptors, the potential for muscle stiffness modulation via force and length feedback, postural control synergies, motor programs, and the neural control of gait.

Factors related to answering the difficult question of whether knee ligament injuries can be prevented during athletic activities are discussed. Prevention programs that train athletes to perform their sport skills in a safe fashion are put forth as the most promising prospect for injury prevention. Methods of assessing neuromuscular function are reviewed critically, and the need for future research in this area is emphasized. We conclude with a brief review of the literature regarding neuromuscular training programs.

### Management of first-time patellar dislocation: The ESSKA 2024 formal consensus-part 1 [^1173eWzh]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). High credibility.

Despite many publications in the field of patellofemoral instability, relatively few studies exhibit a high scientific level, leaving several questions unresolved. A consensus project based on rigorous scientific methodology provides guidance and recommendations for general orthopedic surgeons, orthopedic specialists, and trauma surgeons, and is also relevant for physiotherapists. The method aims to integrate scientific evidence with expert opinions to achieve a peer‐reviewed conclusion with the highest possible level of agreement, serving as a guideline for professionals in this field.

Although regional differences in health systems throughout Europe mean a consensus cannot fully reflect all local aspects, the strict methodology offers an 'ideal' model for diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, with the potential for widespread implementation across Europe.

First-time patellar dislocation (FTPD) is the starting event in each case of patellar instability, whether it is a single incident or followed by redislocations or subluxations, with or without pain. Ongoing symptoms such as patellofemoral pain or limitations in knee-related quality of life are common. Risk factors for FTPD have been extensively studied and are well recognized; they are consistent with those in chronic cases. These factors include anatomical considerations, age, hyperlaxity, and trauma intensity.

### Recurrent patellofemoral instability rates after MPFL reconstruction techniques are in the range of instability rates after other soft tissue realignment techniques [^1171jfw5]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Low credibility.

Recurrent patellofemoral instability is a common knee injury in skeletally immature patients. Many surgical techniques have been described in the literature, all with different success rates. The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available literature to assess recurrent patellofemoral instability rates after surgical treatment using MPFL reconstruction techniques and other soft tissue realignment techniques in skeletally immature patients.

The study searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and The Cochrane Library to identify all original articles concerning the surgical treatment for patellofemoral instability in skeletally immature patients that reported post-operative recurrent patellofemoral instability rates. Subsequently, a risk of bias assessment was conducted, and a meta-analysis was performed on reported post-operative recurrent patellofemoral instability rates after MPFL reconstruction techniques and other soft tissue realignment techniques.

Of the 21 eligible studies (448 knees in 389 patients), 10 studies reported on MPFL reconstruction techniques using different grafts and fixation techniques, and 11 reported on other soft tissue realignment procedures. In total, 62 of the 448 (13.8%) treated knees showed recurrent patellofemoral instability during follow-up. The overall pooled recurrent patellofemoral instability rate was estimated to be 0.08 (95% CI 0.02–0.16). For MPFL reconstruction techniques, the pooled recurrent patellofemoral instability rate was estimated to be 0.02 (95% CI 0.00–0.09).

- **Important requirements of the FILSPARI REMS**: Prescribers must be certified with the FILSPARI REMS by enrolling and completing training. All patients must enroll in the FILSPARI REMS prior to initiating treatment and comply with monitoring requirements [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]. Pharmacies that dispense FILSPARI must be certified with the FILSPARI REMS and must dispense only to patients authorized to receive FILSPARI.

Further information is available at www.filsparirems.com or 1–833–513–1325.

- **Hypotension**: Hypotension has been observed in patients treated with ARBs and endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) and was observed in clinical studies with FILSPARI. In the PROTECT trial, there was a greater incidence of hypotension-associated adverse events, some serious, including dizziness, in patients treated with FILSPARI compared to irbesartan [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In patients at risk for hypotension, consider eliminating or adjusting other antihypertensive medications and maintaining appropriate volume status. If hypotension develops, despite the elimination or reduction of other antihypertensive medications, consider a dose reduction or dose adjustment.

### OARSI initiative to develop classification criteria for early-stage symptomatic knee OA (Esskoa): What conditions should be considered in the differential diagnosis of Esskoa [^115WJ3Sg]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2025). High credibility.

The classification criteria for early-stage symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (EsSKOA) should effectively discriminate individuals with EsSKOA from those with other causes of knee symptoms. We sought to identify conditions in the differential diagnosis of EsSKOA in adults with knee symptoms.

We conducted an online survey of clinicians consulting monthly on at least five people with undiagnosed knee symptoms. From qualitative work and clinical experience, we developed three case scenarios representing possible EsSKOA:

1. A 40-year-old with 1 month of knee stiffness and swelling.
2. A 50-year-old with 8 months of knee discomfort while walking.
3. A 60-year-old with intense knee discomfort after getting out of a car 1 week ago.

For each scenario, participants identified conditions from a pre-defined list that they would consider in the differential diagnosis and the top three diagnoses based on clinical experience. The proportions that considered each condition and among the top three diagnoses for each scenario were summarized overall and by clinical discipline.

A total of 127 clinicians responded (43% female, 48% in practice ≤ 15 years, 50% university-affiliated practice, across 7 clinical disciplines). Knee osteoarthritis (OA) and meniscal injuries were among the top three conditions in the differential diagnosis for all three scenarios. This was followed by immune-mediated and crystal-induced inflammatory arthritis for scenario 1, patellofemoral pain syndrome for scenario 2, and collateral ligament injuries for scenario 3.

### Dynamic intraligamentary stabilization: Novel technique for preserving the ruptured ACL [^115GPSk3]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2015). Low credibility.

The literature at the time of writing indicates that stability and biology are the two main determinants for ACL healing. Every tissue demands a certain level of stability to heal; however, a knee with an injured ACL shows a significant increase in antero-posterior translation of the tibio-femoral joint. This results in normal knee movements causing a constant disconnection of the two ACL stumps, creating an unstable healing environment. The published method of knee bracing in constant posterior translation for 3 months has produced a remarkable number of healed ligaments, but it is not widely accepted due to discomfort.

The authors have developed a new technique called dynamic intraligamentary stabilization (DIS) that restores the intrinsic stability of the knee with minimal discomfort for the patient. The DIS device employs an internal screw-spring mechanism that acts as a dynamic internal fixator, pushing the knee into maximum posterior translation at any degree of flexion. The spring is functional even when the intraligamentary thread is not placed in an isometric position. This technique has already been shown to provide sufficient mechanical stability, enabling biomechanically stable healing of the ACL in a sheep model.

Recent studies indicate that introducing a collagen-platelet composite into a transected ACL can significantly increase its healing capacity. Murray et al. used a collagen-platelet composite to bridge the wound site and reported healing with a recovery of over 50% of the initial ligament strength after 4 weeks.

### Consensus methods in patellofemoral pain: How rigorous are they? A scoping review [^111P4pP9]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Clinicians treating patients with patellofemoral pain (PFP) rely on consensus statements to make the best practice recommendations in the absence of definitive evidence on how to manage PFP. However, the methods used to generate and assess agreement for these recommendations have not been examined. Our objective was to map the methods used to generate consensus-based recommendations for PFP and apply four novel questions to assess the rigour of consensus development.

- **Design**: Scoping review.

- **Data sources**: We searched Medline, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, and Embase from inception to May 2022 to identify consensus-derived statements or practice guidelines on PFP. The Joanna Briggs Institute Manual for Evidence Synthesis was followed to map the existing evidence. We measured the consensus methods based on four sets of questions addressing the panel composition, application of the consensus method chosen, agreement process, and the use of evidence mapping.

- **Eligibility criteria**: All consensus statements or clinical guidelines on PFP were considered.

- **Results**: Twenty-two PFP consensus statements were identified.
	- **Panel composition**: 3 of the 22 (14%) consensus groups reported the panellists' experience, 2 (9%) defined a desired level of expertise, 10 (45%) reported panellist sex, and only 2 (9%) included a patient.
	- **Consensus method**: 7 of 22 (32%) reported using an established method of consensus measurement/development.
	- **Agreement process**: 10 of 22 (45%) reported their consensus threshold and 2 (9%) acknowledged dissenting opinions among the panel.
	- **Evidence mapping**: 6 of 22 (27%).

### Symptoms of knee instability as risk factors for recurrent falls [^112YtgD9]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of this research was to determine whether knee instability contributes to the increased risk of falls and fractures observed in persons with knee osteoarthritis (OA). The study examined the association of knee buckling with the risk of falling and fall-related consequences in older adults with, or at high risk for, knee OA.

At the 60-month visit of the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study, men and women aged 55–84 years were asked about knee buckling in the past 3 months and whether they fell when a knee buckled. Falls and fall-related injuries in the past 12 months and balance confidence were assessed at 60 and 84 months. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the association of knee buckling with falls and their consequences.

A total of 1,842 subjects (59% women, mean age 66.9 ± 7.8 years, and body mass index 30.3 ± 5.7) were included. At 60 months, 16.8% reported buckling, and at 84 months, 14.1% had recurrent (≥ 2) falls. Those who reported buckling at 60 months had a 1.6- to 2.5-fold greater odds of recurrent falls, fear of falling, and poor balance confidence at 84 months. Participants who fell when a knee buckled at baseline had a 4.5-fold, 2-fold, and 3-fold increased odds 2 years later of recurrent falls, significant fall injuries, and fall injuries that limited activity, respectively, and were 4 times more likely to have poor balance confidence.

These findings suggest that interventions targeting the reduction of knee buckling may help prevent falls, fall-related injuries, and adverse psychological consequences of falls in persons with knee OA.

### Predictive scoring for recurrent patellar instability following a first-time patellar dislocation [^112svUUT]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2022). Low credibility.

Patellofemoral instability is a common acute knee injury seen in the pediatric population. First-time patellar dislocations usually undergo conservative management, but approximately 15% to 80% of patients experience re-instability. This study aims to develop a prediction model using radiographic parameters of the patellofemoral joint seen on computed tomography scans in different degrees of knee flexion to determine the risk of recurrence after the first episode of patellofemoral instability.

A 12-year retrospective case-control study was performed. All patients in a single institution aged 18 years or younger who had a computed tomography patellar tracking scan performed for patellar instability were included. Predictors included in the score were determined through backward logistic regression and compared using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.

This study revealed that re-dislocation in first-time patellofemoral dislocation could be accurately predicted using the prediction score that consisted of age, tibial tubercle-trochlear groove distance, and congruence angle at 10- and 20-degree flexion. The sensitivity of the score was 100%, and specificity was 73.3%. Three diagnostic zones were identified and used to categorize patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-probability groups.

This study presented a scoring system that incorporated radiographic knee kinematics in the risk assessment for re-patellofemoral instability for patient stratification. The scoring system could guide the decision for early surgical intervention.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary: Management of anterior cruciate ligament injuries [^113dERa5]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

The management of anterior cruciate ligament injuries is documented in an evidence-based clinical practice guideline, derived from a systematic review of published studies. This guideline pertains to the treatment of anterior cruciate ligament injuries in both skeletally mature and immature patients. It comprises eight recommendations and seven options to assist orthopaedic surgeons and other qualified physicians in managing patients with ACL injuries based on the best available evidence. Furthermore, it serves as a resource for professional healthcare practitioners and developers of practice guidelines and recommendations. In addition to providing pragmatic practice recommendations, this guideline highlights gaps in the existing literature and informs areas for future research and quality measure development.

### The recurrent instability of the patella score: A statistically based model for prediction of long-term recurrence risk after first-time dislocation [^116NoGhW]. Arthroscopy (2019). High credibility.

The ReInstability of the Patella score, or RIP score, is a clinical calculator used in the field of orthopedics, specifically for patients with recurrent patellar instability. This scoring system is designed to predict the risk of recurrent patellar dislocation and takes into account factors such as age, gender, trochlear dysplasia, patella alta, and tibial tuberosity-trochlear groove distance.

The RIP score is particularly useful in guiding treatment decisions for patients with recurrent patellar instability, helping clinicians determine whether conservative or surgical management is more appropriate. Exclusion criteria for the use of the RIP score may include patients with acute patellar dislocation, those with a history of knee surgery, or those with other significant knee pathologies that could influence patellar stability.

The ReInstability of the Patella (RIP) score is a straightforward tool for assessing the likelihood of recurrent patellar instability. It operates on the basis of four key questions, each pertaining to specific patient characteristics or anatomical features, which numerically contribute to the overall score and reflect the risk level.

- **Younger than 25 years**: If "Yes", this condition adds 2 points to the score.
- **Skeletal immaturity**: Affirmative responses contribute 1 point.
- **Presence**

### Assessing joint line positions by means of the contralateral knee: a new approach for planning knee revision surgery [^112sinoB]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Reconstructing the natural joint line in knee revision surgery improves clinical and functional outcomes but may be challenging when both cartilage and bone were removed during previous operations. Assessing joint lines (JLs) by means of bony landmarks is inadvisable because of large variations in human anatomy. Because of the inherent symmetry of the human body, we hypothesized that JLs may be directly assessed by measuring the distances from the bony landmarks to the JL of the contralateral knee by means of radiographic images.

Using scaled weight-bearing radiographs in anteroposterior view of both knees, two independent observers measured the distances from the fibular head, the medial and lateral epicondyle, and the adductor tubercle to the JL. A two-sided p-value of ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Two hundred knees of 100 patients (50 men and 50 women) were examined. For the fibular head, the mean difference between the treated and the control knee was 0.0 mm with narrow confidence limits ranging from -1.1 to 1.1.

As a new assessment method, we have suggested to assess the JL by means of radiographs of the contralateral knee. The most precise parameter was found to be the distance between the fibular head and the JL. The level of arthritis, age, gender, visibility of the landmarks, and misalignment did not influence measurement accuracy. This parameter is the first tibia-related landmark for assessing the JL, which advantageously corresponds to the tibia-first technique in revision surgery.

In the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of the workgroup that physicians may consider aspirating painful, tense effusions after knee injury.

- **Strength of recommendation**: Consensus

- **Implication**: In the absence of reliable evidence, practitioners should remain alert to new information, as emerging studies may change this recommendation. Practitioners should weigh this recommendation with their clinical expertise and be sensitive to patient preferences.

### Treatment after anterior cruciate ligament injury: Panther Symposium ACL treatment consensus group [^1147Nj6b]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Low credibility.

Whereas operative treatment aims to reduce laxity, non-operative treatments aim to reduce functional instability and both thereby prevent further damage to the menisci and cartilage, which may contribute to post-traumatic osteoarthritis. Functional bracing, intended to reduce the risk of ACL injury by decreasing peak ligament strain, has not yet been conclusively shown to achieve this goal, as the evidence is still limited.

There is still uncertainty as to which patients should undergo immediate surgery and which patients may be successfully treated non-operatively. Three different patient responses after ACL injury have been described:

1. A coper can return to the pre-injury level without surgery and subjective instability.
2. An adapter reduces his/her level of activity to avoid subjective instability.
3. A non-coper cannot return to pre-injury activity level due to subjective instability and episodes of giving way.

A screening tool to differentiate potential copers from non-copers was developed and included a combination of hop tests, questionnaires on general knee function, and the frequency of giving-way episodes. Patients categorized as potential copers thereafter participated in structured progressive rehabilitation with additional perturbation training. Regardless of this three-response concept, there is a strong historical view that the treatment approach should be determined through a shared decision-making process between the clinician and the patient.

### Review of knee proprioception and the relation to extremity function after an anterior cruciate ligament rupture [^115fs8ZN]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2001). Low credibility.

Several tests of human conscious knee proprioception have been described, but there is no consensus or reference standard established. Difficulties remain in separating information originating from muscles, tendons, and joints. The tests cannot discriminate between the loss of afferent signals or altered activity in the remaining receptors. There is convincing evidence from several descriptive studies that the afferent information is altered following a knee ligament injury and severely disturbed in some patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. However, an inherent inferior proprioceptive ability may also exist in some individuals, making them vulnerable to injuries.

The deficits in proprioception have mostly been studied and related to the consciously registered sense, whereas the extent of possible disturbances of the unconscious or reflex mechanisms is largely unknown. The latter may, at least theoretically, predominantly contribute to overall afferent regulation. A possibility for major defects exists due to the lack of knowledge regarding the quantified relation between the conscious and unconscious parts. The clinical importance of the altered afferent information has not been properly evaluated, and the role of proprioception that contributes to function has yet to be investigated.

A higher physiological sensitivity to detecting passive joint motion closer to full extension has been found both experimentally and clinically, which may protect the joint due to its close proximity to the limit of joint motion.

### Patellar tracking should be taken into account when measuring radiographic parameters for recurrent patellar instability [^114LLydr]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, many radiographic parameters on patellar instability have their measurements taken statically and have not been studied in various degrees of flexion according to the patellar tracking. There are also limited data regarding the use of these parameters in predicting recurrent patellar dislocation. The study aims to review the radiographic parameters of the patellofemoral joint in different degrees of knee flexion and to correlate them with the presence of recurrent instability.

A 10-year retrospective study was conducted on all patients who had computed tomography patellar-tracking scans done for patellar instability when aged 18 years or younger. The computed tomography patellar-tracking scans were performed with the knee in extension, 10° flexion, and 20° flexion. The axial radiographic parameters were evaluated at the patellar equator, roman arch, and distal patellar pole. Sagittal and coronal parameters were noted. Radiographic parameters were then correlated with recurrent patellar instability.

The femoral sulcus angle and trochlear groove depth at the distal patellar pole in 10° knee flexion (p value 0.04 and 0.03, respectively) and patellar equator in 20° knee flexion (p value 0.02 and 0.03, respectively) had the most significant clinical correlations with recurrent instability on multivariate analysis. Other radiographic parameters found to have significant clinical correlation on univariate analysis include the patellar tilt angle, congruence angle, femoral sulcus angle, trochlear groove depth, and Wiberg's classification.

### Consensus methods in patellofemoral pain: How rigorous are they? A scoping review [^116VK52b]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

To obtain a clear and useful answer from a consensus panel, it is important that invited panellists are both knowledgeable and representative of the population the answers will serve. The panellists recruited to develop consensus on topics related to patellofemoral pain (PFP) have been male dominated (80%) and largely from high-income countries, especially North America — USA or Canada represented in 73% of panels, Western Europe — 52%, and Australia — 43%. Without justification, there is a focus on medical doctors, allied health professionals, and researchers. Low or lower-middle income countries were represented in only one consensus panel (5%). Patients have largely been absent, with only two statements including a patient on their panel. Questions on diagnosis and treatment (i.e. those most concerning patients) were the most commonly asked in the PFP/patellofemoral osteoarthritis consensus-based research. Therefore, it might have been expected that patients would be more involved.

In some cases, it may be appropriate for consensus panels to focus on 'experts-only'. The recently developed reporting guideline for consensus exercises recommends detailed reporting of the criteria for panellist inclusion. We note that most consensus developers did not provide definitions of expertise other than 'experience'. Expertise and experience are conceptually different, and we encourage deeper consideration of the use of 'expertise' to justify the make-up of consensus panels. Too much group homogeneity ma…

### Self-reported knee instability before and after total knee replacement surgery [^113USf6U]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

To determine the prevalence and burden of pain and activity limitations associated with retaining presurgery self-reported knee instability 6 months after total knee replacement (TKR) surgery, the study aimed to identify early potentially modifiable risk factors for retaining knee instability in the operated knee after TKR surgery. A secondary analysis was performed using measures obtained from 390 participants undergoing primary unilateral TKR and participating in a randomized clinical trial. Self-reported knee instability was measured using two items from the Activities of Daily Living Scale of the Knee Outcome Survey. Outcome measures included knee pain (range 0–20) and physical function (range 0–68) on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), stair-climb power, 50-foot walk time, knee range of motion, and isometric knee flexion and extension strength.

In this study, 72% of participants reported knee instability just prior to surgery, with 32% retaining instability in the operated knee 6 months after surgery. Participants retaining operated knee instability experienced significantly more knee pain and activity limitations 6 months after surgery, with mean ± SD WOMAC scores of 4.8 ± 3.7 and 17.5 ± 11.1, respectively, compared to those without knee instability, with scores of 2.9 ± 3.1 and 9.8 ± 9.2. The multivariable predictor model for retained knee instability included a high comorbidity score (> 6), low stair-climb power (7 of 20), and younger age (< 60 years).

### 2016 patellofemoral pain consensus statement from the 4th International Patellofemoral Pain Research Retreat, Manchester. Part 1: Terminology, definitions, clinical examination, natural history, patellofemoral osteoarthritis and patient-reported outcome measures [^113opG6u]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The consensus statement discusses the terminology used to describe a condition affecting the patellofemoral joint. Two terms were proposed: (1) PFP (patellofemoral pain) and (2) patellofemoral arthropathy. Although PFP has been the preferred term recently, it does not account for non-painful joint conditions that could precede pain development. Additionally, it does not encompass symptoms such as crepitus and may emphasize the 'pain' aspect of the condition.

The alternative term, patellofemoral arthropathy, was suggested due to increasing recognition that PFP might be symptomatic of joint disease. However, this focus on the disease process might be inappropriate because: (A) the linkage between the disease process and pain presentation is not clear, (B) pain is the predominant symptom, and (C) it could shift the focus to imaging, rather than clinical outcomes.

- **Statement 1**: The term 'patellofemoral pain' is preferred and is synonymous with other terms, including: (1) PFP syndrome, (2) chondromalacia patella, (3) anterior knee pain and/or syndrome, and (4) runner's knee.

### Surgical versus conservative interventions for treating anterior cruciate ligament injuries [^115XL5ib]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

Rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a common injury, mainly affecting young, physically active individuals. The injury is characterized by joint instability, leading to decreased activity and potentially resulting in a poor knee-related quality of life. It is also associated with an increased risk of secondary osteoarthritis of the knee. It is unclear whether stabilizing the knee surgically via ACL reconstruction produces a better overall outcome compared to non-surgical (conservative) treatment.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of surgical versus conservative interventions for treating ACL injuries.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (18 January 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2016, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1946 to January Week 1 2016), MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations (18 January 2016), EMBASE (1974 to 15 January 2016), trial registers (February 2016), and reference lists.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials that compared the use of surgical and conservative interventions in participants with an ACL rupture. We included any trial that evaluated surgery for ACL reconstruction using any method of reconstruction, type of reconstruction technique, graft fixation, or type of graft.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three review authors independently screened all titles and abstracts for potentially eligible studies, for which we then obtained full-text reports. Two authors then independently confirmed eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk.

### Management of first-time patellar dislocation: The ESSKA 2024 formal consensus-part 1 [^112juRvc]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to provide recommendations for the treatment of patients with first-time patellar dislocation (FTPD), focusing on clinical presentation, symptoms, diagnosis, evaluation, and imaging.

Fifty-four orthopedic surgeons and one physiotherapist from 20 countries across Europe participated in the consensus. The methodology followed the European Society for Sports Traumatology, Knee Surgery and Arthroscopy guidelines. The steering group formulated questions and statements based on expert experience and existing literature. These statements were evaluated by peer-review groups before reaching a final consensus.

The consensus includes 32 questions and statements, with 13 being reviewed in Part 1. An inverse correlation was found between the intensity of trauma leading to FTPD and underlying pathoanatomic risk factors, where low trauma intensity often signifies more severe underlying abnormalities. Patient evaluation should include age, family history, bilateral symptoms of instability, and injury mechanisms. Clinical examination should be complemented by magnetic resonance imaging, which is critical for assessing predisposing factors like trochlear dysplasia and patella alta, and for identifying osteochondral lesions, except in asymptomatic patients.

### ACR appropriateness criteria chronic knee pain [^111KaZah]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for patellofemoral pain syndrome, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging (chronic knee pain), ACR 2018 guidelines recommend obtaining a knee MRI when the initial knee X-ray is normal or demonstrates joint effusion, osteochondritis dissecans, loose bodies, signs of prior osseous injury (such as a Segond fracture or tibial spine avulsion), or in the presence of a history of cartilage or meniscal repair.
