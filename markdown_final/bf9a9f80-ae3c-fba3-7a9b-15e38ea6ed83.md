## Question

What are the indications for renal replacement therapy in ESRD patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the indications for initiating renal replacement therapy in end-stage renal disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing ESRD from AKI contexts. Then, I should verify the highest-quality guideline sources and extract the indication categories. Next, I will examine the evidence base, especially the IDEAL trial and related observational data. After that, I need to consider special populations and the role of conservative care. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, patient-centered decision framework and state the bottom line clearly with caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context, because indications differ between chronic kidney failure and acute kidney injury; here, the question is explicitly about ESRD, so I should anchor on chronic kidney failure guidance rather than AKI algorithms, even though some principles overlap, and I need to ensure I do not conflate emergency AKI indications with elective ESRD decisions.

> Next, I should review the highest-credibility sources; KDIGO 2024 is the most authoritative, and I should double-check that I am citing the correct practice points. KDIGO advises initiating dialysis based on a composite assessment of symptoms, signs, quality of life, preferences, GFR, and labs, and to start when one or more of the following are present: uremic symptoms or signs, refractory volume overload or hypertension, or progressive nutritional decline or cognitive impairment, noting this often but not invariably occurs when GFR is 5–10 mL/min/1.73 m² [^114STYkA] [^116yuL3S].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about GFR thresholds; I initially thought a hard GFR cut-off might be endorsed, but wait, let me verify. KDIGO explicitly rejects eGFR-only triggers and emphasizes individualized, symptom-driven initiation, with the 5–10 mL/min/1.73 m² range serving as a typical, not mandatory, zone where indications commonly emerge; this is reinforced by KDOQI and the IDEAL randomized trial showing no survival advantage to starting at higher eGFR when symptoms are absent [^114STYkA] [^114UeM3b] [^115Evmzi].

> I will now examine the evidence base to ensure alignment. The IDEAL RCT compared early initiation at eGFR 10–14 versus late initiation at 5–7 mL/min/1.73 m² and found no mortality benefit to starting earlier, supporting a defer-until-indicated strategy; observational cohorts associating higher eGFR at initiation with worse outcomes likely reflect reverse causation from frailty and comorbidity, not a causal benefit of earlier dialysis, so I should be cautious not to over-interpret those signals [^115Evmzi] [^116uGhUp] [^1112AFFt].

> Let me consider the three core indication categories and make sure I capture them accurately. First, uremic symptoms or signs such as encephalopathy, pericarditis, intractable pruritus, serositis, or medically refractory acid-base or electrolyte disturbances; second, inability to control volume status or blood pressure despite optimized medical therapy; and third, progressive deterioration in nutritional status or cognitive impairment despite dietary intervention, recognizing that these often cluster when GFR is 5–10 but can occur outside that range and should be assessed holistically [^114STYkA] [^116yuL3S].

> But wait, what if the patient is older, frail, or has limited life expectancy; I should confirm how guidelines address this. KDIGO and KDOQI endorse shared decision-making and support comprehensive conservative management as a legitimate alternative when the burdens of dialysis outweigh benefits, with particular caution in older adults with high comorbidity, where early dialysis may not improve survival or quality of life and may increase treatment burden; this means I need to screen for goals, functional status, and prognosis before recommending initiation [^116HtcCM] [^114UeM3b] [^115NqB8h].

> I need to check pediatric nuances, because growth failure is a unique indication. In children, in addition to adult indications, poor growth refractory to optimized nutrition, growth hormone, and medical management is an indication to initiate kidney replacement therapy, and preemptive transplantation is preferred when feasible, with timing individualized to age, size, and disease trajectory; I should ensure I do not overgeneralize adult thresholds to pediatrics [^115YXBf2] [^117RwU6y].

> Next, I should review practical decision-making steps to avoid missing key elements. I should confirm that the patient has received education on modalities and conservative care, assess for reversible causes of symptoms before attributing them to uremia, document a composite evaluation of symptoms, volume status, nutrition, cognition, labs, and GFR trend, and engage in shared decision-making that incorporates patient preferences and prognosis; this iterative process helps prevent both premature and delayed initiation [^114SZcaH] [^114STYkA].

> Hold on, I should verify the bottom line and make it actionable. Dialysis should be initiated when there is at least one of the following: clinically significant uremic symptoms or complications, refractory volume overload or hypertension despite maximal medical therapy, or progressive malnutrition or cognitive decline, recognizing that this typically but not exclusively occurs when GFR is about 5–10 mL/min/1.73 m²; in the absence of such indications, deferral is reasonable and supported by randomized and observational data, with individualized consideration of conservative care in older or comorbid patients [^114STYkA] [^115Evmzi] [^116uGhUp].

Renal replacement therapy (RRT) is indicated in ESRD when **symptomatic uremia** (encephalopathy, pericarditis, pleuritis, bleeding) [^114STYkA], **refractory volume overload** (pulmonary edema, resistant hypertension) [^116yuL3S], or **severe electrolyte/acid-base disturbances** (hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis) [^114STYkA] are present. RRT is also indicated for **progressive malnutrition** or **cognitive decline** despite optimal care [^114STYkA], and for **pediatric growth failure** refractory to therapy [^115YXBf2]. Routine initiation based on a specific eGFR threshold is not recommended; decisions should be individualized using shared decision-making [^114UeM3b] [^114SZcaH]. Conservative management is appropriate for patients with limited benefit or preference against dialysis [^116HtcCM] [^113duMi1].

---

### Progressive malnutrition and cognitive decline

Progressive **malnutrition** — evidenced by weight loss, hypoalbuminemia, or protein-energy wasting despite dietary intervention [^114STYkA] — and **cognitive impairment** with decline attributable to kidney failure are indications to initiate RRT [^114STYkA].

---

### Pediatric considerations

In children, **growth failure** refractory to optimized nutrition, growth hormone, and medical management is an indication for RRT [^115YXBf2] [^117RwU6y].

---

## Timing of RRT initiation

- **Individualized approach**: Initiate based on symptoms, signs, QoL, preferences, GFR, and labs [^114STYkA] [^116yuL3S].
- **GFR range**: Often 5–10 mL/min/1.73 m², but not a strict threshold [^114STYkA] [^116yuL3S].
- **Shared decision-making**: Essential to align treatment with patient goals [^114SZcaH] [^114UeM3b].

---

## Contraindications and considerations for withholding RRT

- **Limited benefit**: Elderly, frail, or multimorbid patients may not benefit [^115NqB8h] [^113duMi1].
- **Patient preference**: Conservative care is appropriate when aligned with goals [^116HtcCM] [^113duMi1].
- **Ethical considerations**: Use time-limited trials and advance care planning [^115gPKZL] [^116rBgaG].

Few, if any, doubt that renal transplantation should be the first choice of renal replacement therapy whenever this option is possible. But, at which level of remaining kidney function should patients start on dialysis and which dialysis modality should be used? Several studies published in 2010 addressed these questions and will influence dialysis initiation strategies worldwide for years to come.

The optimal timing for initiation of renal replacement therapy in patients with acute kidney injury remains uncertain. Conventionally accepted indications include volume overload, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, overt uremia, and even progressive azotemia in the absence of specific symptoms; however, precise definitions for these indications are lacking. Data from recent observational trials have suggested that early initiation of renal replacement therapy may be associated with decreased mortality; however, the results of these studies are inconclusive. Existing data on timing of initiation of renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury that guide current clinical practice are summarized and issues that need to be addressed in future clinical trials are discussed.

### Initiation of dialysis should be timely: neither early nor late [^1125Gsji]. Seminars in Dialysis (2013). Low credibility.

Over the last decade, individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States are starting maintenance dialysis therapy at progressively higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Moreover, several observational studies have demonstrated an association of a higher risk of death with higher serum creatinine-based estimates of GFR at the time of initiation of dialysis. In contrast, studies in which renal function has been measured by timed urinary collection show either a lower risk of death or no significant association with higher GFR at the time of initiation of dialysis. There are numerous potential sources of bias in such observational studies, particularly in those that use serum creatinine-based eGFR. The only randomized controlled clinical trial to have examined this question did not demonstrate either benefit or harm with initiation of dialysis at higher level of renal function. Thus, the data to date suggest that eGFR should not be the sole consideration when assessing the need for initiating maintenance dialysis in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. Given the high societal costs of starting renal replacement therapy earlier in the course of the disease, these considerations also suggest that dialysis can be safely be postponed in otherwise asymptomatic individuals with advanced chronic kidney disease. By the same token, dialysis should not be denied to individuals who could clearly benefit from renal replacement therapy simply because the GFR is too high (viz., volume overload, refractory hyperkalemia). Finally, there is a compelling need to reexamine the symptoms that could be attributed to uremia and clearly improve upon initiation of dialysis to better guide clinical decision-making.

### Optimizing medical management of patients with pre-end-stage renal disease [^116DwPon]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Patients with end-stage renal disease have reduced quality of life, high levels of morbidity, and an annual mortality of about 22%. Because the high morbidity and mortality of dialysis patients might be reduced substantially if patients were healthier at the time of initiating renal replacement therapy, this article will present treatment recommendations designed to retard the progression of chronic renal disease, to optimize the medical management of comorbid medical conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and lipid disorders, and to reduce the complications of renal insufficiency, including hypertension, anemia, hyperparathyroidism, and malnutrition. Given the lack of prospective clinical studies in this area, these recommendations are derived from consensus standards for managing dialysis patients or patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and lipid disorders, and from expert opinion derived from laboratory investigations of pathophysiology and relevant experimental disease models.

Introduction

Patients with end-stage kidney disease have a high disease burden and a mortality rate that exceeds age-matched individuals with cancer and cardiovascular disease. Renal replacement therapy is life-long treatment to replace the normal function of the kidneys with either chronic dialysis (peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis) or renal transplantation. However, older patients with end-stage kidney disease and additional comorbidities may not achieve improved functional status or live longer on renal replacement therapy. They may be unsuitable for renal transplantation and have complex technical challenges associated with initiating dialysis. Furthermore, some older patients may face the decision of whether or not to even start renal replacement therapy. Those who accept renal replacement therapy often experience a range of distressing psychological and physical symptoms. Despite this, many do not have conversations with loved ones or clinicians about end-of-life issues such as preferences in relation to admission to intensive care, referral to palliative care services, withdrawal from renal replacement therapy, resuscitation, or where they might choose to die. In this context, advance care planning may be a useful intervention to promote shared decision-making among patients, their families, and health care professionals.

### Preemptive renal transplantation: why not? [^115F9org]. American Journal of Transplantation (2003). Low credibility.

Dialysis has been the long-established initial choice of treatment for persons with end-stage renal disease. Transplantation before dialysis, or preemptive renal transplantation (PRT), has been controversial because of the paucity of clinical evidence that has clarified the benefits vs. risks of this approach. However, several recent observational analyses indicate that PRT is the optimal strategy to benefit patients requiring renal replacement therapy. This current review will discuss the advantages that are associated with PRT, and will summarize studies that have investigated the impact of the timing of transplantation on outcomes. We will also discuss the utility of PRT from various perspectives, and describe the challenges ahead in expanding the opportunity of PRT for more patients.

### Update of dialysis initiation timing in end stage kidney disease patients: is it a resolved question? A systematic literature review [^115Evmzi]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major global public health problem, and there is an increasing number of end stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients start dialysis annually. The decision on optimal initiation of maintenance dialysis is a common problem faced by nephrologists. During 1980s-2000s, extensive observational studies have been attempted to investigate the optimal estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at the start of dialysis. In 2010 a randomized controlled trial named "trial Initiating Dialysis Early and Late (IDEAL)" showed that a strategy of early dialysis initiation (target eGFR: 10–14 mL/min/1.73 m²) was not superior to late initiation (waiting until symptoms develop or eGFR is 5–7 mL/min/1.73 m²). Since then, clinical practice guidelines suggest that the decision of initiate maintenance dialysis should be guided primarily by clinical constellation of signs and symptoms attributable to uremic syndrome. However, symptoms or signs of uremia are varied and complex, mainly depends on clinical judgment; what's more, typical uremic symptoms such as pericarditis and encephalopathy in patients without volume overload often occur at a very low GFR, these conditions are often combined with severe metabolic disorders and/or organ damages; the exact optimal timing of dialysis for ESKD patients remains unknown.

Therefore, the aim of our study is to systematically review the available evidence with regard to the optimal initiation of maintenance dialysis in ESKD patients.

### When should renal replacement therapy be initiated for acute kidney injury? [^111sTgXY]. Seminars in Dialysis (2011). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is now well recognized as an independent risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality particularly when dialysis is needed. Although renal replacement therapy (RRT) has been used in AKI for more than five decades, there is no standard methodology to predict which AKI patients will need dialysis and who will recover renal function without requiring dialysis. The lack of consensus on what parameters should guide the decision to start dialysis has led to a wide variation in dialysis utilization. A contributing factor is the lack of studies in the modern era evaluating the relationship of timing of dialysis initiation and outcomes. Although listed as one of the top priorities in research on AKI, timing of dialysis initiation has not been included as a factor in large, randomized controlled trials in this area. In this review we will discuss the criteria that have been used to define early vs. late initiation in previous studies on dialysis initiation. In addition, we propose a patient-centered approach to define early and late initiation that could serve as framework for managing patients and for future studies in this area.

### We offer renal replacement therapy to patients who are not benefitted by It [^115gPKZL]. Seminars in Dialysis (2016). Low credibility.

Nephrologists offer renal replacement therapy (RRT) to patients who are unlikely to benefit in part because of our discomfort discussing goals of care in the setting of an uncertain prognosis for a given individual. Permanent neurological impairment, terminal illness (life expectancy < 6 months), medical conditions precluding the safe delivery of dialysis, elderly patients with poor prognosis, and those who begin "early" RRT are categories of patients for whom dialysis may not be beneficial. Successful use of time-limited trials of dialysis may reduce the number of patients who are started on RRT without significant benefit. However, clear achievable milestones and goals need to be incorporated into plans for time-limited trials to ensure that continuing RRT beyond the trial period is appropriate. The lack of information on outcomes and symptom management using a "palliative approach" to dialysis suggests this should not be a clinical option until additional study is done and efficacy data available. Clinical practice guidelines are available to assist nephrologists in the appropriate withholding of RRT.

### Better prevention than cure: optimal patient preparation for renal replacement therapy [^11658aMq]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

A generous proportion of end-stage renal disease patients may not be adequately prepared for initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT). Here we review potential benefits of early patient referral to nephrologists and optimal preparation for RRT. We place this evidence in the context of the epidemiological study by Kurella Tamura et al., which shows that voluntary community kidney disease screening and education is associated with better patient preparation and, importantly, improved survival upon initiation of RRT.

### Optimizing renal replacement therapy in older adults: a framework for making individualized decisions [^114aEjGL]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

It is often difficult to synthesize information about the risks and benefits of recommended management strategies in older patients with end-stage renal disease since they may have more comorbidity and lower life expectancy than patients described in clinical trials or practice guidelines. In this review, we outline a framework for individualizing end-stage renal disease management decisions in older patients. The framework considers three factors: life expectancy, the risks and benefits of competing treatment strategies, and patient preferences. We illustrate the use of this framework by applying it to three key end-stage renal disease decisions in older patients with varying life expectancy: choice of dialysis modality, choice of vascular access for hemodialysis, and referral for kidney transplantation. In several instances, this approach might provide support for treatment decisions that directly contradict available practice guidelines, illustrating circumstances when strict application of guidelines may be inappropriate for certain patients. By combining quantitative estimates of benefits and harms with qualitative assessments of patient preferences, clinicians may be better able to tailor treatment recommendations to individual older patients, thereby improving the overall quality of end-stage renal disease care.

### Beyond the technical: determining real indications for vascular access and hemodialysis initiation in end-stage renal disease [^114ueYbm]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Determining valid indications for vascular access creation and hemodialysis initiation in end-stage renal disease requires utilization of verified prognostication tools and recognition of triggers to initiate serious conversations, and implementation of concurrent palliative care and/or hospice care is recommended. Establishment of a multi-disciplinary team that includes consideration of interventionalists in the pre-dialysis medical situation is important. A "catheter best" approach may be the most appropriate for some patients to meet goals of care.

### Commentary on the NICE guideline on renal replacement therapy and conservative management [^1158ngPH]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The NICE guidance on RRT focusses on the entire life course of the patient with ESKD. The focus is on integrated, multidisciplinary and holistic care improvements to meet the needs of this unique, complex and high-risk patient group. Many of the aspects such as care coordination and transition are unique in the guidance. Implementation of these recommendations will require comprehensive review of policies, practice, care pathways and infrastructure, which can be potentially challenging within the constraints of current health care systems. There are several areas of controversy where definitive trial evidence is lacking. Much of our clinical current practice and current guidance is based on expert opinion and data largely obtained from observational studies. High quality prospective randomised studies are needed to answer many questions raised within the areas covered by the NICE guideline. Several of these are already underway, led by the UK kidney community, but further broadening of attitudes towards recognising uncertainty and offering randomisation could transform our ability to generate robust evidence to inform shared decision making. Other NICE research recommendations aimed at improving the gaps in evidence base, will need to be supported by kidney research consortiums and funding bodies. Ongoing trials and recommended research in RRT aim to improve the evidence of best practice in ESRD care and determine the future need for reaffirmation or reappraisal of the NICE RRT guidance.

### How I prescribe continuous renal replacement therapy [^115Y6bA5]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Timing of initiation

Early CRRT initiation may not improve outcomes, and the definition of "early" varies between studies. Therefore, clinical judgement guides CRRT initiation. We aim to prevent or rapidly treat life-threatening derangements in fluid status, electrolytes, and/or acid–base balance and to meet metabolic and fluid needs that residual kidney function cannot address.

### Indication for dialysis initiation and mortality in patients with chronic kidney failure: a retrospective cohort study [^1169bfPA]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Initiation of maintenance dialysis therapy for patients with chronic kidney failure is a period of high risk for adverse patient outcomes. Whether indications for dialysis therapy initiation are associated with mortality in this population is unknown.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting & Participants

461 patients who initiated dialysis therapy (hemodialysis, 437; peritoneal dialysis, 24) from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2012, and were treated in facilities operated by a single dialysis organization. Follow-up for the primary outcome was through December 31, 2013.

Predictor

Clinically documented primary indication for dialysis therapy initiation, as categorized into 4 groups: laboratory evidence of kidney function decline (reference category), uremic symptoms, volume overload or hypertension, and other/unknown.

Outcomes

All-cause mortality.

Results

During a median follow-up of 2.4 years, 183 (40%) patients died. Crude mortality rates were 10.0 (95% CI, 6.8–14.7), 12.7 (95% CI, 10.2–15.7), 21.7 (95% CI, 16.4–28.6), and 12.2 (95% CI, 6.8–14.7) deaths/100 patient-years among patients initiating dialysis therapy primarily for laboratory evidence of kidney function decline, uremic symptoms, volume overload or hypertension, and other/unknown reason, respectively. Following adjustment for demographic variables, coexisting illnesses, and estimated glomerular filtration rate, initiation of dialysis therapy for uremic symptoms, volume overload or hypertension, or other/unknown reasons was associated with 1.12 (95% CI, 0.72–1.77), 1.69 (95% CI, 1.02–2.80), and 1.28 (95% CI, 0.73–2.26) times higher risk, respectively, for subsequent mortality compared to initiation for laboratory evidence of kidney function decline.

Limitations

Possibility of residual confounding by unmeasured variables; reliance on clinical documentation to ascertain exposure.

Conclusions

Patients initiating dialysis therapy due to volume overload may have increased risk for mortality compared with patients initiating dialysis due to laboratory evidence of kidney function decline. Further studies are needed to identify and test interventions that might reduce this risk.

### Renal replacement therapy in liver transplant-ineligible patients [^113pae8A]. Liver Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

The decision to initiate renal replacement therapy (RRT) in patients who are ineligible for liver transplantation can be challenging. Careful patient selection is required to identify those who may benefit from early RRT as a pathway towards liver recovery or as a palliative plan of care. Emerging literature suggests that the etiology of kidney injury should play less of a role in clinical decision making. Decisions around RRT are often influenced by medical, ethical, and end-of life factors and should be made in conjunction with patients and their caregivers.

### Treatment of end-stage kidney failure without renal replacement therapy [^113duMi1]. Seminars in Dialysis (2016). Low credibility.

For the majority of patients with end-stage kidney failure (ESKF) replacement of excretory renal function by dialysis or transplantation (RRT) can extend life and alleviate symptoms. Historically, the availability of RRT has been insufficient and this remains the case for much of the world. However, RRT is now widely available in healthcare systems of higher income countries. Increasing numbers of elderly patients are developing ESKF. RRT in this population is largely by dialysis, comorbidity is high and life expectancy short. Evidence of effectiveness coupled with the burden of treatment among these individuals has raised concerns that health services in high-income countries may have moved from an era of unmet need into one of potential over-treatment. Alongside the requirement to make treatment more patient-centered, this has driven the development of comprehensive conservative care as an alternative approach for older comorbid individuals with ESKF, with the potential for acceptable symptom control and reduced treatment burden. This paper provides a largely UK-perspective on treating ESKF without RRT. Emphasis is on the need for high-quality evidence to inform treatment decisions. Complexities of defining, delivering and improving treatment of ESKF without dialysis care are explored. Quantitative and qualitative evidence are summarized and the relationship with palliative and terminal care examined. A framework is suggested for classifying management of ESKF and recommendations made to improve delivery of nondialysis care in the future. For patients with a poor prognosis, such treatment may not result in significantly different survival or quality of life when compared with dialysis. There is a key need to generate the best possible evidence of person-centered health outcomes associated with the various treatment options for ESKF and to present this to patients in a balanced, personalized way that allows them to make the treatment decision most appropriate for them.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^112QdGN4]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO AKI — timing of renal replacement therapy (RRT) recommendations state to initiate RRT emergently when life‑threatening changes in fluid, electrolyte, and acid–base balance exist, and to consider the broader clinical context, the presence of conditions that can be modified with RRT, and trends of laboratory tests — rather than single BUN and creatinine thresholds alone — when making the decision to start RRT (Not Graded). The rationale notes that while no RCTs exist for dialysis for life‑threatening indications, it is widely accepted that patients with severe hyperkalemia, severe acidosis, pulmonary edema, and uremic complications should be dialyzed emergently.

Initiating hemodialysis and frequency/duration — evidence signals: Despite lack of evidence from randomized controlled trials about the optimal time to start kidney replacement therapy, there has been a trend, which has leveled off since 2010, in the United States toward earlier initiation of dialysis at higher levels of kidney function; results of the IDEAL (Initiating Dialysis Early and Late) trial published in 2010 constitute the best evidence regarding timing of dialysis initiation, and observational and controlled nonrandomized studies had suggested that more frequent and/or longer dialysis improves the patient's quality of life, controls uremic symptoms, and decreases hospitalization and mortality, prompting the Frequent Hemodialysis Network daily and nocturnal trials to test these hypotheses.

### Dialysis therapies for end-stage renal disease [^116aVidT]. Seminars in Dialysis (2002). Low credibility.

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) has various causes that may differ according to country and racial group. Whatever the cause, unless the water, salt, electrolytes, and waste products excreted by normal kidneys are removed, their accumulation will result in death. Removal of these products can be variably achieved by either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. The principles and outcomes of these techniques are described, as are their complications. It is important that these two different methods of treatment are not regarded as competitive, but are integrated, together with renal transplantation where appropriate, into the management of patients with ESRD to optimize both outcome and quality of life.

### Clinical pharmacy activities in chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease patients: a systematic literature review [^116mzEZ9]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) represents a major public health problem in developed and developing countries. It is estimated that approximately 5% of the adult U.S. population is affected by CKD, which is defined as serum creatinine concentrations greater than 1.2 to 1.5 mg/dL. The European Kidney Health Alliance (EKHA) reports that approximately 10% of European citizens are affected by some degree of CKD.

CKD and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are associated with an increased risk of mortality, increased rate of hospitalisation, and decreased life expectancy. Progression from early to late stages of CKD generally results in the onset of new symptoms and concomitant complications. Frequent complications and comorbidities of CKD include fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, anaemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism and renal osteodystrophy, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, metabolic acidosis, and several other comorbidities involving malnutrition, pruritus and uremic bleeding. CKD patients are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes coronary heart disease (CHD), cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, and heart failure. The management of underlying and evident comorbidities (either as causes or consequences of CKD) and the prevention or delay of its progression to ESRD are complex.

In ESRD patients, the initiation of renal replacement therapies (RRTs), such as long-term dialysis (including haemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD)) or transplantation, is usually indicated to relieve uremic symptoms and detoxify, whereas kidney transplantation (cadaveric or living donor transplantation) is the therapy of choice for ESRD.

Multidisciplinary health care teams of physicians, nurses, dieticians, and clinical pharmacists share the goal of preventing disease progression and managing comorbid conditions in CKD and ESRD patients. As specialists in pharmacotherapy, clinical pharmacists are routinely involved in patient care and interact with other health care professionals, addressing multiple, often unmet needs for pharmacotherapy optimisation. Ideally, this happens through a preventive, rather than a reactive, approach. Evidence from the literature supports the involvement of clinical pharmacists in several disease areas and underlines the positive patient outcomes and improvement of care that result.

Timing the initiation of dialysis — indications and GFR range: Initiate dialysis based on a composite assessment of a person's symptoms, signs, QoL, preferences, level of GFR, and laboratory abnormalities, and initiate dialysis if the presence of one or more of the following situations is evident: symptoms or signs attributable to kidney failure (e.g., neurological signs and symptoms attributable to uremia, pericarditis, anorexia, medically resistant acid-based or electrolyte abnormalities, intractable pruritus, serositis, and acid-base or electrolyte abnormalities), inability to control volume status or blood pressure, or progressive deterioration in nutritional status refractory to dietary intervention, or cognitive impairment; this often but not invariably occurs in the GFR range between 5 and 10 ml/min per 1.73 m2.

Uncertainties about initiation of kidney replacement therapies and research priorities

A recent meta-analysis of cohort studies and trials has demonstrated that those who commence dialysis with a higher eGFR have a higher mortality. It is likely that this is due to reverse causality, with frailty and accumulated comorbidities, in particular HF, pushing the patient and clinician to initiate dialysis. Global differences exist in how planned KRT is initiated. These include a "PD first" approach, commencement with a functioning arteriovenous fistula and differences in site of fistula placement and "incremental" start to dialysis with either reduced blood flow rates, reduced hours, or limited PD exchanges. To which extent these factors influence outcomes is largely unclear. The indication for initiation of dialysis should be recorded routinely in registry data in addition to reporting elective versus unplanned start to dialysis. In the IDEAL study the majority of patients allocated to late start who started early had the indication for start identified as "uremia". Hence, it would be useful to understand the spectrum of symptoms that prompted initiation of dialysis to provide greater clarity regarding the optimum commencement. Research recommendations are summarized in Table 6.

### Renal replacement therapy in the elderly population [^116XtEEk]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

ESRD has become an important problem for elderly patients. The segment of the ESRD population age 65 years or older has grown considerably, and this growth is expected to accelerate in coming years. Nephrologists caring for the elderly with advanced kidney disease will encounter patients with comorbid conditions common in younger patients, as well as physical, psychological, and social challenges that occur with increased frequency in the aging population. These challenging factors must be addressed to help inform decisions regarding the option to initiate dialysis, the choice of dialysis modality, whether to pursue kidney transplantation, and end-of-life care. This article will highlight some common problems encountered by elderly patients with ESRD and review data on the clinical outcomes of elderly patients treated with different modalities of dialysis, outcomes of kidney transplantation in the elderly, and nondialytic management of CKD stage 5.

### Update of dialysis initiation timing in end stage kidney disease patients: is it a resolved question? A systematic literature review [^115brG9V]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Hence, a number of other studies paid attention to comprehensive assessment of uremic signs and/or symptoms for optimal dialysis initiation. Chang et al. quantified uremic burden based on 7 uremic indicators that reached the predefined threshold (hemoglobin, serum albumin, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, potassium, phosphorus, and bicarbonate); dialysis timing was classified as standard (met 0–2 uremic indicators), late (3–5indicators), and very late (6–7 indicators); and no correlation was found between late or very late group and mortality. Ying et al. developed an equation based on fuzzy mathematics to assess the timing of haemodialysis initiation, the results showed that the combination of sex, age, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, serum albumin, haemoglobin, serum phosphorus, diabetes mellitus, and heart failure as equation variables resulted in the best accuracy to prognose 3-year survival. Matthew et al. categorized clinically documented primary indication for dialysis initiation into 4 groups: laboratory evidence of kidney function decline (reference category), uremic symptoms, volume overload or hypertension, and other/unknown; and found that volume overload or hypertension was associated with the highest risk for subsequent mortality. These studies highlight future directions of comprehensive evaluation of dialysis timing, especially in patients with volume overload and complications sensitive to volume changes during dialysis, mainly varied causes of cardiovascular instabilities. It is well known that the main functions of PD or HD are to remove excess volumetric loads, filter solutes and balance electrolytes. As discussed above, previous studies about dialysis timing focused on GFR, which represent functions of solutes filter and electrolytes balance, showed no positive findings. Present novel finding is that: heart failure, volume overload or hypertension at dialysis initiation was associated with the highest risk for subsequent mortality; and suggests assessments of volume load and patient's tolerance to volume overload as prospective approaches, especially in ESKD patients with cardiovascular disease. Meanwhile, gathering more symptoms and biological disturbances compared to a start only based on GFR in future study is probably of upmost importance.

### A proposed algorithm for initiation of renal replacement therapy in adult critically ill patients [^116itcZi]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Critically ill patients whose course is complicated by acute kidney injury often receive renal replacement therapy (RRT). For these patients, initiation of RRT results in a considerable escalation in both the complexity and associated cost of care. While RRT is extensively used in clinical practice, there remains uncertainty about the ideal circumstances of when to initiate RRT and for what indications. The process of deciding when to initiate RRT in critically ill patients is complex and is influenced by numerous factors, including patient-specific and clinician-specific factors and those related to local organizational/logistical issues. Studies have shown marked variation between clinicians, and across institutions and countries. As a consequence, analysis of ideal circumstances under which to initiate RRT is challenging. Recognizing this limitation, we review the available data and propose a clinical algorithm to aid in the decision for RRT initiation in critically ill adult patients. The algorithm incorporates several patient-specific factors, based on evidence when available, that may decisively influence when to initiate RRT. The objective of this algorithm is to provide a starting point to guide clinicians on when to initiate RRT in critically ill adult patients. In addition, the proposed algorithm is intended to provide a foundation for prospective evaluation and the development of a broad consensus on when to initiate RRT in critically ill patients.

### Excess death estimates in patients with end-stage renal disease… [^113h9ATz]. CDC (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary What is already known about this topic. Patients with end-stage renal disease are at increased risk for COVID-19–associated morbidity and mortality. What is added by this report. Based on the national trend in ESRD deaths during the first 7 months of the U. S. COVID-19 pandemic, an estimated 8. 7–12. 9 excess deaths per 1, 000 patients or 6, 953–10, 316 excess deaths in a population of 798, 611 U. S. ESRD patients occurred. Views: Views equals page views plus PDF downloads Figures End-stage renal disease is a condition in which kidney function has permanently declined such that renal replacement therapy is required to sustain life. The mortality rate for patients with ESRD in the United States has been declining since 2001.

However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, ESRD patients are at high risk for COVID-19–associated morbidity and mortality, which is due, in part, to weakened immune systems and presence of multiple comorbidities. The ESRD National Coordinating Center supports the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the ESRD Networks †, § through analysis of data, dissemination of best practices, and creation of educational materials. ESRD NCC analyzed deaths reported to the Consolidated Renal Operations in a Web-Enabled Network, a system that facilitates the collection of data and maintenance of information about ESRD patients on chronic dialysis or receiving a kidney transplant who are treated in Medicare-certified dialysis facilities and kidney transplant centers in the United States.

Excess death estimates were obtained by comparing observed and predicted monthly numbers of deaths during February 1–August 31, 2020; predicted deaths were modeled based on data from January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2019. The analysis estimated
8. 7–12. 9 excess deaths per 1, 000 ESRD patients, or a total of 6, 953–10, 316 excess deaths in a population of 798, 611 ESRD patients during February 1–August 31.
2020. These findings suggest that deaths among ESRD patients during the early phase of the pandemic exceeded those that would have been expected based on previous years' data. Geographic and temporal patterns of excess mortality, including those among persons with ESRD, should be considered during planning and implementation of interventions, such as COVID-19 vaccination, infection control guidance, and patient education. These findings underscore the importance of data-driven technical assistance and further analyses of the causes and patterns of excess deaths in ESRD patients.

The upper limit of excess deaths was defined as the difference between the observed and the predicted number of deaths; the lower limit was defined as the difference between the observed number of deaths and the upper end of a one-sided 95% prediction interval from the model. The predicted number of deaths was calculated using a Poisson model with five variables: year, month, age group, age-group-by-year interaction term, and ESRD Network service area. Excess death estimates during February 1–August 31, 2020, at the ESRD Network service area and national levels were compared with the total ESRD patient population size from February 2020 to allow comparisons between populations. Excess mortality for all ESRD patients was compared using analyses that included dialysis or kidney transplant patients, defined by the last treatment type for each patient before death.

Initiation framework and conservative care: The initiation of dialysis therapy remains a decision informed by clinical art, as well as by science and the constraints of regulation and reimbursement, and for some patients, conservative therapy, without dialysis or transplantation, is the appropriate option; nephrologists also should be familiar with the principles of palliative care and should not neglect hospice referral for patients with advanced kidney failure.

### Kidney transplantation as primary therapy for end-stage renal disease: a National Kidney Foundation / kidney disease outcomes quality initiative (NKF / KDOQITM) conference [^113oFuyx]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Kidney transplantation is the most desired and cost-effective modality of renal replacement therapy for patients with irreversible chronic kidney failure (end-stage renal disease, stage 5 chronic kidney disease). Despite emerging evidence that the best outcomes accrue to patients who receive a transplant early in the course of renal replacement therapy, only 2.5% of incident patients with end-stage renal disease undergo transplantation as their initial modality of treatment, a figure largely unchanged for at least a decade.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

The National Kidney Foundation convened a Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) conference in Washington, DC, March 19 through 20, 2007, to examine the issue. Fifty-two participants representing transplant centers, dialysis providers, and payers were divided into three work groups to address the impact of early transplantation on the chronic kidney disease paradigm, educational needs of patients and professionals, and finances of renal replacement therapy.

Results

Participants explored the benefits of early transplantation on costs and outcomes, identified current barriers (at multiple levels) that impede access to early transplantation, and recommended specific interventions to overcome those barriers.

Conclusions

With implementation of early education, referral to a transplant center coincident with creation of vascular access, timely transplant evaluation, and identification of potential living donors, early transplantation can be an option for substantially more patients with chronic kidney disease.

### An integrated review of "unplanned" dialysis initiation: reframing the terminology to "suboptimal" initiation [^111gn7ZG]. BMC Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing public health concern. At the end of 2005, an estimated 1 in 1,000 Canadians had been diagnosed with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with almost 61% (19,721 of 32,375) receiving dialysis. Between 1996 and 2005 the incident rate of renal replacement therapy (RRT) rose 36% in Canada from 119 to 162 per million.

Despite advances in nephrological care prior to and after dialysis is initiated, ESRD patients continue to have a high morbidity and mortality, and a significant decline in quality of life. In Canada, the five-year survival of ESRD patients on dialysis ranges from 20% for diabetics over age 65 years to 59% for non-diabetics aged 18–65 years. The mean number of co-morbid conditions in dialysis patients is approximately four per patient, the mean hospital days/patient/year is approximately 15, and self-reported quality of life is far lower than the general population.

The cost of treating ESRD in Canada is significant. In 2000, the direct health-care expenditures for ESRD were estimated at $1.3 billion. Patients on dialysis were responsible for approximately two-thirds (69%) of all ESRD expenditures. Although only 0.1% of Canadians had ESRD, these costs represented 1.3% of Canada's total health-care spending.

Canadian guidelines recommend referral to a nephrologist for patients with: acute kidney failure; eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²; progressive decline of eGFR; persistent proteinuria; or, inability to achieve treatment targets or other difficulties in the management of CKD. Similarly, the National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative (NKF/KDOQI) guidelines recommend co-management with a nephrologist at stage 3 CKD (eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2), and referral at stage 4 (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2).

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for hemodialysis adequacy: 2015 update [^114UeM3b]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Rationale for Guideline 1.2 — starting kidney replacement therapy should not rely on an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) number alone but on symptoms and preferences: Symptoms of uremia are nonspecific, and attempts should be made to evaluate for other, sometimes reversible, causes of symptoms, and uremic symptoms can be subtle, with patients adapting to lower levels of functioning without clearly expressing symptoms. The decision to initiate KRT should not be based on estimated GFR (eGFR) level alone, and the balance among the benefits, risks, and disadvantages of initiating or not initiating dialysis should be evaluated, taking into account education received and preferences expressed by the patients and/or their caregivers. While no specific numeric threshold is endorsed, the Work Group noted there likely is a floor GFR below which KRT is required, and that there is a level at which delaying for KRT initiation versus electing for conservative care becomes imperative.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for hemodialysis adequacy: 2015 update [^114SZcaH]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Guideline 1.1 — kidney replacement therapy (KRT) initiation and modality choice emphasizes shared decision-making and preservation of options: Guideline 1.1 specifically includes those who have initiated KRT for kidney failure, and whenever possible, the timing of presentation should not limit the treatment options for kidney failure. Although logistically, hemodialysis (HD) is easiest to implement, peritoneal dialysis (PD) and conservative care are important options, and dialysis should not be initiated without ensuring that a shared decision-making process among patients, their families and care-givers, and their physicians. The Work Group noted that the purpose of dialysis is not solely prolongation of life but rather promotion of living, and it is essential that dialysis initiation or the decision to forgo KRT be an individualized process that incorporates eliciting patient goals and life preferences, prognosis, and expected benefits and burdens associated with kidney failure and its treatment, followed by guidance and decision support regarding the therapies that can offer the patient the greatest likelihood of achieving their goals within their preference structure.

### When to start renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury: comment on AKIKI and ELAIN [^1156mbHj]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

The dilemma of when to start renal replacement therapy (RRT) among critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) when "conventional" indications are absent has long been a vexing challenge for clinicians. The lack of high-quality evidence has undoubtedly contributed decisional uncertainty and unnecessary practice variation. Two new randomized trials focused on the timing of RRT initiation in critically ill patients with AKI have been reported recently (Table 1).

The Early Versus Late Initiation of Renal Replacement Therapy In Critically Ill Patients With Acute Kidney Injury (ELAIN) trial was a single-center trial comparing early RRT (starting within < 8 hours of fulfilling Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) stage 2 AKI) with delayed RRT (starting within < 12 hours of developing KDIGO stage 3 AKI or upon an absolute indication). Eligible patients were required to have blood neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) > 150 ng/ml and at least one of sepsis, fluid overload, worsening Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, or receiving vasoactive support. The trial ELAIN randomized 231 predominantly postsurgical patients. The median difference among those receiving RRT was 21 hours. Early RRT resulted in a 15.4% reduction in 90-day mortality compared with delayed RRT (39.3% vs 53.6%; p = 0.03). Early RRT also translated into greater kidney recovery (53.6% vs 38.7%, p = 0.02; not significant after excluding deaths through 90 days), decreased RRT duration (9 vs 25 days, p = 0.04), shorter hospital stay (51 vs 82 days, p < 0.001), and reduction in selected plasma proinflammatory mediators. There were no differences in organ dysfunction scores, ICU stay, or dialysis dependence beyond 90 days.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for hemodialysis adequacy: 2015 update [^113ydHR6]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Dialysis initiation decision-making — assessment of uremic signs and symptoms guides decision-making, but the Work Group highlights uncertainty and favors individualized timing. The page states that basing initiation on signs and/or symptoms associated with uremia is inherently challenging because uremia is a nonspecific constellation of symptoms and signs that can have other causes, and it encourages providers to be diligent in their search for reversible causes of symptoms prior to dialysis initiation. It notes that at least one cross-sectional comparison suggests the range as well as the prevalence of symptoms in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease and those undergoing hemodialysis are similar, questions which symptoms would be expected to improve with kidney replacement therapy, and observes that decline in well-being may be slow without a discrete appearance of uremic symptoms, with many patients adapting to lower function or intake. Overall, the Work Group favored an individualized approach to timing dialysis initiation and states that the current body of data does not allow a prescriptive approach for timing dialysis initiation.

### Update of dialysis initiation timing in end stage kidney disease patients: is it a resolved question? A systematic literature review [^114TjdSP]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The exact optimal timing of dialysis for ESKD patients remains unknown. This study systematically reviewed the available evidence with regard to the optimal initiation of maintenance dialysis in ESKD patients.

Methods

An electronic search was performed in Embase, PubMed and the Cochrane Library in order to find studies investigating associations between variables reference to "start of dialysis" and outcomes. Quality assessment and bias assessment were performed by the Newcastle-Ottawa scale and the ROBINSI tool. Due to the heterogeneity of studies, a meta-analysis could not be performed.

Results

Thirteen studies were included; four studies included only haemodialysis patients, three peritoneal dialysis, six both; study outcomes included mortality, cardiovascular events, technique failure, quality of life and others. Nine studies mainly focused on the optimal GFR of maintenance dialysis initiation; five studies showed none association between GFR and mortality or other adverse outcomes, two studies showed dialysis initiation at higher GFR levels were with poor prognosis, and 2 studies showed higher GFR levels with better prognosis. Three studies paid attention to comprehensive assessment of uremic signs and/or symptoms for optimal dialysis initiation; uremic burden based on 7 uremic indicators (hemoglobin, serum albumin, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, potassium, phosphorus, and bicarbonate) were not associated with mortality; another equation (combination of sex, age, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, serum albumin, haemoglobin, serum phosphorus, diabetes mellitus, and heart failure) based on fuzzy mathematics to assess the timing of haemodialysis initiation was accuracy to prognose 3-year survival; the third study found that volume overload or hypertension was associated with the highest risk for subsequent mortality. Two studies compared urgent or optimal start in dialysis, a study reported increased survival in optimal start patients, another reported no differences between Urgent-Start-PD and Early-Start-PD regarding 6-month outcomes.

Limitations

Heterogeneity among the studies was quite high, with differences in sample size, variable and group characteristics; no RCT studies were included, which weakened the strength of evidences.

Conclusions

The criteria for dialysis initiation were varied. Most studies proved that GFR at dialysis initiation was not associated with mortality, timing of dialysis initiation should not be based on GFR, assessments of volume load and patient's tolerance to volume overload are prospective approaches.

### Important differences in management policies for children with end-stage renal disease in the Netherlands and Belgium – report from the RICH-Q study [^1175uidL]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The low prevalence of childhood end-stage renal disease and the small centre sizes have been a barrier for clinical studies and the development of evidence-based guidelines for chronic renal replacement therapy (cRRT) in children. Few data exist on the quality of care for these patients and the applicability of existing guidelines. The aim of this study is to quantify variation in treatment policies and actually delivered care in nine centres that deliver cRRT for children.

Methods

We surveyed treatment policies in all nine centres in the Netherlands and Belgium and compared them with the actually provided therapies and with recommendations from available guidelines. Data on treatment policies were gathered by questionnaires; actually provided care and outcomes were registered prospectively from 2007 to 2010.

Results

Data on policies and actual patient care were obtained from all nine centres. We found relevant differences between centres in treatment policies on various topics, e.g. estimated glomerular filtration rate threshold as an indication for initiation of cRRT, preferred initial mode of cRRT, peritoneal dialysis catheter care, haemodialysis frequency and vascular access. Discrepancies were seen between stated treatment policies and actual performed therapies. For the majority of policies, no evidence-based guidelines are available.

Conclusions

Health care disparities exist due to large and unwanted variation in treatment policies between hospitals providing cRRT for children. Delivered care does not live up to stated policies, for which clear and internationally accepted guidelines are lacking.

This paper provides an endorsement of the KDIGO guideline on acute kidney injury; more specifically, on the part that concerns renal replacement therapy. New evidence that has emerged since the publication of the KDIGO guideline was taken into account, and the guideline is commented on from a European perspective. Advice is given on when to start and stop renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury; which modalities should be preferentially be applied, and in which conditions; how to gain access to circulation; how to measure adequacy; and which dose can be recommended.

### Optimising the timing of renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury [^115iSeg4]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Initiation of organ support therapy is a complex decision integral to practice in the intensive care unit (ICU). Such decisions extend beyond whether these therapies simply normalise relevant physiological parameters and include triage, prognostication and resource allocation, as well as an assessment of the potential for the intervention to cause more harm than benefit in individual patients. When considering renal replacement therapy (RRT) for acute kidney injury (AKI), critical care physicians are required to balance the hazards of starting too early, risking patient exposure to an unnecessary therapy with its attendant complications and costs, against the potential life-threatening harm of initiating too late.

In certain circumstances, decision making is relatively clear. There is little doubt RRT should be started promptly in the presence of life-threatening indications (hyperkalaemia, severe metabolic acidosis, pulmonary oedema, certain drug toxicities), and it is equally clear that RRT is not necessary when these indications are absent and there is evidence of recovery from AKI. RRT is also inappropriate when it is incompatible with patient preferences and treatment goals. However, many critically ill patients continue to meet AKI criteria without developing either an indication for urgent dialysis or evidence of imminent recovery. For these patients, clinicians face a difficult question. Should RRT be initiated early, risking over-treatment, or should it be delayed as long as possible, potentially prolonging exposure to fluid overload and solute imbalance? Five important studies over the past 5 years have attempted to address this question.

### Characteristics of elderly patients with diabetes and end-stage renal disease [^114G7HAA]. Seminars in Dialysis (2010). Low credibility.

Because of a combination of demographic and social factors, such as the aging of the population in general, increased incidence of diabetes, and more liberal criteria for renal replacement therapy initiation, the proportion of the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients with diabetes who are considered elderly is currently the fastest growing segment of incident ESRD population. Despite the fast growth of this group, it is poorly characterized in current literature. In this review, we attempt to summarize the data available to date regarding demographic composition, outcomes, choice of renal replacement therapy, and other management issues including renal transplantation. There is significant evidence that the elderly diabetic patients might differ from the general dialysis population regarding renal replacement modality, vascular access for dialysis, and that guidelines addressing chronic kidney disease (CKD) issues such as nutrition and blood pressure may need modification in this ESRD subgroup. At the same time, other areas such as anemia and bone mineral metabolism have not been adequately studied. Lastly, despite lower rates of kidney transplantation in this population, it confers significant survival advantages, similar to that seen in younger populations. As the fastest growing group in the incident ESRD population, these patients have issues related to clinical management, which represent very important areas for future research.

### Elderly patients with CKD – dilemmas in dialysis therapy and vascular access [^111rZYAm]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2014). Medium credibility.

The population of elderly patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is growing rapidly worldwide. The high prevalence of comorbidities, limited life expectancy and complex quality of life issues associated with this population pose substantial challenges for clinicians in terms of clinical decision-making and providing optimal care. The first dilemma encountered in the management of an elderly patient with ESRD is deciding whether to initiate renal replacement therapy and, if so, selecting the most-suitable dialysis modality. Planning vascular access for haemodialysis is associated with additional challenges. Several clinical practice guidelines recommend an arteriovenous fistula, rather than a central venous catheter or arteriovenous graft, as the preferred access for maintenance haemodialysis therapy. However, whether this recommendation is applicable to elderly patients with ESRD and a limited life expectancy is unclear. Selection and planning of the most appropriate vascular access for an elderly patient with ESRD requires careful consideration of several factors and ultimately should lead to an improvement in the patient's quality of life.

### Starting dialysis is dangerous: how do we balance the risk? [^116VgPHY]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

Recent studies of timing of dialysis initiation have challenged the recent trend to earlier initiation of therapy. The observed outcomes though are a consequence of the balance between the risks of advanced uremia versus the inherent dangers relating to dialysis therapy itself. Many of these risks are inherent in how dialysis treatment is currently carried out, and may indeed be amenable to mitigation, through refinement of clinical practice (and potentially modality choice). This article aims to lay out a discussion relating to patient outcomes being the composite result of this balance, pivoting on the vulnerability of a particular patient to these attendant risks.

### Meeting the challenges of the new K / DOQI guidelines [^114Y6ggm]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Substantial gains in the dialytic treatment of patients with end-stage renal disease have been made during the past several decades. However, inadequate attention has been given to the problem of chronic kidney disease (CKD) as a whole. CKD and its associated complications emerge years before patients develop kidney failure and become dialysis dependent. It now is evident that to improve dialysis outcomes, it is essential for practitioners to recognize the earlier stages of CKD, not only to retard disease progression, but also to prevent and treat its complications and comorbidities long before the need for dialysis arises. The recently published National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines identify the broad-based problem of CKD in the general population and introduce action plans that can be used at the different stages of CKD. This article discusses the process behind the development of the CKD guidelines and highlights the disease evaluation, classification, and stratification system provided by the guidelines. It is hoped that widespread implementation of these recommendations will increase the understanding of CKD among both providers and patients and eliminate many of the obstacles that nephrologists have faced in providing optimal care to dialysis patients in particular and to patients with CKD in general.

KDOQI hemodialysis adequacy — timing of hemodialysis initiation. Patients who reach chronic kidney disease stage 4 (GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) should receive education about kidney failure and treatment options including kidney transplantation, peritoneal dialysis (PD), hemodialysis (HD) in the home or in-center, and conservative treatment, and family members/caregivers should also be educated (Not Graded). The decision to initiate maintenance dialysis should be based primarily on assessment of signs and/or symptoms associated with uremia, evidence of protein-energy wasting, and the ability to safely manage metabolic abnormalities and/or volume overload with medical therapy rather than on a specific level of kidney function in the absence of such signs and symptoms (Not Graded).

### Treatment decisions for older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease [^115NqB8h]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Dialysis initiation rates among older adults, aged 75 years or greater, are increasing at a faster rate than for younger age groups. Older adults with advanced CKD (eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2) typically lose renal function slowly, often suffer from significant comorbidity and thus may die from associated comorbidities before they require dialysis. A patient's pattern of renal function loss over time in relation to their underlying comorbidities can serve as a guide to the probability of a future dialysis requirement. Most who start dialysis, initiate treatment "early", at an estimated glomerulofiltration rate (eGFR) > 10 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and many initiate dialysis in hospital, often in association with an episode of acute renal failure. In the US older adults start dialysis at a mean e GFR of 12.6 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and 20.6% die within six months of dialysis initiation. In both the acute in hospital and outpatient settings, many older adults appear to be initiating dialysis for non-specific, non-life threatening symptoms and clinical contexts. Observational data suggests that dialysis does not provide a survival benefit for older adults with poor mobility and high levels of comorbidity. To optimize the care of this population, early and repeat shared decision making conversations by health care providers, patients, and their families should consider the risks, burdens, and benefits of dialysis versus conservative management, as well as the patient specific symptoms and clinical situations that could justify dialysis initiation. The potential advantages and disadvantages of dialysis therapy should be considered in conjunction with each patient's unique goals and priorities. In conclusion, when considering the morbidity and quality of life impact associated with dialysis, many older adults may prefer to delay dialysis until there is a definitive indication or may opt for conservative management without dialysis. This approach can incorporate all CKD treatments other than dialysis, provide psychosocial and spiritual support and active symptom management and may also incorporate a palliative care approach with less medical monitoring of lab parameters and more focus on the use of drug therapies directed to relief of a patient's symptoms.

### Safety and efficacy of statins in patients with end-stage renal disease [^111UPhYs]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To review statins in the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and their associated safety in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

Data Sources

Peer-reviewed clinical trials, review articles, and treatment guidelines were identified from MEDLINE (1966-July 2013) using the following search terms: end stage renal disease, statin, HMG-CoA (hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A) reductase inhibitor, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular outcomes, and cardiovascular disease. Results were limited to human trials published in English. Citations from articles were reviewed for additional references.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Only clinical trials evaluating cardiovascular end points of statins used in patients with ESRD were included.

Data Synthesis

In patients with ESRD, CVD is the leading cause of death. Statin therapy has been evaluated in 3 clinical trials in patients with ESRD. The 4D and AURORA trials failed to show a benefit with statin therapy, and the SHARP trial, although positive, also included patients with earlier stages of chronic kidney disease. Despite the lack of efficacy, statin therapy was well tolerated. The cause of cardiovascular death in this patient population may not be a result of atherosclerotic events and possibly dependent on the type of renal replacement therapy. For patients on hemodialysis, lipid profiles may not be amenable to statin therapy.

Conclusions

Statin therapy has failed to significantly alter the course of CVD events in patients with ESRD. Evidence supports avoiding the routine use of statins in this patient population and instead reserving them for patients with elevated cholesterol levels or those with recent CVD events.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^116U4h93]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy — initiation timing and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) note that it is difficult to make a recommendation for initiating kidney replacement therapy (KRT) based solely on a specific level of GFR; several studies concluded there is no statistically significant association between renal function at the time of initiation of KRT and subsequent mortality, others suggested that worse kidney function at initiation of KRT is associated with increased mortality or morbidity, and when corrections are made for lead-time bias, there is no clear survival advantage to starting dialysis therapy earlier. The Initiating Dialysis Early and Late (IDEAL) Study is described as a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial comparing outcomes in patients starting dialysis with a Cockcroft-Gault GFR of 10 to 14 versus 5 to 7 mL/min/1.73 m 2. In 2000, the NKF KDOQI CPG on Nutrition in CKD advocated that — in patients with CKD and estimated GFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 who are not undergoing maintenance dialysis — if protein-energy malnutrition develops or persists despite vigorous attempts to optimize protein-energy intake and there is no apparent cause for it other than low nutrient intake, initiation of KRT should be recommended. The page also states that average GFR at initiation has increased in all age groups since 1995, increasing most in the oldest patients.

### Update of dialysis initiation timing in end stage kidney disease patients: is it a resolved question? A systematic literature review [^116c6UZw]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

The remaining six studies all showed that the early start of dialysis had no association with the prognosis of survival, of which three from Chinese HD patients. Liu et al. demonstrated that after adjusting for effectors of age, gender, diabetes, type of vascular access at initiation, clinical signs, and/or symptoms at the initiation of dialysis, and serum albumin, there was no significant difference in survival rate between the 3 groups (< 4 mL/min/1.73 m 2 was used as the reference, in comparison with 4–8 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [p = 0.681] and > 8 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [p = 0.403]). Chang et al. also found the fully adjusted hazards ratios of mortality for the late (3–5indicators) and very late (6–7 indicators) groups were 0.97 (95% confidence interval 0.76–1.24) and 0.83 (0.61–1.15) compared with the standard (met 0–2 uremic indicators) group. The 7 uremic indicators that reached the predefined threshold in case period, namely hemoglobin, serum albumin, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, potassium, phosphorus, and bicarbonate. So the study concluded that it is safe to defer dialysis initiation among patients with CKD having an eGFR of < 5 mL/min/1.73 m 2 even when patients having multiple biochemical uremic burdens. Zhang et al. in a prospective observational cohort study indicated that Charlson comorbidity index, cerebrovascular diseases and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were significantly associated with mortality, but not eGFR at the dialysis initiation by multivariate Cox regression analysis. Furthermore, stratified analyses confirmed elevated eGFR that had no advantage on long‑term prognosis. Therefore, the long‑term prognosis of patients with high eGFRs prior to hemodialysis was not improved.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and management of candidates for kidney transplantation [^115vSYPM]. Transplantation (2020). High credibility.

Rationale — kidney transplantation candidacy in chronic kidney disease (CKD) emphasizes that kidney transplantation improves survival and quality of life and is less costly compared to dialysis. Patients with advanced CKD who are expected to reach end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) have the right to be informed of all available treatment options, including transplantation, and demand for transplantable kidneys exceeds supply such that candidacy for deceased donor transplantation needs careful evaluation. Initiation of the transplant evaluation process depends on the patient's subjective well-being, underlying kidney disease and rate of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) loss; number and severity of comorbid conditions; and the anticipated need for specialized testing, and depending on the patient and region, evaluation may take weeks to several months to complete. Pre-emptive transplantation is the preferred treatment option but requires sufficient time to ensure a complete evaluation and in many regions is restricted to those with a suitable living donor; the timing of pre-emptive living donor transplantation needs individual decision making depending on patient's symptoms and estimated GFR (eGFR). Candidacy assessment is to some extent subjective and those declined should have the right to seek a second opinion.

### Timing of dialysis initiation to reduce mortality and cardiovascular events in advanced chronic kidney disease: nationwide cohort study [^116uGhUp]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Policy implications

Our findings provide novel evidence on the optimal timing of dialysis initiation and show that even with maximum eGFR separations, the range of plausible effects is likely to be small. The modest increase in observed survival for initiation at higher eGFR comes at the expense of earlier dialysis initiation. Our results provide an insight into this trade-off: the maximum 5.1% absolute mortality reduction translated into a postponement of death of only 1.6 months over a five year follow-up period, whereas dialysis would need to be started on average four years earlier. For many patients, the modest survival benefit may not outweigh this increased time on dialysis. Our results further suggest that in the absence of symptoms or strong indications, initiation of dialysis may be postponed until lower eGFR values are reached (intent to defer), without a large increase in mortality or cardiovascular events. From a societal perspective, the higher costs associated with earlier dialysis initiation make these strategies even less desirable. Current position papers highlight the importance of individualised decision making in deciding whether and when to start dialysis, taking into account outcomes, quality of life, and patients' preferences. Our findings should not be used to suggest a single eGFR cut-off to start dialysis in all patients. Rather, our finding of similar survival across the range of eGFR at which dialysis is usually considered (eGFR 5–14 mL/min/1.73 m 2) should be a reassuring addition to the evidence base for clinicians: these data provide no support for any strategy other than starting dialysis on the basis of symptoms and patients' preferences, which is widespread clinical practice, recommended by guidelines, and a patient centred approach. Our study compared different dialysis initiation strategies based on eGFR only: patients who did not adhere to their assigned strategy (that is, started too early or too late on the basis of their eGFR value) were censored in our analyses at the moment of nonadherence. Hence, our study did not investigate whether other parameters, such as volume overload or symptoms, should be taken into consideration when starting dialysis. This requires further study. Neither did our study investigate the effects of dialysis initiation versus comprehensive conservative management in patients with kidney failure. Conservative care has been proposed as a reasonable alternative to maintenance dialysis for selected older patients with comorbidities or poor functional status. Whether differences exist in survival and quality of life between dialysis and conservative management is unknown and is being investigated in the ongoing randomised PREPARE for Kidney Care Study.

### The impact of "early" versus "late" initiation of renal replacement therapy in critical care patients with acute kidney injury: a systematic review and evidence synthesis [^114PY9Yd]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a medical complication associated with significant morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. AKI is common in critical illness, and severe AKI is associated with up to 60% hospital mortality. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) within the intensive care unit (ICU) is conducted as either intermittent hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Traditional indications for RRT require the development of overt clinical manifestations of renal insufficiency, such as acidosis, electrolyte disturbances (most notably hyperkalemia), uremic complications (encephalopathy or pericarditis), and volume overload unresponsive to aggressive medical management. In spite of research and increasing clinical experience with dialysis, the optimal time to initiate RRT in the course of critical illness complicated by AKI is unclear.

The notion of "early" RRT is to initiate dialysis therapy before nitrogenous and other metabolic products accumulate to the degree where they become relatively resistant to therapy. Despite the intuitive rationale for "early" RRT, there is limited evidence to guide clinicians on the optimal time to initiate RRT in critical illness. Neither standard clinical parameters nor research into novel clinical biomarkers has emerged to clearly define an ideal time or clinical picture where the initiation of RRT optimizes patient outcomes. Earlier initiation of RRT must be balanced with potential patient harm associated with RRTs. Protocolled use of hemofiltration for 96 h in patients with septic shock admitted to an ICU regardless of their renal function suggests that "early" RRT can be associated with negative patient outcomes. As a result, research into "early" RRT includes multiple definitions of early that reflect a potpourri of time factors, biochemical markers, and clinical parameters in an attempt to balance the risks of initiating RRT with the benefits expected from supporting renal function during critical illness.

### Continuous renal replacement therapy: who, when, why, and how [^112yDbnZ]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is commonly used to provide renal support for critically ill patients with acute kidney injury, particularly patients who are hemodynamically unstable. A variety of techniques that differ in their mode of solute clearance may be used, including continuous venovenous hemofiltration with predominantly convective solute clearance, continuous venovenous hemodialysis with predominantly diffusive solute clearance, and continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration, which combines both dialysis and hemofiltration. The present article compares CRRT with other modalities of renal support and reviews indications for initiation of renal replacement therapy, as well as dosing and technical aspects in the management of CRRT.

### Choice of dialysis modality [^117Nbh8u]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Few medical decisions have as profound an impact on every aspect of a patient's life as the selection of dialysis modality by a patient with end-stage renal disease. It remains uncertain whether the outcome differences seen between hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients, if any, in observational studies are attributable to the dialysis modality. Such studies, thus, are insufficient to deny patients a choice in selecting their dialysis modality.

### Revised dialysis clinical practice guideline promotes more informed decision-making [^113xPdp6]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Over a decade ago, the Renal Physicians Association and the American Society of Nephrology published the clinical practice guideline, Shared Decision-Making in the Appropriate Initiation of and Withdrawal from Dialysis, to assist nephrologists, patients, and families in making decisions to initiate and withdraw dialysis. Since then, researchers have extensively studied dialysis decision-making, and there is a substantial body of new evidence with regard to 1) the poor prognosis of some elderly stage 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease patients, many of whom are likely to die before initiation of dialysis or for whom dialysis may not provide a survival advantage over medical management without dialysis; 2) the prevalence of cognitive impairment in dialysis patients and the need to periodically assess them for decision-making capacity; 3) the under-recognition and undertreatment of pain and other symptoms in dialysis patients; 4) the underutilization of hospice in dialysis patients; and 5) the distinctly different treatment goals of ESRD patients based on their overall condition and personal preferences. The Renal Physicians Association developed this second edition of the guideline to provide clinicians, patients, and families with 1) the most current evidence about the benefits and burdens of dialysis for patients with diverse conditions; 2) recommendations for quality in decision-making about treatment of patients with acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and ESRD; and 3) practical strategies to help clinicians implement the guideline recommendations.

### Renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury: controversy and consensus [^113Hx5eg]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Renal replacement therapies (RRTs) represent a cornerstone in the management of severe acute kidney injury. This area of intensive care and nephrology has undergone significant improvement and evolution in recent years. Continuous RRTs have been a major focus of new technological and treatment strategies. RRT is being used increasingly in the intensive care unit, not only for renal indications but also for other organ-supportive strategies. Several aspects related to RRT are now well established, but others remain controversial. In this review, we review the available RRT modalities, covering technical and clinical aspects. We discuss several controversial issues, provide some practical recommendations, and where possible suggest a research agenda for the future.

Recommendations for Management of CHF

All patients under evaluation should have baseline echocardiography at dry weight. For patients with an LVEF < 35% not yet on RRT, right and left heart catheterization should be performed to assess for ischemic heart disease and targets for revascularization, with PCI or CABG performed if indicated. In patients with CKD who are not yet on RRT, ultra–low‐contrast angiography followed by staged low‐ or no‐contrast PCI 97 should be considered if feasible. Treatments such as beta blockers and ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers should be initiated to prevent cardiac remodeling and to improve LVEF (Figure 2). Side effects such as hypotension, electrolyte abnormalities, and bradycardia should be monitored closely once therapy has begun. Importantly, many angiotensin receptor blockers are not dialyzed and are preferred over ACE inhibitors, which are dialyzable. If no improvement in cardiac contractility is achieved and LVEF remains < 35% despite optimal medical therapy, the benefits and risks of ICD and S‐ICD for primary prevention should be discussed with the patient. Patients with normal LVEF should be reevaluated by echocardiography within 3 years. Cardiac evaluation should be performed annually for patients with LV systolic dysfunction and more frequently for patients with LVEF < 35% for titration of medical therapy based on guidelines for management of patients with severe LV dysfunction. 98

### Prolonged conservative treatment for frail elderly patients with end-stage renal disease: the verona experience [^116LKeqa]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

Background

In frail elderly patients, the chronic use of renal replacement therapy sometimes affords no tangible benefits and may even negatively affect their quality of life (Qol), making prolonged conservative management a reasonable option.

Methods

This observational, uncontrolled study was conducted on 11 end-stage renal disease patients over 75 years of age, on prolonged conservative treatment with a follow-up of at least 6 months, to assess compliance with the Italian clinical guidelines concerning the treatment of renal failure, comorbidities, hospital stays, and several psychometric and Qol indicators in the patients and their caregivers.

Results

We found a substantial compliance with the targets recommended in the guidelines, a moderate tendency for disease progression and satisfactory psychometric and Qol parameters, which proved much the same as those observed in a parallel (uncontrolled) group of patients on haemodialysis.

Conclusions

Our study shows that a conservative strategy is feasible for frail uraemic patients, achieving acceptable clinical results and a Qol comparable with patients on haemodialysis. The study also provides indications on how to plan trials on this topic, to obtain the evidence needed to guide the difficult choice of whether to recommend dialysis or conservative treatment for such frail patients.

Oligo-anuric patients with end-stage kidney disease are dependent on hemodialysis to achieve and maintain the desired goal of euvolemia. The dialysis prescription, in addition to sodium and fluid restriction, is therefore a critically important factor in the care of hemodialysis patients. Various dialysate sodium concentrations have been favored throughout the history of dialysis, but the "optimal" concentration remains unclear. In this manuscript, we examine the historical context of changes to the dialysate sodium prescription, review the evidence of its associated effects, discuss 'individualization' of dialysate sodium, and highlight the need for definitive trials that are powered for important clinical outcomes.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^1169WSrk]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) — potential applications for renal replacement therapy (RRT) span renal replacement, life‑threatening indications, nonemergent indications, and renal support. Renal replacement is described as "the traditional, prevailing approach based on utilization of RRT when there is little or no residual kidney function". For life‑threatening indications, hyperkalemia has "No trials to validate these criteria" and "requires frequent monitoring of potassium levels and adjustment of concurrent medical management to prevent relapses", pulmonary edema may be managed because "RRT is often utilized to prevent the need for ventilatory support", and "it is rare to wait to initiate RRT in AKI patients until there are uremic complications". For nonemergent indications, solute control notes that "BUN reflects factors not directly associated with kidney function" and that "SCr is influenced by age, race, muscle mass, and catabolic rate, and by changes in its volume of distribution due to fluid administration or withdrawal", with "Fluid overload is an important determinant of the timing of RRT initiation" and "No standard criteria for initiating dialysis exist". For renal support, the approach "is based on the utilization of RRT techniques as an adjunct to enhance kidney function, modify fluid balance, and control solute levels", highlighting that "Fluid overload is emerging as an important factor associated with, and possibly contributing to, adverse outcomes in AKI", with reports that "Recent studies have shown potential benefits from extracorporeal fluid removal in CHF. Intraoperative fluid removal using modified ultrafiltration has been shown to improve outcomes in pediatric cardiac surgery patients". Additional supportive uses include that "Permissive hypercapnic acidosis in patients with lung injury can be corrected with RRT, without inducing fluid overload and hypernatremia", and that "studies are ongoing to assess the efficacy of RRT for cytokine manipulation in sepsis".

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^111N2QnR]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Practice Point 2.2.3 — A 2-year kidney failure risk threshold of > 40% can be used to determine the modality education, timing of preparation for kidney replacement therapy (KRT) including vascular access planning or referral for transplantation, in addition to eGFR-based criteria and other clinical considerations. Based on current evidence, a threshold of > 40% risk or an eGFR of 15 ml/min per 1.73 m2 is acceptable to use for initiating vascular access referral, while lower risk thresholds, such as > 20%, can optimize sensitivity, can be used to initiate modality education, and may be appropriate for prereferral vascular access planning or referral for transplantation in centers with longer wait times. The Work Group noted that the KDOQI vascular access guideline (2019) currently recommend a risk-based threshold > 50% or eGFR < 15 ml/min per 1.73 m2 for initiation of vascular access planning, and waiting until eGFR falls below 15 ml/min per 1.73 m2 may lead to inappropriate overuse of central venous catheters at dialysis initiation.

### Hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women with end-stage renal disease: a review of the issues [^115ShF1C]. Seminars in Dialysis (2001). Low credibility.

Hormone replacement is an integral part of therapies to prevent osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and may be considered a component in the treatment of dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, and possibly cognitive function. The indications for, and efficacy and prescription of, hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women with ESRD have been infrequently studied and less than 10% of postmenopausal women on dialysis are receiving hormone replacement. Small studies suggest that hormone replacement therapy is valuable in treating the dyslipidemia of women on dialysis, but indicate that a reduction in the dosage of hormone replacement may be needed. A potential role for hormone replacement therapy in the treatment and/or prevention of osteoporosis and sexual dysfunction in postmenopausal women on dialysis exists as well.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for hemodialysis adequacy: 2015 update [^114mRLP2]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

KDOQI Guideline 1 rationale — Referral, modality options, and patient choice: Recent KDIGO and prior KDOQI guidelines recommend referral of all individuals with GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 to a nephrologist. Multiple dialysis modalities are available for kidney replacement therapy (KRT), none of which is conclusively demonstrated to be superior, and conservative nondialysis care may be appropriate for many older or more infirm individuals. A thematic synthesis reported the experience of 375 patients and 87 caregivers and identified 4 major themes central to treatment choices; in one study of 584 patients with CKD stages 4 and 5, 61% of those who had started HD regretted the decision and 52% said it was their clinician's choice.

### An isolated elevation in blood urea level is not' uraemia' and not an indication for renal replacement therapy in the ICU [^1167SQgG]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The decision to initiate renal replacement therapy (RRT) and the optimal timing for commencement is a difficult decision clinicians face when treating acute kidney injury (AKI) in the intensive care setting. Without clinically significant ureamic symptoms or emergent indications (electrolyte abnormalities, volume overload) the timing of RRT initiation remains contentious and inconsistent across health providers. The issue is further complicated by several randomised control trials (RCTs) that investigated early versus delayed prescription of RRT producing conflicting results.

Despite the common assumption that elevated urea requires urgent dialysis, treating AKI on serum urea alone is difficult due to variations in the base urea level in the presence of metabolic instability and variations in urea generation. The clinical signs of pathological uraemia (pericarditis, pleuritis, encephalopathy and bleeding) are well established as indications to start haemodialysis, but therapy often commences prior to their development.

It is also common practice to delay haemodialysis for an indefinite period in the absence of these specific uraemic complications due to the risks associated with RRT. However, the question remains, when is the most appropriate time to initiate therapy based on serum urea levels without other apparent indications?

### Treatment decisions for older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease [^111Z19vM]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Beginning in 1972, government funding for dialysis treatment and renal transplantation became available in the US. Over time the dialysis population shifted from a younger, healthier cohort to an older, more medically complex group of patients. Between 1980 and 2012 patients aged 65–74 initiating dialysis increased by 47% while those aged ≥ 75 (older adults) increased by 300%. Dialysis can be a life-extending treatment for patients of all ages, but one year mortality for older dialysis starts in the US was 41%, as compared to 28% for the those aged 65–74 and 17% for patients aged 45–64. In addition to limited life expectancy, many older adults experience functional decline and increased episodes of hospitalization after starting dialysis.

### Kidney replacement therapy transitions during the year preceding death [^1128Uawx]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Our finding that 22% of patients undergo at least one treatment transition (i.e. initiation or switch) in their final year emphasizes the need for ongoing contemplation by healthcare professionals of whether a patient is approaching the end of life and whether a patient is likely to benefit from such a transition. Conservative care is a viable option worth considering. In particular, the transition from KTx to dialysis may prompt healthcare professionals to carefully consider the possibility of a patient approaching end of life. Advance care planning and discussions about expectations and goals in life are crucial to empower patients to make decisions aligning with their preferences and to optimize end-of-life care.

The absence of clinical context and cause of death limited us to evaluate the clinical appropriateness of individual treatment transitions. Furthermore, the composition of our cohort, comprising exclusively deceased individuals, precluded the calculation of survival rates. Nonetheless, given the limited existing information in this area, our findings offer new insights into end-of-life KRT trajectories among patients with kidney failure, which may serve as a starting point for additional exploration. This research letter is a call to further investigate end-of-life KRT trajectories, incorporating the clinical context and patient-relevant outcomes of transitions, and to enhance our understanding of end-of-life care in patients with kidney failure. Further understanding in the dynamics of KRT transitions in the final year of life could potentially assist in refining clinical practices.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^113BjXZQ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Commentary and clinical utility for timing dialysis — The evidence available to inform recommendations about the timing of initiation of dialysis remains limited, and the KDOQI Work Group agrees that initiation of dialysis should be informed by multiple dimensions of a patient's health and livelihood, with symptoms assessed regularly and considered during the shared decision-making process of determining the time to initiate dialysis; the KDIGO guidelines continue to expound on considering initiation of dialysis as "early" or "late" defined by eGFR, but a consideration may be to abandon the labels of early or late and recognize that 1 factor (eg, eGFR) is insufficient, and if no difference in outcomes based on the timing of initiation has been identified, then the reason for characterizing initiation as early or late comes into question; the final practice point is revised to emphasize the role of vascular access planning and introduces the consideration of kidney failure risk prognosis, with preliminary research aligning with a 2-year risk of > 40% and reporting that the combination of eGFR < 20 mL/min/1.73 m^2 and risk ≥ 20% have a strong association with dialysis initiation and use of a vascular access, and the guidelines suggest that the majority of physicians will be comfortable in calculating the risk of kidney failure although implementation of the KFRE within the EHR remains variable across health systems.

### Diagnosis and treatment of low testosterone among patients with end-stage renal disease [^113r8KrM]. Seminars in Dialysis (2014). Low credibility.

The prevalence of low testosterone level is particularly high among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and has been associated with mortality. In populations without ESRD, low testosterone level has also been associated with a number of morbidities including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, low muscle mass, low bone mass, low physical performance, and frailty. However, there is controversy regarding what constitutes low testosterone level in the aging population and at what level replacement therapy with testosterone is indicated. There are no randomized controlled trials investigating long-term outcomes of testosterone replacement therapy in populations with or without ESRD. Available trial results suggest equivocal improvements in sexual function. Muscle mass and bone mineral density appear to improve, but results in physical function and performance are mixed and there are no data on fracture prevention. Some recent data suggest harm when testosterone was given to men with limited mobility. Finally, there is little evidence that testosterone adds to existing erythropoietin agents in the treatment of anemia in ESRD. Due to lack of evidence supporting long-term use of testosterone, the authors recommend against the routine use of testosterone in ESRD patients with low testosterone levels. Testosterone treatment can be considered in those with low bone mass and total testosterone level < 200 ng/dl, or in younger patients with sexual complaints with total testosterone level lower than the reference range. It is important to engage patients in discussion of risks and benefits before initiating testosterone therapy; testosterone therapy should be discontinued if the intended treatment effect is not observed after short-term use.

### Early initiation of continuous renal replacement therapy improves survival of elderly patients with acute kidney injury: a multicenter prospective cohort study [^111bdfKB]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Elderly people (aged ≥ 65 years) are currently the fastest-growing sector of the general population in developed countries. They are more prone to developing acute kidney injury (AKI) because of structural and functional alterations in the kidney, comorbidities (e.g. arteriosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and heart failure), and polypharmacy for the treatment of comorbidities, which increase in prevalence with age. Accordingly, an increasing number of elderly patients can be expected to develop AKI.

For more than a decade, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) has been essential in the management of critically ill patients with AKI. The generally accepted indications for initiating CRRT in AKI include persistent hyperkalemia, severe acidosis and hypervolemia that are unresponsive to adequate medical management, and overt uremic symptoms or signs (e.g. uremic bleeding, pericarditis, and encephalopathy).

Although the optimal timing of CRRT initiation remains controversial, recent studies comparing early and late initiation have suggested that early initiation may have a beneficial impact on survival. However, elderly patients are more susceptible to hemodynamic complications during dialysis, such as intradialytic hypotension and arrhythmia, because of decreased autonomic function and cardiovascular reserve, bleeding problems, and neurological complications resulting from rapid changes in serum electrolytes and osmolarity. Additionally, because short-term and long-term survival following CRRT are expected to be lower in elderly patients compared with the general population, therapeutic decisions, including use of CRRT, tend to be more conservative for patients in this age group, especially in intensive care. Nevertheless, few studies have specifically examined CRRT in older individuals with AKI. Therefore, although previous studies have demonstrated that early initiation of CRRT could be beneficial in the general population, it is not clear whether it could also benefit elderly patients.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the outcomes of early versus late initiation of CRRT using propensity score matching (PSM) in a multicenter, prospective CRRT cohort of elderly individuals.

Guideline 1: initiation of dialysis — Certain complications of kidney failure justify initiation of dialysis treatment in patients for whom estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) has not yet decreased to 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, and the following complications may prompt initiation of kidney replacement therapy: intractable ECV overload; hyperkalemia; metabolic acidosis; hyperphosphatemia; hypercalcemia or hypocalcemia; anemia; neurological dysfunction (eg, neuropathy, encephalopathy); pleuritis or pericarditis; otherwise unexplained decline in functioning or well-being; gastrointestinal dysfunction (eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, gastroduodenitis); weight loss or other evidence of malnutrition; and hypertension.

### Testosterone metabolism and replacement therapy in patients with end-stage renal disease [^11669iGK]. Seminars in Dialysis (2004). Low credibility.

Hypogonadism is common among men with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), beginning before the need for dialysis and not improved with the initiation of dialysis. Many of the manifestations of hypogonadism, such as bone disease and muscle wasting, are also frequently seen among dialysis patients. There have been few studies of testosterone replacement therapy in this patient population, but available data suggest that testosterone can be administered without adjustment of the doses used in hypogonadal men with normal renal function. Extrapolation from results of treatment of hypogonadal older men with normal renal function suggests that testosterone replacement could improve libido and could have salutary effects on muscle mass and bone mineral density in patients with kidney disease. However, caution is warranted because of the potential side effects of testosterone therapy, and further research is needed to more precisely define the balance of risk and benefit in patients with chronic kidney disease. Specifically it will be important to determine the prevalence and clinical significance of hypogonadism in ESRD patients in the modern era and to measure the effects of replacement therapy on various symptoms of hypogonadism as well as on overall quality of life, physical functioning, and survival.
