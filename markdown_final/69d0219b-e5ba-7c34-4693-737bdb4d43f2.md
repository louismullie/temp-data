## Question

Chlordiaezpoxide for acute alcohol withdrawal

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about using chlordiazepoxide for acute alcohol withdrawal. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical indication and where chlordiazepoxide fits among first-line options. Then, I should verify the pharmacologic rationale for choosing a long-acting benzodiazepine. Next, I will review dosing strategies, including symptom-triggered, fixed-dose taper, and front-loading, and confirm dose ranges and monitoring. After that, I need to check special populations, especially hepatic impairment and the elderly, and consider alternatives. Finally, I will examine safety, dependence, and tapering, and synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with supporting evidence.

> Let me first confirm the indication and placement of chlordiazepoxide in guidelines. Chlordiazepoxide is FDA-indicated for the management of withdrawal symptoms of acute alcoholism, and contemporary guidelines consistently recommend benzodiazepines as first-line therapy for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, with no single benzodiazepine proven superior in efficacy or safety, though longer-acting agents are often preferred for smoother control and seizure prevention [^6727dc79] [^ff535a19] [^34fdc60f].

> I need to check the pharmacologic rationale. Chlordiazepoxide is a long-acting benzodiazepine with active metabolites that provide sustained GABA-A modulation, which helps blunt hyperexcitability, reduce breakthrough symptoms, and lower the risk of withdrawal seizures and delirium tremens; this pharmacokinetic profile supports its use in both symptom-triggered and front-loading strategies, particularly in monitored settings [^99e8c1a6] [^173273bf].

> Next, I should review dosing strategies and confirm dose ranges. Three evidence-based approaches are endorsed: symptom-triggered dosing using CIWA-Ar thresholds, fixed-dose taper over 3–5 days, and front-loading for severe withdrawal; ASAM provides chlordiazepoxide-equivalent examples such as 25–100 mg per dose for symptom-triggered therapy, 25–100 mg every 4–6 hours with a 25–50% daily reduction for fixed-dose tapers, and 50–100 mg every 1–2 hours for front-loading until CIWA-Ar is under 10, with a typical ceiling of 300 mg/day in routine practice [^2d0cfc57] [^5598660b] [^1d14b436].

> Hold on, I should verify the evidence base for front-loading and symptom-triggered approaches. Front-loading with long-acting benzodiazepines reduces treatment duration, seizure incidence, and delirium duration in severe withdrawal, and symptom-triggered regimens reduce total benzodiazepine exposure and length of stay compared with fixed dosing; a randomized ED trial also showed phenobarbital and lorazepam had similar efficacy, with chlordiazepoxide commonly used at discharge, reinforcing the acceptability of chlordiazepoxide in practice [^ba26f6b6] [^2818a0e7] [^eb915540].

> I will now examine special populations, starting with hepatic impairment. Initially, I thought both diazepam and chlordiazepoxide should be avoided in hepatic insufficiency due to prolonged sedation from active metabolites; wait, let me verify that nuance. More recent toxicology data suggest diazepam's rapid peak allows careful titration despite liver disease, whereas chlordiazepoxide's delayed onset and active metabolite accumulation can lead to dose-stacking and prolonged sedation, so in significant liver disease, lorazepam or oxazepam are preferred, and if chlordiazepoxide is used, it should be with great caution and close monitoring for oversedation [^dce9756b] [^ff535a19] [^2facd751].

> Let me consider the elderly next. Older adults are at higher risk of oversedation, falls, and respiratory depression with benzodiazepines; therefore, I should confirm that shorter-acting agents with less accumulation, such as lorazepam or oxazepam, are generally preferred in this group, with chlordiazepoxide reserved for carefully selected cases with vigilant monitoring and dose minimization [^af90cf77] [^ff535a19].

> I need to ensure safety and dependence issues are addressed. Chlordiazepoxide can cause oversedation and respiratory depression, especially with accumulation or concomitant CNS depressants, and carries risks of misuse, dependence, and withdrawal; prescriptions should be time-limited, tapered gradually, and accompanied by patient education on risks, driving impairment, and drug interactions, with explicit plans to discontinue after withdrawal is complete [^a000fbcf] [^72c9a69f] [^395b1ebd].

> Next, I should review what to do if symptoms are not controlled. If response is inadequate, I should first confirm adherence and consider increasing the dose within safe limits; if still uncontrolled, reassess the level of care, consider switching agents due to benzodiazepine resistance or kindling, and add adjuncts such as carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproate as appropriate, while avoiding antipsychotic monotherapy given seizure risk; in severe or refractory cases, phenobarbital can be used with close monitoring [^177cbf46] [^2d15f4ca] [^32690f9a].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach. For severe withdrawal or high-risk patients, front-loading with chlordiazepoxide under continuous monitoring is reasonable to rapidly stabilize symptoms; for moderate severity, symptom-triggered dosing with CIWA-Ar is preferred in monitored settings; for mild symptoms or outpatient care, fixed-dose taper with PRN doses can be used if reliable monitoring is available, with a plan to taper and stop within 3–5 days; throughout, monitor for oversedation, respiratory depression, and hepatic considerations, and adjust the agent and dose accordingly [^5598660b] [^2d0cfc57] [^ff535a19].

> Finally, I should double-check the bottom line. Chlordiazepoxide remains a guideline-endorsed, FDA-approved first-line option for acute alcohol withdrawal, particularly useful for front-loading in severe cases and for fixed-dose tapers in selected outpatients; however, in hepatic impairment or the elderly, shorter-acting benzodiazepines are generally safer, and all regimens require vigilant monitoring, dose individualization, and a plan for tapering and discontinuation to mitigate risks of oversedation, dependence, and withdrawal [^6727dc79] [^ff535a19] [^2facd751].

Chlordiazepoxide is a **first-line benzodiazepine** for acute alcohol withdrawal because of its long half-life and active metabolites, which provide smooth, sustained symptom control and reduce breakthrough withdrawal [^ff535a19] [^99e8c1a6]. It is **effective in preventing seizures and delirium tremens** and is preferred for front-loading in severe cases [^75b53002] [^85573bb4]. Dosing can be symptom-triggered or fixed-dose with taper, with typical total daily doses of 25–100 mg every 6–8 hours and a maximum of 300 mg/day; front-loading uses 50–100 mg every 1–2 hours until CIWA-Ar < 10 [^2d0cfc57] [^1db018b9]. Use caution in patients with hepatic impairment or the elderly due to prolonged sedation; consider lorazepam or oxazepam instead [^ff535a19] [^2facd751]. Monitor for oversedation and respiratory depression, and taper gradually to avoid withdrawal [^00fdaf59] [^72c9a69f].

## Pharmacological properties relevant to AWS

Chlordiazepoxide is a long-acting benzodiazepine with a half-life of 24–100 hours and active metabolites (e.g. desmethyldiazepam) that extend its duration of action, providing **smooth, sustained symptom control** and reducing breakthrough withdrawal [^99e8c1a6]. Its mechanism enhances GABAergic inhibition, countering alcohol withdrawal's hyperexcitability [^173273bf].

---

## Clinical efficacy

Chlordiazepoxide is **highly effective** in managing AWS:

- **Seizure prevention**: Benzodiazepines reduce withdrawal seizures versus placebo (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.04–0.69) [^32ad85ef] [^4a07313c].
- **Delirium tremens**: Effective in preventing and treating delirium tremens, especially with front-loading [^ba26f6b6].
- **Symptom control**: Provides robust control of anxiety, tremor, and autonomic hyperactivity [^notfound].

---

## Recommended dosing strategies

| **Dosing strategy** | **Indication** | **Dosing regimen** |
|-|-|-|
| Symptom-triggered | Mild to moderate AWS | 25–100 mg PO q6–8h PRN based on CIWA-Ar ≥ 10 [^2d0cfc57] |
| Fixed-dose taper | Moderate AWS or outpatient | Day 1: 25–100 mg PO q6–8h; Day 2: 25–100 mg PO q8–12h; Day 3: 25–50 mg PO q12h; Day 4: 25–50 mg PO at bedtime; optional Day 5: 25 mg PO at bedtime [^2d0cfc57] |
| Front-loading | Severe AWS (CIWA-Ar ≥ 19) | 50–100 mg PO q1–2h until CIWA-Ar < 10 or 3 doses; monitor closely [^2d0cfc57] [^ba26f6b6] |

---

Maximum recommended daily dose is **300 mg** [^1db018b9].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Chlordiazepoxide is **generally safe** when used appropriately, but adverse effects can occur:

- **Common effects**: Sedation, dizziness, ataxia, and cognitive impairment [^notfound].
- **Serious risks**: Respiratory depression, especially with high doses or CNS depressants [^a000fbcf].
- **Dependence**: Risk of dependence with prolonged use; taper gradually [^72c9a69f].

---

## Special considerations

- **Hepatic impairment**: Use caution due to prolonged sedation; consider lorazepam or oxazepam [^ff535a19] [^2facd751].
- **Elderly**: Increased risk of oversedation and falls; use lower doses and monitor closely [^b8bf4ea2].
- **Pregnancy**: Avoid late pregnancy due to neonatal sedation and withdrawal risks [^72c9a69f].

---

## Comparison with other benzodiazepines

| **Parameter** | **Chlordiazepoxide** | **Diazepam** | **Lorazepam** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Half-life | Long (24–100 h) | Long (20–100 h) | Intermediate (10–20 h) |
| Onset | Slow | Rapid | Intermediate |
| Hepatic metabolism | Yes | Yes | Minimal (glucuronidation) |
| Active metabolites | Yes | Yes | No |
| Clinical use | Preferred for front-loading and sustained control | Preferred for rapid control | Preferred in hepatic impairment |

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Vital signs**: Monitor for oversedation and respiratory depression [^00fdaf59].
- **CIWA-Ar**: Use to guide symptom-triggered dosing [^2d0cfc57].
- **Tapering**: Gradually taper to avoid withdrawal [^72c9a69f].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line**: Chlordiazepoxide is a first-line agent for AWS, especially for front-loading in severe cases [^85573bb4].
- **Dosing**: Use symptom-triggered or fixed-dose taper; front-load for severe withdrawal [^2d0cfc57].
- **Caution**: Use caution in hepatic impairment and the elderly; consider alternatives [^ff535a19].
- **Monitoring**: Monitor closely for oversedation and respiratory depression; taper gradually [^00fdaf59] [^72c9a69f].

---

Chlordiazepoxide remains a **cornerstone of AWS management** due to its long-acting profile, efficacy in preventing severe complications, and flexible dosing strategies, with careful attention to patient-specific factors and monitoring for adverse effects.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^2d0cfc57]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal — benzodiazepine regimens (doses in chlordiazepoxide equivalents) provide severity-based single doses, symptom-triggered dosing, fixed-dose tapers, and front-loading options. Mild withdrawal (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, Revised [CIWA-Ar] < 10) uses 25–50 mg by mouth (PO); moderate (CIWA-Ar 10–18) uses 50–100 mg PO; severe (CIWA-Ar ≥ 19) uses 75–100 mg PO. Symptom-triggered dosing is 25–100 mg PO every 4–6 hours (q4–6h) when CIWA-Ar ≥ 10 with additional doses as needed (PRN). A fixed-dose taper reduces the daily total by 25–50% per day over 3–5 days with PRN doses, using a schedule of Day 1: 25–100 mg PO q4–6h; Day 2: 25–100 mg PO q6–8h; Day 3: 25–100 mg PO q8–12h; Day 4: 25–100 mg PO at bedtime; and optional Day 5: 25 to 100 mg PO at bedtime. A front loading option includes symptom-triggered 50–100 mg PO q 1–2h until CIWA-Ar < 10 or fixed-dose 50–100 mg PO q1–2h for 3 doses.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^5598660b]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — benzodiazepine dosing regimens: In short‑term observational settings with continuous monitoring, symptom‑triggered treatment conducted by trained staff is the preferred dosing method, while front loading under clinical supervision or fixed dosing with additional as‑needed medication are also appropriate. In settings without extended on‑site monitoring, symptom‑triggered dosing is appropriate only if patients or a caregiver can reliably monitor signs and symptoms with a withdrawal severity scale and follow dosing guidance; otherwise, front loading under clinical supervision or fixed dosing with additional as‑needed medication is appropriate. For severe alcohol withdrawal, front loading is recommended, and diazepam and chlordiazepoxide are preferred agents for front loading. When using a fixed‑dose schedule, patients' signs and symptoms should still be monitored, a few additional take‑home doses can be provided to take as needed, and when initiating a fixed‑dose regimen patients should be followed up the next day to modify the dose if needed. If prescribing a shorter‑acting benzodiazepine, using a fixed‑dose regimen with a gradual taper may be appropriate to reduce the likelihood of break‑through and rebound signs and symptoms.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^99e8c1a6]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal — benzodiazepine characteristics, tapering, accumulation, and hepatic considerations: Benzodiazepines are commonly recommended as first-line agents for managing most forms of alcohol withdrawal, and diazepam, lorazepam, and chlordiazepoxide are the most frequently used in treating alcohol withdrawal. While there is no evidence to show superiority of effectiveness or adverse effects among benzodiazepines, slower-acting agents with long half-lives can be considered preferred in clinical practice, helping provide a smoother course of withdrawal, greater control of breakthrough and rebound signs or symptoms, and greater coverage for preventing breakthrough withdrawal seizures and delirium. For patients on shorter-acting agents, a more gradual taper and more frequent reassessment are advised. Longer-acting agents can accumulate and lead to over-sedation and respiratory depression, particularly in older patients or those with compromised health; other signs of accumulation include ataxia, confusion, memory impairment, and delirium, and benzodiazepine-associated delirium has been diagnosed by the administration of flumazenil, a GABA-A receptor antagonist, though this protocol was not reviewed by the Guideline Committee. Benzodiazepine accumulation is more likely in patients with impaired hepatic function, and in such cases the dose can be reduced or an agent with less dependence on hepatic metabolism can be used; laboratory tests can help indicate the need to adjust the treatment plan, but treatment should not be delayed while waiting for lab test results or if the test(s) are unavailable at the treatment setting.

### Guidelines for managing substance withdrawal in jails [^7e47ba94]. BJA/NIC (2023). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal — benzodiazepine-based management emphasizes that benzodiazepines are the preferred agent for treating alcohol withdrawal, and long-acting benzodiazepines are the preferred agents, with adequate treatment with a long-acting benzodiazepine effective in preventing withdrawal seizures. Patients with CIWA-Ar scores < 10 and who are at minimal risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal may be provided supportive care alone and monitored, and it is also appropriate to use benzodiazepines prophylactically for alcohol withdrawal. Patients with CIWA-Ar scores > 10 and patients at risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal should receive pharmacotherapy and supportive care. Front loading is recommended for patients at risk for severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal (e.g. CIWA-Ar ≥ 21), and diazepam and chlordiazepoxide are preferred agents for front loading; in jail settings, front loading, fixed dosing, and symptom-triggered dosing are all appropriate and may be used in combination. The patient's signs and symptoms should be monitored regardless of the dosing schedule used, qualified health care staff should monitor for signs of oversedation and respiratory depression, if symptoms are not controlled as expected with the prescribed dose the provider should consider increasing the dose, and benzodiazepines used to treat alcohol withdrawal should be tapered and discontinued following treatment.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^ba26f6b6]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — benzodiazepine front loading — describes front loading as administering a moderate to high dose of a long-acting benzodiazepine to rapidly control withdrawal, noting diazepam and chlordiazepoxide are the preferred agents and that this approach is typically used in patients at risk for or experiencing severe alcohol withdrawal (e.g. CIWA-Ar scores ≥ 19). The guideline states front loading has been shown to reduce the duration of treatment, incidence of withdrawal seizure, and duration of delirium, and that a front-loading regimen can follow a fixed schedule such as 20 mg diazepam PO every 2 hours for 3 doses. It advises clinicians should monitor patients closely during treatment and, if the CIWA-Ar is used with short acting benzodiazepines, assessments should be done promptly in order to prevent seizures due to protocol errors.

### An audit of symptom triggered chlordiazepoxide treatment of alcohol withdrawal on a medical admissions unit [^ae071949]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Patients suffering from alcohol withdrawal were found on initial audit to be discharged before the resolution of their symptoms. A regimen using symptom triggered chlordiazepoxide was introduced and found, on re-audit and anecdotally, to be an improvement. The duration of symptoms was reduced significantly, the length of stay was reduced (although not statistically significant because of limited power), and most patients who had experience of both regimens found the symptom triggered regimen more effective.

### Chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride [^1db018b9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Because of the wide range of clinical indications for chlordiazepoxide HCl, the optimum dosage varies with the diagnosis and response of the individual patient. The dosage, therefore, should be individualized for maximum beneficial effects.

Preoperative Apprehension and Anxiety

On days preceding surgery, 5 to 10 mg orally, 3 or 4 times daily. If used as preoperative medication, 50 to 100 mg IM 1 hour prior to surgery.

For the relief of withdrawal symptoms of acute alcoholism, the parenteral form is usually used initially. If the drug is administered orally, the suggested initial dose is 50 to 100 mg, to be followed by repeated doses as needed until agitation is controlled up to 300 mg per day. Dosage should then be reduced to maintenance levels.

*See package insert for Sterile Chlordiazepoxide Hydrochloride.

Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Chlordiazepoxide

To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue chlordiazepoxide or reduce the dosage. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increase the dosage to the previous tapered dosage level. Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence).

### Outpatient detoxification of the addicted or alcoholic patient… [^1d0f8413]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

SUBSTITUTION MEDICATIONS FOR ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL Several detoxification medication regimens are appropriate for use in outpatient alcohol withdrawal. Chlordiazepoxide, one of the most frequently used medications, has a well-documented efficacy profile. 21, 22 This drug has a wide therapeutic window and is "self-tapering" because of its long half-life. Thus, chlordiazepoxide is an ideal drug for use in outpatient detoxification. 19 One treatment option is to "front load" the patient to provide adequate sedation. Then small amounts of the drug are added as needed during the detoxification period.
20. Chlordiazepoxide therapy should be stopped if a patient does not respond as expected to an adequate dosage of the medication. Failure to respond may reflect complete down-regulation of the γ-aminobutyric acid–neuron benzodiazepine receptors, which renders the medication ineffective. 23 In this situation, a barbiturate may be necessary to induce sedation.
24.

26 This state can persist more than a year and becomes most evident during withdrawal of the last 10 to 25 percent of the original maintenance dosage. 26 Anxiety can be reduced by using a low dosage of carbamazepine or valproic acid while slowly tapering the sedative-hypnotic drug at the rate of one half of the daily dosage each week. 27 SUPPORTIVE MEDICATIONS The use of supportive medications should be considered in patients who are undergoing alcohol withdrawal. Thiamine supplementation can counteract the thiamine deficiencies that are common in chronic alcohol abusers. This measure can help prevent the development of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which may present with confusion, apathy, drowsiness, amnesia and polyneuropathies. 23 Hallucinations without insight resulting from stage III alcohol withdrawal signify an acute medical emergency.

In this situation, neuroleptic drugs should not be used alone, because they do not prevent progression of the withdrawal syndrome, and they may lower the seizure threshold. 19 When used in conjunction with adequate sedation, haloperidol is preferable because it has only a minimal effect on the seizure threshold. 19.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^77d94306]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — benzodiazepine dosing regimens and front loading — Symptom-triggered treatment is the preferred benzodiazepine dosing method, and fixed dosing according to a scheduled taper is appropriate if symptom-triggered treatment cannot be used. Front loading is recommended for patients experiencing severe alcohol withdrawal (e.g. CIWA-Ar scores ≥ 19), and diazepam or chlordiazepoxide are preferred agents for front loading. A front loading regimen can be driven by a withdrawal symptom severity scale (e.g., 10 mg diazepam PO every hour if CIWA-Ar score ≥ 10) or according to a fixed schedule (e.g., 20 mg diazepam PO every 2 hours for 3 doses). When using a fixed-dose schedule, patients' signs and symptoms should still be monitored, and additional doses of medication provided as needed, and if prescribing a short-acting benzodiazepine, using a fixed-dose regimen with a gradual taper may be preferred to symptom-triggered dosing to minimize breakthrough and rebound signs and symptoms. While monitoring for signs of over-sedation and respiratory depression is important for any dosing regimen, it is particularly important in patients receiving fixed-dose and front-loading regimens.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^ff535a19]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal — benzodiazepine recommendations: Recommendation V.19: While no particular benzodiazepine agent is more effective than another, longer-acting benzodiazepines are the preferred agents due to clinical benefits of their longer duration of action. Recommendation V.20: If waiting for lab test results or if the test are unavailable, if a patient has signs of significant liver disease, use a benzodiazepine with less hepatic metabolization. Recommendation V.21: Clinicians should monitor patients taking benzodiazepines for signs of over-sedation and respiratory depression. Recommendation V.22: A benzodiazepine prescription for acute alcohol withdrawal should be discontinued following treatment.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^37c36005]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine dosing approaches for alcohol withdrawal — symptom-triggered, fixed-dose, and front loading — are described with explicit examples: Symptom-triggered dosing uses thresholds and score-specific doses (e.g., 25–100 mg chlordiazepoxide if CIWA–Ar score ≥ 10; 15 mg oxazepam for CIWA–Ar scores 8–15; 30 mg oxazepam for CIWA–Ar > 15) and the score can determine reassessment frequency; fixed dosing administers predetermined doses at fixed intervals with taper over several days and allows additional medication if symptoms are not controlled; and front loading uses a long-acting agent, for example 20 mg diazepam every hour until CIWA–Ar scores < 10 or every hour for 1–2 hours or until the patient is sedated.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^9a8fb3fd]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to benzodiazepines, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to do not prescribe benzodiazepines in outpatient settings for patients with a history of even mild adverse events with benzodiazepine use, as rapid intervention is not typically available. Use benzodiazepines with caution in patients with a high risk of benzodiazepine diversion, including patients with a current or past benzodiazepine use disorder for the short period of acute alcohol withdrawal. Consider managing the risk by dispensing or prescribing a small number of doses.

### Efficacy and safety of pharmacological interventions for the treatment of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome [^4a07313c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Alcohol abuse and dependence represents a very serious health problem worldwide with major social, interpersonal and legal interpolations. Pharmacological treatments presently used are of uncertain effectiveness and there is even more doubt on the comparative effects and value for money.

Objectives

To summarize Cochrane reviews that assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological interventions in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal.

Methods

We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (30 November 2010). Two authors independently screened, extracted data, summarised key characteristics of the included reviews and assessed their quality using AMSTAR; the quality of the evidence was summarised according to the GRADE methodology.

Main Results

Five reviews, 114 studies, 7333 participants, satisfied criteria for inclusions. The outcomes considered were alcohol withdrawal seizures, adverse events and dropouts. Comparing the five treatments with placebo, benzodiazepines performed better for seizures, three studies, 324 participants, RR 0.16 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.69), moderate quality of evidence. Comparing each of the five treatments versus specific class of drugs, benzodiazepines performed better than antipsychotics for seizures, 4 studies, 633 participants, RR 0.24 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.88) high quality of the evidence. Comparing different benzodiazepines and anticonvulsants among themselves, 28 comparisons, results never reached statistical significance but chlordiazepoxide performed better. The quality of evidence was high for 3% of the results, moderate for 28%, low for 48% and very low for 20%.

Authors' Conclusions

Among the treatments considered, benzodiazepines showed a protective benefit against seizures, when compared to placebo and a potentially protective benefit for many outcomes when compared with antipsychotics. Nevertheless, no definite conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of benzodiazepines were possible, because of the heterogeneity of the trials both in interventions and in the assessment of outcomes. Data on potential harms are sparse and fragmented. Results do not provide sufficient evidence in favour of anticonvulsants for the treatment of AWS, but anticonvulsants seem to have limited side effects. There is also not enough evidence of effectiveness and safety of baclofen, because only one study consider this treatment and of GHB for which no strong differences were observed in the comparisons with placebo, benzodiazepines and anticonvulsants.

### Chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride (chlordiazepoxide HCl) [^51a512e4]. FDA (2005). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Because of the wide range of clinical indications for chlordiazepoxide, the optimum dosage varies with the diagnosis and response of the individual patient. The dosage, therefore, should be individualized for maximum beneficial effects.

Preoperative apprehension and anxiety: On days preceding surgery, 5 to 10 mg orally, 3 or 4 times daily. If used as preoperative medication, 50 to 100 mg IM* one hour prior to surgery.

For the relief of withdrawal symptoms of acute alcoholism, the parenteral form* is usually used initially. If the drug is administered orally, the suggested initial oral dose is 50 to 100 mg, to be followed by repeated doses as needed until agitation is controlled - up to 300 mg per day. Dosage should then be reduced to maintenance levels.

*See package insert for Sterile Chlordiazepoxide Hydrochloride.

Management of Overdosage: Manifestations of chlordiazepoxide overdosage includes somnolence, confusion, coma and diminished reflexes. Respiration, pulse and blood pressure should be monitored, as in all cases of drug overdosage, although, in general, these effects have been minimal following chlordiazepoxide overdosage. General supportive measures should be employed, along with immediate gastric lavage. Intravenous fluids should be administered and an adequate airway maintained. Hypotension may be combated by the use of norepinephrine or metaraminol. Dialysis is of limited value. There have been occasional reports of excitation in patients following chlordiazepoxide overdosage; if this occurs barbiturates should not be used. As with the management of intentional overdosage with any drug, it should be borne in mind that multiple agents may have been ingested.

Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, is indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines and may be used in situations when an overdose with a benzodiazepine is known or suspected. Prior to the administration of flumazenil, necessary measures should be instituted to secure airway, ventilation, and intravenous access. Flumazenil is intended as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, proper management of benzodiazepine overdose. Patients treated with flumazenil should be monitored for re-sedation, respiratory depression, and other residual benzodiazepine effects for an appropriate period after treatment. The prescriber should be aware of a risk of seizure in association with flumazenil treatment, particularly in long-term benzodiazepine users and in cyclic antidepressant overdose. The complete flumazenil package insert including CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS should be consulted prior to use.

### Baclofen for alcohol withdrawal [^18f4a3b8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Baclofen shows potential for rapidly reducing symptoms of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) in people with alcoholism. Treatment with baclofen is easy to manage and rarely produces euphoria or other pleasant effects, or craving for the drug. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in 2015, Issue 4.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of baclofen for people with AWS.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to March 2017: the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL. We also searched registers of ongoing trials. We handsearched the references quoted in the identified trials, and sought information from researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and relevant trial authors about unpublished or uncompleted trials. We placed no restrictions on language.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating baclofen versus placebo or any other treatment for people with AWS. We excluded uncontrolled, non-randomised, or quasi-randomised trials. We included both parallel group and cross-over studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included three RCTs with 141 randomised participants. We did not perform meta-analyses due to the different control interventions. For the comparison of baclofen and placebo (1 study, 31 participants), there was no significant difference in Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Scale, Revised (CIWA-Ar) scores (very low quality evidence). For the comparison of baclofen and diazepam (1 study, 37 participants), there was no significant difference in CIWA-Ar scores (very low quality evidence), adverse events (risk difference (RD) 0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.10 to 0.10; very low quality evidence), dropouts (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.10; very low quality evidence), and dropouts due to adverse events (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.10; very low quality evidence). For the comparison of baclofen and chlordiazepoxide (1 study, 60 participants), there was no significant difference in CIWA-Ar scores (mean difference (MD) 1.00, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.30; very low quality evidence), global improvement (MD 0.10, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.23; very low quality evidence), adverse events (RD 2.50, 95% CI 0.88 to 7.10; very low quality of evidence), dropouts (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.06; very low quality evidence), and dropouts due to adverse events (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.06; very low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

No conclusions can be drawn about the efficacy and safety of baclofen for the management of alcohol withdrawal because we found insufficient and very low quality evidence.

### Peri-operative identification and management of patients with unhealthy alcohol intake [^8bfde154]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

On admission to hospital, the revised Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment – Alcohol (CIWA‐Ar) score should be measured in at‐risk patients. This is a 10‐point scale (Fig. 6) used to assess alcohol withdrawal that can be used to direct pharmacological interventions; benzodiazepines such as chlordiazepoxide are a mainstay of therapy, while alternatives include carbamazepine and clomethiazole. The required interval between medication doses will vary but is often every 90 min with administration of a longer‐acting benzodiazepine, such as diazepam 20 mg, triggered at a CIWA‐Ar score of > 11. This is repeated until there are three consecutive CIWA‐Ar scores < 11, indicating complete detoxification. The patient should then continue with standard vital and neurological observations unless there is a re‐emergence of symptoms. This strategy may warrant modification in established liver cirrhosis due to the concurrent risk of encephalopathy; in this setting the exclusive use of short‐acting benzodiazepines such as oxazepam is warranted. This may also apply to other groups who can have greater sensitivity to sedative drugs, such as patients who are older.

Figure 6
Components of the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment Alcohol – Revised (CIWA‐Ar) Scale.

Seizures are a common sequel of harmful alcohol intake, particularly in the context of withdrawal. Other differentials, such as hypoglycaemia or electrolyte deficiencies, should be considered as part of management. Alcohol‐related seizures occurring as an inpatient should be dealt with according to established guidelines. Benzodiazepines are a mainstay of therapy; phenytoin should be avoided. Following a seizure the patient should continue, or recommence, CIWA‐Ar scoring as appropriate.

Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions

To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue chlordiazepoxide or reduce the dosage (a patient-specific plan should be used to taper the dose) (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of chlordiazepoxide).

Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages, and those who have had longer durations of use.

Acute Withdrawal Reactions

The continued use of benzodiazepines, including chlordiazepoxide, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of chlordiazepoxide after continued use, or administration of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening (e.g., seizures) (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence).

Protracted Withdrawal Syndrome

In some cases, benzodiazepine users have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence).

Chlordiazepoxide HCl may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery. Similarly, it may impair mental alertness in children. The concomitant use of alcohol or other central nervous system depressants may have an additive effect. PATIENTS SHOULD BE WARNED ACCORDINGLY.

Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome

Use of chlordiazepoxide HCl late in pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression, lethargy, hypotonia) and/or withdrawal symptoms (hyperreflexia, irritability, restlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties) in the neonate (see PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy). Monitor neonates exposed to chlordiazepoxide HCl during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation and monitor neonates exposed to chlordiazepoxide HCl during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal; manage these neonates accordingly.

### Benzodiazepines for alcohol withdrawal [^32ad85ef]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Alcohol abuse and dependence represents a serious health problem worldwide with social, interpersonal and legal interpolations. Benzodiazepines have been widely used for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Moreover it is unknown whether different benzodiazepines and different regimens of administration may have the same merits.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of benzodiazepines in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal.

Search Strategy

Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group' Register of Trials (December 2009), PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL (January 1966 to December 2009), EconLIT (1969 to December 2009). Parallel searches on web sites of health technology assessment and related agencies, and their databases.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials examining effectiveness, safety and risk-benefit of benzodiazepines in comparison with placebo or other pharmacological treatment and between themselves. All patients were included regardless of age, gender, nationality, and outpatient or inpatient therapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened and extracted data from studies.

Main Results

Sixty four studies, 4309 participants, met the inclusion criteria.- Comparing benzodiazepines versus placebo, benzodiazepines performed better for seizures, 3 studies, 324 participants, RR 0.16 (0.04 to 0.69), no statistically significant difference for the other outcomes considered.- Comparing benzodiazepines versus other drugs, there is a trend in favour of benzodiazepines for seizure and delirium control, severe life threatening side effect, dropouts, dropouts due to side effects and patient's global assessment score. A trend in favour of control group was observed for CIWA-Ar scores at 48 hours and at the end of treatment. The results reach statistical significance only in one study, with 61 participants, results on Hamilton anxiety rating scale favour control MD -1.60 (-2.59 to -0.61)- Comparing different benzodiazepines among themselves, results never reached statistical significance but chlordiazepoxide performed better- Comparing benzodiazepine plus other drug versus other drug, results never reached statistical significance.- In the comparison of fixed-schedule versus symptom-triggered regimens, results from a single study, with 159 participants, favour symptom-triggered regimens MD -1.10 [-3.27, 1.07] for CIWA-Ar scores at the end of treatment. Differences in isolated trials should be interpreted very cautiously.

Authors' Conclusions

Benzodiazepines showed a protective benefit against alcohol withdrawal symptoms, in particular seizures, when compared to placebo and a potentially protective benefit for many outcomes when compared with other drugs. Nevertheless, no definite conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of benzodiazepines was possible, because of the heterogeneity of the trials both in interventions and the assessment of outcomes.

### Research needs for inpatient management of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^5a538abe]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Benzodiazepines differ in terms of onset and duration of action, dosing, metabolism, and available formulations, all of which should be considered when selecting a benzodiazepine for the treatment of SAWS in a given patient. Diazepam is a commonly used and studied benzodiazepine for treating alcohol withdrawal, having both enteral and intravenous formulations and a rapid onset of action. However, some patients with AUD have underlying liver dysfunction. Diazepam oxidation and metabolism of active metabolites occurs via the liver, and thus liver dysfunction may prolong drug effects. An alternative medication is lorazepam, which is also well studied, metabolized via hepatic glucuronidation (less commonly impaired), and does not have active metabolites. Chlordiazepoxide, a long-acting benzodiazepine commonly used and studied in specialized addiction settings, allows patients to "self-taper" during the course of treatment, but its use is limited in hospital settings by the lack of an intravenous formulation.

Benzodiazepine Resistance

Despite receiving escalating doses of benzodiazepines, some patients with SAWS do not experience adequate symptom control. Mechanisms of cross-tolerance with alcohol at the GABA A receptor (see ONSin S1) have been implicated to explain this observation. The suboptimal response is often termed "benzodiazepine resistance." In this context, administration of alternative medications as a first-line or adjunctive therapy may achieve faster symptom control than further escalation of benzodiazepine dosing. Although there is no consistent definition of benzodiazepine-resistant SAWS, data suggest a high cumulative dose of a benzodiazepine administered over a short period of time (e.g. 40 mg diazepam-equivalents within 1 h) without resolution of SAWS symptoms characterizes benzodiazepine-resistant physiology. Treatment choices for patients with SAWS that is refractory to benzodiazepines vary widely. Evaluation of benzodiazepine-alternative medications for benzodiazepine-resistant SAWS will be critical to establish whether morbidity associated with standard management approaches (e.g. intubation, prolonged ICU care) can be improved. Specific alternative therapies are detailed in Table 1, including the advantages and disadvantages of each medication and studied doses. Of note, antipsychotics are not included in Table 1, as they have been shown to precipitate or exacerbate seizures and are not considered an alternative therapy.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).
The use of benzodiazepines, including chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride capsules, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride capsules and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (see WARNINGS).
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride capsules, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride capsules after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride capsules or reduce the dosage (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and WARNINGS).

### Anticonvulsants for alcohol withdrawal [^0334ef5e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Alcohol abuse and dependence represents a most serious health problem worldwide with major social, interpersonal and legal interpolations. Besides benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants are often used for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Anticonvulsants drugs are indicated for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, alone or in combination with benzodiazepine treatments. In spite of the wide use, the exact role of the anticonvulsants for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal has not yet bee adequately assessed.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of anticonvulsants in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal.

Search Strategy

We searched Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group' Register of Trials (December 2009), PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL (1966 to December 2009), EconLIT (1969 to December 2009). Parallel searches on web sites of health technology assessment and related agencies, and their databases.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the effectiveness, safety and overall risk-benefit of anticonvulsants in comparison with a placebo or other pharmacological treatment. All patients were included regardless of age, gender, nationality, and outpatient or inpatient therapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened and extracted data from studies.

Main Results

Fifty-six studies, with a total of 4076 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Comparing anticonvulsants with placebo, no statistically significant differences for the six outcomes considered. Comparing anticonvulsant versus other drug, 19 outcomes considered, results favour anticonvulsants only in the comparison carbamazepine versus benzodiazepine (oxazepam and lorazepam) for alcohol withdrawal symptoms (CIWA-Ar score): 3 studies, 262 participants, MD -1.04 (-1.89 to -0.20), none of the other comparisons reached statistical significance. Comparing different anticonvulsants no statistically significant differences in the two outcomes considered. Comparing anticonvulsants plus other drugs versus other drugs (3 outcomes considered), results from one study, 72 participants, favour paraldehyde plus chloral hydrate versus chlordiazepoxide, for the severe-life threatening side effects, RR 0.12 (0.03 to 0.44).

Authors' Conclusions

Results of this review do not provide sufficient evidence in favour of anticonvulsants for the treatment of AWS. There are some suggestions that carbamazepine may actually be more effective in treating some aspects of alcohol withdrawal when compared to benzodiazepines, the current first-line regimen for alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Anticonvulsants seem to have limited side effects, although adverse effects are not rigorously reported in the analysed trials.

### Evaluating changes in symptoms during acute alcohol withdrawal… [^31d6cc70]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Male patients experiencing the symptoms of acute alcohol withdrawal were assigned at ramdom to double-blind treatment with chlordiazepoxide, chlorpromazine, hydroxyzine, thiamine, or placebo for a period of ten days. They were rated three times daily by nursing personnel using a Nurses' Rating Scale and were asked to complete a Mood Scale daily. Patients generally showed a rapid improvement in different symptom areas regardless of the group to which they had been assigned. Treatment comparisons suggested that fewer symptoms were associated with placebo and thiamine treatment than with the three psychoactive drugs. However, the greater incidence of convulsions and delirium occurring in these two groups as compared with the chlordiazeposide group more than offset any advantage that may exist for what is essentially supportive treatment.

- To our knowledge, this is the first reported comparison of clonidine with benzodiazepine in the management of acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome. In a double-blind trial, 61 men experiencing acute alcohol withdrawal were randomly assigned to receive clonidine or chlordiazepoxide over a 60-hour treatment period. Clonidine was more effective than chlordiazepoxide at reducing alcohol withdrawal scale scores, systolic blood pressures, and heart rates over the entire study period. Clonidine was as good as chlordiazepoxide at improving Cognitive Capacity Screening Exam, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, and Self-Rating Scale scores. Adverse drug reactions reported by each group were similar, though less nausea and vomiting were observed in the clonidine group.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^0a40d3a7]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal — ambulatory risk management and pharmacotherapy options emphasizes that patients at risk of developing severe or complicated withdrawal or complications of withdrawal should receive pharmacotherapy as soon as possible, with benzodiazepines recommended as first-line treatment; phenobarbital can be used as an alternative in Level 2-WM settings for patients with a contraindication for benzodiazepine use but should only be used by clinicians experienced with its use. For patients at high risk of severe withdrawal, front loading with a benzodiazepine is recommended and patients should be closely observed for over-sedation and respiratory depression following administration. For lower-risk patients, providing at least a single or a few doses of benzodiazepine is appropriate, including when there is a history of severe or complicated withdrawal, risk for complications of significant medical, surgical, or psychiatric illness (particularly cardiovascular disease including coronary artery disease), or signs/symptoms of withdrawal concurrent with a positive blood alcohol content. Risk stratification includes timing within the 6–36 hour window after cessation of (or reduction in) alcohol consumption; if risk is unknown, patients should be reassessed frequently over the next 24 hours. For those at risk of developing mild or moderate withdrawal, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, or gabapentin are appropriate options.

### Promising strategies for the prevention of alcohol-related brain damage through optimised management of acute alcohol withdrawal: a focussed literature review [^173273bf]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Addressing the glutamate imbalance in AWS

The most common medications used to combat the neurochemical imbalance, and symptoms, of AWS are positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of the GABA A receptor, for example diazepam and chlordiazepoxide. These medications act at sites distinct to the GABA binding domain, increasing the activity of GABA A to enhance chloride influx and so have a net inhibitory effect on neurons. As such treatment with diazepam indirectly attenuates glutamate-mediated neurotransmission, alters hippocampal and anterior cingulate cortex glutamate concentrations, and effectively mitigates risk of the development of alcohol withdrawal-related seizures and delirium tremens. Other medications that alter the hyperglutamatergic state in AWS include topiramate (an AMPA and kainite receptor antagonist, and GABA A receptor modulator), lamotrigine (a pre-synaptic sodium channel blocker, inhibiting glutamate release)) and memantine (an activity-dependent NMDA receptor blocker); all of which demonstrate varying efficacy.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapies for alcohol withdrawal: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^75b53002]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

There have been few head-to-head clinical trials of pharmacotherapies for alcohol withdrawal (AW). We, therefore, aimed to evaluate the comparative performance of pharmacotherapies for AW.

Methods

Six databases were searched for randomized clinical trials through November 2021. Trials were included after a blinded review by two independent reviewers. Outcomes included incident seizures, delirium tremens, AW severity scores, adverse events, dropouts, dropouts from adverse events, length of hospital stay, use of additional medications, total benzodiazepine requirements, and death. Effect sizes were pooled using frequentist random-effects network meta-analysis models to generate summary ORs and Cohen's d standardized mean differences (SMDs).

Results

Across the 149 trials, there were 10692 participants (76% male, median 43.5years old). AW severity spanned mild (n = 32), moderate (n = 51), and severe (n = 66). Fixed-schedule chlormethiazole (OR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.04–0.65), fixed-schedule diazepam (OR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.04–0.59), fixed-schedule lorazepam (OR = 0.19; 95% CI, 0.08–0.45), fixed-schedule chlordiazepoxide (OR = 0.21; 95% CI, 0.08–0.53), and divalproex (OR = 0.22; 95% CI, 0.05–0.86) were superior to placebo at reducing incident AW seizures. However, only fixed-schedule diazepam (OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.05–0.76) reduced incident delirium tremens. Oxcarbazepine (d = -3.69; 95% CI, -6.21 to -1.17), carbamazepine (d = -2.76; 95% CI, -4.13 to -1.40), fixed-schedule oxazepam (d = -2.55; 95% CI, -4.26 to -0.83), and γ-hydroxybutyrate (d = -1.80; 95% CI, -3.35 to -0.26) improved endpoint Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-Revised scores over placebo. Promazine and carbamazepine were the only agents significantly associated with greater dropouts because of adverse events. The quality of evidence was downgraded because of the substantial risk of bias, heterogeneity, inconsistency, and imprecision.

Conclusions

Although some pharmacotherapeutic modalities, particularly benzodiazepines, appear to be safe and efficacious for reducing some measures of alcohol withdrawal, methodological issues and a high risk of bias prevent a consistent estimate of their comparative performance.

In a double-blind trial, 61 men experiencing acute alcohol withdrawal were randomly assigned to receive clonidine or chlordiazepoxide over a 60-hour treatment period. Clonidine was more effective than chlordiazepoxide at reducing alcohol withdrawal scale scores, systolic blood pressures, and heart rates over the entire study period. Clonidine was as good as chlordiazepoxide at improving Cognitive Capacity Screening Exam, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, and Self-Rating Scale scores. Adverse drug reactions reported by each group were similar, though less nausea and vomiting were observed in the clonidine group.

### Should chlordiazepoxide and diazepam be avoided when treating alcohol withdrawal syndrome in patients with hepatic insufficiency? [^dce9756b]. Clinical Toxicology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chlordiazepoxide and diazepam are first-line treatments for patients with alcohol withdrawal. However, their use is discouraged in hepatic insufficiency due to concerns that impaired metabolism may prolong their half-lives and those of their active metabolites, increasing the risk of prolonged sedation to an unacceptable level.

The Activity Of Chlordiazepoxide and Its Metabolites

Findings presented here suggest that chlordiazepoxide has minimal sedative activity-its effect is primarily dependent on its metabolites. Chlordiazepoxide metabolism occurs through hepatic oxidation, so its biotransformation to its metabolites can be markedly delayed in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Because unmetabolized chlordiazepoxide has little activity, this delay may lead to the administration of a considerable cumulative dose before a therapeutic response occurs. This could result in the accumulation of a substantial reservoir of unmetabolized chlordiazepoxide ("dose-stacking"). This reservoir would undergo slow biotransformation to chlordiazepoxide metabolites, even after dosing is discontinued. The chlordiazepoxide metabolite demoxepam has a markedly longer half-life (14-95h) than chlordiazepoxide (6.6-28h), which may be further prolonged by hepatic insufficiency. Therefore, if chlordiazepoxide dose-stacking occurs in patients with hepatic insufficiency, demoxepam may also accumulate. This can result in a delayed, profound, and prolonged sedative effect.

The Activity Of Diazepam and Its Major Metabolite

The major metabolite of diazepam, desmethyldiazepam, is no more sedating than diazepam itself. As a result, the rapid onset sedative effect of diazepam-reaching its peak within 5min when administered intravenously and within 120min when administered orally-is unaffected by hepatic insufficiency. This allows accurate titration of diazepam to avoid prolonged sedation, even with compromised liver function.

Discussion

The widely accepted assertion that the increased risk of prolonged sedation when using chlordiazepoxide to treat alcohol withdrawal in patients with hepatic insufficiency is primarily due to the prolonged half-lives of chlordiazepoxide and its metabolites appears incorrect. It primarily results from a delayed onset of action and peak effect, driven by slowed chlordiazepoxide metabolism and the greater activity of its metabolites compared to the parent drug. These factors combine to increase the risk of dose-stacking. Dose-stacking is readily avoided with diazepam use in patients with hepatic insufficiency because its rapid time-to-peak effect is unaffected.

Conclusions

Although it has long been recommended that diazepam be avoided for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal in patients with hepatic insufficiency, the findings presented here suggest that it can be used as long as the dosing interval exceeds the time-to-peak effect and the patient is assessed for sedation before each dose-measures incorporated into front-loading and symptom-triggered treatments. In contrast, chlordiazepoxide may cause prolonged sedation in patients with hepatic insufficiency-even with close monitoring-due to unrecognized dose-stacking.

### Treatment of severe alcohol withdrawal [^91009cf1]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Approximately 50% of patients with alcohol dependence experience alcohol withdrawal. Severe alcohol withdrawal is characterized by seizures and/or delirium tremens, often refractory to standard doses of benzodiazepines, and requires aggressive treatment. This review aims to summarize the literature pertaining to the pharmacotherapy of severe alcohol withdrawal.

Data Sources

PubMed (January 1960 to October 2015) was searched using the search termsalcohol withdrawal, delirium tremens, intensive care, andrefractory Supplemental references were generated through review of identified literature citations.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Available English language articles assessing pharmacotherapy options for adult patients with severe alcohol withdrawal were included.

Data Synthesis

A PubMed search yielded 739 articles for evaluation, of which 27 were included. The number of randomized controlled trials was limited, so many of these are retrospective analyses and case reports. Benzodiazepines remain the treatment of choice, with diazepam having the most favorable pharmacokinetic profile. Protocolized escalation of benzodiazepines as an alternative to a symptom-triggered approach may decrease the need for mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay. Propofol is appropriate for patients refractory to benzodiazepines; however, the roles of phenobarbital, dexmedetomidine, and ketamine remain unclear.

Conclusions

Severe alcohol withdrawal is not clearly defined, and limited data regarding management are available. Protocolized administration of benzodiazepines, in combination with phenobarbital, may reduce the need for mechanical ventilation and lead to shorter ICU stays. Propofol is a viable alternative for patients refractory to benzodiazepines; however, the role of other agents remains unclear. Randomized, prospective studies are needed to clearly define effective treatment strategies.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — pharmacotherapy prophylaxis (Recommendations IV.13 and IV.14) notes that patients at risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal or concomitant alcohol withdrawal may be treated in ambulatory settings at the discretion of providers with extensive experience in management of alcohol withdrawal, and such patients should be provided with preventative pharmacotherapy. Benzodiazepines are first-line treatment because of their well-documented effectiveness in reducing the signs and symptoms of withdrawal including the incidence of seizure and delirium. Phenobarbital is an appropriate alternative in Level 2-WM settings for providers experienced with its use; for patients with a contraindication for benzodiazepine use, phenobarbital (in Level 2-WM settings by providers experienced with its use) or transfer to a more intensive level of care are appropriate options. A front loading regimen is recommended for patients at high risk of severe withdrawal syndrome. Providing at least a single dose of preventative medication is appropriate for patients at lower levels of risk who have: a history of severe or complicated withdrawal; an acute medical, psychiatric, or surgical illness; severe coronary artery disease; displaying signs or symptoms of withdrawal concurrent with a positive blood alcohol content.

### Contemporary management and outcomes of veterans hospitalized with alcohol withdrawal: a multicenter retrospective cohort study [^2818a0e7]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Few studies describe contemporary alcohol withdrawal management in hospitalized settings or review current practices considering the guidelines by the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM).

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalized with alcohol withdrawal on medical or surgical wards in 19 Veteran Health Administration (VHA) hospitals between October 1, 2018, and September 30, 2019. Demographic and comorbidity data were obtained from the Veteran Health Administration Corporate Data Warehouse. Inpatient management and hospital outcomes were obtained by chart review. Factors associated with treatment duration and complicated withdrawal were examined.

Results

Of the 594 patients included in this study, 51% were managed with symptom-triggered therapy alone, 26% with fixed dose plus symptom-triggered therapy, 10% with front loading regimens plus symptom-triggered therapy, and 3% with fixed dose alone. The most common medication given was lorazepam (87%) followed by chlordiazepoxide (33%), diazepam (14%), and phenobarbital (6%). Symptom-triggered therapy alone (relative risk [RR], 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57–0.80) and front loading with symptom-triggered therapy (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.62–0.92) were associated with reduced treatment duration. Lorazepam (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.02–1.41) and phenobarbital (RR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.06–1.54) were associated with increased treatment duration. Lorazepam (adjusted odds ratio, 4.30; 95% CI, 1.05–17.63) and phenobarbital (adjusted odds ratio, 6.51; 95% CI, 2.08–20.40) were also associated with complicated withdrawal.

Conclusions

Overall, our results support guidelines by the ASAM to manage patients with long-acting benzodiazepines using symptom-triggered therapy. Health care systems that are using shorter acting benzodiazepines and fixed-dose regimens should consider updating alcohol withdrawal management pathways to follow ASAM recommendations.

Alcohol withdrawal seizures — acute treatment and anticonvulsant options — are outlined as follows: Benzodiazepines are effective in the primary and secondary prevention of alcohol withdrawal seizures, and intravenous (IV) administration of a fast-acting agent such as lorazepam or diazepam is recommended after a withdrawal-related seizure; in a randomized, double-blind trial, patients received either 2 mL of saline or 2 mL of lorazepam intravenously and IV lorazepam significantly reduced recurrent seizures. All patients presenting with an alcohol withdrawal seizure should have IV access established immediately for fluids and medication, and intramuscular (IM) administration is also an effective and acceptable route. Phenobarbital is an appropriate option with a long half-life and a narrow therapeutic window and is more commonly used in an inpatient setting, such as the intensive care unit (ICU) or emergency department (ED) where there is continuous supervision; the Guideline Committee recommends caution when using in settings that offer less monitoring than the ICU and ED, and clinicians with minimal experience should use extra caution in case over-sedation or respiratory depression occurs. Supporting data include a prospective series in which none of the 38 patients with alcohol withdrawal seizures had a subsequent convulsion after IV phenobarbital, and a small randomized trial in the ED found phenobarbital to be as effective as benzodiazepines for reducing CIWA-Ar scores from baseline to discharge. While animal studies show anticonvulsants can prevent seizures and delirium, human evidence is mixed and insufficient to conclude superiority over benzodiazepines, and phenytoin has been shown to be ineffective in preventing the recurrence of seizure and is not recommended unless treating a concomitant underlying seizure disorder.

Discussion

Benzodiazepines have long played a prominent role in the treatment and prophylaxis of AWS and are often regarded as standard of care. This class of medications treats the psychomotor agitation that accompanies AWS and prevents progression from minor to major symptoms. Like ethanol, benzodiazepines stimulate the gamma-aminobutyric (GABA) receptors in the brain resulting in reduced neuronal activity and sedation. Although any benzodiazepine can be used for AWS, chlordiazepoxide, lorazepam, and diazepam are preferred for their relatively long half-lives, reducing the risk of breakthrough symptoms.

When initiating benzodiazepine therapy, consider the specific agent, route, and dosing-strategy (table 3). For severe, acute AWS, including patients with tremor, use intravenous medication initially. As symptoms abate, patients should be transitioned to oral medication as soon as possible. For patients with mild symptoms, it is appropriate to start with oral administration. Both symptom-triggered benzodiazepine therapy and "front-loading" (rapid, deeper sedation followed by tapering) strategies have been described. The approach used is primarily based on the ability of the patient to cope with mild symptoms of AWS. Patients who are less likely to tolerate any hypertension or tachycardia may benefit from more aggressive initial dosing. In patients with severe symptoms, using a front-loading approach is associated with reduced length of stay compared with symptom-based treatment only. When using a front-loading approach, both diazepam and lorazepam may be used; however, care should be taken with lorazepam as longer onset of action may lead to frequent doses and resultant oversedation. A symptom-triggered approach for patients uses benzodiazepines in conjunction with standardized symptom scales such as CIWA or mMINDS. This approach decreases the total amount of medication administered and the duration of treatment when compared with fixed dosing regimens. Fixed dosing strategies, where benzodiazepines are given at regular intervals, regardless of symptoms, are associated with increased medication administration. Oral benzodiazepines are appropriate for mild symptoms using a symptom-based approach, and acceptable results have been obtained using chlordiazepoxide.

### Chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride (chlordiazepoxide HCl) [^c971c2f5]. FDA (2005). Low credibility.

DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

Chlordiazepoxide HCI Capsules are classified by the Drug Enforcement Administration as a Schedule IV controlled substance.

Withdrawal symptoms, similar in character to those noted with barbiturates and alcohol (convulsions, tremor, abdominal and muscle cramps, vomiting and sweating), have occurred following abrupt discontinuance of chlordiazepoxide. The more severe withdrawal symptoms have usually been limited to those patients who had received excessive doses over an extended period of time. Generally milder withdrawal symptoms (e.g., dysphoria and insomnia) have been reported following abrupt discontinuance of benzodiazepines taken continuously at therapeutic levels for several months. Consequently, after extended therapy, abrupt discontinuation should generally be avoided and a gradual dosage tapering schedule followed. Addiction-prone individuals (such as drug addicts or alcoholics) should be under careful surveillance when receiving chlordiazepoxide or other psychotropic agents because of the predisposition of such patients to habituation and dependence.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^b8bf4ea2]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal delirium — benzodiazepine pharmacotherapy and dosing: patients should be sedated to achieve and maintain a light somnolence and benzodiazepines are recommended as first-line agents. When available, medication should be administered intravenously; intermittent IV administration of long- and short-acting medications is acceptable and effective, while continuous IV infusion is considerably more expensive and there is no evidence of therapeutic superiority. Patients receiving repeated high intravenous doses of lorazepam or diazepam should be monitored closely for signs of hyponatremia and metabolic acidosis. When treating alcohol withdrawal delirium, use an established dosing protocol as a guide but individualize dosing; intravenous symptom-triggered or fixed-dose front loading is appropriate, and once light somnolence is achieved and patients are calm and cooperative, or if IV medication is not available, shifting to oral symptom-triggered treatment is recommended. Very large doses of benzodiazepines may be needed to control agitation; clinicians should not hesitate to provide such large doses but should keep in mind the possible risk of over-sedation and respiratory depression, and when large doses are used there is risk of accumulation of long-acting benzodiazepine metabolites, especially in patients with impaired hepatic function or the elderly, who should be monitored closely.

### A prospective, randomized, trial of phenobarbital versus benzodiazepines for acute alcohol withdrawal [^eb915540]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare phenobarbital (PB) versus lorazepam (LZ) in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal in the emergency department (ED) and at 48 hours.

Methods

Prospectively, randomized, consenting patients were assessed using a modified Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA) score and given intravenous PB (mean, 509 mg) or LZ (mean, 4.2 mg). At discharge, LZ patients received chlordiazepoxide (Librium), and PB patients received placebo.

Results

Of 44 patients, 25 received PB, and 19 LZ. Both PB and LZ reduced CIWA scores from baseline to discharge (15.0–5.4 and 16.8–4.2, P < .0001). There were no differences between PB and LZ in baseline CIWA scores (P = 0.3), discharge scores (P = 0.4), ED length of stay (267 versus 256 minutes, P = 0.8), admissions (12% versus 16%, P = 0.8), or 48-hour follow-up CIWA scores (5.8 versus 7.2, P = 0.6).

Conclusion

Phenobarbital and LZ were similarly effective in the treatment of mild/moderate alcohol withdrawal in the ED and at 48 hours.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^2d15f4ca]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal — when symptoms are not controlled on prescribed medication: First, consider increasing the dose. If over‑sedation or inadequate monitoring is a concern, first ensure appropriate level of care. Patients receiving pharmacotherapy should be monitored for signs of response; if patients do not respond as expected, an assessment of nonadherence can be considered. Patients with more severe withdrawal may require larger doses than are typically seen, particularly during early withdrawal, but providing large doses of benzodiazepine can lead to over‑sedation and worse outcomes and these patients should be monitored closely. Second, patients should be reassessed for appropriate level of care and a more intensive level may be needed to monitor and manage major complications. Third, consider switching to a different medication; higher numbers of previous alcohol withdrawal episodes is associated with decreased responsiveness to benzodiazepines, and switching to an alternative medication should be considered. Fourth, if using benzodiazepines, consider adding an adjunct medication; the use of carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid as an adjunct to benzodiazepines is also appropriate for patients experiencing moderate or severe withdrawal.

### Lorazepam versus diazepam in the management of emergency department patients with alcohol withdrawal [^5cb323bd]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Alcohol withdrawal is a common emergency department (ED) presentation. Although benzodiazepines reduce symptoms of withdrawal, there is little ED-based evidence to assist clinicians in selecting appropriate pharmacotherapy. We compare lorazepam with diazepam for the management of alcohol withdrawal to assess 1-week ED and hospital-related outcomes.

Methods

From January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2018, at 3 urban EDs in Vancouver, Canada, we studied patients with a discharge diagnosis of alcohol withdrawal. We excluded individuals presenting with a seizure or an acute concurrent illness. We performed a structured chart review to ascertain demographics, ED treatments, and outcomes. Patients were stratified according to initial management with lorazepam versus diazepam. The primary outcome was hospital admission, and secondary outcomes included in-ED seizures and 1-week return visits for discharged patients.

Results

Of 1,055 patients who presented with acute alcohol withdrawal, 898 were treated with benzodiazepines. Median age was 47 years (interquartile range 37 to 56 years) and 73% were men. Baseline characteristics were similar in the 2 groups. Overall, 69 of 394 patients (17.5%) receiving lorazepam were admitted to the hospital compared with 94 of 504 patients receiving diazepam (18.7%), a difference of 1.2% (95% confidence interval -4.2% to 6.3%). Seven patients (0.7%; 95% confidence interval 0.3% to 1.4%) had an in-ED seizure, but all seizures occurred before receipt of benzodiazepines. Among patients discharged home, 1-week return visits occurred for 78 of 325 (24.0%) who received lorazepam and 94 of 410 (23.2%) who received diazepam, a difference of 0.8% (95% confidence interval -5.3% to 7.1%).

Conclusion

In our sample of ED patients with acute alcohol withdrawal, patients receiving lorazepam had an admission rate similar to that of those receiving diazepam. The few in-ED seizures occurred before medication administration. For discharged patients, the 1-week ED return visit rate of nearly 25% could warrant enhanced follow-up and community support.

Discussion

In this cohort of patients with acute alcohol withdrawal who were discharged from the ED, those who received phenobarbital were less likely to return to the ED within three days of the index visit when compared to those who received benzodiazepines alone. This difference was not present when examining return visits between three and seven days following the index visit. After multivariate adjustment, odds ratios demonstrated no significant differences. While the baseline characteristics were similar among treatment groups, patients who received phenobarbital were much more aggressively treated than patients who received benzodiazepines alone.

Despite multiple studies demonstrating phenobarbital to be an effective medication for acute alcohol withdrawal, few studies have examined the outpatient efficacy of phenobarbital after administration in the ED. In part, this is likely due to difficulty in coordinating follow-up for these patients, who often have unstable housing, comorbid substance use and mental illness, or other socioeconomic barriers precluding them from reliable follow-up. In a prospective, uncontrolled study of patients with alcohol withdrawal, no patient who received a loading dose of phenobarbital in the ED and was subsequently discharged returned within the following week. However, return visits were only queried at the institution of the index visit, and there was no comparison cohort. In a prospective, randomized trial of phenobarbital versus benzodiazepines for acute alcohol withdrawal in the ED, there was no difference in mean CIWA score at 48-h follow-up, but all patients in the benzodiazepine cohort received chlordiazepoxide at discharge, and only 36% of the phenobarbital cohort returned for follow-up.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal — onset and time course: When evaluating risk, clinicians should consider the time elapsed since the patient's cessation of (or reduction in) alcohol use, as signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal typically begin 6–24 hours after cessation. Seizures may begin as early as 8 hours, can continue for up to 48 hours with peak activity occurring around 24 hours, and hallucinations often develop within 12–24 hours and typically resolve within 24–48 hours if other signs indicative of withdrawal delirium do not emerge. The onset of alcohol withdrawal delirium appears between 72 and 96 hours after a patient's last drink and can last as short as a few hours, but usually for 2–3 days.

Alcohol withdrawal medications note that long-acting benzodiazepines are the most commonly used medications for treating alcohol withdrawal, with dosing approaches including front loading, fixed, and symptom-triggered; symptom severity will help determine the most appropriate dosing regimen, which may be adjusted during the course of treatment, and many jails routinely give one or two doses of benzodiazepine prophylactically (under protocols, with patient-specific orders) to patients at risk for alcohol withdrawal as a low-risk, low-cost, effective preventive measure.

ASAM guideline update — rationale and targeted practice issues — in June 2017, the American Society of Addiction Medicine's Quality Improvement Council elected to update alcohol withdrawal management guidelines based on several factors, including that ASAM conducted an Educational Needs Assessment in 2016 and that updated QIC policies recommend that all ASAM guidelines should be updated every five years; ASAM's previous guidelines on alcohol withdrawal management were published in 1997 and 2004, and ASAM identified several practice concerns related to alcohol withdrawal treatment: uncertainty about the CIWA-Ar, excessive caution about the use of benzodiazepines to treat alcohol withdrawal, the use of barbiturates with a much narrower therapeutic window than benzodiazepines, and inconsistent treatment practices in non-specialty settings.

Acamprosate is recommended by various bodies to form a part of management plans when addressing moderate or severe drinking behaviours and reducing relapse. When incorporated into management regimens of alcohol withdrawal, acamprosate may lead to a later first relapse compared with those managed with placebo. Furthermore, demonstrate that acamprosate, when included as a part of detoxification that confers no additional harm or relapse risk compared with placebo. In addition to forming part of relapse prevention plans, based on the information above, various lines of evidence suggest that when initiated early in withdrawal (and in addition to thiamine and benzodiazepines), or ideally prior to the onset of symptoms, acamprosate may offer neuroprotective, and neurorestorative benefits (through improved sleep architecture) with respect to the development of ARBD, conferring longer-lasting protection, manifested by preservation of cognitive function.

Collectively the data we have reviewed demonstrate the impact that hyperglutamatergic tone has on neuronal function during AWS. We highlight the potential role that glutamate receptor antagonism through acamprosate for example, may play in the protection of the brain during AWS and the prevention of signs and symptoms of ARBD, long-term. In order to facilitate this translation to clinical practice, further research is required in clinical populations to investigate the long-term neurocognitive outcomes and recovery of function of patients prescribed acamprosate as part of their alcohol withdrawal management plan. Additionally, a risk-benefit exercise focussed on both the feasibility of prescribing acamprosate in the context of acute illness where renal and hepatic function may be impaired, and where capacity to consent to engage with the treatment alongside the recommended psychological intervention may be suboptimal.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^177cbf46]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal — management of inadequate response and adjuncts: Patients receiving pharmacotherapy should be monitored for signs of response to medication. If response is insufficient, first consider increasing the dose, recognizing that patients with more severe withdrawal may require larger doses and that large doses of benzodiazepine can lead to over-sedation and respiratory depression, especially in patients with liver disease. Second, patients should be reassessed for appropriate level of care because failure to respond may reflect more severe withdrawal with significant risk of major complications, and a more intensive level of care may be needed. Third, consider switching to a different medication since nonresponse may reflect benzodiazepine resistance due to kindling, decreased responsiveness after multiple withdrawal episodes, or withdrawal from another GABAergic agent; in these cases, switching to an alternative medication should be considered. Fourth, if using benzodiazepines, consider adding an adjunct medication, with carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid as options for severe or moderate withdrawal, noting valproic acid should not be used in patients with acute liver impairment or women of childbearing potential. Adjunct phenobarbital can be used in severe withdrawal with close monitoring, phenobarbital and benzodiazepines have additive clinical effects, and alpha2-adrenergic agonists and a beta-adrenergic antagonist can be used with benzodiazepines to manage persistent hypertension or tachycardia.

### Chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide [^7701bac7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute Withdrawal Reactions

The continued use of benzodiazepines, including chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide after continued use, or administration of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening (e.g., seizures) (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE).

Protracted Withdrawal Syndrome

In some cases, benzodiazepine users have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE).

Effects on the Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery

As in the case of other preparations containing CNS-acting drugs, patients receiving chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules should be cautioned about possible combined effects with opioids, alcohol and other CNS depressants. For the same reason, they should be cautioned against hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle.

Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome

Use of benzodiazepines late in pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression, lethargy, hypotonia) and/or withdrawal symptoms (hyperreflexia, irritability, restlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties) in the neonate (see PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy). Monitor neonates exposed to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, which contains a benzodiazepine (chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride), during pregnancy and labor for signs of sedation and monitor neonates exposed to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal; manage these neonates accordingly.

### Prevalence and clinical impact of alcohol withdrawal syndrome in alcohol-associated hepatitis And the potential role of prophylaxis: a multinational, retrospective cohort study [^4bf71da4]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Data related to AWS were captured by clinicians with experience taking care of patients hospitalized with AH. The diagnosis of AWS was made based on the clinical judgment of the primary clinician following the patient and the need for sedative therapy to control AWS symptoms. Medications used for control of AWS were categorized into benzodiazepines and phenobarbital. The route of therapy [oral versus intravenous (IV)] was recorded as well. Patients who received both oral and IV therapy were categorized in the IV group. In Spanish centres, phenobarbital is not utilized for AWS treatment. The amount of benzodiazepine was detailed in diazepam-equivalent format. The duration of AWS therapy was determined by the time a patient required medication to control AWS-related symptoms. AWS severity was categorized into severe and non-severe based on the presence of hallucination, delirium tremens, and/or seizures. The severity of AWS symptoms was quantified by clinical institute withdrawal assessment-alcohol revised (CIWA-Ar) scoring system. We also obtained clinical complications associated with AWS, such as intubation and ICU admission. Participating centers shared similar ICU admission protocols and none of them considered having alcohol use disorder or AH as a contraindication for ICU admission. Of note, the clinical protocols for the management of AWS differed between US and Spanish centres. In Spain, AWS prophylaxis is universally administered in all patients with a history of recent excessive alcohol use, including all patients admitted with AH. As a standard of care protocol, AWS prophylaxis is given at the time of admission to all patients with AH. Prophylaxis is largely based on clomethiazole. Clomethiazole is a thiamine derivative with a GABA agonist effect commonly used for the treatment of AWS symptoms. It has been shown clomethiazole efficacy to control AWS symptoms is not inferior to chlordiazepoxide. Use of clomethiazole as a prophylaxis agent in patients at risk for AWS is common in several European countries such as Germany or Spain. In the US, prophylaxis is rarely used and patients do not receive any pharmacologic therapy until AWS symptoms start. To conduct a comparison, cases were defined as patients diagnosed with AH by an attending physician and requiring sedative therapy to control symptoms of AWS. As controls, we included all patients with AH who did not develop AWS during the index episode. The primary outcome of the study was 28-day, 90-day, and 180-day mortality.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^110558f3]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal delirium — benzodiazepine management and antipsychotic adjuncts: Benzodiazepines are the most commonly used medications to treat patients with delirium because of the favorable therapeutic window, and intermittent IV administration of a long-acting medication or continuous IV infusion of short-acting medication are both effective treatments for alcohol withdrawal delirium. Patients treated with repeated high doses of lorazepam or diazepam require close monitoring due to the rapid onset of action and the risk of accumulation of long-acting benzodiazepine metabolites, which is especially common in patients with impaired hepatic function or among the elderly. If a patient has been delirious longer than 72 hours and has been receiving high doses of benzodiazepines (in the thousands of milligrams), the patient may have developed benzodiazepine-induced delirium, and clinicians should consider reducing the benzodiazepine dose and adding an antipsychotic agent to control agitation and/or confusion. Even if patients are at reduced risk of seizure, antipsychotics should not be used as monotherapy because they lower the seizure threshold; second generation atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone and quetiapine, are preferred, haloperidol, a first generation antipsychotic, is also an appropriate agent, and antipsychotics may also be used in conjunction with benzodiazepines to control severe agitation and hallucinations associated with early alcohol withdrawal delirium.
