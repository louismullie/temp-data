## Question

What complications may arise from transtympanic steroid injections?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what complications may arise from transtympanic (intratympanic) steroid injections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clearly defining the intervention and scope. Then, I should review the quality of evidence and how adverse events were ascertained. Next, I will enumerate procedural and drug-related complications with rates and clinical course. After that, I should assess systemic exposure risks. Finally, I will stratify risk factors, reconcile conflicting data, and close with pragmatic counseling and mitigation strategies.

> Let me first confirm the intervention and clinical context. Intratympanic corticosteroids are delivered through the tympanic membrane into the middle ear to treat inner ear disorders — most commonly idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) and Ménière's disease — and are recommended or considered in guidelines as salvage therapy for incomplete SSNHL recovery and as a vertigo-control option in refractory Ménière's disease, which frames where most safety data come from [^1166JvBr] [^11571GAC] [^1148YKX6].

> Hold on, I should verify how robust the adverse event evidence is before quoting numbers. The Cochrane reviews emphasize that adverse event reporting is incomplete, often pooled across active and placebo intratympanic injections, and overall certainty is low to very low; thus, precision around rates is limited and procedure-related harms can be difficult to separate from steroid-specific effects [^11575oj3] [^115UC2oc] [^116FwG1o] [^114Yd8hg].

> I will now examine the most frequent complication: tympanic membrane (TM) perforation. Wait, let me verify exact ranges. Across SSNHL trials, persistent TM perforation rates after intratympanic injections range from 0% to about 5.5%, with Cochrane summaries commonly reporting 0–4.2% when counting both corticosteroid and placebo injections, indicating low absolute risk but very low certainty of evidence [^115UC2oc] [^11575oj3]. A 192-patient series found 1.6% persistent perforations ≥ 90 days, typically after multiple injections, with one tympanoplasty required, and median healing around 18 days, which aligns with mostly self-limited courses [^114r3D9A]. Next, I should review technique-related modifiers: a systematic review suggested higher perforation with ventilation tubes (VT) versus direct transtympanic tympanocentesis (7.3% vs 1.0%, P < .001) [^1161nyAS]. But wait, I should double-check consistency — another meta-analysis reported no significant difference between ty‑tube and transtympanic approaches (~1.1% vs ~1.1%), so I need to present this as conflicting and method-dependent, not definitive [^112v7BJQ]. Finally, I need to ensure risk in impaired healing states is addressed — irradiated ears had dramatic TM breakdown in case series and slower closure in observational data, so prior head/neck radiation and repeated injections appear to increase risk [^113yLZoc] [^114r3D9A].

> Next, I should review vestibular symptoms at injection. Transient vertigo/dizziness at the time of injection is variably reported; Cochrane summaries for SSNHL and salvage settings range roughly from 0% up to 33%, reflecting per-injection, short-lived events, with very low certainty due to heterogeneity and incomplete reporting [^11575oj3] [^115UC2oc]. Let me consider clinical course — these episodes typically resolve without intervention and are temporally linked to the procedure rather than delayed toxicity, which is consistent with procedural vestibular stimulation rather than steroid pharmacodynamics [^11575oj3].

> I need to check for otalgia and other minor local effects. Ear pain during or immediately after injection is commonly described but infrequently quantified in trials; it is recognized in SSNHL reviews as an injection-related adverse event with uncertain frequency [^115UC2oc]. Hmm, wait a minute, what about other local, self-limited symptoms? Nausea during/after injection has been reported in open-label series, typically transient, and dysgeusia has been noted in pediatric summaries of IT steroid risks, albeit with sparse quantification [^115hsH7z] [^111MnBPB].

> Let me verify conductive hearing effects from the procedure itself. Filling the middle ear with fluid can cause a transient, volume-dependent conductive hearing loss; a first‑in‑human intratympanic study explicitly evaluated this and found volume-dependent conductive changes, supporting counseling about short-lived muffling after injections [^116ybmb1].

> I should confirm rare but serious complications. Iatrogenic perilymphatic fistula has been documented as a rare, traumatic complication from overly deep needle penetration during intratympanic steroid injection; this is case-report level evidence and underscores careful technique near the posterior-inferior quadrant without advancing beyond the middle ear space [^1114ZFxd]. Additionally, ear discharge/infection is a theoretical and procedural risk captured in Ménière's Cochrane safety discussions, but precise rates remain uncertain given placebo injections also carry this risk [^114Yd8hg].

> Now, systemic considerations. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — local delivery aims to limit systemic exposure, but I should confirm pharmacokinetics. Human studies show very limited plasma exposure for locally delivered agents and high inner-ear/perilymph levels after intratympanic steroids, consistent with targeted delivery and reduced systemic risk, though some systemic absorption is possible [^116egAu2] [^115bnhPL] [^112T1PiU]. I should also note that topically applied steroids can be absorbed enough to cause systemic effects in principle, and first‑in‑human otic work cites theoretical risks (hypertension, behavioral changes, hyperglycemia), but these appear uncommon with limited intratympanic dosing in clinical series and CI perioperative steroid reviews, where steroid‑related systemic AEs were rarely reported [^113nr8zP] [^116ybmb1] [^115yJnuj].

> Next, I should review patient and procedural risk modifiers. Prior head and neck irradiation is a consistent red flag for impaired TM healing with case reports of near-total membrane breakdown and observational data suggesting prolonged closure times, so I need to ensure heightened caution there [^113yLZoc] [^114r3D9A]. Multiple injections likely increase perforation risk via cumulative membrane trauma, and technique choice may matter — but wait, as I mentioned earlier, the literature conflicts on whether ventilation tubes increase residual perforation risk compared to direct tympanocentesis, so this must be individualized and discussed with patients given low-certainty and discordant meta-analyses [^1161nyAS] [^112v7BJQ]. Diabetes, smoking, and other factors were explored but not clearly associated with delayed healing in the 2016 series, underscoring the limited power of available datasets [^114r3D9A].

> Let me consider pragmatic counseling and mitigation. I should confirm that patients are counseled on: small but real risk of persistent TM perforation that usually heals but can rarely require repair; transient vertigo and otalgia during injection; temporary muffled hearing from middle ear fill; rare infection; and extremely rare inner ear trauma if technique is improper [^11575oj3] [^115UC2oc] [^114Yd8hg] [^116ybmb1] [^1114ZFxd]. Technique pearls include using the posterior‑inferior quadrant, avoiding deep advancement, minimizing injected volume to reduce transient conductive effects, and spacing or limiting injections when feasible — particularly in previously irradiated ears or those with impaired healing — while aligning use with guideline-based indications such as SSNHL salvage [^116ybmb1] [^1166JvBr].

> But wait, what if the patient is being offered intratympanic steroids for Ménière's disease — does safety differ? Safety profiles in Ménière's RCTs and OTO‑104 programs generally appeared acceptable with low rates of serious AEs, though adverse event reporting varied and selective reporting was noted; as above, perforation and injection-related symptoms remain the key issues to discuss given the procedure itself carries risk even with placebo injections [^1148YKX6] [^114Yd8hg] [^11582qX1] [^11485MUN] [^113amZ2y].

> In summary, I should double-check that my bottom line matches the evidence: the most common complications of intratympanic steroid injections are minor and self-limited — transient vertigo/dizziness and otalgia — while persistent TM perforation occurs in roughly 0–5% across heterogeneous studies, often less than 2% in larger series, and may rarely need repair; serious inner ear injury is exceptional and largely preventable with proper technique. Systemic steroid effects are uncommon due to limited plasma exposure, but not impossible, and counseling should reflect this. Elevated risk is plausible with multiple injections and prior irradiation, and the literature conflicts on whether delivery via ventilation tubes meaningfully alters perforation risk, warranting individualized discussion and meticulous technique [^11575oj3] [^115UC2oc] [^114r3D9A] [^1114ZFxd] [^116egAu2] [^115bnhPL] [^113nr8zP] [^1161nyAS] [^112v7BJQ] [^113yLZoc].

---

Transtympanic steroid injections are generally safe, but clinicians should counsel patients about **persistent tympanic membrane perforation** (about 1–2%) [^114r3D9A] and **transient vertigo or dizziness** (6–33%) [^11575oj3] as the most common complications. Other risks include **otitis media**, **otalgia**, **tinnitus**, and rare events such as perilymphatic fistula [^1114ZFxd] or tympanic membrane breakdown, especially in irradiated ears [^113yLZoc]. Uncommon but possible **systemic steroid effects** can occur with repeated injections [^113nr8zP] [^notfound]. Most complications are **minor and self-limited**, but persistent perforation may require surgical repair [^114r3D9A]; risk is higher with multiple injections, myringotomy [^1161nyAS], or prior radiation [^113yLZoc].

---

## Tympanic membrane perforation

Persistent tympanic membrane perforation is a **well-documented complication** of transtympanic steroid injections [^1161nyAS]. The incidence — defined as perforation lasting ≥ 90 days — is approximately 1.6% [^114r3D9A]. Risk factors include multiple injections, myringotomy, and prior head and neck irradiation [^113yLZoc]. Persistent perforations may require surgical repair, such as tympanoplasty [^114r3D9A].

---

## Vertigo and dizziness

Transient **vertigo or dizziness** is common, occurring in approximately 6.7% to 33% of patients [^11575oj3] [^114Yd8hg]. Symptoms are typically brief and self-limited, resolving within minutes to hours after the injection.

---

## Otitis media and infection

Otitis media (middle ear infection) is a **potential complication**, although the incidence is relatively low [^114Yd8hg]. In a large retrospective series, it occurred in approximately 1.2% of patients. Proper aseptic technique and patient selection are essential to minimize this risk.

---

## Otalgia (ear pain)

Ear pain or discomfort during or after injection is a **common, minor complication** [^115UC2oc]. Incidence varies widely, but symptoms are generally transient and self-limited.

---

## Tinnitus

Tinnitus **may occur or temporarily worsen** after the injection. It is typically transient and resolves spontaneously [^114Yd8hg].

---

## Rare complications

Several **rare but serious complications** have been reported:

- **Perilymphatic fistula**: A rare complication resulting from trauma during injection, potentially causing persistent vertigo and hearing loss [^1114ZFxd].

- **Tympanic membrane breakdown**: Particularly in patients with prior irradiation, total or near-total breakdown of the tympanic membrane has been reported [^113yLZoc].

- **Systemic steroid effects**: Although rare, systemic absorption of steroids can occur, potentially causing hyperglycemia, hypertension, or immunosuppression, particularly with repeated injections [^113nr8zP] [^115bnhPL].

---

## Factors influencing complication rates

Several factors influence **complication rates and severity**:

- **Injection technique**: Myringotomy or ventilation tube placement [^1161nyAS] increases the risk of persistent perforation compared to simple needle injection [^114r3D9A].

- **Number of injections**: Multiple injections increase the risk of persistent perforation and other complications [^114r3D9A].

- **Patient-specific factors**: Prior head and neck irradiation, diabetes mellitus, and smoking may increase the risk of complications [^114r3D9A] [^113yLZoc].

---

## Management of complications

Most complications are **minor and self-limited**, requiring only observation and symptomatic treatment. Persistent tympanic membrane perforations may require surgical repair (tympanoplasty) [^114r3D9A]. Infections should be treated with appropriate antibiotics, and rare complications such as perilymphatic fistula may require surgical intervention [^1114ZFxd].

Transtympanic steroid injections are generally safe, but clinicians should counsel patients about **persistent tympanic membrane perforation** (about 1–2%) [^114r3D9A] and **transient vertigo or dizziness** (6–33%) [^11575oj3] as the most common complications [^114Yd8hg]. Other risks include otitis media, otalgia, tinnitus, and rare events such as perilymphatic fistula [^1114ZFxd] or tympanic membrane breakdown, especially in irradiated ears [^113yLZoc]. Systemic steroid effects are uncommon but possible with repeated injections [^113nr8zP] [^116Sqw6J]. Most complications are minor and self-limited, but persistent perforation may require surgical repair; risk is higher with multiple injections, myringotomy [^1161nyAS], or prior radiation [^114r3D9A] [^113yLZoc].

### Rate of tympanic membrane perforation after intratympanic steroid injection [^114r3D9A]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2016). Low credibility.

To determine the rate of persistent tympanic membrane perforation after intratympanic steroid injection and identify associated comorbid conditions and risk factors for prolonged perforation closure, clinical data were gathered from patients who underwent intratympanic steroid injection for sudden sensorineural hearing loss or Ménière's disease. Primary outcomes included the rate of persistent tympanic membrane perforation, defined as a perforation persisting at least 90 days after the last injection, and the time to perforation healing. Researchers analyzed age, sex, number of injections, smoking status, diabetes mellitus, previous head and neck irradiation, and oral steroid use as potential predictors of persistent perforation.

One hundred ninety-two patients were included in the study. Three patients (1.6%) experienced persistent tympanic membrane perforations, all of whom had received multiple injections. One patient required tympanoplasty to repair the persistent perforation. The median time to perforation healing was 18 days. No statistically significant variable was associated with time to perforation healing. However, patients with a prior history of head and neck radiation had an average healing time of 36.5 days, compared to 17.5 days for those without prior radiation exposure, approaching statistical significance (p = 0.078).

The rate of persistent tympanic membrane perforation following intratympanic steroid injection is low.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^11575oj3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

For this comparison, five studies provided information about adverse events. There were insufficient data for meta-analysis. In all studies, reporting was incomplete for one or more adverse event outcomes either because a rate was not provided for both randomized groups or because it was unclear in which group (or groups) events were observed.

- **Persistent tympanic membrane perforation**: Five studies reported a rate of tympanic membrane perforation of between 0% (0/19) and 4.2% (1/24) for those who received an intratympanic injection. This includes participants who received placebo intratympanic injection. We concluded that the evidence is very uncertain regarding the risk of tympanic membrane perforation for those who received intratympanic injection (either corticosteroid or placebo) as secondary treatment (185 participants; 5 studies; very low-certainty evidence).

- **Vertigo/dizziness at the time of intratympanic injection**: Three studies reported a rate of vertigo/dizziness of between 6.7% (1/15) and 33% (number not reported) for those who received an intratympanic injection. This includes participants who received placebo intratympanic injection. We concluded that the evidence is very uncertain regarding the risk of vertigo/dizziness at the time of intratympanic injection (either corticosteroid or placebo) as secondary treatment (118 participants; 3 studies; very low-certainty evidence).

Intratympanic (IT) steroid therapy is a mainstay treatment for sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) for both initial therapy and salvage therapy. We report a rare case of iatrogenic perilymphatic fistula that resulted from trauma during an IT steroid injection for SSNHL. We discuss the diagnosis and treatment in the case and compare it with previous reports from the literature.

Intratympanic corticosteroids versus no treatment or versus placebo as secondary therapy

Seven studies were included in this comparison. Five studies compared the efficacy of secondary intratympanic corticosteroid treatment with no therapy, and two studies compared intratympanic corticosteroids with intratympanic placebo. Intratympanic therapy may result in a small improvement in the change in hearing threshold (low-certainty evidence), although the mean difference was just below the threshold for clinical relevance (PTA change of -9.07 dB).

In addition, intratympanic corticosteroids may result in a much higher proportion of patients achieving an improvement in their hearing, with an absolute effect of 315 more patients per 1000 experiencing improved hearing. There is a small, but clinically important, effect on the final hearing threshold (a decrease of 11.09 dB HL, low-certainty). The clinically relevant effects persisted after sensitivity analysis.

Adverse effects were reported only for those who received intratympanic corticosteroids, making it impossible to compare the intervention to placebo or no treatment. Persistent tympanic membrane perforation, vertigo/dizziness during injection, and ear pain during injection were noted in the intervention group, but the frequency of these effects remains uncertain.

The results indicate that there may be a small improvement in hearing with the use of intratympanic corticosteroids, but it is unclear whether this would be a noticeable or important difference.

### Intratympanic steroid treatment in idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss: a control study [^117F3oEH]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Although systemic steroids appear to be the most effective and widely accepted treatment for sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSHL) today, a significant number of patients do not respond to steroid treatment, or they cannot receive steroids for medical reasons. Intratympanic (IT) administration of steroids is an alternative or additional method of management without the side effects of intravenous steroids. The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness and safety of IT administration of steroids in patients who had not responded to intravenous treatment and to compare treatment efficacy with controls.

- **Study design and setting**: Our study consisted of 37 patients with SSHL who, at the end of 10 days of therapy with intravenous steroids as a first-line treatment, had pure-tone 4-frequency (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz) average (PTA) worse than 30 dB or worse than 10 dB from the contralateral ear (defined as failed intravenous treatment). They were randomized into two groups: treatment and control. The 19 patients in the treatment group received approximately 0.5 mL sterile aqueous suspension of methylprednisolone acetate in a concentration of 80 mg/2 mL by direct injection. The procedure was carried out four times within a 15-day period. An audiogram was performed before each injection and approximately 1.5 months after the last session.

- **Results**: All patients tolerated the procedure well. No perforation or infection was noticed in any of the patients at their last visit. Regarding the 19 patients who received intratympanic treatment, the results indicated…

Measures of treatment effect

We summarized the effects of dichotomous outcomes, such as the proportion of patients with hearing improvement measured by pure tone audiometry, as risk ratios (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). For the key dichotomous outcomes presented in the summary of findings tables, we also expressed the results as absolute numbers, indicating the assumed risk in the comparator group and the corresponding risk associated with the experimental intervention based on its pooled relative effect and 95% CI.

For outcomes measured on a continuous scale, such as the change in PTA and final PTA, we calculated the mean difference (MD) with a 95% CI. In the meta-analysis, the primary outcome's summary statistic was the mean difference (MD) of the mean change in decibels (dB) in hearing threshold between two groups in each study, measured by pure tone audiometry, from baseline to post-therapy. The secondary outcome, 'final hearing threshold', was summarized by the mean difference (MD) of the mean final hearing threshold in dB HL (post-therapy) between two groups in each study, also measured by pure tone audiometry. We used RevMan 5 to compute the measures of treatment effect for each individual study (RevMan 2020).

For hearing outcomes measured on a continuous scale, such as the change in PTA and final PTA, we assumed a difference of 10 dB to be a clinically relevant effect. This decision was based on the test-retest reliability of pure tone audiometric measurements and established minimal criteria for improvement in individual patients (Chandrasekhar 2019; Gurgel 2012; Stachler).

### Evaluation of levels of triamcinolone acetonide in human perilymph and plasma after intratympanic application in patients receiving cochlear implants: A randomized clinical trial [^116Sqw6J]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Statistical analysis was performed with continuous variables presented as median values with ranges, from minimum to maximum. The nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test was utilized to compare TAC levels in perilymph and plasma. For group comparisons of TAC levels in perilymph, analysis of variance (ANOVA) models were employed:

- **One-factorial ANOVA design**: Initially, groups 1 to 4 were compared using this design, with the Tukey-Kramer method applied for multiplicity-adjusted pairwise group comparisons.

- **Two 1-factorial ANOVA models**: These models tested for overall dose (10 mg/mL vs. 40 mg/mL) and overall time point effects (1 hour vs. 24 hours).

- **Two-factorial ANOVA model**: This included the factors of dose and the time between application and sampling, along with an interaction term to examine dose-dependent time effects and time-dependent dose effects.

Due to the skew distribution of TAC levels in perilymph, log10-transformed values were used as dependent variables for all ANOVA and regression models. To quantify the effects on TAC levels, geometric mean ratios (GMRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined by retransforming mean differences from the logarithmic scale to the original scale. To compare TAC levels in patients with an aerated middle ear to those with mucosal disease, the 2-sample t-test was used for perilymph (log10 transformed) and the exact Wilcoxon rank sum test for plasma. The analysis was conducted using SAS statistical software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute), and a two-sided P value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### Intratympanic administration of OTO-313 reduces tinnitus in patients with moderate to severe, persistent tinnitus: A phase 1/2 study [^116egAu2]. Otology & Neurotology (2021). High credibility.

A single intratympanic injection of OTO-313 in the clinical study was well-tolerated at both dose levels, with a low incidence of adverse events. All plasma samples at all timepoints had gacyclidine concentrations below the limit of quantitation of the bioanalytical assay, demonstrating limited exposure following intratympanic administration of OTO-313. Intratympanic administration of steroids and other medications is becoming more commonplace in the treatment of inner ear disorders because it not only provides more sufficient drug concentrations to the inner ear compared with systemic dosing, but also yields limited plasma exposure, consequently reducing the risk of systemic side effects.

Interestingly, the maximal effect of OTO-313 occurred at 8 weeks post-dose, suggesting that improvements in tinnitus and the functional effects of tinnitus may not be immediate after an OTO-313 injection. This delayed response may be due to the time required for NMDA receptor blockade to reverse the tinnitus-related aberrant neuronal activity and to subsequently impact tinnitus perception and the functional effects of tinnitus (e.g. cognition, sleep, emotions), which may themselves take time to ameliorate. Future studies will extend the observation period to evaluate this and the durability of the treatment effect further.

Limitations of this study include the small sample size and limited statistical comparisons, which are common for early-stage clinical studies and will be addressed by evaluating a larger population in future studies. In addition, there was an imbalance between groups that needs further investigation.

### Intratympanic steroid treatments rescued recurrent hearing loss following COVID-19 vaccination and detection of an intralabyrinthine schwannoma [^117GB1dS]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Suspecting an inflammatory response against the labyrinthine schwannoma following the two-dose vaccination, an intratympanic steroid injection of dexamethasone (10 mg/mL) was administered once on day 103 by the ENT doctor to completely fill the left middle ear. Three days after the first local steroid treatment (day 106), the patient reported the disappearance of ringing and buzzing in the left ear. The hearing test revealed an average improvement of 20 dB in the left ear hearing on day 111 (figure 1B–E, Audiogram 5). The patient then received a second intratympanic injection of 10 mg/mL dexamethasone to the left middle ear on day 117, resulting in significant hearing recovery and a word recognition score returning to normal, as shown by a hearing test on day 138 (figure 1B–E, Audiogram 6).

### Study of steroid effects on graft and inner ear outcomes in tympanoplasty: Randomized controlled trial [^111tpDmX]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2018). High credibility.

More studies are needed to investigate the side effects of steroids in tympanoplasty, owing to the paucity of such studies in the literature. This randomized, controlled clinical trial included 59 patients with chronic otitis media who underwent tympanoplasty and were randomized after surgery to a systemic steroid or no steroid treatment. Patients were randomized into two groups. Perforation size, graft outcome, and complications such as tinnitus and hearing loss were compared between the two groups. Postsurgical steroid injection had no effect on graft outcome (p = 0.927) or tinnitus (p = 0.478). Tympanic membrane perforation (p = 0.92), plaque size (p = 0.94), bleeding amount (p = 0.38), and mucosal status (p = 0.96) during surgery had no effect on graft outcome after the tympanoplasty. In conclusion, administration of steroids after tympanoplasty failed to improve outcomes and may put the patient at risk of side effects.

### Intratympanic steroid treatments may improve hearing via ion homeostasis alterations and not immune suppression [^113hc4BH]. Otology & Neurotology (2015). Low credibility.

The inner ear (IE) endothelium is capable of responding to therapeutic steroids by altering the local expression of cytokine and ion homeostasis genes that impact inflammation and fluid regulation.

- **Background**: Glucocorticoids are often given transtympanically for hearing disorders because of their anti-inflammatory effects; however, their direct impact on IE ion homeostasis and cytokine gene expression has not been studied.

- **Methods**: The middle ears of Balb/c mice were transtympanically injected with 5 μL of phosphate-buffered saline, prednisolone (Pred), or dexamethasone (Dex). Untreated mice served as controls. Mice were euthanized at 6, 24, and 72 hours; the cochleas were harvested; and total RNA was isolated from the IE tissues. The expression of eight cytokine genes and 24 ion homeostasis genes was analyzed using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.

- **Results**: Phosphate-buffered saline caused upregulation of inflammatory cytokine genes that peaked at 6 hours. Surprisingly, Pred and Dex also caused upregulation of most cytokine genes. Interestingly, ion homeostasis genes were predominantly upregulated with Dex and Pred, with Pred having a larger effect.

- **Conclusion**: In the murine model, intratympanic steroids caused an initial upregulation of inflammatory cytokine genes in the IE and predominant upregulation of ion homeostasis genes. These findings suggest that glucocorticoids do not suppress IE inflammation but rather cause an initial inflammatory response in the IE. Thus, inflammatory gene suppression is not a likely mechanism.

### Assessment of safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and volume-dependent conductive hearing loss in healthy volunteers: First-in-human, open-label, placebo-controlled study of a single intratympanic injection of AC102 [^116ybmb1]. Otology & Neurotology (2025). Low credibility.

Despite numerous efforts, at the time of writing, no approved pharmacotherapies are available for the treatment of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL). The treatment of hearing loss with systemic or intratympanic glucocorticoid steroids, which have anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties, is recommended in many countries and is regarded as the standard of care. However, there is a lack of clear evidence for the significant beneficial effects of glucocorticoids in treating SSNHL. In addition, such treatment may not be justified due to the possible side effects, including hypertension, behavioral disturbances, and diabetes mellitus. Although the root cause of SSNHL is often unknown, it likely affects the hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) of the auditory nerve. Importantly, neither the hair cells nor the SGNs can be replaced once lost. Therefore, it is crucial to have an immediate and target-specific intervention to prevent any further damage to these cells and to prevent acute hearing loss from becoming permanent.

Getting drugs or medication into the inner ear can be a challenging task due to the presence of the blood-labyrinth barrier that protects the inner ear and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). Therefore, a systemically administered medication is less likely to reach these target tissues at levels sufficient to have a therapeutic effect without the risk of systemic adverse reactions. Different approaches have been explored to target the inner ear effectively, including local delivery via intratympanic injection and systemic administration.

The objective of this study is to investigate the adjuvant effect and safety of intratympanic steroid for the treatment of Bell's palsy.

- **Study design**: This was a prospective, investigator-blinded, randomized study conducted at a tertiary referral center.

- **Patients**: Patients who received treatment for Bell's palsy from December 2007 to March 2011 were randomly divided into two groups. The control group (n = 17) was treated with a systemic steroid plus an antiviral agent, while the intratympanic steroid injection group (IT group, n = 14) received intratympanic steroid injection combined with medications. Facial functions were evaluated regularly up to 6 months.

- **Intervention**: Intratympanic steroid injection was administered.

- **Main outcome measures**: Facial nerve functions at initial presentation and follow-up were evaluated using the House-Brackmann (H-B) system. The primary outcome was the complete recovery rate at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included improvement of H-B grade within 3 weeks, time to first improvement in facial function, and cumulative recovery rate. Additionally, a subgroup analysis of patients with an H-B grade higher than IV was performed.

- **Results**: The complete recovery rate did not differ between groups. The time to first improvement was shorter in the IT group (p = 0.043). The IT group also had a better cumulative recovery rate (p = 0.041) and showed significant improvement in H-B grade within 3 weeks compared to the control group (p = 0.045). In cases of severe facial palsy, the complete recovery rates for the IT group and control group were 80% and 50%, respectively (p = 0.16), with the IT group showing significant facial improvement within 3 weeks (p = 0.025). No major adverse effects were noted.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for Ménière's disease [^114RW8dQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Ménière's disease is a condition that causes episodes of vertigo associated with hearing loss and tinnitus. Corticosteroids are sometimes administered directly into the middle ear to treat this condition through the tympanic membrane. The underlying cause of Ménière's disease is unknown, as is the way in which this treatment may work. The efficacy of this intervention in preventing vertigo attacks and their associated symptoms is currently unclear.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of intratympanic corticosteroids versus placebo or no treatment in people with Ménière's disease.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register, Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 14 September 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in adults with a diagnosis of Ménière's disease comparing intratympanic corticosteroids with either placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies with follow-up of less than three months or with a cross-over design unless data from the first phase of the study could be identified.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were improvement in vertigo (assessed as a dichotomous outcome - improved or not improved), change in vertigo (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale), and serious outcomes.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for Ménière's disease [^11538vqW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Ménière's disease is a condition causing recurring episodes of vertigo, accompanied by hearing loss and tinnitus. Corticosteroids are sometimes administered directly into the middle ear through the tympanic membrane to treat this condition. The underlying cause of Ménière's disease, as well as the mechanism by which this treatment may work, remains unknown. The efficacy of intratympanic corticosteroids in preventing vertigo attacks and their associated symptoms is currently unclear.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the benefits and harms of intratympanic corticosteroids compared to placebo or no treatment in individuals with Ménière's disease.

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist conducted a comprehensive search of the Cochrane ENT Register, Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP, and additional sources for both published and unpublished trials. The search was completed on 14 September 2022.

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs involving adults with a diagnosis of Ménière's disease, comparing intratympanic corticosteroids with placebo or no treatment, were included. Studies with follow-up durations of less than three months or with a cross-over design were excluded, unless data from the first phase of the study could be identified.

Standard Cochrane methods were utilized for data collection and analysis. The primary outcomes assessed were:

- **Improvement in vertigo**: Evaluated as a dichotomous outcome, either improved or not improved.
- **Change in vertigo**: Assessed as a continuous outcome, using a score on a numerical scale.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for Ménière's disease [^117XMxoM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

To evaluate the benefits and harms of intratympanic corticosteroids versus placebo or no treatment in people with Ménière's disease, a systematic review of existing studies was conducted. This analysis sought to provide a comprehensive assessment to guide clinical decision-making for managing this condition, ensuring a clear understanding of potential outcomes for patients undergoing such treatment.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^115UC2oc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

- **Minor and serious adverse events**: For this comparison, eight studies provided information pertaining to adverse events (Ahn 2008; Arastou 2013; Arslan 2011; Battaglia 2008; Choi 2011; Gundogan 2013; Koltsidopoulos 2013; Tsounis 2018). In three studies, reporting was incomplete for one or more adverse event outcomes, because it was unclear in which group (or groups) events were observed (Arastou 2013; Arslan 2011; Tsounis 2018). There were insufficient data for meta-analysis.

- **Persistent tympanic membrane perforation**: Five studies reported a rate of perforation between 0% (0/85) and 5.5% (2/36) for those who received an intratympanic injection (Ahn 2008; Arastou 2013; Arslan 2011; Choi 2011; Gundogan 2013). We concluded that the evidence is very uncertain regarding the risk of tympanic membrane perforation for those who received intratympanic corticosteroid combined with systemic corticosteroid as primary treatment (474 participants; 5 studies; very low-certainty evidence).

- **Vertigo/dizziness at the time of injection**: Four studies reported a rate between 0% (0/60) and 8.1% (3/37) for those who received an intratympanic injection (Ahn 2008; Choi 2011; Gundogan 2013; Tsounis 2018). Note that in one study, two groups received intratympanic injection: one group received intratympanic corticosteroid, and the other received intratympanic and systemic corticosteroid (Tsounis 2018). We concluded that the evidence is very uncertain regarding the risk of vertigo/dizziness at the time of intratympanic injection for those who received intratympanic corticosteroid as prima.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for Ménière's disease [^1148YKX6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

A variety of different interventions have been proposed to treat people with Ménière's disease. These include dietary or lifestyle changes, oral treatments, treatments administered by injection into the ear (intratympanic), and surgical treatments. This review focuses on the use of intratympanic corticosteroids to treat the symptoms of Ménière's disease.

Corticosteroids can be administered into the middle ear through the tympanic membrane. They are often administered via injection but can also be delivered as drops through a ventilation tube (with or without a wick). Treatment regimens vary from a one-off injection to a short course (two to three injections) and may need to be repeated if symptoms recur. Different types of corticosteroids may be used, including methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, or hydrocortisone.

At present, there is no agreement on which is the ideal treatment for people with Ménière's disease; consequently, there is no 'gold standard' treatment with which to compare these medications.

The underlying cause of Ménière's disease is poorly understood, as are the ways in which the interventions may work. The specific action of steroids in the inner ear is unclear, but may include an influence on water homeostasis, ion channels, and blood flow to the inner ear. The rationale for intratympanic delivery is that it enables steroids to reach the target organ at a high dose, whilst avoiding complications from systemic administration.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^115i3qdD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Hearing recovery in patients with ISSNHL mostly occurs early, within a few days of onset, but can also occur after several weeks. It has been observed that the time course of hearing recovery can extend to six months. However, most of the hearing improvement will take place during the first weeks after onset. To estimate the treatment effect of an intervention for ISSNHL, it is desirable that the final outcome assessment is conducted after several weeks of follow-up. Short evaluation periods may risk underestimation of treatment effects. After the recovery period, the hearing thresholds reached can be assumed to be stable in most patients. A large randomized controlled trial assessed the primary outcome 30 days after onset with an initial assessment after 10 days and a follow-up at six months.

- **Why it is important to do this review**: There is still uncertainty as to 1) whether intratympanic corticosteroids are better than placebo or no treatment, 2) whether intratympanic administration of corticosteroids alone or in combination with systemic application of steroids will lead to better results than systemic drug administration alone, 3) if so, which treatment protocol will lead to the best outcome, and 4) what risks of adverse events are associated with this approach in inner ear therapy. This Cochrane Review was therefore warranted to assess the benefits and harms of intratympanic corticosteroids treatment for ISSNHL.

### Tympanic membrane perforation after intratympanic steroid injection: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1161nyAS]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

We investigated the incidence of tympanic membrane (TM) perforations induced after intratympanic steroid injection (ITSI) in patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) through a systematic review and meta-analysis.

- **Data sources**: PubMed, Embase, and MEDLINE.

- **Review methods**: Primary database searches were performed, and 1901 records were identified. After the removal of 1802 articles through abstract screening, the remaining 99 full-text journals were assessed for eligibility to be included in the study. Fifty-eight studies that used either ventilation tubing (VT) or tympanocentesis (TC) for ITSI were selected for analysis. The subjects were divided into VT and TC groups. The rate of TM perforation after ITSI in the two groups, sites of ITSI, needle gauge, and influence on residual hearing were investigated.

- **Results**: The cohorts comprised patients who underwent VT (n = 257, 9.6%) and TC (n = 2415, 90.4%). The proportion of TM perforation after ITSI in each group was 0.073 (95% CI, 0.0469–0.1113) and 0.010 (95% CI, 0.0045–0.0215), respectively, suggesting that the VT group showed a significantly higher TM perforation rate than the TC group (P < .001). In the subgroup analyses, there was no significant difference in the odds ratio for the rate of TM perforation according to the injection site and needle gauge for TC. The proportion of surgical repair showed no significant difference between the two groups.

- **Conclusion**: ITSI via VT may have a significantly higher risk of TM perforation than ITSI via TC, although both methods present relatively small overall risks.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^11571GAC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) is common and defined as a sudden decrease in sensorineural hearing sensitivity of unknown etiology. Systemic corticosteroids are widely used; however, their value remains unclear. Intratympanic injections of corticosteroids have become increasingly common in the treatment of ISSNHL.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of intratympanic corticosteroids in people with ISSNHL.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Trials Register; CENTRAL (2021, Issue 9); PubMed; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials (search date: 23 September 2021).

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving people with ISSNHL and follow-up of over a week. Intratympanic corticosteroids were given as primary or secondary treatment (after failure of systemic therapy).

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard Cochrane methods, including GRADE, to assess the certainty of the evidence. Our primary outcome was the change in hearing threshold with pure tone audiometry. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of people whose hearing improved, final hearing threshold, speech audiometry, frequency-specific hearing changes, and adverse effects.

- **Main results**: We included 30 studies, comprising 2133 analyzed participants. Some studies had more than two treatment arms and were therefore relevant to several comparisons. Studies investigated intratympanic corticosteroids as either primary or adjunctive therapy.

### Efficacy of steroid injection on idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^114TGCpa]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of transtympanic steroid injection in patients with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) compared to those receiving oral steroids alone.

- **Study design**: Retrospective chart review.
- **Methods**: The study included patients with a history of ISSNHL who did not respond to oral steroid therapy. Audiograms were administered to patients, and they were included in the study if sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) of more than 20 dB occurred within less than 72 hours. Patients who received transtympanic steroid injection were compared with those who received only oral steroids.
- **Results**: Sixty-one patients met the inclusion criteria and participated in the study. In the injection group, 9 patients (30%) showed improvement in pure tone average compared to 5 patients (17%) in the oral group. Additionally, 12 patients (38.7%) in the injection group demonstrated improvement in speech discrimination scores by more than 15%, while only 3 patients (10%) in the oral steroid group showed similar improvements.
- **Conclusion**: The findings indicate that patients with ISSNHL who did not benefit from oral steroid therapy achieve improved hearing outcomes with transtympanic steroids compared to oral steroids.

The evidence-based medicine (EBM) rating for this study is B-3b.

### Clinical practice guideline: Sudden hearing loss (update) [^1166JvBr]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for sudden sensorineural hearing loss, specifically with respect to intratympanic corticosteroids, the AAO-HNSF 2019 guidelines recommend offering, or referring to a clinician who can offer, intratympanic corticosteroid therapy when patients exhibit incomplete recovery from SSNHL 2 to 6 weeks after the onset of symptoms.

### Transtympanic steroids for treatment of sudden hearing loss [^1149GduL]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

To determine whether transtympanic steroid administration may be an effective treatment for sudden onset sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) in patients for whom systemic steroid treatment has failed or who were not candidates for systemic steroids, a study was conducted.

The standard medical regimen for SSNHL usually involves systemic steroid therapy. Unfortunately, some patients do not respond successfully to or are poorly tolerant of systemic steroids. Transtympanic administration of steroids has been suggested as an alternative to systemic therapy. A prospective study was designed to evaluate the hearing outcomes in SSNHL patients treated with transtympanic steroids.

- **Methods**: Patients received transtympanic steroids if oral steroids had failed to work or if they were not able to tolerate oral steroids. Transtympanic steroids were administered through a ventilation tube placed with the patient under local anesthesia. Steroid administration was performed on four separate occasions over the course of 10 to 14 days. Hearing was assessed immediately before therapy and within 1 to 2 weeks after therapy.

- **Results**: Hearing improvement was documented in 10 of 23 patients (44%) who underwent transtympanic steroid administration. This represents a 44% hearing salvage in patients for whom steroid treatment would otherwise have been considered a failure.

Transtympanic steroid therapy may be an alternative treatment for patients with SSNHL for whom systemic steroid therapy had failed or who could not tolerate systemic steroid therapy.

### Intratympanic steroids for treatment of sudden hearing loss after failure of intravenous therapy [^116GHoJ7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

We sought to describe our experience with intratympanic steroid treatment of sudden sensorineural hearing loss after failure of intravenous steroid treatment.

- **Study design and setting**: We conducted a nonrandomized prospective clinical trial. Fifty patients presenting with sudden onset idiopathic hearing loss were treated intravenously over five days. After this period, patients with treatment failure (18 cases) were offered intratympanic steroid treatment. Nine patients refused, whereas the other nine patients received three weekly injections of methylprednisolone. Recovery of hearing was reported as improvement of more than 15 dB in pure tone average.

- **Results**: Intratympanic steroid treatment improved hearing loss in five patients (55%). This is significant compared with those patients who refused intratympanic treatment, who showed no further improvement (P < 0.05). No serious adverse effects were observed.

- **Conclusion**: Intratympanic steroids significantly improve the recovery outcome of sudden hearing loss that had not recovered after intravenous steroid treatment.

- **Significance**: Intratympanic steroids are an effective and safe therapy in sudden sensorineural hearing loss cases that are refractory to standard treatment.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^116kv6QU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

The assessment of the risk of bias in the included studies was undertaken independently by four authors, with the following domains taken into consideration as guided by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Handbook 2011): sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other sources of bias.

We used the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool in RevMan 5 (RevMan 2020), which involves scrutiny of each domain as reported in the trial and judgment about the adequacy of each entry. Discrepancies between raters' judgments were discussed and resolved by consensus. We judged the risk of bias to be 'high', 'low', or 'unclear' and documented this, together with an explanation, in the risk of bias tables in Characteristics of Included Studies.

In non-placebo-controlled studies, we generally considered the risk of bias derived from a lack of blinding to be 'low', as we assumed that the ascertainment of outcomes was not influenced by open (non-blind) administration. Studies that met the inclusion criteria after screening were included in the review independent of their risk of bias classification. The assigned risk of bias in studies influenced the assessment of the certainty of the evidence (GRADE).

### Intratympanic steroid treatments rescued recurrent hearing loss following COVID-19 vaccination and detection of an intralabyrinthine schwannoma [^111cCztv]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

To combat the COVID-19 pandemic, mRNA vaccines have been widely administered as one of the most effective approaches to protect from SARS-CoV-2 infections and/or severe disease. The adverse effects of mRNA vaccinations are mostly reported as mild and temporary, including short-term, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache, without requiring specific treatments. However, it has been reported that these vaccinations are possibly associated with 147 cases of sudden hearing loss, unilateral or neurosensory deafness, and hypoacusis, with incidence estimates of sudden sensorineural hearing loss after COVID-19 vaccination ranging from 0.3 to 4.1 per 100,000 per year. It was unclear how to specifically treat such sudden hearing loss. Here, we report a case of sudden recurrent hearing loss following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, coinciding with the detection of an intralabyrinthine schwannoma and subsequent improvement with oral and then intratympanic steroid treatments.

### Intratympanic methylprednisolone for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^116h4APf]. Otology & Neurotology (2007). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids are commonly used for the treatment of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSHL). In this study, the effectiveness of intratympanic (IT) corticosteroid injection was evaluated and compared with a control group in patients with SSHL who failed systemic corticosteroid treatment.

- **Materials and methods**: A total of 19 patients in the retreatment group (RG) and 18 patients in the control group (CG), all of whom failed high-dose intravenous and oral corticosteroid treatments, were included in the study. These patients were invited back, and IT methylprednisolone was injected five times at 3-day intervals in the RG and followed up for a mean period of 24.9 months (range, 7–30 months). Audiological evaluations were performed initially, one week after the completion of injections, monthly in the first three months, and at the end of the follow-up period in the RG. The CG was followed up for three months after the completion of systemic corticosteroid treatment without any additional drug administration.

- **Results**: The mean age was 52.6 years (range, 20–79 years) in the RG and 59.9 years in the CG. The mean pure-tone average for speech frequencies (500–4,000 Hz) at baseline audiogram and at the first month, third month, and last controls were 65.2 dB (range, 43–102 dB), 45.4 dB (range, 23–77 dB), 43.6 dB (range, 30–77 dB), and 44.5 dB (range, 33–77 dB), respectively, in the RG. The mean pure-tone averages for speech frequencies (500–4,000 Hz) at the end of systemic treatment and at the third-month control were 63.5 dB (range, 44–98 dB) and 59.0 dB (range, 40–100 dB), respectively, in the CG.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^115MEoZB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

We assessed two aspects of reporting bias: between-study publication bias and within-study outcome reporting bias.

- **Publication bias**: Where sufficient studies (10 or more) were available for an outcome, we used a funnel plot to assess publication bias.

- **Outcome reporting bias**: We assessed within-study reporting bias by comparing the outcomes reported in the published report with those listed in the methods section. If a study protocol was available, we compared the reported outcomes with the pre-specified outcomes in the study protocol. When results were not reported in a statistically correct way, this was reflected in a designation of high risk of bias due to selective outcome reporting.

### Efficacy of intratympanic OTO-104 for the treatment of Ménière's disease: The outcome of three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies [^11485MUN]. Otology & Neurotology (2023). High credibility.

In the AVERTS-1 study, although the OTO-104 treatment group had lower adjusted mean definitive vertigo days (DVD) than placebo at month 3, the difference was not statistically significant (2.2 for OTO-104 versus 2.4 for placebo; p = 0.623). Secondary endpoints, including mean vertigo severity score at month 3 (0.408 for OTO-104 versus 0.403 for placebo; p = 0.932), change from baseline in vertigo frequency at month 3 (−0.173 for OTO-104 versus −0.173 for placebo; p = 0.993), and the effect of vertigo on days sick at home or bedridden at month 3 (0.590 for OTO-104 versus 0.579 for placebo; p = 0.943), were not different between OTO-104 and placebo groups. Additionally, the SF-36 physical and mental health summaries at month 3 showed no significant differences between OTO-104 and placebo groups.

- **Subgroup analysis**: In a subgroup analysis of the 115 patients (69.7% of the study population) who did not previously receive intratympanic steroid injections, OTO-104 patients showed more improvement (i.e. had lower adjusted mean DVD) from baseline than patients receiving placebo at month 3, and the difference was significant (1.895 for OTO-104 versus 3.027 for placebo; p = 0.045). In contrast, among the 50 patients (30.3% of the study population) who previously received intratympanic steroid injections, placebo patients had lower adjusted mean DVD (i.e. improved more) compared with patients receiving OTO-104 at month 3, and the difference was statistically significant.

### Intratympanic dexamethasone for sudden sensorineural hearing loss after failure of systemic therapy [^115mEsTn]. The Laryngoscope (2007). Low credibility.

Intratympanic steroids are increasingly used in the treatment of inner ear disorders, especially in patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) who have failed systemic therapy. We reviewed our experience with intratympanic steroids in the treatment of patients with sudden SNHL to determine overall success, morbidity, and prognostic factors.

Intratympanic steroids have minimal morbidity and the potential to have a positive effect on hearing recovery in patients with sudden SNHL who have failed systemic therapy.

- **Study design**: The authors conducted a retrospective review.

- **Methods**: Patients presenting with sudden SNHL, defined as a rapid decline in hearing over 3 days or less affecting 3 or more frequencies by 30 dB or greater who underwent intratympanic steroids therapy (24 mg/mL dexamethasone), were reviewed. Excluded were patients with Meniere disease, retrocochlear disease, autoimmune HL, trauma, fluctuating HL, radiation-induced HL, noise-induced HL, or any other identifiable etiology for sudden HL. Patients who showed signs of fluctuation of hearing after injection were excluded. Pretreatment and post-treatment audiometric evaluations, including pure-tone average (PTA) and speech reception threshold (SRT), were analyzed. Patient variables as they related to recovery were studied and included patient age, time to onset of therapy, status of the contralateral ear, presence of diabetes, severity of HL, and presence of associated symptoms (tinnitus, vertigo). A 20-dB gain in PTA or a 20% improvement in SDS was considered significant.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^111WNSKa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

A small number of studies investigated secondary treatment after the failure of initial therapy (Chang 2010; Ho 2004; Lee 2011; Li 2011; Plontke 2009; Wu 2011; Xenellis 2006; Zhou 2011). The type of initial (primary) treatment that participants had received varied: three studies used intravenous steroids (Plontke 2009; Xenellis 2006; Zhou 2011), three studies used a 10‐ to 14‐day course of oral steroids (Ho 2004; Lee 2011; Li 2011), and one study used an initial dose of intravenous steroids followed by a tapered oral dose (Wu 2011). One study did not describe the primary therapy that had been used (Chang 2010).

Most studies that considered secondary treatment compared intratympanic steroids to either no treatment (Chang 2010; Ho 2004; Lee 2011; Li 2011; Xenellis 2006) or to placebo (Plontke 2009; Wu 2011). A single study compared intratympanic plus systemic corticosteroids to systemic corticosteroids alone (Zhou 2011).

The nature of the intratympanic injection varied between studies. Most studies used an intratympanic delivery of either dexamethasone or methylprednisolone, administered as a short course of three to four injections typically over 7 to 14 days. Two studies used notably different methods of administration. One involved daily injections for 10 days, followed by alternate-day injections for a further 20 days and ongoing injections twice a week for five months (Kosyakov 2011). Another study used a catheter to provide continuous infusion of dexamethasone over 14 days rather than intermittent injections (Plontke 2009).

### Residual perforation risk assessment of intratympanic steroids via tympanostomy tube versus transtympanic injections [^112v7BJQ]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Low credibility.

To investigate the risk of residual tympanic membrane (TM) perforation after intratympanic (IT) steroidal treatment administered via transtympanic injection compared with trans-tympanostomy tube (TyT), a case series, systematic review, and meta-analysis were conducted. Data were retrieved from the medical files of an original cohort of all consecutive patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss necessitating IT steroidal treatment in a tertiary medical center between January 1, 2016, and November 20, 2020. A systematic literature search of "MEDLINE" via "PubMed", "Embase", and "Web of Science" on comparable published cases was performed and a meta-analysis was established.

Eighteen studies describing 818 ears were included in the quantitative meta-analysis, in addition to a local cohort of 140 ears. The proportion of residual TM perforation was found to be 1.11% and 1.14% (95% confidence interval: 0.01%-3.27% and 0.028%-2.38%) in the TyT and trans-tympanic groups, respectively, suggesting no significant difference in residual TM perforation risk between these techniques. IT steroid therapy via TyT is not associated with more residual perforations than IT steroid therapy via transtympanic injections.

### Intratympanic vs systemic corticosteroids in first-line treatment of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113JXUvu]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, evidence-based recommendations on the intratympanic vs systemic administration of corticosteroids for the treatment of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss remain unestablished. Contradictory conclusions have been reported in previous meta-analyses.

The objective of this study was to compare recovery from idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss based on systemic, intratympanic, or a combined treatment with corticosteroids as a first-line treatment.

- **Data sources**: We adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines and searched PubMed, Embase, OvidSP, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library from January 1, 1966, to July 1, 2018. This study was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42018109314).

- **Study selection**: We included randomized studies that excluded identifiable causes of hearing loss. Corticosteroids must have been administered solitarily. We excluded studies that did not define hearing loss as a minimum 30 dB within 72 hours.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: We identified 170 titles, of which 56 (32.9%) were eligible for full-text screening. We independently extracted data and applied a fixed-effects model to investigate our objectives.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: We aimed to (1) estimate the difference in mean pure tone average (PTA) gain in decibels from intratympanic treatment vs systemic treatment and (2) investigate odds ratios for recovery between the different treatment groups.

We included 7 eligible studies. A total of 710 patients were allocated among the different treatment groups.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^115JcuGS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

After scanning all search results and independently screening the titles and abstracts, we retrieved the full texts of reports that loosely met the inclusion criteria and where exclusion could not be clearly inferred from the abstract. At least two authors reviewed these reports and applied the inclusion criteria independently. These criteria were: 1) intratympanic corticosteroid treatment of ISSNHL, 2) clinical study, 3) stated randomisation process, and 4) studying at least one comparison included in the review.

Final decisions on inclusion were based on full-text analysis of preselected studies for the following criteria: 1) a reported randomisation process in the main text of the study report, 2) studying comparisons included in the review, 3) the diagnosis of included patients was ISSNHL, 4) the proportion of included patients with bilateral ISSNHL was below 5%, and 5) the time point of final outcome assessment was at least one week (eight days or more) after the start of treatment. To include a high number of studies, we also included those performing outcome assessments with short follow-up (less than four weeks). However, we considered follow-up durations of two weeks or less to represent a high risk of bias in these studies.

We openly discussed any differences of opinion about which studies to include in the review. If consensus could not be reached, we planned to refer these studies to the Cochrane ENT Co-ordinating Editor. However, this was not necessary in any case.

### Evaluation of levels of triamcinolone acetonide in human perilymph and plasma after intratympanic application in patients receiving cochlear implants: A randomized clinical trial [^112T1PiU]. JAMA Otolaryngology–Head & Neck Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Each patient provided written informed consent to participate in this prospective study, which was approved by the ethics committee of the Medical University of Vienna. Inclusion criteria were that patients were between 18 and 90 years old, undergoing cochlear implantation, and willing to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria were that patients were younger than 18 years, were receiving steroids on a regular basis or had received steroids intravenously or orally preoperatively, had contraindications against the administration of TAC, or had contraindications against IT injections [Supplement 1].

Forty patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups. Groups 1 and 2 received IT TAC approximately 24 hours before surgery, whereas groups 3 and 4 received the injection approximately 1 hour before surgery. Groups 1 and 3 were treated with TAC, 10 mg/mL, and groups 2 and 4 with TAC, 40 mg/mL. Causes of hearing loss were distributed as follows: otosclerosis (n = 1), Meniere disease (n = 2), labyrinthitis (n = 1), progressive hearing loss after cytomegalovirus infection (n = 1), progressive sensorineural hearing loss (n = 24), sudden sensorineural hearing loss (n = 5), and vestibular schwannoma (n = 3).

### Differences in responsiveness of intratympanic steroid injection for intractable vertigo in Meniere's disease [^117VQWYM]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2021). Low credibility.

The efficacy of intratympanic steroid (ITS) injection for intractable Meniere's disease has been reported; however, its differences in responsiveness are not fully understood. This study investigated the clinical characteristics of patients who responded to ITS injection treatment.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study included 32 patients with Meniere's disease who were unable to control frequent vertigo attacks despite conservative treatment for at least 3 months. They received an intratympanic injection of dexamethasone (3.3 mg/mL) in the affected side at least three times. We measured hearing threshold, subjective symptom scores, cervical and ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential (cVEMP and oVEMP), and performed glycerol and bithermal caloric tests.

- **Results**: Satisfactory control of vertigo for 1 year after the first round of injection was found in 18 patients (56.3%; the response group). However, the injections failed to control vertigo in the other 14 patients (43.8%; the non-response group), and they were then treated with middle ear micropressure therapy. The response group showed improvement in low-frequency hearing, whereas hearing acuity did not change in the non-response group. Significantly reduced amplitude of cVEMP on the affected side was found in 62.5% of patients in the response group; however, no patients in the non-response group showed reduced amplitude of cVEMP.

- **Conclusions**: ITS injection significantly improved the subjective symptoms for intractable Meniere's disease; however, the long-term effects were heterogeneous.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for Ménière's disease [^114Yd8hg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Assessing adverse effects can be challenging. Many of the studies included in this review used intratympanic injections for the administration of corticosteroids. This procedure may itself carry a risk of adverse effects, such as ear discharge or tympanic membrane perforation, regardless of the material injected. Therefore, when balancing the risks and benefits of this procedure, individuals with Ménière's disease may wish to be informed about the frequency of these events occurring as a consequence of intratympanic injection. In this review, we identified low-certainty evidence that intratympanic corticosteroids may increase the risk of persistent tympanic membrane perforation. This may be expected in clinical practice, where the chance of spontaneous tympanic membrane perforation, without any intervention, is very rare. However, it should also be noted that participants in the control group of many of these studies also received a placebo injection. Therefore, any increase in the risk of perforation observed here is potentially due to an additional risk from the injected material, such as corticosteroids, rather than from the procedure itself.

It is noteworthy that, in this situation, the evidence regarding the risks of an intervention may come from different types of studies compared to those that consider efficacy. Clearly, placebo interventions are required to appropriately assess the efficacy of an intervention such as intratympanic corticosteroids. However, when the procedure itself (intratympanic injection) is associated with specific risks, it is also relevant.

### Intratympanic triamcinolone and dexamethasone in the treatment of Ménière's syndrome [^115BeXAZ]. Otology & Neurotology (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to describe the safety and potential efficacy of intratympanic administration of triamcinolone (40 mg/mL) in the treatment of unilateral Ménière's syndrome. The study was designed as a single-institution retrospective analysis conducted at a tertiary referral neurotology clinic.

The study included eighteen patients diagnosed with unilateral Ménière's syndrome whose vertigo was refractory to medical management. The intervention involved the intratympanic injection of triamcinolone or dexamethasone.

- **Outcome measures**: Kaplan-Meier analysis was utilized to determine the rate of successful vertigo control. Responders were defined as patients who achieved sufficient vertigo control to decline ablative therapy, while nonresponders were those who did not achieve satisfactory vertigo control and required ablative or surgical therapy. Changes in hearing were evaluated using pre- and post-treatment audiogram data, and patient follow-up data was assessed for complications potentially resulting from intratympanic therapy.

- **Results**: No patient experienced profound hearing loss or other serious adverse events due to intratympanic triamcinolone therapy. Tympanic membrane perforation occurred in three (18%) patients, all of whom had received three or more previous intratympanic injections. Satisfactory vertigo control with intratympanic triamcinolone therapy was achieved in 14 (78%) of 18 subjects.

The conclusion drawn from these results suggests that intratympanic triamcinolone therapy, when used on an as-needed basis, is a safe and potentially effective procedure for vertigo control in patients with Ménière's syndrome.

### Intratympanic steroid injection for treatment of idiopathic sudden hearing loss [^115hsH7z]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

To conduct a clinical trial of intratympanic steroid injection for idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss in subjects who failed oral steroid therapy, an open-label methylprednisolone injection clinical trial was conducted in a tertiary neurotologic referral center. Twenty subjects (14 males; 6 females) received four injections within a two-week period (four days apart). Hearing, dizziness, and tinnitus were evaluated before and after treatment.

There were no serious unexpected adverse events. Two types of expected adverse events were noted: tympanic membrane perforation and nausea after injection. No increases in dizziness or tinnitus lasting longer than 24 hours were observed after injections. One of 20 subjects (5%) improved to near-normal hearing. In addition, there was a statistically significant improvement in the four-frequency pure-tone average and speech discrimination score at one month after treatment.

Four intratympanic injections of methylprednisolone improved pure-tone average or speech discrimination scores for a subset of sudden hearing loss subjects that failed to benefit from oral steroids. This clinical trial of intratympanic injections for idiopathic sudden hearing loss was successfully completed and yielded promising results.

### Evaluation of levels of triamcinolone acetonide in human perilymph and plasma after intratympanic application in patients receiving cochlear implants: A randomized clinical trial [^115bnhPL]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Many inner ear diseases are treated with systemic corticosteroids. However, owing to minimal blood flow to the cochlea and the blood-perilymph barrier, only a small proportion of intravenously applied prednisolone reaches the perilymphatic fluid. Studies investigating glucocorticoid absorption and distribution have mainly been conducted in animals. Bird et al. investigated perilymph concentrations 0.5 to 3 hours after intratympanic (IT) application of methylprednisolone or dexamethasone in humans. Concentrations of methylprednisolone and dexamethasone were 33- to 260-fold higher after IT than after intravenous application, depending on the dose and drug. Application via a transtympanic approach has received increasing interest in recent years. Drugs, however, have been optimized for intravenous, intradermal, or intramuscular application and absorption but lack adaptation for this new treatment method. The goal of this randomized clinical trial was to investigate and compare perilymph and plasma concentrations of triamcinolone acetonide (TAC) after IT application, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously evaluated in humans.

### Intratympanic steroid treatments rescued recurrent hearing loss following COVID-19 vaccination and detection of an intralabyrinthine schwannoma [^115VFuZf]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

A man in his 20s with normal vital records and blood pressure was referred to the ear, nose, and throat (ENT) clinic for two episodes of sudden hearing loss in the left ear within three months following the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccination. Oral steroids initially improved his hearing loss but became ineffective thereafter. He experienced progressive hearing loss, along with a continuous ringing and buzzing sound in the left ear, and mild spontaneous vertigo at the later stage of hearing loss, though no position-evoked vertigo was reported.

- **Timeline of symptoms and treatments**: After the two-dose COVID-19 vaccination (administered 4 weeks apart), the first hearing loss occurred on day 1 after the second dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. The second, recurrent hearing loss began on day 31, lasting for 3.5 months, accompanied by ear ringing and mild vertigo. Clinical tests included seven audiometric tests, an MRI, and a blood draw. Ineffective treatments included pseudoephedrine, fluticasone propionate nasal spray, cetirizine (first effective but later ineffective), and oral prednisone. However, intratympanic steroid injections proved effective in the end. No pure tone average abnormality or hearing loss symptoms were reported prior to vaccination.

- **Figure 1**: This figure illustrates the timeline of clinical symptoms and treatments, audiometric and hearing measurement data, and MRI images of the intralabyrinthine schwannoma. Standard pure tone audiograms of seven sequential hearing tests were conducted.

### Intratympanic steroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss: A systematic review [^1177F8FD]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

To determine the evidence for the efficacy of intratympanic (IT) steroid treatment for the management of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss, a systematic review of the existing literature was conducted.

Data sources included online databases such as PubMed, Medline, OVID, Google Scholar, Cochrane Review, and additional publications cited in bibliographies.

- **Review methods**: Both authors performed a literature search using structured criteria to select studies for the systematic review.

The authors identified 176 articles, of which 32 studies focused on initial or salvage intratympanic steroid injections for sudden hearing loss. This group included six randomized trials and only two randomized controlled trials. Despite the limited number of well-executed trials, the majority of studies investigating intratympanic steroids for salvage treatment demonstrated a beneficial effect. A limited meta-analysis of higher quality studies found a mean difference in improvement of 13.3 dB (95% confidence interval, 7.7–18.9; P < .0001). Although these results were statistically significant, the clinical significance remains uncertain. Initial intratympanic therapy was found to be equivalent to standard therapy in the available literature of varying quality.

- **Conclusion**: Intratympanic steroid treatment as a primary treatment for sudden sensorineural hearing loss appears equivalent to high-dose oral prednisone therapy. As a salvage therapy, intratympanic steroids may offer potential for some degree of additional hearing recovery, although the extent of this improvement is not clearly defined.

### The role of steroids in the preservation of hearing and vestibular function in cochlear implantation [^115yJnuj]. The Laryngoscope (2024). High credibility.

Cochlear implant surgery is guided by principles of atraumatic insertion to protect the inner ear. Previous studies suggest the potential benefit of steroids in patients undergoing cochlear implantation (CI), although the optimal route of administration has yet to be determined. This review aims to systematically evaluate human studies of hearing and vestibular function preservation in patients undergoing CI receiving perioperative steroids and to discuss their role.

- **Data sources**: Search performed in PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases in December 2023.

- **Review methods**: Studies comparing several methods of steroid delivery and conventional management for patients undergoing CI were identified. Primary outcomes included hearing and vestibular function preservation. Secondary outcomes included reported adverse events, routes of steroid administration, and the presence of a control group without steroid administration.

- **Results**: A total of 15 studies (N = 659) met inclusion criteria. Methodology, doses, route of steroid administration, and follow-up duration differed between most studies. Audiometric, vestibular, and hearing preservation (HP) results were inconsistent. In 12 studies, perioperative steroids were associated with either increased HP or vestibular function preservation. Only two studies reported adverse events related to oral corticosteroid therapy.

- **Conclusions**: There is a tendency for perioperative steroids to have a positive impact, at least in the short term, on hearing and vestibular function preservation in CI. Topical corticosteroid therapy appears beneficial.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^116FwG1o]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

We largely assessed the certainty of the evidence in this review as low or very low. There was moderate-certainty evidence for a small number of outcomes, but we identified no high-certainty evidence. The main reasons for this uncertainty were a serious risk of bias in the included studies and imprecision in the effect estimates — either due to a small number of included participants or few events, or because the wide confidence intervals overlapped the threshold for clinical relevance.

Nearly all the included studies had a small number of participants. This increases the risk that randomization does not achieve balance across groups for important prognostic characteristics (both known and unknown) that may confound outcome estimates. One such characteristic is the propensity towards spontaneous recovery, which can have a large impact on pooled estimates for hearing threshold. Imbalance across groups may not be detected by a comparison of baseline parameters such as pre-treatment hearing loss and delay between the onset of symptoms and the start of treatment. It is important, therefore, to ensure that trials have enough participants to achieve a balance across groups for the propensity towards spontaneous recovery, as well as other important prognostic factors. This is supported by meta-analyses (Liebau 2017; Liebau 2018), which demonstrated — in primary and secondary treatment, respectively — that variation in outcome estimates is reduced when there is a larger number of participants.

### Efficacy of intratympanic OTO-104 for the treatment of Ménière's disease: The outcome of three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies [^113amZ2y]. Otology & Neurotology (2023). High credibility.

There is conflicting evidence to support the use of intratympanic corticosteroids to treat patients suffering from the effects of Ménière's disease. Although all three OTO-104 studies outlined previously showed numerical benefit, they do not allow us to confirm the effectiveness of corticosteroids to the highest research standards. However, it should be appreciated that for the two negative studies, subgroup analyses revealed significant benefits in favor of OTO-104, with patients noticing an improvement in their quality of life in one of the negative studies. The safety profile of this intervention was excellent in all three studies.

This series of studies should not mark the end of the use of intratympanic steroids in the clinical treatment of Ménière's disease for several reasons. First, it remains undetermined whether intratympanic steroids might be beneficial for the treatment of some subsets of Ménière's disease sufferers. Given that the risk of harm from intratympanic injection is largely limited to a small rate of tympanic membrane perforation, it is reasonable for the clinician to attempt a trial of intratympanic steroids. Second, the series of studies summarized here consistently show a high placebo response, which in and of itself is efficacious as a treatment, particularly in light of the fact that the safety profile of intratympanic steroid injection is excellent. Third, further studies involving other steroids and patients selected to have Ménière's disease through MRI of hydrops or via other novel methods might improve the diagnostic process.

### Intratympanic triamcinolone acetonide as treatment option for idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^112tDBTB]. Otology & Neurotology (2019). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids represent the most commonly used treatment option for patients with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss. In the past, these compounds were mainly formulated and tested for intravenous or oral administration. Intratympanic application is increasingly being used, often as salvage treatment. The most suitable corticosteroid for local application has yet to be identified. Trials have suggested that triamcinolone acetonide has superior molecular properties for this treatment modality.

- **Methods**: The main aim of this study was to retrospectively assess the first audiometric results of patients diagnosed with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss and treated simultaneously with systemic prednisolone and intratympanic triamcinolone acetonide. This data was then compared to systemic treatment only, as well as to historic cohorts treated intratympanically with widely used corticosteroids, namely dexamethasone or methylprednisolone.

- **Results**: Ninety patients received intravenous prednisolone only, and 89 individuals underwent intravenous treatment combined with three to four simultaneous intratympanic applications of triamcinolone. Eight patients received intratympanic triamcinolone as first-line treatment. After adjusting data for sex, time since onset, age, and severity of hearing loss, no statistically significant difference between the two main treatment groups could be identified. No major adverse events were observed, specifically no otitis media or persistent vertigo. Two perforated tympanic membranes healed spontaneously.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^113Frj1s]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Data extraction and management for the study of intratympanic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss were meticulously handled to ensure reliability. Study characteristics and data related to participants from each study were independently extracted by at least three authors. Any discrepancies among the extracted data were discussed and resolved by consensus. Only treatment arms that met the comparisons defined in the review were included. If a study had more than one treatment arm matching the same type of intervention, the one most widely used among included studies was selected. In most studies, outcome data were extracted from the defined primary endpoint. When no time point was defined as the primary endpoint, the latest time point was chosen for inclusion. Exceptionally, if the number of participants lost to follow-up was very high at the final time point and the necessary outcome parameters and number of participants were reported for an earlier time point, this earlier time point was chosen. This is documented in the "Characteristics of included studies" table.

We documented the following details for each study:

- **Methods**: Study design, country, year, setting, allocation, and blinding.
- **Participants**: Inclusion and exclusion criteria, number of included participants, and baseline parameters.
- **Interventions**: Treatment arms, time point of start of intervention, whether primary therapy or secondary/rescue therapy, dosage and type of steroid, drug delivery strategy, injection regime, duration of intervention, time to follow-up, and concomitant treatments.
- **Outcomes**: Defined primary and secondary outcomes in the review, definition of PTA, and successful hearing improvement.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for Ménière's disease [^11582qX1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

We rated all the included studies at either high or unclear risk of bias from selective reporting. Three studies did not have a published protocol for comparison with the reported results; therefore, we rated them at unclear risk of selective reporting (Borghei 2016; El Shafei 2020; Garduno‐Anaya 2005). We also rated two of the studies on OTO‐104 at unclear risk due to reporting issues. Lambert 2012 provided very limited, narrative data only on hearing and quality of life, precluding any meta-analysis. NCT02265393 reported most outcomes at 12 months of follow-up (when all participants had received the study drug) rather than at six months, which would have allowed a comparison of efficacy between control and intervention arms.

We rated three studies at high risk of bias. The study by Ul Shamas 2017 did not report any vertigo outcomes, which is extremely unusual for a trial on Ménière's disease. For AVERTS‐2 and Lambert 2016, there were discrepancies in reporting between the trial registration documents and the publications. The trial registry site for AVERTS‐2 stated that hearing and quality of life would be assessed; however, these outcomes are not reported. Furthermore, tympanic membrane perforation is not included in adverse event reporting, despite being a widely recognized complication of this procedure. The trial registry site for Lambert 2016 indicated that outcomes would be reported after four months of follow-up, but the trial results are all given at three months follow-up.

### Sudden sensorineural hearing loss in children: A report of 75 cases [^111MnBPB]. Otology & Neurotology (2018). Low credibility.

Systemic steroids are recommended for the treatment of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) in American guidelines, with intratympanic steroid therapy considered as second-line or salvage therapy. Although these guidelines are proposed for patients over 18 years of age, literature has reported that systemic steroids are also the first choice for children with SSNHL. Some studies on intratympanic steroid treatment for idiopathic SSNHL, after the failure of intravenous therapy, demonstrate that salvage therapy offers potential benefits. It provides localized treatment with higher perilymphatic concentrations and avoids systemic side effects.

However, there are disadvantages, including otalgia during and after treatment, persistent tympanic membrane perforation, vertigo, dysgeusia, and potential infection. While there are reports on systemic steroid treatment in children, there is insufficient data on intratympanic steroid administration in this age group. Only two studies focus on this:

- **Study by Pitaro et al**: Investigated 8 out of 19 children who received intratympanic steroid salvage therapy; five had partial hearing recovery, while three did not improve.

- **Review by Dedhia and Chi**: Examined 20 children with SSNHL, of which two patients underwent intratympanic steroid therapy and both showed improvement.

Oral steroids combined with intratympanic injection are discussed in the literature, with authors proposing that combination therapy is better than single-drug therapy.
