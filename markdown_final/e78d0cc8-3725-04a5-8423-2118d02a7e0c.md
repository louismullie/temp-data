## Question

Low potassium on chlorthalidone and spirolactone

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the risk of low potassium (hypokalemia) when using chlorthalidone and spironolactone together, and how to interpret and manage that risk. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology of chlorthalidone and spironolactone and their expected effects on potassium. Then, I should verify what high-quality trials and guidelines say about hypokalemia with chlorthalidone versus hydrochlorothiazide and about hyperkalemia with spironolactone. Next, I will examine whether the combination meaningfully changes potassium balance in practice. After that, I should review monitoring recommendations and risk modifiers like kidney function, diabetes, and concomitant RAAS blockade. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach to management and counseling, including when to adjust doses or add potassium binders or supplements.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology. Chlorthalidone is a thiazide-like diuretic that increases sodium and water excretion and predictably lowers serum potassium via increased distal tubular sodium reabsorption and potassium wasting, with the risk rising at higher doses and in vulnerable patients, which is why guidelines advise routine monitoring for hypokalemia with thiazide-type diuretics [^114Z3kxS] [^114VQoSG]. Spironolactone, in contrast, is a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist that promotes sodium excretion while retaining potassium, so its intrinsic effect is to raise potassium or at least offset potassium loss, which is precisely why it is used to treat thiazide-induced hypokalemia in some combinations [^113ss86n] [^111K3fjM].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of hypokalemia risk with chlorthalidone compared with hydrochlorothiazide, because clinicians often ask whether chlorthalidone is "worse" for potassium. Large observational and randomized data consistently show higher rates of hypokalemia with chlorthalidone than with hydrochlorothiazide, including hazard ratios around 1.7–2.7 in multiple datasets, with the excess risk attenuated as kidney function declines, likely due to reduced natriuresis and potassium wasting at lower GFR [^114KJgdd]. I should double-check that this aligns with guideline cautions; yes, contemporary guidance lists hypokalemia as a key adverse effect to monitor with chlorthalidone and recommends periodic potassium checks, especially early in therapy or with dose changes [^114Z3kxS] [^114VQoSG].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about spironolactone's effect in combination. I need to check whether adding spironolactone to chlorthalidone typically normalizes potassium or still leaves patients low. Mechanistically, spironolactone's potassium-sparing effect should blunt or reverse chlorthalidone-induced potassium loss, and fixed-dose spironolactone/hydrochlorothiazide combinations are FDA-indicated in part to mitigate thiazide-induced hypokalemia, which supports the concept clinically even though the exact chlorthalidone/spironolactone combination has not been extensively trialed head-to-head [^111K3fjM] [^1121eUPP]. Let me consider real-world signals: in resistant hypertension cohorts, spironolactone add-on is common and hyperkalemia, not hypokalemia, is the dominant electrolyte issue requiring monitoring, reinforcing that spironolactone tends to raise or stabilize potassium rather than lower it [^111K9iw2] [^111YrF4B].

> I should confirm the clinical balance in the combination. In practice, when spironolactone is added to a thiazide-type diuretic, the net effect on potassium is often neutral or modestly upward, particularly in patients with preserved kidney function, though the final result depends on dose, renal function, dietary potassium, and concomitant RAAS blockade. Importantly, hypokalemia remains a recognized risk of chlorthalidone monotherapy, whereas the combination with spironolactone reduces that risk rather than amplifies it [^114Z3kxS] [^111K3fjM]. But wait, what if the patient has CKD or is on ACEi/ARB? In those settings, spironolactone's potassium-raising effect is stronger, so the balance may tilt toward normokalemia or even hyperkalemia, which is why monitoring is essential rather than assuming hypokalemia will persist [^112s1v2E] [^116K1ha6].

> Next, I should review monitoring and risk modifiers. I need to ensure I am aligned with guideline cadence: check potassium and renal function within 1 week of initiating or changing spironolactone, again at about 1 month, and periodically thereafter, with closer intervals in CKD, diabetes, or when ACEi/ARB are added or uptitrated; for chlorthalidone, periodic potassium checks are advised, especially early in therapy or with dose increases, given the higher hypokalemia signal [^115EgLFb] [^114Z3kxS]. Hold on, I should verify special populations: in older adults or those with eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m², hyperkalemia risk with MRAs rises, so the same vigilance applies even if the combination reduces hypokalemia risk from the thiazide component [^115TVQqw] [^112s1v2E].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. If a patient on chlorthalidone develops hypokalemia, adding spironolactone is a rational, evidence-aligned strategy to restore potassium balance while enhancing natriuresis in resistant hypertension, provided kidney function is adequate and potassium can be safely monitored. Conversely, if a patient on the combination presents with low potassium, I should double-check adherence, dose, and competing causes such as diarrhea, laxative use, or inadequate intake before attributing blame to the combination itself [^113jkZCn] [^111K9iw2]. I should confirm that potassium supplements are generally avoided when starting spironolactone unless there is a compelling indication, to mitigate hyperkalemia risk, and that any supplement use should be reassessed promptly after MRA initiation [^111j2vUr].

> I will now examine dose and titration nuances. Low-start, go-slow dosing for spironolactone (often 12.5–25 mg daily) with reassessment of potassium and creatinine in 3–7 days is prudent, particularly in older adults, those with CKD, or anyone on ACEi/ARB. If potassium drifts upward, dose reduction or temporary holding is reasonable, whereas if potassium remains low despite adherence, the thiazide dose may be too high or there may be an alternative cause of potassium loss that needs correction [^115EgLFb] [^114Z3kxS]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with resistant hypertension pathways; yes, contemporary guidance supports adding spironolactone 25–50 mg in appropriate candidates with close monitoring, and to prefer chlorthalidone or indapamide when intensifying thiazide therapy in resistant hypertension [^113jkZCn] [^111YrF4B].

> But wait, what if the patient cannot tolerate spironolactone due to gynecomastia or persistent hyperkalemia? In that scenario, I should consider alternatives such as amiloride or eplerenone, recognizing that eplerenone may be less potent for BP and potassium effects at conventional doses and may require higher dosing in some patients, with the same monitoring principles applying [^113jkZCn] [^115p4enL]. I need to ensure I also counsel on avoiding potassium-containing salt substitutes and to review all concomitant drugs that raise potassium when MRAs are used, including ACEi/ARB, NSAIDs, trimethoprim, and heparin, adjusting the monitoring cadence accordingly [^111j2vUr] [^116K1ha6].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line: chlorthalidone meaningfully increases the risk of hypokalemia compared with hydrochlorothiazide, whereas spironolactone tends to raise or stabilize potassium. When combined, spironolactone generally offsets chlorthalidone-induced potassium loss, so clinically significant hypokalemia is less likely than with chlorthalidone alone, though the net effect is individualized and must be verified with structured monitoring and dose titration to keep potassium in the normal range while achieving BP goals [^114KJgdd] [^111ie4ew] [^111K3fjM] [^114Z3kxS].

Low potassium (hypokalemia) is common with chlorthalidone due to renal potassium wasting [^112fiPeK], but **spironolactone usually prevents or corrects it** by retaining potassium [^111K3fjM]. When both are used together, the net effect is often neutral, though **monitoring is essential** because chlorthalidone's potency and long half-life can still cause hypokalemia, especially at higher doses or in patients with CKD, diabetes, or on ACEi/ARBs [^114Z3kxS] [^111ie4ew]. Check potassium within 1 week of starting or changing therapy, then periodically; if potassium falls below 3.5 mEq/L, consider reducing chlorthalidone, adding or increasing spironolactone, or using potassium supplements or a potassium-sparing agent [^115EgLFb] [^114VQoSG].

## Mechanisms of potassium imbalance

### Chlorthalidone-induced hypokalemia

- **Mechanism**: Inhibits the sodium-chloride cotransporter in the distal tubule, increasing sodium and water excretion and promoting potassium loss via aldosterone-driven exchange [^1179wYUi].
- **Risk factors**: Higher doses, prolonged use, CKD, diabetes, high dietary sodium, and concomitant ACEi/ARBs or loop diuretics [^111ie4ew] [^114VQoSG].
- **Clinical significance**: Hypokalemia increases arrhythmia risk, especially in patients with cardiovascular disease or on digoxin [^1156ETpR].

---

### Spironolactone-induced potassium retention

- **Mechanism**: Aldosterone receptor antagonism reduces sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion, increasing serum potassium [^113ss86n].
- **Risk factors**: CKD, diabetes, ACEi/ARBs, NSAIDs, and high potassium intake [^111j2vUr].
- **Clinical significance**: Hyperkalemia risk, particularly in patients with reduced renal function or on RAAS blockade [^1171f8vg].

---

## Clinical evidence on potassium balance with combined therapy

- **SPIRO-CKD trial**: In CKD patients, spironolactone 25 mg vs chlorthalidone 25 mg showed more hyperkalemia with spironolactone (12 vs 2; RR 5.5) and no significant difference in LV mass or BP, indicating that spironolactone's potassium-sparing effect can dominate in some patients [^114Bb7rE].
- **PATHWAY-2**: Spironolactone was superior to other add-ons in resistant hypertension, with hyperkalemia managed by monitoring and dose adjustment [^115zV8Er].
- **Real-world data**: Chlorthalidone is associated with higher hypokalemia risk than HCTZ, but spironolactone co-use mitigates this risk in many patients [^114KJgdd] [^111ie4ew].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Monitoring**: Check potassium and renal function within 1 week of starting or changing therapy, then periodically; more frequent checks in CKD, diabetes, or with ACEi/ARBs [^115EgLFb] [^112s1v2E].
- **Dosing**: Use the lowest effective chlorthalidone dose (often 12.5–25 mg) and titrate spironolactone to balance potassium and BP control [^114Z3kxS] [^113jkZCn].
- **Management of hypokalemia**: Reduce chlorthalidone, increase spironolactone, add potassium supplements, or use another potassium-sparing agent (e.g. amiloride) [^114VQoSG] [^114U8x5K].

---

## Practical clinical approach

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended action** |
|-|-|
| Hypokalemia (K+ < 3.5 mEq/L) | - Reduce chlorthalidone dose <br/> - Increase spironolactone dose <br/> - Add potassium supplement or potassium-sparing agent <br/> - Monitor potassium and renal function [^114VQoSG] [^115EgLFb] |
| Hyperkalemia (K+ > 5.5 mEq/L) | - Reduce or stop spironolactone <br/> - Check for interacting drugs (ACEi/ARB, NSAIDs) <br/> - Consider dietary potassium restriction <br/> - Monitor potassium and renal function [^115EgLFb] [^116K1ha6] |
| Stable potassium (3.5–5.0 mEq/L) | - Continue current regimen <br/> - Monitor periodically [^114Z3kxS] |

---

## Special considerations

- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: Hypokalemia risk is lower but hyperkalemia risk is higher; monitor closely and adjust doses as needed [^111ie4ew] [^115TVQqw].
- **Diabetes mellitus**: Higher hypokalemia risk with chlorthalidone; spironolactone can help but monitor for hyperkalemia [^114zzwFD] [^111j2vUr].
- **Elderly patients**: Greater susceptibility to electrolyte disturbances; monitor more frequently [^114VQoSG].

---

## Summary of key points

- **Chlorthalidone commonly causes hypokalemia** via renal potassium wasting [^1179wYUi].
- **Spironolactone prevents or corrects hypokalemia** by retaining potassium [^111K3fjM].
- **Combined therapy often balances potassium**, but monitoring is essential due to chlorthalidone's potency and long half-life [^114Z3kxS].
- **Adjust therapy based on potassium and renal function**, using dose changes, supplements, or alternative agents as needed [^115EgLFb].

---

Low potassium is a predictable risk with chlorthalidone, but **spironolactone usually offsets this**; nonetheless, **close monitoring and individualized adjustments** are necessary to maintain safe potassium levels.

American Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Pharmacovigilance

This trial is categorized by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency as type A (no higher than the risk of standard medical care). Patients are being followed up closely throughout this study, and an ongoing evaluation of risk will continue throughout the recruitment period. Both spironolactone and chlorthalidone are considered investigational medicinal products (IMPs) within SPIRO-CKD trial. Any adverse events or serious adverse events that occur during this trial are reportable to the SPIRO-CKD Trials Office at the trials unit up to 6 weeks following last administration of the IMP. Any suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions related to the IMP will be reported irrespective of how long after IMP administration the reaction occurred. Responses to abnormalities of serum sodium, potassium, and eGFR will be guided by predetermined management plans (see Appendix 2).

Blood pressure monitoring

To confirm or deny the trial hypothesis, it is essential that the change in blood pressure during the treatment period is not significantly different in each arm of the trial. A tight blood pressure target was thought impractical; instead, a blood pressure monitoring committee (BPMC) reviews the blood pressure data after each block of 20 patients for the first 100 patients and then after each block of 30 patients to the end of trial recruitment. The precise frequency of review may change on the advice of the BPMC following its independent review of the data. Patients enter the trial with controlled blood pressure so that there are not anticipated to be clinical reasons for adding further drugs for blood pressure control during the randomized treatment phase. In the event of a difference in blood pressure change becoming evident, the BPMC will advise on changes to medication in either arm.

Background and Objectives

In a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, treatment with spironolactone in early-stage CKD reduced left ventricular mass and arterial stiffness compared with placebo. It is not known if these effects were due to BP reduction or specific vascular and myocardial effects of spironolactone.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

A prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end point study conducted in four UK centers (Birmingham, Cambridge, Edinburgh, and London) comparing spironolactone 25 mg to chlorthalidone 25 mg once daily for 40 weeks in 154 participants with nondiabetic stage 2 and 3 CKD (eGFR 30–89 ml/min per 1.73 m 2). The primary end point was change in left ventricular mass on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Participants were on treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker and had controlled BP (target ≤ 130/80 mm Hg).

Results

There was no significant difference in left ventricular mass regression; at week 40, the adjusted mean difference for spironolactone compared with chlorthalidone was -3.8 g (95% confidence interval, -8.1 to 0.5 g, P = 0.08). Office and 24-hour ambulatory BPs fell in response to both drugs with no significant differences between treatment. Pulse wave velocity was not significantly different between groups; at week 40, the adjusted mean difference for spironolactone compared with chlorthalidone was 0.04 m/s (-0.4 m/s, 0.5 m/s, P = 0.90). Hyperkalemia (defined ≥ 5.4 mEq/L) occurred more frequently with spironolactone (12 versus two participants, adjusted relative risk was 5.5, 95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 22.1, P = 0.02), but there were no patients with severe hyperkalemia (defined ≥ 6.5 mEq/L). A decline in eGFR > 30% occurred in eight participants treated with chlorthalidone compared with two participants with spironolactone (adjusted relative risk was 0.2, 95% confidence interval, 0.05 to 1.1, P = 0.07).

Conclusions

Spironolactone was not superior to chlorthalidone in reducing left ventricular mass, BP, or arterial stiffness in nondiabetic CKD.

American Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

The effect of thiazide-like drugs on LV mass in early-stage CKD has not previously been examined, although they are effective in lowering blood pressure in this group. The study will also provide evidence on the safety of both spironolactone and chlorthalidone in subjects with early-stage CKD, giving valuable data on the effects of both drugs on kidney function measured by eGFR and on changes in serum potassium and sodium concentrations. If safety and efficacy are confirmed, the rationale would be provided for a larger clinical trial designed to examine the effects of MRB drugs on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality end points. It is acknowledged that the nonblinded study design increases the risk of bias, but the PROBE design maintains the benefits associated with a strict randomization procedure, whereas the blinded end points help to eliminate bias. In a meta-analysis of trials of an ARB, changes in mean 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure in double-blind and PROBE trials were not significantly different.

Salt-sensitive and low-renin hypertension

Lastly, though not addressed in most guidelines, patients with salt-sensitive hypertension and/or low-renin hypertension have characteristics that lend themselves well to treatment with a diuretic. In most cases, low levels of renin are an indication that the RAS is suppressed because of volume overload and sodium retention. In such patients, as well as in salt-sensitive patients, treatment with diuretics, which reduce volume and increase sodium excretion, would be expected to be efficacious, whereas treatment with RAS inhibitors would be expected to suppress the RAS further. In fact, in the few clinical trials that have looked at patients with low-plasma renin activity and/or salt sensitivity, effective blood pressure lowering strategies include HCTZ, chlorthalidone, indapamide, or spironolactone.

As salt-sensitive hypertension is especially common in black patients, older adults, and in patients with more severe blood pressure or with comorbidities, such as metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, or chronic kidney disease and as low-renin hypertension is particularly common in African Americans, the elderly, and patients with resistant hypertension, it is not surprising that diuretics have been shown to be particularly effective in these patient populations.

### Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide [^1121eUPP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Essential hypertension:

For patients with essential hypertension in whom other measures are considered inadequate or inappropriate;
In hypertensive patients for the treatment of a diuretic-induced hypokalemia when other measures are considered inappropriate;
Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes, including the classes to which this drug principally belongs. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

### Resistant hypertension [^115S19ZY]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Resistant hypertension (RH) is defined as blood pressure above a goal despite adherence to at least 3 optimally dosed antihypertensive medications of different classes, one of which is a diuretic. Evaluation of possible RH begins with an assessment of adherence to medications. The white-coat effect should be ruled out by out-of-office blood pressure monitoring. Obesity, heavy alcohol intake, and interfering substances all contribute to RH. Dietary sodium restriction is an important part of management. RH may be secondary to problems such as renal disease, obstructive sleep apnea, or aldosteronism, and testing for these conditions should be considered. Adequate diuretic treatment is a key part of therapy. Chlorthalidone is more effective than hydrochlorothiazide in reducing blood pressure because it is more potent and lasts longer. In addition, it may reduce cardiovascular events to a greater extent than hydrochlorothiazide. When glomerular filtration rate is < 30 mL/min, a loop diuretic usually is needed. The addition of spironolactone, with careful attention to potassium levels, is an evidence-based strategy for the treatment of RH. Other strategies include use of a vasodilating β-blocker, adding a long-acting nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, or adding clonidine. When blood pressure is not coming under control despite 4 or 5 agents, referral to a hypertension specialist may be warranted.

### Usefulness of urinary potassium to creatinine ratio to predict diuretic response in patients with acute heart failure and preserved ejection fraction [^113WxQ8x]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

We speculate that patients with an elevated urine K/Cr ratio might respond better to thiazides due to better renal flow. Considering the determinants of potassium excretion in urine, potassium intake was similar throughout the whole cohort since we did not educate our patients on a restriction in potassium intake. In our cohort, we did not measure plasma aldosterone levels, since 2/3 of the patients received drugs that were inhibitors of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system, with no differences between the two groups. Patients treated with thiazides had higher systolic pressures, both at the baseline visit and at 24 and 72 h, compared to those treated with spironolactone, translating into better renal flow, which is undoubtedly a determining factor of the correct action of diuretics.

In addition, in a recent published study with the same cohort of patients, the ICARPo study, in which chlorthalidone was compared with spironolactone in terms of diuresis and natriuresis, after a multivariate analysis including K/Cr among the covariables, we observed a greater diuresis and natriuresis with chlorthalidone both at 24 and 72 h. This was the first study in the literature that compared the natriuretic and diuretic effect of chlorthalidone versus spironolactone in AHF.

It should be noted that the current ESC guidelines, as opposed to previous ones, do not contemplate the possibility of adding spironolactone as a second diuretic, and they do consider thiazide, acetazolamide, or metolazone useful as additional diuretic. Current findings support current guidelines adding new information about the utility of certain novel parameters for tailoring the diuretic strategy in patients with AHF and suboptimal loop diuretic response.

4.1 Study limitations

Several limitations in this study should be noted. First, this is a small single‐center observational study that only included patients with AHF and LVEF ≥ 50%. Second, it should be noted that urine potassium values were relatively low in the entire sample, probably due to the advanced disease and high resistance to diuretics. Third, in the current work we did not measure aldosterone levels or other surrogates of aldosterone activity. Thus, we could not examine the role of urinary potassium as a proxy of aldosterone activity. Finally, it is a small prospective single‐center observational study, in which the risk of significant residual confounding cannot be ruled out.

### Novel bloodless potassium determination using a signal-processed single-lead ECG [^115QGZSX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Blood potassium levels are tightly regulated homeostatically and are critical for normal physiological cellular function. 1, 2 Fluctuations in potassium values are found in many disease states and can expose patients to life‐threatening arrhythmias. 3, 4, 5 Compelling evidence shows that in patients with renal or cardiac disease, even modest potassium changes may lead to morbidity, hospitalization, and death. 6 Moreover, evidence‐based therapies used to treat these conditions, including adrenergic blockade, potassium‐sparing diuretics, and renin–angiotensin antagonism, result in hyper‐ or hypokalemia. After the potassium‐sparing diuretic spironolactone was shown to lower heart failure mortality in a randomized prospective trial, hospitalization for hyperkalemia tripled and mortality doubled. 7 As the prevalence of these diseases and their risk factors (hypertension and diabetes) rise, and as the population continues to age, increasing numbers of patients will be at risk of hyper‐ and hypokalemia. 8, 9

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Resistant hypertension — initial combination therapy and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) use — Antihypertensive drug therapy should start with a combination of an ACEi or ARB, a CCB, and a diuretic. Replacing thiazide-type diuretics (eg, HCTZ or bendroflumethiazide) with thiazide-like diuretics (eg, chlorthalidone and indapamide) may offer additional BP reduction and cardiovascular protection among patients with previous MI or stroke. Randomized controlled trials have shown that addition of spironolactone (25–50 mg/day) as the fourth drug reduced home and 24-hour SBP by 6.6 to 8.7 mm Hg when compared with placebo in patients with resistant hypertension and eGFR < 45 mL/ min/1.73 m2; the reduction in BP was greater than with addition of doxazosin or bisoprolol, and the magnitude of reduction in 24-hour systolic and diastolic BP was greater with spironolactone than clonidine in a separate clinical trial. Nevertheless, 4% to 40% of adults with resistant hypertension cannot tolerate spironolactone due to hyperkalemia or antiandrogenic side effects. For eplerenone, RCTs have not demonstrated reduction of home BP or 24-hour BP at doses between 25 and 100 mg daily when compared with placebo, and effective treatment may require higher dosages; use of nonsteroidal MRA for treating resistant hypertension in patients with moderate to advanced CKD has not been tested in a clinical trial but may be considered in selected patients with close monitoring of serum potassium.

4 DISCUSSION

To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the role of K/Cr to guide the choice of a second diuretic to add to furosemide in patients with AHF and suboptimal loop diuretic response. In patients with K/Cr above the median (≥ 0.56), both diuresis and natriuresis were higher when using chlorthalidone compared to spironolactone. After multivariate analysis, the effects on natriuresis with chlorthalidone compared to spironolactone approached a statistically significant increase at 24 and 72 h visits. The use of chlorthalidone resulted in higher cumulative diuresis at 72 h at both K/Cr levels. Of note, these results contradict our initial hypothesis, as we speculated that patients with elevated K/Cr would present greater diuresis and natriuresis with MRAs.

The hyperaldosteronism suspected to be associated with a higher concentration of potassium in urine, could thus benefit from its inhibition with MRAs has not been corroborated. In this regard, renal potassium excretion is conditioned by numerous factors, being a particularly complex regulation. Renal potassium excretion depends: first, on the concentration of potassium in the blood, which in turn depends largely on the intake; second, on the distal sodium supply and on tubular flow; third, on the concentration of aldosterone in plasma, which, in turn, depends mainly on the concentration of potassium in the blood and angiotensin II. Therefore, we cannot assert that urine potassium levels in patients with heart failure are primarily due to secondary hyperaldosteronism, but rather depend on many determinants that prevent explicitly giving hyperaldosteronism a leading role. Also, to the best of our knowledge, there is no prior evidence showing robust evidence endorsing the association between spot urinary potassium and aldosterone activity in patients with advanced HF. The association of urinary potassium secretion and plasma aldosterone has been controversial for many years. Most of the evidence comes from animal studies. The role of aldosterone in isolation, independently, with the regulation of potassium excretion seems to be of little relevance. It is more important when plasma potassium levels increase coincident with increased intake.

Spironolactone can cause hyperkalemia. The risk of hyperkalemia may be increased in patients with renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus or with concomitant use of drugs that raise serum potassium (see Drug Interactions). Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. The risk of hypokalemia may be increased in patients with cirrhosis, brisk diuresis, or with concomitant use of drugs that lower serum potassium. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.

Other Metabolic Disturbances

Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.

Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricemia and precipitate gout in susceptible patients.

Hydrochlorothiazide decreases urinary calcium excretion and may cause elevations of serum calcium. Monitor calcium levels in patients with hypercalcemia receiving spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide.

Gynecomastia

Gynecomastia may develop in association with the use of spironolactone; physicians should be alert to its possible onset. The development of gynecomastia appears to be related to both dosage level and duration of therapy and is normally reversible when spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are discontinued. In rare instances, some breast enlargement may persist when spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are discontinued.

Somnolence

Somnolence and dizziness have been reported to occur in some patients. Caution is advised when driving or operating machinery until the response to initial treatment has been determined.

Information for Patients

Patients who receive spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide should be advised to avoid potassium supplements and foods containing high levels of potassium including salt substitutes.

Non-melanoma Skin Cancer

Instruct patients taking hydrochlorothiazide to protect skin from the sun and undergo regular skin cancer screening.

Laboratory Tests

Periodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be done at appropriate intervals, particularly in the elderly and those with significant renal or hepatic impairments.

ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists, Aldosterone Blockers, Potassium Supplements, Heparin, Low Molecular Weight Heparin, and Other Drugs Known to Cause Hyperkalemia

Concomitant administration may lead to severe hyperkalemia.

Alcohol, Barbiturates, or Narcotics

Potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.

### Chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide and kidney outcomes in patients with hypertension: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^113Ttf6X]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The DCP trial was performed between June 1, 2016, and June 1, 2022; for this prespecified secondary analysis, we included an additional 1.5 years of EHR-based follow-up until December 31, 2023. Patients who underwent randomization and had a baseline and 1 or more follow-up creatinine measures were included in this intention-to-treat analysis.

Outcomes

Evaluation of kidney outcomes was a priori specified in the DCP protocol. The primary outcome was CKD progression, defined as doubling of serum creatinine level from baseline, a terminal eGFR of less than 15 mL/min, or dialysis initiation. Other exploratory kidney outcomes included (1) an alternative composite measure consisting of a 40% reduction in eGFR (a terminal eGFR < 15 mL/min or dialysis initiation), (2) incidence of new CKD (defined as eGFR < 60 mL/min) among those without CKD at baseline, and (3) evaluation of change in annual eGFR slope (estimated as the absolute change between baseline and last eGFR taken during the study divided by duration of the 2 measurements and multiplied by 365.25 days). We additionally evaluated the incidence of hypokalemia and hospitalization for acute kidney injury as safety outcomes. Finally, we evaluated the effect of the intervention on prespecified subgroups.

Drug fills from VA outpatient pharmacies were also examined, limiting to those of interest and prescribed during the study. Specifically evaluated for this article are pharmacy fills for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, spironolactone, eplerenone, loop diuretics, sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, and potassium supplementation.

### Spironolactone prevents chlorthalidone-induced sympathetic activation and insulin resistance in hypertensive patients [^114kUUuP]. Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Recent studies from our laboratory indicate that chlorthalidone triggers persistent activation of the sympathetic nervous system and promotes insulin resistance in hypertensive patients, independent of serum potassium. Mechanisms underlying these adverse effects of chlorthalidone remain unknown, but increasing evidence in rodents suggests the role of angiotensin and aldosterone excess in inducing both sympathetic overactivity and insulin resistance. Accordingly, we conducted studies in 17 subjects with untreated stage 1 hypertension, measuring sympathetic nerve activity at baseline and after 12 weeks of chlorthalidone alone (25 mg/d), chlorthalidone plus spironolactone, and chlorthalidone plus irbesartan, using randomized crossover design. We found that chlorthalidone alone decreased 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure from 135 ± 3/84 ± 2 to 124 ± 2/78 ± 2 mm Hg and significantly increased sympathetic nerve activity from baseline (from 41 ± 3 versus 49 ± 4 bursts per minute; P < 0.01). The addition of spironolactone to chlorthalidone returned sympathetic nerve activity value to baseline (42 ± 3 bursts per minute; P > 0.05), whereas the addition of irbesartan failed to alter the sympathetic nerve activity response to chlorthalidone in the same subjects (52 ± 2 bursts per minute; P < 0.01) despite a similar reduction in ambulatory blood pressure (121 ± 2/75 ± 2 and 121 ± 2/75 ± 2 mm Hg, respectively). Chlorthalidone alone also increased indices of insulin resistance, which was not observed when used in combination with spironolactone. In conclusion, our study demonstrates beneficial effects of spironolactone in attenuating both chlorthalidone-induced sympathetic activation and insulin resistance in humans, independent of blood pressure reduction. Because sympathetic overactivity and insulin resistance contribute to the poor prognosis in patients with cardiovascular disease, combination therapy of chlorthalidone with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists may constitute a preferable regimen than chlorthalidone alone in hypertensive patients.

### Usefulness of urinary potassium to creatinine ratio to predict diuretic response in patients with acute heart failure and preserved ejection fraction [^113cJctL]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with acute heart failure (AHF) require intensification in the diuretic strategy. However, the optimal diuretic strategy remains unclear. In this work, we aimed to evaluate the role of urinary potassium to creatinine ratio (K/Cr) to predict diuretic and natriuretic response to thiazide or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) in a cohort of patients with AHF and preserved ejection fraction (AHF-pEF).

Hypothesis

Patients with a high urinary K/Cr ratio will have a better diuretic and natriuretic response with spironolactone versus chlorthalidone.

Methods

This is a study of 44 patients with AHF-pEF with suboptimal loop diuretic response. The primary endpoint was the baseline K/Cr associated with natriuretic and diuretic effect of chlorthalidone versus spironolactone at 24 and 72h. Mixed linear regression models were used to analyze the endpoints. Estimates were reported as least squares mean with their respective 95% confidence interval (CIs).

Results

The median age of the study population was 85 years (82.5–88.5), and 30 (68.2%) were women. The inferential multivariate analysis suggested a greater natriuretic and diuretic effect of chlorthalidone across K/Cr levels. In the upper category, chlorthalidone translated into a statistically increase in natriuresis at 24 and 72h. Chlorthalidone versus spironolactone showed ∆uNa of 25.7mmol/L at 24h (95% CI = -3.7 to 55.4, p = .098) and ∆uNa of 24.8mmol/L at 72h (95% CI = -4 to 53.6, p = .0106). The omnibus p value is .027. Multivariate analyses revealed a significant increase in 72h cumulative diuresis irrespective of K/Cr status in those on chlorthalidone.

Conclusions

In patients with AHF-pEF and suboptimal diuretic response, diuresis and natriuresis are higher with the administration of chlorthalidone over spironolactone. These data don't support the hypothesis that the K/Cr ratio can help guide the choice of thiazide diuretic versus MRA in AHF-pEF patients on loop diuretic.

### Usefulness of urinary potassium to creatinine ratio to predict diuretic response in patients with acute heart failure and preserved ejection fraction [^113VoVyF]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Fluid overload or fluid redistribution is the main reason for hospital admission in acute heart failure (AHF), followed by increased cardiac filling pressures. The mainstay of treatment for AHF consists of the administration of intravenous (i.v.) loop diuretics, with or without the addition of other diuretics. In most patients, administration of i.v. loop diuretics is sufficient to obtain clinical relief and mitigate signs of fluid overload. However, in some patients a sequential nephron blockage with additional diuretic is necessary. The evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of the diuretic sequence in patients with suboptimal loop diuretic response is scarce. Indeed, the benefit of adding thiazides to loop diuretics in patients with AHF is based on small observational studies and not on randomized clinical trials. In addition, the diuretic effect of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) in patients with diuretic resistance is controversial. We recently published that in patients with AHF treated with i.v. furosemide, the addition of chlorthalidone was associated with a short‐term greater natriuresis and urine output compared to addition of spironolactone. However, given that hyperaldosteronism is a key feature of diuretic resistance, and it translates into an increase in urine potassium levels, we hypothesize that high urine potassium will identify a subset of patients that benefits from MRA administration. Conversely, low urine potassium will identify those in which thiazides will provide a stronger natriuretic response.

In this work, we aimed to evaluate the role of urinary potassium to creatinine ratio (K/Cr) to predict diuretic and natriuretic response to thiazide or MRA in a cohort of patients with AHF with preserved ejection fraction (AHF‐pEF) and suboptimal loop diuretic response.

### Low-dose spironolactone in the management of resistant hypertension: a surveillance study [^115JnSFj]. Journal of Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Methods

We have conducted an open observational study of the use of spironolactone 25–50 mg in the management of patients with resistant hypertension. This drug was recommended in 133 patients who were already receiving an angiotensin-blocking drug in addition to other therapies.

Results

Of these, three defaulted from follow-up and 11 could not tolerate spironolactone. We therefore have outcome data on 119 patients. The addition of spironolactone (median dose 25 mg) was associated with a mean (SD) fall in systolic blood pressure of 21.7 mmHg (24.0; P < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure of 8.5 mmHg (14.9; P < 0.001). In two patients spironolactone had to be discontinued on account of a rise of serum potassium to above 6.0 mmol/l, whereas overall the mean increase in serum potassium was 0.3 mmol/l.

Conclusion

With careful monitoring of plasma electrolytes, spironolactone at a low dose is an effective add-in drug in patients with hypertension resistant to a regime that includes an angiotensin-blocking agent.

In addition, the recruiting physician could discontinue a participant from the study treatment at any time if it was considered necessary for any reason, including the following general rules:
Ineligibility (either arising during the study or retrospectively having been overlooked at screening).
Significant protocol deviation as judged by the trial physician.
Significant noncompliance with treatment regimen or study requirements.
An adverse event that requires discontinuation of the study medication or results in the inability to continue to comply with study procedures.
Disease progression that requires discontinuation of the study medication or results in the inability to continue to comply with study procedures.
Lost to follow-up.

Each participant also had the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the time from randomization until the first occurrence of any of the following events: death, hospitalization for heart disease (coronary heart disease, arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, sudden death or failed sudden death, defined as a cardiac arrest where the participant was successfully resuscitated), stroke, heart failure, transient ischemic attack or PAD, or first onset of any condition listed not present at baseline.

Prespecified secondary outcomes included changes in blood pressure, natriuretic peptides, ACR and eGFR recorded in the primary care record across follow-up, as well as rates of adverse events, including hyperkalemia and hypotension. Hyperkalemia was considered serum potassium of 5.5 mmol l −1 or greater, subcategorized as 5.5–5.9 mmol l −1, 6.0–6.4 mmol l −1 and ≥ 6.5 mmol l −1. Hypotension was defined as systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg or a drop in the systolic pressure of > 20 mm Hg on standing. Progression of kidney disease was defined as a ≥ 30% increase in creatinine from baseline, a drop of ≥ 25% in eGFR from baseline or a ≥ 20% drop in eGFR from the previous result.

An independent panel of three senior clinicians adjudicated each of the endpoints, using all the available clinical information independently of each other, with discussion determining the endpoint where there was initial disagreement.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^11628net]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — screening test interpretation and patient preparation — relies on combined interpretation of plasma aldosterone concentration, renin activity, and the aldosterone to renin activity ratio as the most accurate and reliable screening approach. Patients with primary aldosteronism typically have suppressed renin activity (< 1 ng/mL/h), most data support that the plasma aldosterone concentration should be at least 10 ng/dL to interpret the test as positive, and the most commonly used aldosterone to renin activity ratio cutoff is 30 (with plasma aldosterone in ng/dL and plasma renin activity in ng/mL/h), although some data support alternative thresholds (20 or 40). Patients should have unrestricted salt intake, serum potassium in the normal range, and ideally, MRA (eg, spironolactone or eplerenone) withdrawn for at least 4 weeks before testing, and additional evaluation may be indicated if the renin activity is suppressed; low screening rates may be due to barriers such as older medication-withdrawal guidance, which has since been disputed by growing evidence supporting screening despite treatment with most medications.

### Thiazide diuretics alone or combined with potassium-sparing diuretics to treat hypertension: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111poCTc]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Thiazide diuretics and thiazide-like diuretics (e.g. chlorthalidone and indapamide) were the primary drugs tested in landmark randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that demonstrated the high degree of efficacy of blood pressure (BP)-lowering in preventing major cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension. However, there are no RCTs comparing the efficacy of different thiazides, alone or combined with potassium-sparing diuretics, to prevent cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hypertension. Indirect comparisons by meta-analyses and evidence from observational studies returned conflicting results.

Comparisons of the BP-lowering effect of the several thiazides, alone and associated with potassium-sparing agents, have been rarely investigated in head-to-head clinical trials. The effect of amiloride and triamterene on BP remained uncertain and was not identified in a systematic review of six double-blind RCTs with a total of 496 participants. In two isolated trials, however, amiloride increased the BP-lowering effect of hydrochlorothiazide. Amiloride may be effective in resistant hypertension, particularly at higher doses. Potassium supplementation has a BP-lowering effect, and the replacement of a proportion of sodium chloride with potassium chloride in meals reduced BP. A pioneering nutritional RCT showed that replacing 25% of the sodium chloride content with potassium chloride was associated with reducing the incidence of major cardiovascular events and death. The antihypertensive efficacy of spironolactone and eplerenone have been well documented; however, these drugs are not commonly used with thiazides in fixed combinations.

Thiazides have been associated with adverse metabolic effects, including hypokalaemia, hyperglycaemia, hyponatremia, hyperuricemia, hyperlipidaemia and hypomagnesemia in a dose-dependent fashion. The risk of hypokalaemia, impaired glucose tolerance or sudden death may be minimized by combining thiazides with potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. spironolactone, eplerenone, amiloride or triamterene).

The critical role of potassium in BP control and the adverse effects of thiazide diuretics suggest that potassium-sparing diuretics can be effective adjuncts in treating hypertension. The scarcity of direct comparisons between thiazides alone with thiazides associated with potassium-sparing diuretics concerning their BP-lowering and adverse effects motivated this systematic review with a Bayesian network meta-analysis.

### Efficacy and safety of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists for the treatment of low-renin hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1157DfuG]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Seven studies were assessed as having a high risk of bias and the other ten studies were judged to have some concerns (Supplementary Table 2). Most trials did not have a trial protocol registered prospectively and allocation concealment was not reported. A potential carry-over effect of previous treatment was identified in three cross-over studies. The attrition rate was incompletely reported, especially in the studies in which LRH was a subgroup. Two out of the eight studies that reported dropout rates had high attrition of participants (> 20%).

Blood pressure

BP results are summarised in Supplementary Table 3. Fourteen studies reported changes in mean SBP and DBP. The remaining studies only reported a change in MAP, defined as DBP + pulse pressure/3.

MRA versus diuretics

Six studies reported changes in mean SBP and DBP: four cross-over and two parallel studies. Treatment duration ranged from four to twelve weeks. Spironolactone (50–400 mg/day) was compared to chlorthalidone (50–100 mg/day), hydrochlorothiazide (100–200 mg/day) or bendroflumethiazide (5 mg/day) (Table 1). One study compared spironolactone to a combination medication hydrochlorothiazide/triamterene. Triamterene, an ENaCi, is often used as an adjunct therapy due to its potassium-sparing properties but not as monotherapy due to its weak BP-lowering effect. Nevertheless, given that MRA also reduces ENaC activity, we have excluded this study from the meta-analysis to ensure clear comparisons of the different classes of medication.

### Primary aldosteronism, a common entity? the myth persists [^1147UM59]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Primary aldosterone excess or hyperaldosteronism is an important cause of hypertension which, when associated with an aldosterone secreting adenoma, is amenable to surgical cure. The biochemical hallmarks of the condition are a relative excess of aldosterone production with suppression of plasma levels of renin (a proxy for angiotensin II, the major trophic substance regulating aldosterone secretion). This combination of a high aldosterone and a low renin is however more commonly associated with 'nodular hyperplasia' of the adrenal glands, a condition not improved by surgery and variably responsive to the effects of the mineralocorticoid antagonist, spironolactone. Until recently the prevalence of either form of secondary hypertension has been thought to be low such that few clinicians 'hunted' for it in the absence of hypokalaemia (the traditional clue for the syndrome). This view has been challenged, firstly by the realisation that no more than 50% of such patients will have a low plasma potassium and secondly by the assumption that a 'normal' plasma aldosterone is in fact inappropriately elevated if the renin level is low. A single measurement of the ratio of aldosterone to renin levels is claimed to be highly predictive of patients who will have primary aldosterone excess. This paper examines the logic behind such claims and presents evidence from the literature that an abnormal ratio is simply a different description of the low renin state and that such patients do not necessarily have mineralocorticoid hypertension. Most patients 'discovered' by this test will have what many call low-renin hypertension, a condition not amenable to specific therapy. Claims that they are peculiarly sensitive to the hypotensive effects of spironolactone have not been tested in controlled trials. The test would however be expected to pick up those individuals with true Conn's syndrome but such patients remain too few in number to justify widespread use of an expensive screening test.

### Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide [^111K3fjM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Mechanism of Action

Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are a combination of two diuretic agents with different but complementary mechanisms and sites of action, thereby providing additive diuretic and antihypertensive effects. Additionally, the spironolactone component helps to minimize the potassium loss characteristically induced by the thiazide component.

The diuretic effect of spironolactone is mediated through its action as a specific pharmacologic antagonist of aldosterone, primarily by competitive binding of receptors at the aldosterone-dependent sodium-potassium exchange site in the distal convoluted renal tubule. Hydrochlorothiazide promotes the excretion of sodium and water primarily by inhibiting their reabsorption in the cortical diluting segment of the distal renal tubule.

Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are effective in significantly lowering the systolic and diastolic blood pressure in many patients with essential hypertension, even when aldosterone secretion is within normal limits.

Both spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide reduce exchangeable sodium, plasma volume, body weight, and blood pressure. The diuretic and antihypertensive effects of the individual components are potentiated when spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide are given concurrently.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Spironolactone, an ingredient of spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, has been shown to be a tumorigen in chronic toxicity studies in rats (see PRECAUTIONS section). Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be used only in those conditions described below. Unnecessary use of this drug should be avoided.

Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for:

Edematous conditions for patients with:

Congestive heart failure:

For the management of edema and sodium retention when the patient is only partially responsive to, or is intolerant of, other therapeutic measures;
The treatment of diuretic-induced hypokalemia in patients with congestive heart failure when other measures are considered inappropriate;
The treatment of patients with congestive heart failure taking digitalis when other therapies are considered inadequate or inappropriate.

Cirrhosis of the liver accompanied by edema and/or ascites:

Aldosterone levels may be exceptionally high in this condition. Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for maintenance therapy together with bed rest and the restriction of fluid and sodium.

The nephrotic syndrome:

For nephrotic patients when treatment of the underlying disease, restriction of fluid and sodium intake, and the use of other diuretics do not provide an adequate response.

### Chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension treatment after myocardial infarction or stroke: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^111kb4EC]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Hypokalemia has been associated with an increased risk of adverse CV outcomes. A meta-analysis of 13 cohort studies suggested a progressively increasing risk for mortality associated with hypokalemia starting at a potassium value of 3.5 mEq/L. Hypokalemia and its association with an increased risk for CV outcomes have been limiting factors for the use of high-dose diuretic therapy. A meta-analysis of 18 RCTs comparing high-dose vs low-dose diuretic therapy demonstrated a reduction in coronary heart disease and all-cause mortality associated with low-dose diuretics. Similarly, a secondary analysis of the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program trial, which compared CTD with placebo in older individuals, demonstrated an increased risk of CV events in those taking CTD who developed hypokalemia (potassium level < 3.5 mEq/L) compared with those who did not. The DCP trial was a pragmatic RCT with the assumption being that the doses of CTD and HCTZ were pharmacologically comparable. This was demonstrated by similar clinical BP values observed over the course of the trial. We also assumed that hypokalemia would be the same between groups and managed similarly, but this was not the case, as evidenced by the increased incidence of a nadir potassium level less than 3.1 mEq/L associated with CTD both overall in the DCP trial and specifically in participants without a prior MI or stroke. It is unclear why those with a prior MI or stroke had a greater incidence of mild hypokalemia but no greater incidence of moderate to severe hypokalemia or hospitalization for hypokalemia in the CTD group compared with the HCTZ group. Generally, patients were taking similar doses of HCTZ at baseline (6379 of 6756 [94.4%] and 6402 of 6767 [94.6%] were receiving 25 mg of HCTZ at baseline in the CTD and HCTZ group, respectively), and there was no difference in BP between treatment groups over the trial duration. Additionally, while those with prior MI or stroke were more likely to be taking an ACE inhibitor, ARB, and/or MRA at baseline, use of these classes of medications did not substantially change over the study course. On average, those in the group with prior MI or stroke had a greater number of outpatient visits over the duration of the study. The difference in use of potassium supplements without severe hypokalemia may have been the result of greater recognition of mild hypokalemia and greater treatment associated with the greater frequency of visits in this high-risk subgroup. However, the absolute number of moderate to severe hypokalemic events was greater in this group compared with the group without prior MI or stroke.

### Comparison of clinical outcomes and safety associated with chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide in older adults with varying levels of kidney function [^111ie4ew]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

We did observe a higher risk of hypokalemia associated with chlorthalidone use compared with hydrochlorothiazide use, which is consistent with prior observational studies. In our primary analysis, we found that chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide use was associated with a HR for hypokalemia of 1.70 (95% CI, 1.55–1.1.87), which is actually lower than that reported in other observational studies. This may be associated with the intention-to-treat design, as our as-treated sensitivity analysis found a HR for hypokalemia more on par those prior studies. Our study expands on these prior works by demonstrating that this increased risk for hypokalemia persists even after dose matching between chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide. In addition, we now demonstrate that the excess risk for hypokalemia associated with chlorthalidone was attenuated in participants with reduced kidney function. Perhaps this reflects reduced drug concentrations at the nephron level in participants with CKD or reduced baseline potassium excretion as kidney function declines.

What are some potential clinical implications of a higher risk of hypokalemia associated with chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide? Numerous studies have demonstrated that hypokalemia in patients with hypertension receiving diuretics is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and death. In our study, chlorthalidone use was associated with a 70% increased risk of hypokalemia compared with hydrochlorothiazide, which was observed primarily by participants with preserved eGFR. One could postulate that the higher rates of hypokalemia associated with chlorthalidone from our study (particularly among those with preserved eGFR) may have contributed to our findings regarding cardiovascular events and mortality. Notably, among participants with eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2, in whom there was no significant difference in hypokalemia, we also found no significant difference in cardiovascular events or mortality. However, prospective or interventional studies will be necessary to more fully understand this link.

### Comparison of cardiovascular and safety outcomes of chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide to treat hypertension [^114KJgdd]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Our observational analysis across 3 large and disparate databases showed no significant difference in the effectiveness of chlorthalidone compared with hydrochlorothiazide for a range of cardiovascular outcomes, but chlorthalidone had a worse safety profile, including an association with an increased risk of hypokalemia with an HR of 2.72 (95% CI, 2.38–3.12). Other electrolyte abnormalities were also more frequent.

Our study is the largest multisite analysis of real-world evidence to address this comparison, with 36 918 records of individuals prescribed chlorthalidone and 693 337 prescribed hydrochlorothiazide across the 3 databases. We found consistent results across our 3 databases, excellent balance on more than 60 000 covariates after stratification, little bias based on our controls, little sensitivity to changes in time at risk, to inclusion of baseline blood pressure or to initial dose, and confirmation of differences in potassium by laboratory measurement.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for hypertension, more specifically with respect to assessment of treatment response, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining serum potassium monitoring in patients with CKD or taking potassium-sparing medications, such as some diuretics, ACEis, ARBs, or spironolactone, if dietary potassium is being increased.

### Comparison of cardiovascular and safety outcomes of chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide to treat hypertension [^115LjBfE]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

A simple difference in effective dose, with chlorthalidone known to have a greater-per-milligram potency for lowering blood pressure levels than hydrochlorothiazide, could underlie some of the observed differences in toxicities, but our dose-sensitivity analysis still revealed higher hypokalemia for chlorthalidone at a 1:2 chlorthalidone:hydrochlorothiazide dose ratio. Furthermore, if clinicians treat to similar blood pressure levels, then they may titrate the doses to levels with similar blood pressure reduction, explaining our lack of differences in effectiveness but not our differences in safety. Ernst et alfound better chlorthalidone nighttime blood pressure control at a 1:2 dose ratio, which could explain some increased safety signals.

The literature inconsistently points to a difference in hypokalemia between the 2 drugs. At a 1:2 dose ratio, Ernst et alfound little difference in potassium. At a 1:1 dose ratio, Bakris et alfound no statistically significant difference in the hypokalemia rate although with only 5 events, the study lacked power. The network meta-analysis by Ernst et alfound a small difference in potassium reduction. Two analyses of the MRFIT cohort, showed increased reduction of potassium for chlorthalidone when both drugs were used at high doses (50 mg-100 mg). A study of real-world evidence by Dhalla et alshowed odds ratios around 3 for hypokalemia, matching our results well, even in the 2 strata in which chlorthalidone was half the dose of hydrochlorothiazide; it also found an HR of 1.68 for hyponatremia.

Limitations

Our main limitation is the possibility of residual confounding including confounding by indication, differences in physician characteristics that may be associated with drug choice, concomitant use of other drugs started after the index date, differences in blood pressure measurement error, and informative censoring at the end of the on-treatment periods. To minimize this risk, we used newer methods to account for bias and to detect residual bias through our negative and positive controls.

### Atenolol and chlorthalidone tablet (Atenolol and chlorthalidone) [^114VQoSG]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

Atenolol and chlorthalidone may aggravate peripheral arterial circulatory disorders.

Electrolyte and Fluid Balance Status

Periodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals.

Patients should be observed for clinical signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance; i.e., hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, and hypokalemia. Serum and urine electrolyte determinations are particularly important when the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving parenteral fluids. Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance include dryness of the mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting.

Measurement of potassium levels is appropriate especially in elderly patients, those receiving digitalis preparations for cardiac failure, patients whose dietary intake of potassium is abnormally low, or those suffering from gastrointestinal complaints.

Hypokalemia may develop especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present, or during concomitant use of corticosteroids or ACTH.

Interference with adequate oral electrolyte intake will also contribute to hypokalemia. Hypokalemia can sensitize or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis (e.g., increased ventricular irritability). Hypokalemia may be avoided or treated by use of potassium supplements or foods with a high potassium content.

Any chloride deficit during thiazide therapy is generally mild and usually does not require specific treatment except under extraordinary circumstances (as in liver disease or renal disease). Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather; appropriate therapy is water restriction rather than administration of salt except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life-threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^111K9iw2]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Resistant hypertension — spironolactone add-on therapy: For patients with resistant hypertension (defined as those who are not adequately controlled with maximally tolerated dose of triple therapy [i.e., a thiazide-type diuretic, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker]), we suggest adding spironolactone in those patients without contraindications (Weak for | Reviewed, New-replaced). The mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone more effectively reduced SBP and DBP compared to placebo when added as the fourth agent to the treatment regimen of patients with resistant HTN, and in patients with a history of hyperkalemia and diminished renal function, spironolactone should be used cautiously and with frequent monitoring of potassium and renal function.

### Dose doubling, relative potency, and dose equivalence of potassium-sparing diuretics affecting blood pressure and serum potassium: systematic review and meta-analyses [^115p4enL]. Journal of Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Potassium-sparing diuretics (PSDs) are valuable antihypertensives with additional benefits unrelated to control of systolic blood pressure (SBP). However, their key parameters affecting SBP and serum potassium are poorly defined, fostering underutilization.

Method

Consequently, we conducted systematic reviews and meta-analyses, yielding 3668 articles and ultimately 84 randomized comparisons.

Results

For office SBP, overall placebo-adjusted changes were triamterene -1.9 (low dose only), amiloride -9.9, spironolactone -13.2, and eplerenone -9.2. Differences in antihypertensive effect were due to potency rather than efficacy. Doubling amiloride, eplerenone, and spironolactone doses reduced SBP (95% confidence limits) on average by -2.3 (-3.1, -1.5). Relative antihypertensive potencies were spironolactone > amiloride > eplerenone. Spironolactone had significantly greater antihypertensive potency than amiloride, -4.0 (-7.4, -0.6), and eplerenone, -5.5 (-7.4, -3.6). Dose equivalencies were eplerenone-spironolactone 4.5-to-1 (e.g., eplerenone 125∼spironolactone 25), amiloride-spironolactone 3.3-to-1, and eplerenone-amiloride 1.4-to-1. Increases in serum potassium from amiloride and spironolactone at commonly used doses averaged 0.14–0.29mEq/l; the dose doubling effect was 0.16 (0.10, 0.22). Spironolactone caused greater hyperkalemia than amiloride across their dose ranges: 0.14, P = 0.043. Seven features make important bias unlikely: a comprehensive literature search, adjustment for covariates, all models explaining 95–100% of the between-study variability, similar dose doubling effects among PSDs, two different methods giving the same potency sequence, similar results from double blind comparisons, and similar results for eplerenone versus spironolactone from analysing direct comparison data (i.e., no meta-regression) for office and 24-h SBP.

Conclusion

This synthesis accomplishes for PSDs what has already been achieved for thiazide-type diuretics and other antihypertensives and can guide the application of these underutilized medicines.

### A randomized, multicenter, open-label, blinded end point trial comparing the effects of spironolactone to chlorthalidone on left ventricular mass in patients with early-stage chronic kidney disease: rationale and design of the SPIRO-CKD trial [^113vL8hE]. American Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Run-in phase

For those patients wanting to take part but not immediately eligible because they are either on existing diuretic therapy or not taking ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy or taking both of these agents, a 4- to 6-week run-in phase is used. For patients on existing loop or thiazide diuretic therapy who wish to take part in the trial, after obtaining consent, diuretic therapy is stopped, and the patient is reviewed after 4 weeks to ensure that he/she meets the eligibility criteria (Table I). For patients not on ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy, after obtaining consent, an ACE inhibitor or ARB of the physician's choice is introduced and titrated to a well-tolerated therapeutic dose over a 4-week period. The patient is then reviewed to ensure eligibility. For patients on dual ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy, after obtaining consent, either the ACE inhibitor or the ARB is stopped. Patients are then reviewed to ensure eligibility. Those patients who fulfill all entry criteria are consented and randomized into the main SPIRO-CKD trial.

Randomization

Once informed consent is received and the baseline assessments completed, patients are entered into the main SPIRO-CKD trial. Participants are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either spironolactone (25 mg once a day) or chlorthalidone (half a 50-mg tablet once a day, as there are no 25-mg tablets available for use in the UK) for 40 weeks without blinding. A secure central randomization service was provided by the Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit (University of Birmingham) using a computer-generated program, using a minimization algorithm to ensure balance between the arms with regard to the important clinical variables of blood pressure, age, and gender. Compliance with treatment is monitored by study coordinators using tablet counting.

### Comparison of clinical outcomes and safety associated with chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide in older adults with varying levels of kidney function [^111XoXQr]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the safety and clinical outcomes associated with chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide use among older adults with varying levels of kidney function?

Findings

In this cohort study of 12 722 older adults, chlorthalidone use was associated with a higher risk for eGFR decline of 30% or more, cardiovascular events, and hypokalemia compared with hydrochlorothiazide use. The excess risk of hypokalemia with chlorthalidone was attenuated in participants with reduced kidney function.

Meaning

These findings suggest that there is no clear reason to prefer chlorthalidone over hydrochlorothiazide, although further randomized clinical trials may provide clarity into the comparative effectiveness of these 2 medications.

Search strategy and information sources

Searches were performed in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus and LILACS. ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for possible results in unpublished studies, and the Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC [ProQuest]) was searched for results in nonindexed journals or other reporting forms, all from inception to 15 September 2021, with no language restrictions. To improve search strategy sensitivity, the strategies were developed using Medline subject heading (MeSH) terms, synonyms and Boolean operators (where possible). Keywords and MeSH terms were as follows: 'hydrochlorothiazide', 'chlorothiazide', 'bendroflumethiazide', 'hydroflumethiazide', 'cyclopenthiazide', 'chlorthalidone', 'metolazone', 'indapamide', 'mefruside', 'xipamide', 'bemetizide', 'spironolactone', 'eplerenone', 'amiloride', 'triamterene', 'thiazide diuretics', 'inhibitor of the epithelial sodium channel', 'potassium sparing diuretic' and 'hypertension'. Comprehensive search strategies are provided in the Supplement (Search Strategy).

Study selection

An electronic database was exported to reference manager software (EndNote X9), and duplicates were removed. Titles and abstracts were independently selected by pairs of independent reviewers using the liberal accelerated approach. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or by a third reviewer. Authors were contacted to seek any potential unpublished outcomes.

Data extraction and items

The following data were extracted: study characteristics, baseline characteristics of participants, interventions and comparators, and outcomes.

The interventions of interest were classified as thiazide diuretic alone or thiazide diuretic combined with a potassium-sparing diuretic and further stratified according to the mean daily dose. The doses of the interventions were categorized as proportions of the manufacturer's recommended starting dose: low-dose (< 2 × start dose) and high-dose (≥ 2 × start dose). The starting dose of hydrochlorothiazide was 25 mg because chlorthalidone is 1.5–2 times as effective as hydrochlorothiazide for lowering BP.

Data on drugs and doses are presented in Table S1 in the Supplement. The full glossary of extracted variables with their definitions is available at.

### Endocrine and haemodynamic changes in resistant hypertension, and blood pressure responses to spironolactone or amiloride: the PATHWAY-2 mechanisms substudies [^115zV8Er]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

Implications of all the available evidence

We propose that spironolactone, or amiloride if spironolactone is not tolerated, should be first-line treatment for resistant hypertension, in addition to background treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, a calcium channel blocker, and a diuretic, in patients with an eGFR greater than 45 mL/min/1.73m 2 and serum potassium within the normal range. Among this cohort are likely to be some — perhaps many — patients whose hypertension is caused by primary aldosteronism. We encourage a reconsideration of which diagnostic thresholds for primary aldosteronism are appropriate in patients with resistant hypertension, to facilitate recognition of a potentially curable aldosterone-producing adenomas in patients with resistant hypertension.

Understanding the mechanism of the blood pressure-lowering superiority of spironolactone in resistant hypertension would help to delineate the pathophysiological basis of resistant hypertension and provide a rationale for developing alternative treatment strategies for patients in whom spironolactone is poorly tolerated. The hypothesis underpinning PATHWAY-2 was that resistant hypertension is predominantly a sodium-retaining state (despite background treatment with thiazide-type diuretics) and that further diuretic (more correctly, natriuretic) treatment would be the most effective means of lowering blood pressure.PATHWAY-2 incorporated a series of prespecified hormonal and haemodynamic measurements designed to facilitate investigation of the pathophysiology of resistant hypertension and its drug treatment. We now report the results of these analyses, which address three clinically important questions.

### Atenolol and chlorthalidone [^116AdUZz]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

Atenolol and chlorthalidone tablets may aggravate peripheral arterial circulatory disorders.

Information for Patients

Hypoglycemia

Inform patients or caregivers that there is a risk of hypoglycemia when atenolol and chlorthalidone tablets are given to patients who are fasting or who are vomiting. Monitor for symptoms of hypoglycemia.

Electrolyte and Fluid Balance Status

Periodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals.

Patients should be observed for clinical signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance; i.e., hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, and hypokalemia. Serum and urine electrolyte determinations are particularly important when the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving parenteral fluids. Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance include dryness of the mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting.

Measurement of potassium levels is appropriate especially in elderly patients, those receiving digitalis preparations for cardiac failure, patients whose dietary intake of potassium is abnormally low, or those suffering from gastrointestinal complaints.

Hypokalemia may develop especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present, or during concomitant use of corticosteroids or ACTH.

Interference with adequate oral electrolyte intake will also contribute to hypokalemia. Hypokalemia can sensitize or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis (e.g., increased ventricular irritability). Hypokalemia may be avoided or treated by use of potassium supplements or foods with a high potassium content.

Any chloride deficit during thiazide therapy is generally mild and usually does not require specific treatment except under extraordinary circumstances (as in liver disease or renal disease). Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather; appropriate therapy is water restriction rather than administration of salt except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life-threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.

### Chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide and kidney outcomes in patients with hypertension: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^115dzFc1]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

Overall results from this secondary analysis of the DCP demonstrate that chlorthalidone was not superior to hydrochlorothiazide for kidney outcomes at the doses observed. There was a greater tendency for a higher incidence of hypokalemia in those randomized to chlorthalidone compared with hydrochlorothiazide even in those with CKD, although the incidence and difference between the groups were small. Given these findings, clinicians should feel more confident in using either agent for the treatment of hypertension.

### Refractory versus resistant hypertension [^115Et26S]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Refractory hypertension is a recently proposed phenotype of antihypertensive treatment failure. As such it represents an extreme subtype of resistant or difficult-to-treat hypertension. Resistant hypertension is relatively common with an estimated prevalence of 10–20% of treated hypertensive patients. It is typically defined as having an uncontrolled blood pressure on three or more antihypertensive medications, including a diuretic. Refractory hypertension is rare with a prevalence of approximately 5% of patients with uncontrolled resistant hypertension. It is defined as an uncontrolled blood pressure with the use of five or more antihypertensive medications, including a long-acting thiazide diuretic, such as chlorthalidone, and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist such as spironolactone.

Recent Findings

Persistent excess fluid retention is thought to commonly underlie development of resistant hypertension, recent studies suggest that refractory may be more likely attributable to heightened sympathetic output as opposed to inappropriate fluid retention.

Summary

Treatment recommendations for resistant hypertension are generally based on intensification of diuretic therapy, especially with combined use of chlorthalidone and spironolactone. Although fuller elucidation is needed, such an approach may not be appropriate for refractory hypertension, which instead, may require effective sympathetic inhibition, either with medications or device-based approaches.

Mineralocorticoid antagonists in HFpEF — MRAs significantly improve measures of diastolic function in individuals with HFpEF, and spironolactone may reduce the risk of hospitalizations for HF in specific subsets of individuals with HFpEF; however, appropriate monitoring of potassium and kidney function are warranted to reduce the risk of hyperkalemia and worsening kidney function. In TOPCAT, 3,445 individuals with HF and LVEF ≥ 45% were randomized to spironolactone (15–45 mg daily) or placebo; the initially published results did not show a significant benefit in the primary composite outcome (HR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.77–1.04), although there was a significant reduction in hospitalization for HF (HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.69–0.99).

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115Rhs2M]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — choice of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist: In individuals with primary aldosteronism receiving PA-specific medical therapy, we suggest spironolactone over other mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) due to its low cost and widespread availability. The recommendation is driven by the availability and low cost of spironolactone over other MRAs; however, all MRAs, when titrated to equivalent potencies, are anticipated to have similar efficacy in treating primary aldosteronism, and MRAs with greater mineralocorticoid receptor selectivity and fewer androgen/progesterone receptor-mediated side effects may be preferred; when initiating an MRA, consider hypertension severity for dosing and potential discontinuation of other antihypertensive medications, and monitor potassium, renal function, renin (concentration or activity), and blood pressure response during follow-up to guide MRA dose titration.

### Spironolactone [^111j2vUr]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.1 Drugs and Supplements Increasing Serum Potassium

Concomitant administration of spironolactone with potassium supplementation or drugs that can increase potassium may lead to severe hyperkalemia. In general, discontinue potassium supplementation in heart failure patients who start spironolactone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Check serum potassium levels when ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy is altered in patients receiving spironolactone.

Examples of drugs that can increase potassium include:

ACE inhibitors
angiotensin receptor blockers
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
heparin and low molecular weight heparin
trimethoprim

7.2 Lithium

Like other diuretics, spironolactone reduces the renal clearance of lithium, thus increasing the risk of lithium toxicity. Monitor lithium levels periodically when spironolactone is coadministered [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.3 Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)

In some patients, the administration of an NSAID can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effect of diuretics. Therefore, when spironolactone and NSAIDs are used concomitantly, monitor closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.4 Digoxin

Spironolactone and its metabolites interfere with radioimmunoassays for digoxin and increase the apparent exposure to digoxin. It is unknown to what extent, if any, spironolactone may increase actual digoxin exposure. In patients taking concomitant digoxin, use an assay that does not interact with spironolactone.

7.5 Cholestyramine

Hyperkalemic metabolic acidosis has been reported in patients given spironolactone concurrently with cholestyramine.

7.6 Acetylsalicylic Acid

Acetylsalicylic acid may reduce the efficacy of spironolactone. Therefore, when spironolactone and acetylsalicylic acid are used concomitantly, spironolactone may need to be titrated to higher maintenance dose and the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect is obtained [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.7 Abiraterone

Spironolactone binds to the androgen receptor and may increase prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in abiraterone-treated prostate cancer patients. Concomitant use of spironolactone and abiraterone is not recommended.

### Spironolactone [^113ss86n]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Spironolactone and its active metabolites are specific pharmacologic antagonists of aldosterone, acting primarily through competitive binding of receptors at the aldosterone-dependent sodium-potassium exchange site in the distal convoluted renal tubule. Spironolactone causes increased amounts of sodium and water to be excreted, while potassium is retained. Spironolactone acts both as a diuretic and as an antihypertensive drug by this mechanism. It may be given alone or with other diuretic agents that act more proximally in the renal tubule.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Aldosterone antagonist activity: Increased levels of the mineralocorticoid, aldosterone, are present in primary and secondary hyperaldosteronism. Edematous states in which secondary aldosteronism is usually involved include congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome. By competing with aldosterone for receptor sites, spironolactone provides effective therapy for the edema and ascites in those conditions.

Spironolactone counteracts secondary aldosteronism induced by the volume depletion and associated sodium loss caused by active diuretic therapy.

### Management of hypertension in advanced kidney disease [^11493DcS]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this study was to present recent developments in pharmacotherapy of hypertension in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Recent Findings

In the AMBER trial, compared with placebo, the potassium-binder patiromer mitigated the risk of hyperkalaemia and enabled more patients with uncontrolled resistant hypertension and stage 3b/4 CKD to tolerate and continue spironolactone treatment; add-on therapy with spironolactone provoked a clinically meaningful reduction of 11-12mmHg in unattended automated office SBP over 12weeks of follow-up. In the BLOCK-CKD trial, the investigational nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid-receptor-antagonist (MRA) KBP-5074 lowered office SBP by 7-10mmHg relative to placebo at 84days with a minimal risk of hyperkalaemia in patients with advanced CKD and uncontrolled hypertension. The CLICK trial showed that the thiazide-like diuretic chlorthalidone provoked a placebo-subtracted reduction of 10.5mmHg in 24-h ambulatory SBP at 12weeks in patients with stage 4 CKD and poorly controlled hypertension.

Summary

Enablement of more persistent spironolactone use with newer potassium-binding agents, the clinical development of novel nonsteroidal MRAs with a more favourable benefit-risk profile and the recently proven blood pressure lowering action of chlorthalidone are three therapeutic opportunities for more effective management of hypertension in high-risk patients with advanced CKD.

### Medication adherence-still the holy grail [^113eFzR6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite the plethora of evidence suggesting that fixed‐dose combination products improve medication adherence and satisfaction, they are rarely used in the United States. Why do practitioners not opt to prescribe fixed‐dose combination antihypertensive products? We have often heard from practitioners that an important barrier is lack of options, both in drug and dose selection. Although there are a seemingly large number of combinations currently marketed in the United States (Table), a single diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide) is present in some three quarters of products and others include seldom‐used drugs (eg, timolol, spironolactone, aliskiren) or combinations (eg, hydrochlorothiazide+amiloride, chlorthalidone+clonidine). Furthermore, it is true that dosing options are often limited to combinations of low, moderate, or high doses, but no other permutations of these. For example, it is not currently possible to use a fixed‐dose combination for 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide/day+a low‐dose of an angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor or ARB. We would argue that low‐dose combinations are likely sufficient and nearly as effective as higher dose combinations for most patients; however, practitioners may have legitimate reasons for wanting to maximize a single antihypertensive among a multidrug regimen. The current array of combination products is largely a byproduct of the antihypertensive drug development pipeline, with new products added as new classes emerged (eg, hydrochlorothiazide + angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors or ARBs). Regrettably, most generic manufacturers do not seem inclined to market additional options to address these issues, perhaps in part because of findings of infrequent use such as observed by Mobley et al.

Infrequent use of fixed‐dose combinations may also be because of practitioners' preference to titrate 1 drug at a time. However, available data indicate that most patients with hypertension require more than 1 drug to achieve adequate BP lowering, and it is known that lower doses of drugs from different classes provide greater BP lowering than a single drug class at higher dose. It may also be that once a patient is titrated to optimal doses of multiple medications, prescribers simply continue the status quo, renewing the multiple medications, rather than converting the patient to a fixed‐dose combination product once optimal drugs/doses have been identified. Automated alerts built into electronic health systems that prompt prescribers to switch to equivalent fixed‐dose combination product matching might ameliorate some of these issues and improve adherence with available hypertension treatment guidelines and improve patient adherence with complicated antihypertensive medication regimens.

Adverse Events

Throughout the trial, the incidence of acute kidney injury requiring hospitalization was similar between groups (391 [6.4%] in the chlorthalidone group and 379 [6.2%] in the hydrochlorothiazide group; P = 0.63) (Table 3). Those randomized to the chlorthalidone group had an increased incidence of hypokalemia (potassium < 3.1 mEq/L [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1]; 400 [6.5%] in the chlorthalidone group vs 293 [4.8%] in the hydrochlorothiazide group; P < .001). There was also a greater incidence of hospitalizations for hypokalemia in those randomized to chlorthalidone (213 [3.5%]) compared with hydrochlorothiazide (179 [2.9%]), although this difference was not significantly different (P = 0.07). When stratified by baseline CKD status, the difference in hypokalemia (potassium < 3.1 mEq/dL) remained similar in those with and without CKD, with a difference of 1.8% and 1.3%, respectively. Only those without CKD had an increased risk of hospitalization for hypokalemia in the chlorthalidone group (161 [3.6%]) compared with the hydrochlorothiazide group (123 [2.7%]) (P = 0.03) (eTable 4 in Supplement 2).

### Atenolol and chlorthalidone (Tenoretic) [^117VrXBb]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

General

TENORETIC may aggravate peripheral arterial circulatory disorders.

Information for Patients

Inform patients or caregivers that there is a risk of hypoglycemia when TENORETIC is given to patients who are fasting or who are vomiting. Monitor for symptoms of hypoglycemia.

Electrolyte and Fluid Balance Status

Periodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals.

Patients should be observed for clinical signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance; i.e., hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, and hypokalemia. Serum and urine electrolyte determinations are particularly important when the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving parenteral fluids. Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance include dryness of the mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting.

Measurement of potassium levels is appropriate especially in elderly patients, those receiving digitalis preparations for cardiac failure, patients whose dietary intake of potassium is abnormally low, or those suffering from gastrointestinal complaints.

Hypokalemia may develop especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present, or during concomitant use of corticosteroids or ACTH.

Interference with adequate oral electrolyte intake will also contribute to hypokalemia. Hypokalemia can sensitize or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis (e.g., increased ventricular irritability). Hypokalemia may be avoided or treated by use of potassium supplements or foods with a high potassium content.

Any chloride deficit during thiazide therapy is generally mild and usually does not require specific treatment except under extraordinary circumstances (as in liver disease or renal disease). Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather; appropriate therapy is water restriction rather than administration of salt except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life-threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.

A full description of the methodology and protocol of this investigation has been published. The present report was generated according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Network Meta-analysis (PRISMA-NMA) guidelines. The protocol of this network meta-analysis was prospectively registered at the PROSPERO database (CRD42018118492), published and deposited in a public repository (the Open Science Framework).

Eligibility criteria

Adults with primary hypertension.

Interventions and comparators

Interventions of interest were thiazide diuretics alone (hydrochlorothiazide, chlorothiazide, butizide, bendroflumethiazide, hydroflumethiazide, trichlormethiazide, methyclothiazide, polythiazide, cyclothiazide, cyclopenthiazide, chlorthalidone, metolazone, quinethazone, fenquizone, clorexolone, clopamide, indapamide, diapamide, isodapamide, mefruside, xipamide, bemetizide, benzthiazide or chlorazanil) or combined with a potassium-sparing diuretic (spironolactone, eplerenone, amiloride and triamterene).

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the mean difference in office SBP. Safety outcomes were the mean difference in biochemical abnormalities (potassium, uric acid, fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C and triglycerides) and the incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancer.

Study design

Double-blind placebo or active-controlled RCTs (parallel, crossover or factorial) with a follow-up period between 3 and 52 weeks were included. Crossover studies were included if there were at least 2 weeks of washout between study phases.

### Does aldosterone-to-renin ratio predict the antihypertensive effect of the aldosterone antagonist spironolactone? [^111Pxaem]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The recognition that some 10% to 15% of the hypertensive population may have aldosterone excess has increased the frequency of measurement of the aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) and the use of aldosterone antagonists. Whether this ratio will predict the blood pressure (BP) response to spironolactone is not clear.

Methods

We correlated the BP response to spironolactone 50 mg/day to baseline ARR in 69 hypertensive patients (mean [± SD] age 57 ± 2 years, 65% male), consisting of 39 subjects with long-standing hypertension (4.0 ± 0.2 years) whose hypertension was uncontrolled on at least three antihypertensive medications and 30 previously untreated patients who were randomized in a cross-over design to receive either spironolactone 50 mg/day or bendroflumethiazide 2.5 mg/day for 4 weeks.

Results

After 4 weeks of spironolactone, BP in patients with never-treated hypertension was reduced by 18 ± 3 / 11 ± 1 mm Hg. There was a highly significant correlation between log ARR and the fall in systolic BP (r = 0.69, P < .001) and diastolic BP (r = 0.45, P < .05). Nine of ten patients with low renin activity (≤ 0.5 ng/mL/h) showed a > 20-mm Hg fall in systolic BP. No such correlations were seen when BP was reduced by bendroflumethazide 2.5 mg. For patients with resistant hypertension, despite a BP reduction of 28 ± 3 / 13 ± 2 mm Hg after 14 weeks of spironolactone, there was no relationship between the reduction in BP and the ARR; however, subjects with pretreatment potassium < 4.0 mmol/L had a greater response than those with levels ≥ 4.0 mmol/L (34 ± 3 / 16 ± 2 v 20 ± 6 / 8 ± 3 mm Hg, P < .05)

Conclusions

Based on the study results, ARR and low renin activity may predict the response to spironolactone in never-treated hypertensive patients but not in patients taking antihypertensive drugs, possibly because of the effect of these agents on ARR. In such patients a trial of spironolactone is required to assess the BP response.

### Spironolactone-induced renal insufficiency and hyperkalemia in patients with heart failure [^114AAF12]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Background

A previous randomized controlled trial evaluating the use of spironolactone in heart failure patients reported a low risk of hyperkalemia (2%) and renal insufficiency (0%). Because treatments for heart failure have changed since the benefits of spironolactone were reported, the prevalence of these complications may differ in current clinical practice. We therefore sought to determine the prevalence and clinical associations of hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency in heart failure patients treated with spironolactone.

Methods

We performed a case control study of heart failure patients treated with spironolactone in our clinical practice. Cases were patients who developed hyperkalemia (K(+) > 5.0 mEq/L) or renal insufficiency (Cr ≥ 2.5 mg/dL), and they were compared to 2 randomly selected controls per case. Clinical characteristics, medications, and serum chemistries at baseline and follow-up time periods were compared.

Results

Sixty-seven of 926 patients (7.2%) required discontinuation of spironolactone due to hyperkalemia (n = 33) or renal failure (n = 34). Patients who developed hyperkalemia were older and more likely to have diabetes, had higher baseline serum potassium levels and lower baseline potassium supplement doses, and were more likely to be treated with beta-blockers than controls (n = 134). Patients who developed renal insufficiency had lower baseline body weight and higher baseline serum creatinine, required higher doses of loop diuretics, and were more likely to be treated with thiazide diuretics than controls.

Conclusions

Spironolactone-induced hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency are more common in our clinical experience than reported previously. This difference is explained by patient comorbidities and more frequent use of beta-blockers.

### Spironolactone (Aldactone) [^1119WZC4]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

1.3	Edema Associated with Hepatic Cirrhosis or Nephrotic Syndrome

ALDACTONE is indicated for the management of edema in the following settings:

Cirrhosis of the liver when edema is not responsive to fluid and sodium restriction.
Nephrotic syndrome when treatment of the underlying disease, restriction of fluid and sodium intake, and the use of other diuretics produce an inadequate response.

Because it increases serum potassium, ALDACTONE may be useful for treating edema when administration of other diuretics has caused hypokalemia.

1.4	Primary Hyperaldosteronism

ALDACTONE is indicated in the following settings:

Short-term preoperative treatment of patients with primary hyperaldosteronism.
Long-term maintenance therapy for patients with discrete aldosterone-producing adrenal adenomas who are not candidates for surgery.
Long-term maintenance therapy for patients with bilateral micro or macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (idiopathic hyperaldosteronism).

### Effect of amiloride, or amiloride plus hydrochlorothiazide, versus hydrochlorothiazide on glucose tolerance and blood pressure (PATHWAY-3): a parallel-group, double-blind randomised phase 4 trial [^116sh9oQ]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

The short duration of the study also limits our ability to explain why potassium-sparing and potassium-losing diuretics have opposing effects on blood glucose. On several measures — insulin concentrations, HbA 1c, and the calculated homoeostatic model assessments of insulin secretion and resistance — we found no differences between groups. Good control of blood pressure and the high prevalence of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in our study population probably mitigated the rise in 2 h blood glucose in the hydrochlorothiazide group, despite the high proportion of patients with central adiposity. But results in the amiloride group — in which there were seemingly contrary trends for HbA 1c and 2 h glucose concentrations — show previously noted limitations of using HbA 1c as a surrogate of glucose intolerance. Thus, the adverse effect of spironolactone on glucose tolerance, which was imputed from a similar small rise in HbA 1c, could possibly be an artifact. The mechanism to explain why HbA 1c does not accurately reflect glucose intolerance in this setting can only be speculated, but perhaps redistribution and reduction of blood supply by diuretics affects red cell disposal and hence the turnover of HbA 1c. A final limitation is that we enrolled patients with an increased likelihood of developing glucose intolerance. The beneficial effects of amiloride might be less certain or applicable in thinner patients.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Aldosterone antagonists — initiation and monitoring: Spironolactone should be initiated at a dose of 12.5 to 25 mg daily, or occasionally on alternate days, and eplerenone was used at 25 mg per day, increasing to 50 mg daily. Potassium supplementation is generally stopped after initiation, patients should be counseled to avoid high potassium-containing foods, and patients should be cautioned to avoid the addition of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors. Potassium levels and renal function should be rechecked within 3 days and again at 1 week after initiation; subsequent monitoring should occur at least monthly for the first 3 months and every 3 months thereafter, with any addition or increase in angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) triggering a new cycle of monitoring. In view of hyperkalemia risk, the Writing Committee recommends that the routine triple combination of ACEIs, ARBs, and an aldosterone antagonist be avoided. The development of potassium levels in excess of 5.5 mEq per liter should generally trigger discontinuation or dose reduction of the aldosterone antagonist, and patients should be instructed specifically to stop the aldosterone antagonist during an episode of diarrhea or while loop diuretic therapy is interrupted.

### 2025 AHA / ACC / AANP / AAPA / ABC / ACCP / ACPM / AGS / AMA / ASPC / NMA / PCNA / SGIM guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation and management of high blood pressure in adults: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1175cRQ2]. Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Resistant hypertension — initial combination therapy and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) — Antihypertensive drug therapy should start with a combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), a calcium channel blocker (CCB), and a diuretic, and replacing thiazide-type diuretics with thiazide-like diuretics may offer additional BP reduction and cardiovascular protection. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that the addition of spironolactone (25–50 mg/day) as the fourth drug reduced home and 24-hour systolic BP (SBP) by 6.6 to 8.7 mm Hg compared with placebo in patients with resistant hypertension and eGFR ≥ 45 mL/ min/1.73 m2, with reductions greater than with doxazosin, bisoprolol, or clonidine. Nevertheless, 4% to 40% of adults with resistant hypertension cannot tolerate spironolactone due to hyperkalemia or antiandrogenic side effects; eplerenone is a potential alternative, but RCTs have not demonstrated reduction of home BP or 24-hour BP at doses between 25 and 100 mg daily and effective treatment may require higher dosages, and nonsteroidal MRA for moderate to advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) has not been tested in a clinical trial but may be considered in selected patients with close monitoring of serum potassium.

### The spironolactone, amiloride, losartan, and thiazide (SALT) double-blind crossover trial in patients with low-renin hypertension and elevated aldosterone-renin ratio [^113jtYxA]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

Background

There is continuing variation in diagnosis and estimated prevalence of primary hyperaldosteronism. The higher estimates encourage search for adrenal adenomas in patients with elevated ratios of plasma aldosterone to renin. However, it is more likely that patients with normal plasma K+ and aldosterone belong to the polygenic spectrum of low-renin hypertension rather than have the same monogenic syndrome as classic Conn's. Our primary hypothesis was that in low-renin patients with normal plasma K+ and aldosterone, a thiazide diuretic, bendroflumethiazide, would be as effective as spironolactone in overcoming the Na+ retention and lowering blood pressure. Secondary objectives were to compare the dose response for each diuretic and to evaluate amiloride as an alternative to spironolactone.

Methods and Results

Fifty-seven patients entered and 51 patients completed a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized crossover trial. Entry criteria included low plasma renin, normal K+, elevated aldosterone-renin ratio, and a previous systolic blood pressure response to spironolactone of ≥ 20 mm Hg. Two doses each of spironolactone and bendroflumethiazide were compared. The crossover also included amiloride and losartan. Outcome measures were blood pressure, plasma renin, and other biochemical markers of diuretic action. Spironolactone 100 mg and bendroflumethiazide 5 mg caused similar falls in systolic blood pressure, whereas bendroflumethiazide 2.5 mg was 5/2 mm Hg less effective in reducing blood pressure than either bendroflumethiazide 5 mg or spironolactone 50 mg (P < 0.005). Amiloride 40 mg was as effective as the other diuretics. Biochemical indices of natriuresis showed bendroflumethiazide to be less effective than either spironolactone or amiloride; plasma renin rose 4-fold on spironolactone but only 2-fold on bendroflumethiazide (P = 0.003).

Conclusions

In hypertensive patients with a low plasma renin but normal K+, bendroflumethiazide 5 mg was as effective as spironolactone 100 mg in lowering blood pressure, despite patients being selected for a previous large fall in blood pressure on spironolactone. Because this result differs from that expected in primary hyperaldosteronism, our finding argues against low-renin hypertension including a large, undiagnosed pool of primary hyperaldosteronism. However, spironolactone was the more effective natriuretic agent, suggesting that inappropriate aldosterone release or response may still contribute to the Na+ retention of low-renin hypertension.

### Comparison of cardiovascular and safety outcomes of chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide to treat hypertension [^114t8uvZ]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Chlorthalidone use was associated with a higher rate of electrolyte and renal disorders, with an increase in hypokalemia, hyponatremia, acute renal failure, and chronic kidney disease. Based on the electrolyte findings, chlorthalidone's association with an increase in rate of type II diabetes may be associated with potassium depletion or to dehydration. Chlorthalidone's lower rate of abnormal weight gain may be associated with more effective diuresis.

To our knowledge, there have been no completed large head-to-head randomized clinical trials comparing chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide on cardiovascular effectiveness. An indirect meta-analysis by Thomopoulos et allooked at cardiovascular outcomes vs placebo for low-dose diuretics; there were nominal differences, but the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelineinterpreted the results as roughly equivalent for the 2 drugs. The indirect meta-analysis by Roush et alshowed an improved relative risk for composite cardiovascular events for chlorthalidone compared with hydrochlorothiazide of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.72–0.88). The real-world evidence study by Dhalla et alestimated an HR for chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.81–1.06), although 1 dose subgroup did reach statistical significance without adjustment for multiple hypotheses. An observational study of the MRFIT cohort by Dorsch et alshowed a relative HR for chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.68–0.92), but the doses for both drugs were high. A randomized clinical trial comparing hydrochlorothiazide with chlorthalidone currently in progressmay provide more definitive information to inform drug choice.

### Potassium balance in dialysis patients [^114AFsgR]. Seminars in Dialysis (2013). Low credibility.

The advent of dialytic therapy has enabled nephrologists to provide life-saving therapy, but potassium balance continues to be an ever present challenge in the ESRD population. Although a small percent of patients are chronically hypokalemic, hyperkalemia is by far the most common abnormality in dialysis patients. It is associated with increased all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and arrhythmogenic death. Although alterations of the dialysis bath may decrease predialysis potassium, potassium baths < 2 mEq/l are associated with a higher risk of sudden cardiac death. Studies show that patients are aware of the risks of hyperkalemia, but adherence to a low potassium diet is suboptimal. ACEI, ARBs, and spironolactone may cause slight increases in potassium even in anuric patients, requiring increased surveillance. Fludrocortisone and potassium binders have not been proven to be beneficial in lowering interdialytic potassium levels. Frequent hemodialysis may be a viable option, and studies of prophylactic placement of implantable cardioverter/defibrillators are underway.

### Endocrine and haemodynamic changes in resistant hypertension, and blood pressure responses to spironolactone or amiloride: the PATHWAY-2 mechanisms substudies [^111WBtAm]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

As for the increased awareness of primary aldosteronism as a potentially preventable or curable cause of resistant hypertension, possible investigations and treatments in selected centres and patients will probably vary greatly, as will what can be more widely recommended on the basis of available clinical and health economic evidence. Prospective evaluation of sodium-to-potassium ratios might allow their use as an initial screening filter. Management of primary aldosteronism is rapidly changing as less invasive modalities become available for diagnosis and treatment of functional adenomas.

Our study has some limitations. By design, only some of the patients in PATHWAY-2 participated in the various substudies. However, baseline characteristics were similar between the cohorts. Prospective power was calculated for the primary outcome in PATHWAY-2, but not for the individual substudies, which were intended to allow prespecified, secondary mechanistic analyses that might help to explain the results of the main study. In our favour, the size of the study proved much larger than necessary to detect the primary outcome, having been powered to detect a difference of only 3 mm Hg between spironolactone and other drugs, at an α of 0.003;, indeed, post-hoc analysis of the first cycle of treatment showed the superiority of spironolactone in just 80 patients. Urine aldosterone measurements might have helped to confirm a high prevalence of primary aldosteronism. Finally, the similarity and correlation of the amiloride responses with those previously measured on spironolactone add qualified support for use of open-label treatment to simplify and encourage complex rotation studies, but do not guarantee that the two potassium-sparing diuretics are interchangeable. The finding that only the spironolactone response correlated with SUSPPUP might point to spironolactone as the more effective drug when aldosterone is the cause of sodium retention, and amiloride when the cause is clearly downstream.

We conclude that the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone is an effective treatment of resistant hypertension because resistant hypertension is commonly a salt-retaining condition probably due to inappropriate aldosterone secretion. Amiloride seems to be an effective, well tolerated alternative to spironolactone. Finally, our findings should encourage debate about whether thresholds for diagnosis of primary aldosteronism should be reconsidered in patients presenting with resistant hypertension, and about the possibility of earlier diagnosis of primary aldosteronism to prevent development of resistant hypertension.

### Spironolactone dose in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: findings from TOPCAT [^113PpUPA]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

Spironolactone up-titration may be limited by side effects that could be minimized at lower than target doses, but whether lower than target doses remain efficacious is unknown. In TOPCAT, spironolactone (or placebo) were started at 15mg/day, and increased up to a maximum of 45mg/day. The prognostic implications related to spironolactone dose are yet to be reported. We aimed to assess the average spironolactone/placebo doses provided during the trial, overall and within high-risk subgroups (e.g. elderly, renal dysfunction, high potassium); discontinuation rates; and the efficacy of lower than target doses in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

Methods and Results

Overall, 1767 patients from 'TOPCAT-Americas' were included. Linear, logistic and Cox regressions were applied. Patients randomized to spironolactone received lower doses than placebo: 22.5 (15.0–27.5) mg/day vs. 27.5 (17.5–27.5) mg/day (P < 0.001). Patients aged ≥ 75years, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤ 60mL/min/1.73m 2, and with potassium levels > 4.5mmol/L, received lower spironolactone doses (median≈20mg/day). This pattern of dose differences was not observed in patients taking placebo, where the between-subgroup placebo doses were similar (spironolactone-placebo by subgroup P interaction < 0.05). Among patients taking spironolactone, 25.4% discontinued the drug during the first year, compared with 18.3% of the patients taking placebo (P < 0.001). Discontinuation rates in the aforementioned high-risk subgroups reached 30% during the first year. Spironolactone reduced the primary outcome of heart failure hospitalization/cardiovascular death without significant heterogeneity between the study subgroups (P interaction > 0.1). Spironolactone discontinuation was associated with a two to fourfold higher risk of subsequent events.

Conclusion

Spironolactone (but not placebo) was used at lower doses among the elderly, those with renal dysfunction and with higher potassium levels. The effect of spironolactone was homogeneous across these subgroups. In patients unable to tolerate target doses, a low-dose strategy should be preferred to stopping treatment.

### Oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in adult females: a hybrid systematic review [^114E6XzM]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Dropout rates due to side effects in spironolactone-treated participants were low in the RCTs and case series, suggesting that most women who begin the drug will continue to take it. However, side effect rates were significantly higher for the 200 mg/day dose than for lower doses. This was especially true for menstrual irregularities, the most common side effect reported in the RCTs and case series. Pooling of data has shown that the rate of menstrual irregularities can be significantly reduced by concomitant use of a COC, a practice that is widely recommended by experts. However, experts also recommend dose escalation, which, paradoxically, was rarely used in the included trials or case series as a potential, but as yet untested, means of improving tolerance and adherence.

A recent multicenter study in 974 women concluded that routine monitoring of serum potassium in healthy women taking spironolactone for acne is not necessary. The findings from this systematic review support that conclusion. Occasional testing may be justified on a case-by-case basis when risk factors are present. Although 14 women with raised potassium levels were identified among 469 women in the RCTs and case series, hyperkalemia was invariably mild and clinically insignificant. Some of the side effects of spironolactone, notably nausea, fatigue, and especially muscle weakness, can be indicative of hyperkalemia and, if persistent, could be used to indicate patients in whom testing may be justified. Crucially, the non-requirement for routine testing would reduce the overall direct costs of spironolactone treatment.

### A European renal association (ERA) synopsis for nephrology practice of the 2023 European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^114sVXVb]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

In June 2023, the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) presented and published the new 2023 ESH Guidelines for the Management of Arterial Hypertension, a document that was endorsed by the European Renal Association (ERA). Following the evolution of evidence in recent years, several novel recommendations relevant to the management of hypertension in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) appeared in these Guidelines. These include recommendations for target office blood pressure (BP) < 130/80 mmHg in most and against target office BP < 120/70 mmHg in all patients with CKD; recommendations for use of spironolactone or chlorthalidone for patients with resistant hypertension with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) higher or lower than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, respectively; use of a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor for patients with CKD and estimated eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2; use of finerenone for patients with CKD, type 2 diabetes mellitus, albuminuria, eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and serum potassium < 5.0 mmol/L; and revascularization in patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease and secondary hypertension or high-risk phenotypes if stenosis ≥ 70% is present. The present report is a synopsis of sections of the ESH Guidelines that are relevant to the daily clinical practice of nephrologists, prepared by experts from ESH and ERA. The sections summarized are those referring to the role of CKD in hypertension staging and cardiovascular risk stratification, the evaluation of hypertension-mediated kidney damage and the overall management of hypertension in patients with CKD.

### Meta-analysis of dose-response characteristics of hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone: effects on systolic blood pressure and potassium [^112uyX92]. American Journal of Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence supporting the benefit of low-dose thiazide-based regimens to reduce cardiovascular events is primarily derived from studies using chlorthalidone, yet low-dose hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) (12.5–25 mg) remains more widely prescribed. We sought to describe their comparative dose-response relationships for changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and potassium.

Methods

PubMed from 1948 to July 2008 was systematically searched to identify clinical trials using either HCTZ or chlorthalidone monotherapies. A total of 108 clinical trials with HCTZ and 29 with chlorthalidone were analyzed. Data were pooled to evaluate the effects on SBP and potassium of both drugs throughout their respective dose-response curves. Equivalence analysis was performed for the clinically recommended low-dose range of 12.5–25 mg, grouped by study duration, using the two one-sided tests procedure described by Schuirmann.

Results

When evaluated on a milligram-per-milligram basis using pooled data, chlorthalidone generally produces slightly greater reductions in SBP and potassium than HCTZ. In the low-dose range of 12.5–25 mg, equivalence analysis reveals that the reductions in SBP are not equivalent between the two drugs, using upper and lower equivalence bounds of 4 mm Hg. Within the same dosing range, the mean changes in potassium were determined to be equivalent when upper and lower equivalence bounds of 0.29 mEq/l are used.

Conclusions

Equivalence analysis using data from several studies suggests that the SBP reductions achieved with HCTZ and chlorthalidone cannot be considered equivalent within the low-dose range currently recommended. However, within this dosing range, reductions in potassium can be considered equivalent.

### Spironolactone (Aldactone) [^116K1ha6]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of spironolactone PO (also known as Aldactone, Carospir):
- **Electrolyte abnormalities**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as spironolactone may cause electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities, including hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hypochloremic alkalosis, hyperglycemia, and hyperuricemia. Monitor serum electrolytes, uric acid, and blood glucose periodically.
- **Gynecomastia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as spironolactone can cause gynecomastia in a dose-dependent manner, with an onset varying from 1–2 months to over a year. Monitor serum electrolytes, uric acid, and blood glucose periodically.
- **Hypotension, renal dysfunction**: use caution in patients with salt depletion or concomitant use of ACEis/ARBs or nephrotoxic drugs, such as aminoglycosides, cisplatin, and NSAIDs. Monitor volume status and renal function periodically. Monitor the diuretic effect when co-administered with NSAIDs.
- **Increased serum lithium levels**: use caution in patients taking lithium preparations. Monitor lithium levels periodically.
- **Increased serum potassium**: use caution in patients with renal impairment or concomitant use of potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes, or medications increasing potassium serum levels, such as ACEis or ARBs. Monitor serum potassium levels within 1 week of initiation or up-titration and regularly thereafter.

### A randomized, multicenter, open-label, blinded end point trial comparing the effects of spironolactone to chlorthalidone on left ventricular mass in patients with early-stage chronic kidney disease: rationale and design of the SPIRO-CKD trial [^1111zZxq]. American Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with increased left ventricular (LV) mass and arterial stiffness. In a previous trial, spironolactone improved these end points compared with placebo in subjects with early-stage CKD, but it is not known whether these effects were specific to the drug or secondary to blood pressure lowering.

Aim

The aim was to investigate the hypothesis that spironolactone is superior to chlorthalidone in the reduction of LV mass while exerting similar effects on blood pressure.

Design

This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end point clinical trial initially designed to compare the effects of 40weeks of treatment with spironolactone 25mg once daily to chlorthalidone 25mg once daily on the co-primary end points of change in pulse wave velocity and change in LV mass in 350 patients with stages 2 and 3 CKD on established treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. Because of slow recruitment rates, it became apparent that it would not be possible to recruit this sample size within the funded time period. The study design was therefore changed to one with a single primary end point of LV mass requiring 150 patients. Recruitment was completed on 31 December 2016, at which time 154 patients had been recruited. Investigations included cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, applanation tonometry, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and laboratory tests. Subjects are assessed before and after 40weeks of randomly allocated drug therapy and at 46weeks after discontinuation of the study drug.

### Chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension treatment after myocardial infarction or stroke: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^115U66sn]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Other studies have demonstrated a similar increase in the incidence of hypokalemia associated with CTD compared with HCTZ. More recently, a study by Hripcsak et alusing insurance databases suggested no difference in CV outcomes between CTD and HCTZ but an increased risk of hypokalemia associated with CTD. In addition, Edwards et alsuggested in a propensity-matched cohort that CTD was associated with a greater risk for CV events and hypokalemia compared with HCTZ. It is unclear whether the overall results of the DCP trial would have been altered had hypokalemia (potassium level < 3.5 mEq/L) been more aggressively monitored and treated. A hypothesis for the differential outcome in those with prior MI or stroke is that benefits of CTD were unmasked by the prevention of a nadir potassium level less than 3.1 mEq/L in the CTD compared with the HCTZ group and/or by the greater use of supplemental potassium in the CTD group. There may, however, be an alternative explanation.

Results of this analysis suggest a qualitative interaction. This type of interaction is less common than a quantitative interaction, in which the treatment is beneficial (or harmful) in all subgroups but the magnitude of effect varies among subgroups. It is typically difficult to interpret subgroups with qualitative interactions to determine whether the effect is real or simply from chance. Formal tests for interaction were conducted, with results remaining significant after adjusting for multiplicity. Also, the suggestion of a qualitative interaction by baseline MI or stroke status was seen for the primary outcome and for components of the primary outcome, including acute heart failure, MI, noncancer-related death, and total mortality. Finally, adverse effects related to hypokalemia differed in those with and without MI or stroke at baseline. Despite this approach, it is possible that the observed interaction was due to chance alone.

Spironolactone and PATHWAY-2

In patients with resistant hypertension, the option of adding a fourth antihypertensive drug has been investigated. The crossover trial PATHWAY-2 recently showed spironolactone to be superior to placebo as an add-on in patients with resistant hypertension who had been identified by renin profiling as potential responders to the therapy. Despite the positive results from PATHWAY-2, the Expert Group has discussed whether these results should prompt adding spironolactone as a fourth line treatment in the management of resistant hypertension to define a trial population for device-based proof of concept studies. In the PATHWAY-2 trial, patients were on a low-dose of bendroflumethiazide, a drug less effective than chlorthalidone or indapamide, which may have favoured the BP response to spironolactone; BP response was not analysed per aldosterone levels, body mass index or BP at baseline; the short time (6 weeks) of exposure to the maximum dose of spironolactone (50 mg/d) was insufficient for an accurate assessment of the long-term tolerability of this drug; and there are no data on efficacy and safety in patients with eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 since they were excluded from the trial. Moreover, in clinical practise spironolactone has a challenging tolerability profile with higher rates of intolerance than in PATHWAY-2, including gynecomastia and erectile dysfunction, which may cause treatment interruption or termination at the request of the healthcare provider or patient. Indeed, an unexpectedly low rate of side effects occurred in the PATHWAY-2 study, possibly because of the relatively short treatment duration.

Based on these reservations, the European Expert Group felt that there is no need to mandate failure to control BP on spironolactone as an inclusion criteria for resistant hypertension patients in a proof-of-concept trial of device-based hypertension therapies.

### Effectiveness of chlorthalidone plus amiloride for the prevention of hypertension: the PREVER-prevention randomized clinical trial [^111TCEL9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Dietary change represents the optimal approach, but achieving and maintaining a meaningful reduction in dietary sodium through lifestyle change has proven to be very difficult. 31 While continuing to promote adoption of a healthy diet, use of diuretics at low dose may be a more effective means of achieving natriuresis and interrupting the dangerous cycle of BP response to excessive consumption of sodium.

In our study, the incidence of hypertension was similar to that described in a cohort study conducted previously in Porto Alegre, Brazil. 1 The curves for incidence of hypertension in the 2 treatment groups started to diverge at an early stage, and the difference between the 2 treatment arms became increasingly prominent over time. This suggests that continued administration of a low‐dose diuretic could reverse the pathophysiology that underpins typical age‐related increases in BP. Likewise, the beneficial effects on LVM that we noted during diuretic therapy suggest that these deleterious effects of high normal BP can also be prevented. 2

The interaction between treatment and sex was unexpected, and it could not be readily explained by adjustment or by differences in adherence to treatment. It may represent a chance finding. In clinical event trials, the efficacy of chlorthalidone treatment has not been influenced by sex. 32, 33 The nonsignificant trend for greater efficacy in patients with diabetes mellitus could have resulted from chance or could be explained by the higher risk of developing hypertension in those who already have diabetes mellitus, which may be caused by loss of glomeruli and insulin‐induced sodium retention.

At the end of our study, levels of low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol and uric acid were higher in the participants treated with the chlorthalidone/amiloride combination pill, findings that have been noted frequently during diuretic therapy. 34 In comparison with placebo treatment, levels of high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol were also higher in the participants treated with diuretics, whereas potassium was slightly lower. The long‐term consequences of these differences are uncertain, but even if the consequences are deleterious, they are unlikely to exceed the benefit of preventing incident hypertension. In our trial, participants treated with diuretic did not experience a significant increase in blood glucose or glycosylated hemoglobin levels. An increased incidence of biochemical diabetes has been noted during therapy with higher levels of chlorthalidone, 32, 33 but the biological implications of this type of diabetes appears to be benign in contrast to the high risk of CVD in persons with obesity‐related diabetes mellitus. 34

### Role of diuretics in cardiovascular events and mortality in systolic blood pressure intervention trial: a post hoc analysis [^115FYcLn]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Postrandomization Diuretics Use

Diuretics were classified in SPRINT as follows: thiazide-type, which included both thiazide (hydrochlorothiazide, chlorothiazide, and metolazone) and thiazide-like diuretics (chlorthalidone and indapamide); loop diuretics (furosemide, torsemide, and bumetanide); and potassium (K)-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, triamterene, and amiloride). Chlorthalidone, spironolactone, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide/triamterene, and amiloride were on the SPRINT formulary. Chlorthalidone was encouraged as the diuretic of choice. The protocol allowed the use of off-formulary diuretics, but these were neither provided nor paid for by the trial organization. For this report, we categorized diuretics use as follows: no diuretics use, thiazide-type diuretics (alone or in combination with loop diuretics and/or K-sparing diuretics), and non–thiazide-type diuretics (loop and/or K-sparing [loop/K] diuretics without thiazides). Loop and K-sparing diuretics were grouped together because few participants were on these medications.

SPRINT End Points

The SPRINT primary end point was a composite of first occurrence of myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome not resulting in myocardial infarction, stroke, acute decompensated heart failure, or death from cardiovascular causes. Death from any cause was a predefined secondary outcome. A committee blinded to the study group assignments adjudicated these end points as specified in the SPRINT protocol.

### Management of hyperkalemia during treatment with mineralocorticoid receptor blockers: findings from esaxerenone [^111Fa4pA]. Hypertension Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Monitoring

In the general patient population, potassium levels are often elevated. Approximately 6.8% of the Japanese population is estimated to have hyperkalemia (defined as at least two serum potassium readings ≥ 5.1 mEq/L) based on the results of a medical database analysis. Similarly, a Swedish study examining 364,955 patients who accessed healthcare over a 3-year period revealed a 7% incidence of hyperkalemia (defined as potassium > 5 mEq/L) with a 35.7% rate of recurrence.

Regular monitoring allows drug dosages to be adjusted based on serum potassium levels. A long-term potassium monitoring study in patients with heart failure suggested that maintenance of serum potassium levels within the normal range should be considered a therapeutic target, allowing clinicians to modify treatment and mitigate risks to improve clinical outcomes for patients. In patients with diabetes being treated with an ACE inhibitor, ARB, or spironolactone, compared with no monitoring, regular monitoring of serum potassium has been shown to decrease the risk of hyperkalemia-related adverse events (adjusted relative risk 0.5, 95% CI 0.37–0.66). According to the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative, the suggested frequency of serum potassium monitoring after initiation of ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy is as follows: every 4–12 weeks for serum potassium ≤ 4.5 mEq/L, every 2–4 weeks for 4.6–5 mEq/L, and more frequently than every 2 weeks for > 5 mEq/L. The American Heart Association states that potassium levels and renal function should typically be checked on days 3 and 7 after initiating therapy with aldosterone antagonists and then at least monthly for the first 3 months. However, the frequency of serum potassium measurement is not described in the guidelines published by the Japanese Society of Nephrology or Japanese societies related to CVD.

To avoid the risk of false positive findings, serum potassium levels need to be measured carefully. Causes of false positives include hemolysis, delay in sample processing, long-term cold storage, and contamination of blood samples with antiseptics or potassium salts from blood collection tubes. Careful collection techniques and proper sample handling and storage are therefore essential.

Additional suggestions for clinicians intending to prescribe RAASis include pretreatment GFR and baseline serum potassium determination (to identify or exclude high-risk patients), dosage titration, and discontinuation of potassium supplements or concomitant maintenance treatment with loop or thiazide diuretics.

### Evidence-based diuretic therapy for improving cardiovascular prognosis in systemic hypertension [^115ojWaM]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Diuretics are among the most commonly prescribed cardiovascular (CV) medications. The strength of evidence supporting the effectiveness of diuretics in lowering blood pressure and for preventing major adverse CV events in patients with hypertension varies considerably among diuretic classes and even among agents within the same class. Unfortunately, common prescribing habits among American physicians, including specialists in CV diseases, are not in line with the existing evidence regarding diuretic therapy for improving CV prognosis. In conclusion, although hydrochlorothiazide is the standard diuretic used for hypertension, the outcomes data suggest that chlorthalidone, indapamide, and possibly even the aldosterone receptor blockers (spironolactone and eplerenone) may be superior agents.

### Chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension treatment after myocardial infarction or stroke: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^1156M8CX]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

Strengths of the current subgroup analysis include an a priori plan to examine the subgroup with MI or stroke and use of data prior to randomization. This study also has limitations. Despite the significant interaction in an a priori subgroup, these findings may be due to chance. While the incidence of adverse events was greater in the subgroup with prior MI or stroke than in the subgroup without MI or stroke, there were few participants in this group and there were fewer events overall. It is also unclear whether the benefits seen in the group with prior MI or stroke compared with the group with no prior MI or stroke were the result of baseline risk, prevention of hypokalemia, or additional potassium supplementation in the group with prior MI or stroke. We can only conclude that the combination of all 3 was associated with an improved outcome in participants taking CTD compared with HCTZ. There may be other factors not explored here that may have led to the observed interaction.

### Review of the diagnosis and treatment of periodic paralysis [^116sqaPX]. Muscle & Nerve (2018). Low credibility.

Prevention

The patient should be advised to avoid triggers such as high‐carbohydrate and/or high‐salt meals, alcohol, and stress. 2 Although no randomized controlled studies are available to inform dosing, a daily slow‐release potassium salt formulation may be considered the standard of care for chronic therapy.

Dichlorphenamide is approved for HypoPP, and has been associated with reductions in attack frequency, severity, and duration during chronic treatment. 22, 53 Based on anecdotal reports, acetazolamide 125–1000 mg/day may be effective chronic treatment of HypoPP. 15, 20, 23, 56, 57, 58 In a double‐blind crossover study, acetazolamide 125 mg three times daily or placebo given for 2 weeks each was evaluated in 8 patients with HypoPP. 59 Muscle strength was measured in muscle groups every week and improved significantly in seven of eight patients. Mean strength was significantly greater with acetazolamide (P = 0.05), and total muscle strength increased by a mean of 10% with treatment.

Potassium‐sparing diuretics are a potential option for chronic treatment of HypoPP. 6, 18 Recommended doses are triamterene 50–150 mg/day, spironolactone 25–100 mg/day or eplerenone 50–100 mg daily. Spironolactone may be poorly tolerated because of androgenic side effects, and epleronone may be substituted because it causes fewer hormonal issues. For patients with HypoPP, potassium supplementation and a potassium‐sparing diuretic may be used concomitantly, but potassium levels should be routinely monitored.

Recent studies in mouse models of HypoPP with both SCN4A mutations and CACNA1S mutations show that maneuvers to reduce the activity of the Na‐K‐2Cl (NKCC) co‐transporter can reverse an acute attack of HypoPP and protect against an attack triggered by low K + exposure. 60, 61 The beneficial effect is the result of biasing intracellular chloride to be low, which promotes hyperpolarization of the resting potential. The NKCC co‐transporter is activated by hyperosmolarity (hence the importance of avoiding high sodium diet, dehydration or hyperglycemia) and is inhibited by loop diuretics such as bumetanide. Pharmacologic inhibition of NKCC as an acute therapy for HypoPP is under study.

### Potassium and its discontents: new insight, new treatments [^112XawKj]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is common in patients with impaired kidney function or who take drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis. During the past decade, substantial advances in understanding how the body controls potassium excretion have been made, which may lead to improved standard of care for these patients. Renal potassium disposition is primarily handled by a short segment of the nephron, comprising part of the distal convoluted tubule and the connecting tubule, and regulation results from the interplay between aldosterone and plasma potassium. When dietary potassium intake and plasma potassium are low, the electroneutral sodium chloride cotransporter is activated, leading to salt retention. This effect limits sodium delivery to potassium secretory segments, limiting potassium losses. In contrast, when dietary potassium intake is high, aldosterone is stimulated. Simultaneously, potassium inhibits the sodium chloride cotransporter. Because more sodium is then delivered to potassium secretory segments, primed by aldosterone, kaliuresis results. When these processes are disrupted, hyperkalemia results. Recently, new agents capable of removing potassium from the body and treating hyperkalemia have been tested in clinical trials. This development suggests that more effective and safer approaches to the prevention and treatment of hyperkalemia may be on the horizon.

### Spironolactone management of resistant hypertension [^115vHfcL]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy data, and adverse effects of spironolactone in the treatment of resistant hypertension.

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE (1966-July 2010), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-July 2010), and Cochrane database (2009) for the key words spironolactone or resistant hypertension. References cited in the articles were reviewed for additional information.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language literature reporting pharmacology data from animal studies and clinical trials evaluating the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy data, and adverse effects of spironolactone were included.

Data Synthesis

Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic with anti-aldosterone effects that are beneficial in the management of hypertension. Spironolactone has shown improvement in 5 prospective studies and 1 retrospective study evaluating its blood pressuring-lowering abilities in patients with resistant hypertension. Specifically, the average blood pressure lowering noted in these trials with the addition of spironolactone in patients with resistant hypertension was 22/10 mm Hg. Trials evaluating spironolactone's role in resistant hypertension treatment have identified hyperkalemia, gynecomastia, and renal insufficiency as the major adverse effects that warrant monitoring.

Conclusions

Spironolactone is an appropriate antihypertensive medication to add to treatment of patients with resistant hypertension (≥ 3 antihypertensive medications at optimal doses) not at their blood pressure goal. In patients considered to have resistant hypertension, secondary causes should be ruled out.

### ACC / AHA 2005 guideline update for the diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in the adult: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (writing committee to update the 2001 guidelines for the evaluation and management of heart failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society [^1171f8vg]. Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Heart failure — risks of aldosterone antagonists: The major risk of aldosterone antagonists is hyperkalemia due to inhibition of potassium excretion, with incidence reported to be as high as 24% in one series in which half of hyperkalemic subjects had potassium levels in excess of 6 mEq per liter; in contrast, the large trial reported 2% but a preceding pilot trial observed 13% with a 25-mg dose and 20% with a 50-mg dose. After publication of trial results, a population-based analysis in Ontario of more than 30 000 patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) after a hospitalization for heart failure found spironolactone prescriptions more than tripled, with hospitalization for hyperkalemia increasing from 2.4 to 11 patients per thousand and associated mortality increasing from 0.3 to 2 per thousand. These observations lead to a strong recommendation for caution in the selection and monitoring of patients to be given aldosterone antagonists.

### Diuretics for hypertension: a review and update [^114j1yq6]. American Journal of Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

This review and update focuses on the clinical features of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), the thiazide-like agents chlorthalidone (CTDN) and indapamide (INDAP), potassium-sparing ENaC inhibitors and aldosterone receptor antagonists, and loop diuretics. Diuretics are the second most commonly prescribed class of antihypertensive medication, and thiazide-related diuretics have increased at a rate greater than that of antihypertensive medications as a whole. The latest hypertension guidelines have underscored the importance of diuretics for all patients, but particularly for those with salt-sensitive and resistant hypertension. HCTZ is 4.2–6.2 systolic mm Hg less potent than CTDN, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers by 24-hour measurements and 5.1mm Hg systolic less potent than INDAP by office measurements. For reducing cardiovascular events (CVEs), HCTZ is less effective than enalapril and amlodipine in randomized trials, and, in network analysis of trials, it is less effective than CTDN and HCTZ-amiloride. Combined with thiazide-type diuretics, potassium-sparing agents decrease ventricular ectopy and reduce the risk for sudden cardiac death relative to thiazide-type diuretics used alone. A recent synthesis of 44 trials has shown that the relative potencies in milligrams among spironolactone (SPIR), amiloride, and eplerenone (EPLER) are approximately from 25 to 10 to 100, respectively, which may be important when SPIR is poorly tolerated. SPIR reduces proteinuria beyond that provided by other renin angiotensin aldosterone inhibitors. EPLER also reduces proteinuria and has beneficial effects on endothelial function. While guidelines often do not differentiate among specific diuretics, this review demonstrates that these distinctions are important for managing hypertension.

### ACC / AHA / ESC 2006 guidelines for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force and the European Society of Cardiology committee for practice guidelines (writing committee to develop guidelines for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death) [^1156ETpR]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Nonantiarrhythmic drugs — electrolytes and myocardial remodeling therapies: Administration of potassium and magnesium, either intravenously in the acute setting or orally for chronic augmentation in blood levels, can favorably influence the electrophysiologic substrate involved in ventricular arrhythmias and is especially useful in the presence of hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia; electrolyte disturbances are common in heart failure, particularly with high-dose loop diuretics. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, and aldosterone blockade with spironolactone or eplerenone improve the myocardial substrate through reverse remodeling, and these therapies have been associated with a reduction in sudden cardiac death as well as non–sudden cardiac death.

### Fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide [^116yg4Dx]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Drug Interactions

Potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics

As noted above ("Derangements of Serum Electrolytes"), the net effect of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide may be to elevate a patient's serum potassium, to reduce it, or to leave it unchanged. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) or potassium supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. If concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored frequently.

Lithium

Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. Because renal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, the risk of lithium toxicity is presumably raised further when, as in therapy with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, a thiazide diuretic is coadministered with the ACE inhibitor. Fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide and lithium should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended.

Antacids

In a clinical pharmacology study, serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat were reduced when fosinopril was coadministered with an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril. If concomitant administration of these agents is indicated, dosing should be separated by 2 hours.

### Effect of amiloride, or amiloride plus hydrochlorothiazide, versus hydrochlorothiazide on glucose tolerance and blood pressure (PATHWAY-3): a parallel-group, double-blind randomised phase 4 trial [^111zK3r5]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

The prevailing view in the 1990s and 2000s was that, at low doses, thiazides did not cause metabolic consequences but remained maximally efficacious at lowering blood pressure. Such a view was initially supported by under-powered comparisons of doses, in which no difference in effects on blood pressure were reported. However, an apparent dose–response correlation for blood pressure was rediscovered during treatment titration for an outcome comparison of diuretics with calcium-channel blockers, and this relation was confirmed by a formal, crossover comparison of doses in the Spironolactone, Amiloride, Losartan, Thiazide (SALT) study. The results of SALT also showed the potential value of potassium-sparing diuretics as an alternative to high-dose thiazides. However, in practice, concerns about hyperkalaemia limit the use of potassium-sparing diuretics, especially in an era when most patients are receiving a renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blocker. Additionally, without proof that potassium-sparing diuretics are not associated with glucose intolerance, or indeed that they prevent major complications of hypertension, drugs such as spironolactone have not been included as options before stage 4 hypertension in most national guidelines, still less a replacement for thiazides as first-line treatment.

### Blood pressure-lowering efficacy of monotherapy with thiazide diuretics for primary hypertension [^1179wYUi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is a modifiable cardiovascular risk factor. Although it is established that low-dose thiazides reduce mortality as well as cardiovascular morbidity, the dose-related effect of thiazides in decreasing blood pressure has not been subject to a rigorous systematic review. It is not known whether individual drugs within the thiazide diuretic class differ in their blood pressure-lowering effects and adverse effects.

Objectives

To determine the dose-related decrease in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure due to thiazide diuretics compared with placebo control in the treatment of patients with primary hypertension. Secondary outcomes included the dose-related adverse events leading to patient withdrawal and adverse biochemical effects on serum potassium, uric acid, creatinine, glucose and lipids.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2014, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to February 2014), Ovid EMBASE (1974 to February 2014) and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included double-blind, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing fixed-dose thiazide diuretic monotherapy with placebo for a duration of 3 to 12 weeks in the treatment of adult patients with primary hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened articles, assessed trial eligibility, extracted data and determined risk of bias. We combined data for continuous variables using a mean difference (MD) and for dichotomous outcomes we calculated the relative risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).

Main Results

We included 60 randomized, double-blind trials that evaluated the dose-related trough blood pressure-lowering efficacy of six different thiazide diuretics in 11,282 participants treated for a mean duration of eight weeks. The mean age of the participants was 55 years and baseline blood pressure was 158/99 mmHg. Adequate blood pressure-lowering efficacy data were available for hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone and indapamide. We judged 54 (90%) included trials to have unclear or high risk of bias, which impacted on our confidence in the results for some of our outcomes. In 33 trials with a baseline blood pressure of 155/100 mmHg, hydrochlorothiazide lowered blood pressure based on dose, with doses of 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg/day lowering blood pressure compared to placebo by 4 mmHg (95% CI 2 to 6, moderate-quality evidence)/2 mmHg (95% CI 1 to 4, moderate-quality evidence), 6 mmHg (95% CI 5 to 7, high-quality evidence)/3 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality evidence), 8 mmHg (95% CI 7 to 9, high-quality evidence)/3 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality evidence) and 11 mmHg (95% CI 6 to 15, low-quality evidence)/5 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 7, low-quality evidence), respectively. Direct comparison of doses did not show evidence of dose dependence for blood pressure-lowering for any of the other thiazides for which RCT data were available: bendrofluazide, chlorthalidone, cyclopenthiazide, metolazone or indapamide. In seven trials with a baseline blood pressure of 163/88 mmHg, chlorthalidone at doses of 12.5 mg to 75 mg/day reduced average blood pressure compared to placebo by 12.0 mmHg (95% CI 10 to 14, low-quality evidence)/4 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 5, low-quality evidence). In 10 trials with a baseline blood pressure of 161/98 mmHg, indapamide at doses of 1.0 mg to 5.0 mg/day reduced blood pressure compared to placebo by 9 mmHg (95% CI 7 to 10, low-quality evidence)/4 (95% CI 3 to 5, low-quality evidence). We judged the maximal blood pressure-lowering effect of the different thiazides to be similar. Overall, thiazides reduced average blood pressure compared to placebo by 9 mmHg (95% CI 9 to 10, high-quality evidence)/4 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality evidence). Thiazides as a class have a greater effect on systolic than on diastolic blood pressure, therefore thiazides lower pulse pressure by 4 mmHg to 6 mmHg, an amount that is greater than the 3 mmHg seen with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and renin inhibitors, and the 2 mmHg seen with non-selective beta-blockers. This is based on an informal indirect comparison of results observed in other Cochrane reviews on ACE inhibitors, ARBs and renin inhibitors compared with placebo, which used similar inclusion/exclusion criteria to the present review. Thiazides reduced potassium, increased uric acid and increased total cholesterol and triglycerides. These effects were dose-related and were least for hydrochlorothiazide. Chlorthalidone increased serum glucose but the evidence was unclear for other thiazides. There is a high risk of bias in the metabolic data. This review does not provide a good assessment of the adverse effects of these drugs because there was a high risk of bias in the reporting of withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

This systematic review shows that hydrochlorothiazide has a dose-related blood pressure-lowering effect. The mean blood pressure-lowering effect over the dose range 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg/day is 4/2 mmHg, 6/3 mmHg, 8/3 mmHg and 11/5 mmHg, respectively. For other thiazide drugs, the lowest doses studied lowered blood pressure maximally and higher doses did not lower it more. Due to the greater effect on systolic than on diastolic blood pressure, thiazides lower pulse pressure by 4 mmHg to 6 mmHg. This exceeds the mean 3 mmHg pulse pressure reduction achieved by ACE inhibitors, ARBs and renin inhibitors, and the 2 mmHg pulse pressure reduction with non-selective beta-blockers as shown in other Cochrane reviews, which compared these antihypertensive drug classes with placebo and used similar inclusion/exclusion criteria. Thiazides did not increase withdrawals due to adverse effects in these short-term trials but there is a high risk of bias for that outcome. Thiazides reduced potassium, increased uric acid and increased total cholesterol and triglycerides.

### A practical approach to hypertension management in diabetes [^1174XBFp]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Antihypertensive Drugs

RAAS blockers [ACEI (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors) and ARBs (angiotensin receptor blockers)]: ACEI/ARBs remain the mainstay in the treatment of hypertension in a diabetes patient. They are not only beneficial in the prevention of new onset diabetes but also for albuminuria. They protect kidneys by reducing efferent glomerular arteriolar tone and inhibit mesangial growth factors. ARBs are equally efficacious, with fewer side effects, although in real-world settings may be better than ACEI in stroke prevention. On the basis of evidence from ALTITUDE and ONTARGET, the combined use of ACEI/ARB is discouraged. RAAS blockers have benefits beyond BP lowering, and the drug azilsartan, the newest addition to the sartan family, provides superior reduction of BP compared to olmesartan and telmisartan.
Diuretics: Chlorthalidone and indapamide are the two most frequently used diuretics in trials for the treatment of hypertension in diabetes. Their role in preventing heart failure in patients in ALLHAT makes them an important class in this group. They may be used as first-line or as add-on treatment. Concerns are monitoring of electrolytes and glucose.
Calcium channel blockers (CCBs): CCBs may be used as first-line treatment for hypertension in elderly patients with diabetes and isolated systolic hypertension. They may also be used in patients with intolerance to RAAS blockers. They may help in preventing stroke, but have lower efficacy than RAAS blockers.
Beta blockers (BB): This class of antihypertensives is used in diabetes patients with heart failure, ischemic heart disease, or tachycardia. Apart from these indications, BB are infrequently prescribed for diabetes patients. Concerns are masking hypoglycemia, impairing insulin sensitivity, weight gain, and deranged lipids.
Alpha blockers: These are used as third- or fourth-line agents, especially with prostate hyperplasia. They have less efficacy for stroke prevention and heart failure compared to other classes.
Aldosterone antagonists: Used in hypertension in diabetes, e.g. spironolactone, effective in low doses, and more effective when serum potassium is less than 4.5 mmol/L. Reduce albuminuria in diabetes patients, and renoprotection is independent of systemic hemodynamic alterations. Concerns are type 4 renal tubular acidosis, hyperkalemia, impotence, and gynecomastia. Finerenone is a newer non-steroidal antimineralocorticoid with a lesser side effect profile.
Combination of antihypertensives: Initiate combination therapy if not at goal or if initial BP is greater than 160/100. Since BP in many patients with hypertension and diabetes is uncontrolled, CCB/diuretics are used as an add-on to therapy. Combining ACEI/ARB with CCB may offer better renoprotection and reduced ankle edema. Patients with volume overload or obesity do well on ACEI/ARB and diuretic combination. Patients uncontrolled on either may benefit from the triple combination of ACEI/ARB plus CCB plus diuretic. Effective combinations may be with alpha blockers and beta blockers in cases of prostatic hyperplasia and heart failure, respectively. Some patients whose BP remains uncontrolled, or with resistant hypertension, may need the further addition of aldosterone antagonists.

### Treatment of Cushing's syndrome with osilodrostat: practical applications of recent studies with case examples [^112Ujuzc]. Pituitary (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypokalemia in the LINC trials

While the patient in this case example did not experience hypokalemia during several years of treatment, this electrolyte abnormality has occurred in clinical trials of osilodrostat treatment. In LINC 3, 18/137 participants (13%) experienced hypokalemia. Most serum potassium concentrations were maintained within the normal range, but a pattern was observed with greater decreases in mean serum potassium levels with increasing maximum concentration (C max) of osilodrostat. Grades 3 to 4 hypokalemia were reported in 7 patients, with the lowest reported serum potassium concentration of 2.4 mmol/L (normal range was 3.5–5.3 mmol/L). Hypokalemia was treated with potassium supplements, spironolactone, dose reduction or interruption, or a combination of these approaches. In our experience, if the potassium level is low-normal, then we may consider adding spironolactone, especially in women or in patients with hypertension. If the potassium level is below normal (i.e. < 3.5 mmol/L), then potassium supplementation should be administered, with follow-up lab tests to confirm normalization. Consideration can also be given to adding spironolactone to the regimen. While not common, osilodrostat dose interruption and intravenous potassium administration may be needed if more severe hypokalemia occurs and does not normalize with oral repletion and potassium-sparing medications.

3 Results

Table 1 displays the baseline characteristics of patients in this study. This study included 60 patients with DKD, whose ages ranged from 38 to 75 years. 26 (43.33%) were female and 34 (56.67%) were male.

TABLE 1
Baseline characteristics of the study population.

Table 2 demonstrates the changes in kidney function parameters, including serum Cr, eGFR, U. Alb, and uACR. We used the Wilcoxon signed‐rank test to look at the changes in the parameters. After 12 weeks of taking spironolactone, there was a statistically significant rise in mean eGFR (p = 0.042) and big drops in U. Alb and uACR (p < 0.001). Furthermore, there was a significant reduction in the mean level of Cr after 3 months compared to the beginning of the study (p = 0.003). Although the systolic BP reduced over the study period, the changes were not statistically significant. However, the mean diastolic BP showed a statistically significant decrease after 3 months.

Changes in the renal outcomes during 12 weeks of treatment with 12.5 mg/day spironolactone.

Regarding the potential risk of hyperkalaemia during long‐term use of spironolactone, the serum K levels were measured at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, and 12. One‐way ANOVA analysis showed that the mean serum K changes over time were not significant (p = 0.302). Figure 1 demonstrates the changes in serum K levels over the 12 weeks of using low‐dose spironolactone.

### Which diuretic should be used for the treatment of hypertension? [^111J1dTp]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Chlorthalidone is a thiazide-like diuretic that is used infrequently, even though it is available as a generic, is inexpensive, and has been used as the prototype diuretic in most of the randomized controlled clinical trials during the past three decades that established the effectiveness and superiority of thiazides or thiazide-like diuretics for the treatment of hypertension. 9, 10 Therefore, a dose of 12. 5 to 25 mg of HCTZ per day is not proven to have the same beneficial effect as chlorthalidone in the same dose, because chlorthalidone at a dose of
12. 5 to 25 mg was compared with 25 to 50 mg of HCTZ combined with a potassium-sparing diuretic. 15 It does not make sense to continue to use HCTZ at a dose that is only one half of the effective dose used in clinical trials. Some physicians still have concerns that chlorthalidone may be more likely than HCTZ to cause hypokalemia.

However, two recent studies did not show any significant difference in serum potassium levels when comparing the use of HCTZ with chlorthalidone. Also, incidences of hypokalemia were not unusually high in the two large studies that used chlorthalidone. 1, 3 Although 12. 5 to 25 mg daily is the dose used most often clinically and in other studies, even
6. 25 mg daily had been used in the SHEP trial and in clinical practices in patients older than 70 years, and women with a low body weight, especially at the beginning. Hypokalemia remains a concern for HCTZ, chlorthalidone, and other thiazides, but potassium-sparing diuretics can correct hypokalemia and give additional help in blood pressure control and cardiovascular protection. 16 These clinical differences between chlorthalidone and HCTZ merit our considering chlorthalidone in preference to HCTZ.

This simple change in our treatment habits may help our patients achieve better blood pressure control and prevent additional cardiovascular events.

Age

Distal renal tubule function and the ability to eliminate potassium decline as age increases. As a result, elderly individuals are at increased risk of developing hyperkalemia, especially those who also have CKD or CVD. In a group of patients with heart failure, the mean (± standard deviation) age was significantly older in those with serum potassium > 5.0 mEq/L (76 ± 9 years) than in those with lower potassium levels (73 ± 11 years). Similarly, in a retrospective study of patients with CVD and CKD, patients with hyperkalemia were significantly older (66.1 ± 10.3 years) than those with normal potassium levels (63.9 ± 11.2 years). The results of another retrospective analysis using electronic medical records showed that older patients were at greater risk of developing hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.0 mEq/L) than younger patients (OR (95% CI) values for age 45–64, 65–74, and ≥ 75 years versus age 18–44 years were 1.41 (1.36–1.47), 1.66 (1.59–1.73) and 1.72 (1.65–1.79), respectively).

RAASi medication

Treatment with antihypertensive agents, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), a direct renin inhibitor, and MR blockers are all known to increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Elevated serum potassium levels are observed with single-agent administration, and the level increases further with combination therapy. A systematic review showed that a combination therapy with an ACE inhibitor and an ARB resulted in a small, but significant, increase in serum potassium levels (weighted mean difference, 0.11 mEq/L; 95% CI 0.05–0.17).

In a study of normokalemic patients with hypertension who were randomly assigned to treatment with the ACE inhibitor lisinopril, the diuretic chlorthalidone, or the CCB amlodipine, the incidence of hyperkalemia was found to be greater in the patients treated with lisinopril (3.6%) than in those treated with either of the other agents (p < 0.01 for both). In another study of patients with systemic hypertension, monotherapy with either the ACE inhibitor enalapril or the MR blocker eplerenone was associated with elevated serum potassium levels.

### Hypertension in chronic kidney disease-treatment standard 2023 [^115TfUpd]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is very common and remains often poorly controlled in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Accurate blood pressure (BP) measurement is the essential first step in the diagnosis and management of hypertension. Dietary sodium restriction is often overlooked, but can improve BP control, especially among patients treated with an agent to block the renin-angiotensin system. In the presence of very high albuminuria, international guidelines consistently and strongly recommend the use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker as the antihypertensive agent of first choice. Long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and diuretics are reasonable second- and third-line therapeutic options. For patients with treatment-resistant hypertension, guidelines recommend the addition of spironolactone to the baseline antihypertensive regimen. However, the associated risk of hyperkalemia restricts the broad utilization of spironolactone in patients with moderate-to-advanced CKD. Evidence from the CLICK (Chlorthalidone in Chronic Kidney Disease) trial indicates that the thiazide-like diuretic chlorthalidone is effective and serves as an alternative therapeutic opportunity for patients with stage 4 CKD and uncontrolled hypertension, including those with treatment-resistant hypertension. Chlorthalidone can also mitigate the risk of hyperkalemia to enable the concomitant use of spironolactone, but this combination requires careful monitoring of BP and kidney function for the prevention of adverse events. Emerging agents, such as the non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist ocedurenone, dual endothelin receptor antagonist aprocitentan and the aldosterone synthase inhibitor baxdrostat offer novel targets and strategies to control BP better. Larger and longer term clinical trials are needed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of these novel therapies in the future. In this article, we review the current standards of treatment and discuss novel developments in pathophysiology, diagnosis, outcome prediction and management of hypertension in patients with CKD.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^117TkvYt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Screening for primary aldosteronism in individuals with hypertension — recommendation and technical steps: We recommend primary aldosteronism (PA) screening with serum/plasma aldosterone concentration and plasma renin (concentration or activity). Screen for PA by measuring serum/plasma aldosterone and plasma renin (concentration or activity) in the morning with individuals seated and avoiding dietary sodium restriction during the few days prior to screening. Potassium should be measured alongside renin and aldosterone — not for screening itself, but to aid in the accurate interpretation of aldosterone — as a low potassium may lead to a falsely low aldosterone; if screening results are negative and the patient has hypokalemia, potassium should be corrected to within the laboratory reference range and screening should be repeated. Manage interfering medications depending on individual safety and feasibility, and the Guideline Development Panel outlined both minimal-withdrawal and no-withdrawal strategies of interfering medications before screening. A positive screen meets both of the following in most circumstances: renin is low/suppressed and aldosterone is inappropriately high relative to renin.
