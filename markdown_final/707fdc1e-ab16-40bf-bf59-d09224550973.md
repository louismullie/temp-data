term breech trial

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the Term Breech Trial (TBT), its findings, criticisms, and how contemporary evidence and guidelines have evolved since 2000. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the TBT's design and primary outcomes. Then, I should verify the immediate practice impact and guideline shifts. Next, I will examine methodological criticisms and their implications. After that, I need to review long-term follow-up data and reconcile them with short-term results. Then, I should assess subsequent observational studies and meta-analyses that challenge or refine the TBT's conclusions. Next, I will consider external cephalic version (ECV) as a key alternative strategy. Finally, I will synthesize current guideline positions and outline a practical, risk-stratified approach to counseling and management, making sure I double-check areas of uncertainty and acknowledge limitations before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the core facts of the TBT. The TBT was a large, multicenter randomized controlled trial of 2,088 women with term singleton breech presentation, comparing planned cesarean delivery versus planned vaginal birth, and it found a significant reduction in perinatal or neonatal death or serious neonatal morbidity with planned cesarean (1.6% vs 5.0%; relative risk 0.33, 95% CI 0.19–0.56), which drove early termination and immediate practice change toward cesarean for breech in many settings [^116PSACP] [^116AgojC] [^111vr52N].

> Wait, let me verify the immediate practice and guideline impact. Within months of publication, ACOG and RCOG advised planned cesarean for persistent term breech, and vaginal breech delivery rates plummeted worldwide; for example, in New South Wales, vaginal breech rates dropped from 17% in 1999 to 4.5% in 2001, and in a large metropolitan dataset, cesarean rates for breech rose from 76.9% to 89.7% after the TBT, reflecting a global shift toward cesarean as the default [^116dLJRv] [^114ki96H] [^111vr52N] [^1171VaHd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without scrutinizing the trial's limitations. Critics highlighted suboptimal adherence to vaginal birth eligibility criteria, high inter-institutional variability in care, recruitment during active labor, and frequent absence of experienced clinicians at vaginal breech deliveries; these factors could inflate adverse outcomes in the planned vaginal arm and complicate generalizability, prompting calls to reconsider the original recommendations [^112ZMDT3] [^114ki96H] [^114fuaGs].

> I should double-check the long-term follow-up before inferring durable benefits. At 2 years, there was no difference in death or neurodevelopmental delay between planned cesarean and planned vaginal birth (3.1% vs 2.8%; RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.52–2.30), and maternal outcomes at 2 years were broadly similar, suggesting that the short-term neonatal advantage did not translate into measurable long-term developmental benefits in the sampled cohort [^112E32EB] [^111YMCue].

> Next, I should review subsequent evidence that challenges or refines the TBT signal. Observational studies with strict selection and standardized intrapartum protocols, such as PREMODA (8,105 women), found no significant difference in composite neonatal mortality or serious morbidity between planned vaginal and planned cesarean birth when rigorous criteria were applied, and Norwegian registry-based analyses similarly suggested that adverse outcomes in breech may be driven partly by underlying fetal conditions rather than mode of delivery per se [^115edc21] [^111WDfZ4] [^1174angs].

> Let me consider the Cochrane perspective and meta-analytic updates. The 2003 and 2015 Cochrane reviews confirmed a reduction in perinatal or neonatal death or serious morbidity with planned cesarean, but emphasized heterogeneity, low to moderate quality of evidence, and the trade-off of increased short-term maternal morbidity; importantly, they cautioned that results may not generalize to settings with different protocols or expertise, reinforcing the need for individualized decision-making [^116AgojC] [^1152717a].

> I need to ensure I address the role of ECV as a primary strategy to avoid breech delivery altogether. ECV at term reduces non-cephalic presentation at birth and cesarean section without clear increases in perinatal mortality, and adjuncts like beta-stimulant tocolysis and, in some protocols, regional anesthesia can improve success; early ECV (starting around 34–35 weeks) further reduces noncephalic presentation but may modestly increase late preterm birth, so timing must be individualized and contextualized [^116xbXcF] [^116SN2ND] [^116ek4g9].

> But wait, what about cost and implementation realities for ECV. Economic modeling suggests ECV is cost-effective when the probability of successful version exceeds roughly 32–63%, depending on assumptions, and real-world uptake remains suboptimal in many systems, highlighting a gap between evidence and practice that can perpetuate unnecessary cesareans for breech [^114w3hp7] [^115kp7PT].

> Next, I should review how guidelines have evolved since the early 2000s. Contemporary ACOG, RCOG, SOGC, and RANZCOG positions no longer endorse routine cesarean for all term breech; instead, they support offering ECV and, when ECV is declined or unsuccessful, considering planned vaginal breech birth under strict protocols with experienced teams and informed consent, reflecting a shift toward shared decision-making and center-specific expertise [^113M6QyA] [^115YiKCG] [^1165LdJJ] [^116Mr899].

> I will now examine practical selection and intrapartum management criteria that emerge from the literature. Favorable candidates for vaginal breech birth are typically those with estimated fetal weight between about 2,500–3,800 g, frank or complete breech (not footling), flexed fetal head, adequate maternal pelvis, spontaneous labor, and continuous expert attendance; conversely, factors such as fetal growth restriction, hyperextended head, macrosomia, oligohydramnios, and nulliparity with unfavorable pelvis increase risk and often prompt cesarean, and these align with PREMODA-era risk modeling and modern reviews [^111WDfZ4] [^115LBx9J] [^112kvFiH].

> Hold on, I should verify maternal risk trade-offs to counsel accurately. Planned cesarean is associated with modestly increased short-term maternal morbidity (e.g., infection, hemorrhage, longer recovery), whereas planned vaginal birth carries higher risks of urinary incontinence at 3 months but less abdominal pain; long-term maternal outcomes appear similar, and cesarean scar risks in future pregnancies should be discussed as part of shared decision-making [^116AgojC] [^113B2m4E] [^111YMCue].

> Let me reconsider the overarching message so I don't overstate certainty. The TBT established a short-term neonatal benefit for planned cesarean, but methodological limitations and subsequent studies with stricter selection and experienced teams show that planned vaginal breech birth can be safe for appropriately selected women in the right setting; therefore, the safest course is not universal cesarean but a structured pathway: screen at 36 weeks, offer ECV, apply rigorous eligibility criteria if vaginal birth is considered, ensure experienced attendance and continuous monitoring, and pivot to cesarean promptly if labor progress stalls or fetal status deteriorates [^114ki96H] [^115edc21] [^113M6QyA].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the TBT showed a 60% reduction in perinatal mortality, but I should double-check the exact figures. The composite of perinatal or neonatal death or serious morbidity fell from 5.0% with planned vaginal to 1.6% with planned cesarean (RR 0.33), whereas perinatal or neonatal death alone was reduced from 1.3% to 0.3% in some summaries; I should confirm that these latter mortality-only figures derive from subgroup or pooled analyses and not the original composite endpoint, so I will qualify them accordingly to avoid misattribution [^116PSACP] [^116AgojC] [^1152717a].

> Finally, I need to ensure the counseling framework is explicit and actionable. For a woman with term breech, I would discuss ECV success rates and timing, the short-term neonatal advantages and maternal trade-offs of planned cesarean, the feasibility and requirements of a vaginal breech trial under strict protocols, and the center's experience and availability of skilled clinicians; documentation of informed preferences and contingency plans is essential, recognizing that breech presentation may itself signal underlying vulnerabilities that warrant closer antenatal surveillance regardless of planned mode of delivery [^113M6QyA] [^115LBx9J] [^1174angs].

The Term Breech Trial (TBT) was a large RCT that found **planned cesarean reduced perinatal mortality and serious neonatal morbidity** [^116AgojC] compared with planned vaginal birth for term breech, with no difference in maternal mortality or serious morbidity [^112Q8Xce]. However, the trial faced criticism for **protocol violations, selection bias, and lack of expertise** in vaginal breech delivery, limiting generalizability [^112ZMDT3] [^114ki96H]. Long-term follow-up showed **no difference in death or neurodevelopmental delay at 2 years** [^112E32EB], and subsequent observational studies suggest vaginal breech delivery can be safe with strict selection and experienced attendants [^115edc21] [^113D7Rrc]. Current guidelines support **individualized decision-making**, with planned cesarean as the preferred option and vaginal breech considered only in carefully selected women with experienced teams [^113M6QyA] [^1165LdJJ].

---

## Study design and methodology

- **Design**: Multicenter, randomized controlled trial (RCT).
- **Participants**: 2,088 women with singleton breech presentation at term (≥ 37 weeks) from 121 centers in 26 countries.
- **Intervention**: Planned cesarean section (CS) vs planned vaginal birth (VB).
- **Primary outcome**: Perinatal or neonatal mortality or serious neonatal morbidity.

---

## Key findings

- **Perinatal outcomes**: Planned CS significantly reduced perinatal mortality and serious neonatal morbidity (1.6% vs 5.0%; relative risk [RR] 0.33, 95% CI 0.19–0.56) [^116AgojC].
- **Maternal outcomes**: No significant difference in maternal mortality or serious maternal morbidity between groups [^notfound].
- **Long-term outcomes**: No significant difference in death or neurodevelopmental delay at 2 years between groups [^112E32EB].

---

## Criticisms and limitations

- **Protocol violations**: Lack of adherence to inclusion criteria and suboptimal intrapartum management in some centers [^112ZMDT3] [^114ki96H].
- **Selection bias**: Many women were recruited during active labor, and expertise in vaginal breech delivery varied widely [^112ZMDT3].
- **Generalizability**: Results may not apply to settings with strict selection criteria and experienced attendants [^113D7Rrc].

---

## Impact on clinical practice and guidelines

The TBT led to a **global shift toward planned CS** for term breech, with vaginal breech delivery rates declining sharply [^1171VaHd]. ACOG and RCOG recommend **planned CS** as the preferred mode, though some guidelines allow vaginal breech in carefully selected women with experienced attendants [^113M6QyA] [^1165LdJJ].

---

## Subsequent research and current consensus

Observational studies suggest vaginal breech delivery can be safe with **strict selection and experienced attendants** [^115edc21] [^113D7Rrc]. Current consensus supports **individualized decision-making**, balancing neonatal benefits of CS against maternal risks and patient preferences [^113M6QyA].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **Counseling**: Women should be informed of risks and benefits of both modes, including long-term outcomes [^1152717a].
- **Selection criteria**: Vaginal breech delivery should only be considered in carefully selected women with experienced teams [^1165LdJJ].
- **External cephalic version (ECV)**: Recommended to reduce breech presentations and CS rates [^116xbXcF].

---

The TBT showed that planned CS reduces perinatal mortality and serious neonatal morbidity for term breech, but its limitations mean **vaginal breech can still be safe** with strict selection and experienced attendants. Current practice favors **individualized care**, with planned CS as the preferred option and vaginal breech reserved for selected women with experienced teams.

### Revisiting the management of term breech presentation: a proposal for overcoming some of the controversies [^114ki96H]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The ideal management of women with term breech presentation remains a matter of intense debate. The rate of vaginal delivery has steadily declined in the last decades of the last century. In 2000, the Term Breech Trial (TBT) Collaborative Group concluded that a composite variable combining perinatal and neonatal mortality or serious neonatal morbidity was significantly lower in the planned caesarean section (CS) group than in the planned vaginal birth group, which marked an apparent turning point in this controversy. Based on the short-term outcomes presented in the TBT study, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommended over the next few years that all women with persistent singleton breech presentation at term should undergo a planned CS delivery. An important and almost immediate impact on the practice was also observed in some countries that previously had a high proportion of vaginal breech deliveries. TBT was the largest randomized trial ever published on the term breech mode of delivery. However, despite its undeniable strengths, a number of weaknesses have been identified. Specifically, there was a lack of adherence to strict criteria for vaginal birth in an important proportion of the included patients and nonoptimal methods of labour management as recognized by the TBT group itself. In addition, when the TBT Collaborative Group published the 2-year analysis of paediatric outcomes, despite a large (greater than 50%) post-randomization loss to follow-up, these researchers found no reduction in the risk of death or neurodevelopmental delay in children at 2 years of age, thus raising questions regarding the real lessons to be drawn from this trial. Using multiple logistic regression analyses, the TBT group also reported that the risk of maternal morbidity was lowest following vaginal birth (odds ratio [OR] 1.0) and highest following CS after active labour (36.1% in the TBT) (OR 3.33; 95% CI 1.75–6.33, P < 0.001), particularly after a short second stage < 30 min (OR 0.25; 95% CI 0.11–0.57, P < 0.001).

### Five years to the term breech trial: the rise and fall of a randomized controlled trial [^112ZMDT3]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

On the basis of the end points of neonatal morbidity and death, the authors of the term breech trial concluded unequivocally that cesarean delivery was safer for breech babies.

Study Design

Analysis of the original and new data gives rise to serious concerns as far as study design, methods, and conclusions are concerned. In a substantial number of cases, there was a lack of adherence to the inclusion criteria. There was a large interinstitutional variation of standard of care; inadequate methods of antepartum and intrapartum fetal assessment were used, and a large proportion of women were recruited during active labor. In many instances of planned vaginal delivery, there was no attendance of a clinician with adequate expertise.

Results

Most cases of neonatal death and morbidity in the term breech trial cannot be attributed to the mode of delivery. Moreover, analysis of outcome after 2 years has shown no difference between vaginal and abdominal deliveries of breech babies.

Conclusion

The original term breech trial recommendations should be withdrawn.

### Outcomes at 3 months after planned cesarean vs planned vaginal delivery for breech presentation at term: the international randomized term breech trial [^113B2m4E]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

The Term Breech Trial found a significant reduction in adverse perinatal outcomes without an increased risk of immediate maternal morbidity with planned cesarean delivery compared with planned vaginal birth. No randomized controlled trial of planned cesarean delivery has measured benefits and risks of postpartum outcomes months after the birth.

Objective

To compare maternal outcomes of planned cesarean delivery and planned vaginal birth at 3 months post partum.

Design

Follow-up study to the Term Breech Trial, a randomized controlled trial conducted between January 9, 1997, and April 21, 2000.

Setting and Participants

A total of 1596 of 1940 women from 110 centers worldwide who had a singleton fetus in breech presentation at term responded to a follow-up questionnaire at 3 months post partum.

Main Outcome Measures

Breastfeeding; infant health; ease of caring for infant and adjusting to being a new mother; sexual relations and relationship with husband/partner; pain; urinary, flatal, and fecal incontinence; depression; and views regarding childbirth experience and study participation.

Results

Baseline information was similar for both the cesarean and vaginal delivery groups. Women in the planned cesarean delivery group were less likely to report urinary incontinence than those in the planned vaginal birth group (36/798 [4.5%] vs 58/797 [7.3%]; relative risk, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.41–0.93). Incontinence of flatus was not different between groups but was less of a problem in the planned cesarean delivery group when it occurred (P = 0.006). There were no differences between groups in other outcomes.

Conclusions

Planned cesarean delivery for pregnancies with breech presentation at term may result in a lower risk of incontinence and is not associated with an increased risk of other problems for women at 3 months post partum, although the effect on longer-term outcomes is uncertain.

### Outcomes of children at 2 years after planned cesarean birth versus planned vaginal birth for breech presentation at term: the international randomized term breech trial [^112E32EB]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine whether planned cesarean delivery for the singleton fetus in breech presentation at term reduces the risk of death or neurodevelopmental delay at 2 years of age.

Study Design

In selected centers in the Term Breech Trial, children were screened for abnormalities at ≥ 2 years of age with the Ages and Stages Questionnaire, followed by a neurodevelopmental assessment if the Ages and Stages Questionnaire score was abnormal.

Results

A total of 923 of 1159 children (79.6%) from 85 centers were followed to 2 years of age. The risk of death or neurodevelopmental delay was no different for the planned cesarean than for the planned vaginal birth groups (14 children [3.1%] vs 13 children [2.8%]; relative risk, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.52–2.30; p = 0.85; risk difference, +0.3%; 95% CI, -1.9%, +2.4%).

Conclusion

Planned cesarean delivery is not associated with a reduction in risk of death or neurodevelopmental delay in children at 2 years of age.

### Planned caesarean section for term breech delivery [^116AgojC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Routine use of caesarean section for breech presentation is widespread. However, poor outcomes after breech birth might be the result of underlying conditions causing breech presentation rather than damage during delivery.

Objectives

To assess the effects of planned caesarean section for singleton breech presentation at term on measures of pregnancy outcome.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (November 2002) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2003).

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing planned caesarean section for singleton breech presentation at term with planned vaginal birth.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed trial eligibility and quality.

Main Results

Three trials (2396 participants) were included in the review. Caesarean delivery occurred in 550/1227 (45%) of those women allocated to a vaginal delivery protocol. Perinatal or neonatal death (excluding fatal anomalies) or serious neonatal morbidity was reduced (relative risk (RR) 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.56) with planned caesarean section. The reduction in risk of perinatal or neonatal death or serious neonatal morbidity was less for countries with high national perinatal mortality rates. Perinatal or neonatal death (excluding fatal anomalies) was also reduced (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.86) with planned caesarean section. The proportional reductions were similar for countries with low and high national perinatal mortality rates. Planned caesarean section was associated with modestly increased short-term maternal morbidity (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.61). At 3 months after delivery, women allocated to the planned caesarean section group reported less urinary incontinence (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.93); more abdominal pain (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.29 to 2. 79); and less perineal pain (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.58).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Planned caesarean section compared with planned vaginal birth reduced perinatal or neonatal death or serious neonatal morbidity for the singleton breech baby at term, at the expense of somewhat increased maternal morbidity. Information on long-term consequences of caesarean section, such as reproductive function and emotional adjustment, is limited. The option of external cephalic version is dealt with in separate reviews. The data from this review cannot be generalised to settings where women labour and birth at home, or where caesarean section is not readily available, or to methods of breech delivery that differ materially from the clinical delivery protocols used in the trials reviewed. The review will help to inform individualised decision-making regarding breech delivery.

### External cephalic version for breech presentation before term [^116ek4g9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

External cephalic version (ECV) of the breech fetus at term (after 37 weeks) has been shown to be effective in reducing the number of breech presentations and caesarean sections, but the rates of success are relatively low. This review examines studies initiating ECV prior to term (before 37 weeks' gestation).

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of a policy of beginning ECV before term (before 37 weeks' gestation) for breech presentation on fetal presentation at birth, method of delivery, and the rate of preterm birth, perinatal morbidity, stillbirth or neonatal mortality.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 March 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of ECV attempted before term (37 weeks' gestation) or commenced before term, compared with a control group of women (in breech presentation) in which either no ECV attempted or ECV was attempted at term. Cluster-randomised trials were eligible for inclusion but none were identified. Quasi-RCTs or studies using a cross-over design were not eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked for accuracy. Studies were assessed for risk of bias and for important outcomes the overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Five studies are included (2187 women). It was not possible for the intervention to be blinded, and it is not clear what impact lack of blinding would have on the outcomes reported. For other 'Risk of bias' domains studies were either at low or unclear risk of bias. One study reported on ECV that was undertaken and completed before 37 weeks' gestation compared with no ECV. No difference was found in the rate of non-cephalic presentation at birth (risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 1.69; participants = 102). One study reported on a policy of ECV that was initiated before term (33 weeks) and up until 40 weeks' gestation and which could be repeated up until delivery compared with no ECV. This study showed a decrease in the rate of non-cephalic presentation at birth (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.77; participants = 179). Three studies reported on ECV started at between 34 to 35 weeks' gestation compared with beginning at 37 to 38 weeks' gestation. Pooled results suggested that early ECV reduced the risk of non-cephalic presentation at birth (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.90; participants = 1906; studies = three; I² = 0%, evidence graded high quality), failure to achieve vaginal cephalic birth (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.97; participants = 1888; studies = three; I² = 0%, evidence graded high quality), and vaginal breech delivery (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.78; participants = 1888; studies = three; I² = 0%, evidence graded high quality). The difference between groups for risk of caesarean was not statistically significant (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.00; participants = 1888; studies = three; I² = 0%, evidence graded high quality). There was evidence that risk of preterm labour was increased with early ECV compared with ECV after 37 weeks (6.6% in the ECV group and 4.3% for controls) (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.21; participants = 1888; studies = three; I² = 0%, evidence graded high quality). There was no clear difference between groups for low infant Apgar score at five minutes or perinatal death (stillbirth plus neonatal mortality up to seven days) (evidence graded as low quality for both outcomes).

Authors' Conclusions

Compared with no ECV attempt, ECV commenced before term reduces non-cephalic presentation at birth. Compared with ECV at term, beginning ECV at between 34 to 35 weeks may have some benefit in terms of decreasing the rate of non-cephalic presentation, and risk of vaginal breech birth. However, early ECV may increase risk of late preterm birth, and it is important that any future research reports infant morbidity outcomes. Results of the review suggest that there is a need for careful discussion with women about the timing of the ECV procedure so that they can make informed decisions.

### Planned caesarean section for term breech delivery [^1152717a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Poor outcomes after breech birth might be the result of underlying conditions causing breech presentation or due to factors associated with the delivery.

Objectives

To assess the effects of planned caesarean section for singleton breech presentation at term on measures of pregnancy outcome.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 March 2015).

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing planned caesarean section for singleton breech presentation at term with planned vaginal birth.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy.

Main Results

Three trials (2396 participants) were included in the review. Caesarean delivery occurred in 550/1227 (45%) of those women allocated to a vaginal delivery protocol and 1060/1169 (91%) of those women allocated to planned caesarean section (average risk ratio (RR) random-effects, 1.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.60 to 2.20; three studies, 2396 women, evidence graded low quality). Perinatal or neonatal death (excluding fatal anomalies) or severe neonatal morbidity was reduced with a policy of planned caesarean section in settings with a low national perinatal mortality rate (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.29, one study, 1025 women, evidence graded moderate quality), but not in settings with a high national perinatal mortality rate (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.24, one study, 1053 women, evidence graded low quality). The difference between subgroups was significant (Test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 8.01, df = 1 (P = 0.005), I² = 87.5%). Due to this significant heterogeneity, a random-effects analysis was performed. The average overall effect was not statistically significant (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.02 to 2.44, one study, 2078 infants). Perinatal or neonatal death (excluding fatal anomalies) was reduced with planned caesarean section (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.86, three studies, 2388 women). The proportional reductions were similar for countries with low and high national perinatal mortality rates. The numbers studied were too small to satisfactorily address reductions in birth trauma and brachial plexus injury with planned caesarean section. Neither of these outcomes reached statistical significance (birth trauma: RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.10, one study, 2062 infants (20 events), evidence graded low quality; brachial plexus injury: RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.47, three studies, 2375 infants (nine events)). Planned caesarean section was associated with modestly increased short-term maternal morbidity (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.61, three studies, 2396 women, low quality evidence). At three months after delivery, women allocated to the planned caesarean section group reported less urinary incontinence (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.93, one study, 1595 women); no difference in 'any pain' (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.29, one study, 1593 women, low quality evidence); more abdominal pain (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.79, one study, 1593 women); and less perineal pain (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.58, one study, 1593 women). At two years, there were no differences in the combined outcome 'death or neurodevelopmental delay' (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.30, one study, 920 children, evidence graded low quality); more infants who had been allocated to planned caesarean delivery had medical problems at two years (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.89, one study, 843 children). Maternal outcomes at two years were also similar. In countries with low perinatal mortality rates, the protocol of planned caesarean section was associated with lower healthcare costs, expressed in 2002 Canadian dollars (mean difference -$877.00, 95% CI -894.89 to -859.11, one study, 1027 women). All of the trials included in this review had design limitations, and the GRADE level of evidence was mostly low. No studies attempted to blind the intervention, and the process of random allocation was suboptimal in two studies. Two of the three trials had serious design limitations, however these studies contributed to fewer outcomes than the large multi-centre trial with lower risk of bias.

Authors' Conclusions

Planned caesarean section compared with planned vaginal birth reduced perinatal or neonatal death as well as the composite outcome death or serious neonatal morbidity, at the expense of somewhat increased maternal morbidity. In a subset with 2-year follow up, infant medical problems were increased following planned caesarean section and no difference in long-term neurodevelopmental delay or the outcome "death or neurodevelopmental delay" was found, though the numbers were too small to exclude the possibility of an important difference in either direction. The benefits need to be weighed against factors such as the mother's preference for vaginal birth and risks such as future pregnancy complications in the woman's specific healthcare setting. The option of external cephalic version is dealt with in separate reviews. The data from this review cannot be generalised to settings where caesarean section is not readily available, or to methods of breech delivery that differ materially from the clinical delivery protocols used in the trials reviewed. The review will help to inform individualised decision-making regarding breech delivery. Research on strategies to improve the safety of breech delivery and to further investigate the possible association of caesarean section with infant medical problems is needed.

### Factors associated with adverse perinatal outcome in the term breech trial [^1166s6WQ]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

In the Term Breech Trial, the risk of adverse perinatal outcome was lower with planned cesarean section versus planned vaginal birth. We undertook secondary analyses to determine factors associated with adverse perinatal outcome.

Study Design

By using multiple logistic regression analyses, we determined the effect of prelabor cesarean section, cesarean section during early labor, cesarean section during active labor versus vaginal birth, and other factors, on adverse perinatal outcome. For 1384 fetuses delivered after labor, we determined the effect of variables associated with labor on adverse perinatal outcome.

Results

The risk of adverse perinatal outcome was lowest with prelabor cesarean section (odds ratio [OR] = 0.13) and highest with vaginal birth. For those delivered after labor, labor augmentation (P = 0.007), birth weight less than 2.8 kg (P = 0.003), and longer time between pushing and delivery (P < .001) increased the risk, whereas the presence of an experienced clinician at delivery (P = 0.004) reduced the risk of adverse perinatal outcome.

Conclusion

Breech infants at term are best delivered by prelabor cesarean section.

### Planned caesarean section for term breech delivery [^116fTrYv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Routine use of caesarean section for breech presentation is widespread. However, poor outcomes after breech birth might be the result of underlying conditions causing breech presentation rather than damage during delivery.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of planned caesarean section for breech presentation on measures of pregnancy outcome.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth trials register and the Cochrane Controlled Trials register. Date of last search: November 2000.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing planned caesarean section for breech presentation with planned vaginal delivery.

Data Collection and Analysis

Reviewers assessed trial eligibility and quality. Data were entered onto and analysed using RevMan software.

Main Results

Caesarean delivery occurred in 550/1227 (45%) of those women allocated to a vaginal delivery protocol. Planned caesarean section was associated with modestly increased maternal morbidity (relative risk 1.29, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.61). Perinatal and neonatal death (excluding fatal anomalies) were greatly reduced (0.29, 0.10 to 0.86). The reductions were similar for countries with low and high perinatal mortality rates. Perinatal/neonatal death or neonatal morbidity was also greatly reduced (0.31, 0.19 to 0.52). The difference was smaller for countries with a high national perinatal mortality rate.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Planned caesarean section greatly reduces both perinatal/neonatal mortality and neonatal morbidity, at the expense of somewhat increased maternal morbidity. Cost, and future morbidity due to the caesarean section scar were not assessed. The option of external cephalic version is dealt with in separate reviews. The data from this review will help to inform individualised decision-making regarding breech delivery.

### Maternal outcomes at 2 years after planned cesarean section versus planned vaginal birth for breech presentation at term: the international randomized term breech trial [^111YMCue]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was undertaken to compare maternal outcomes at 2 years postpartum after planned cesarean section and planned vaginal birth for the singleton fetus in breech presentation at term.

Study Design

In selected centers in the Term Breech Trial, mothers completed a structured questionnaire at 2 or more years postpartum to determine their health in the previous 3 to 6 months.

Results

A total of 917 of 1159 (79.1%) mothers from 85 centers completed a follow-up questionnaire at 2 years postpartum. There were no differences between groups in breast feeding, relationship with child or partner, pain, subsequent pregnancy, incontinence, depression, urinary, menstrual or sexual problems, fatigue, or distressing memories of the birth experience. Planned cesarean section was associated with a higher risk of constipation (P = 0.02).

Conclusion

Maternal outcomes at 2 years postpartum are similar after planned cesarean section and planned vaginal birth for the singleton breech fetus at term.

### Vaginal breech delivery: results of a prospective registration study [^116PSACP]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Background

In 2000, the results of a randomized multicenter trial, the Term Breech Trial (TBT) were published in the Lancet. 2083 women were included in the study, and of the 1,042 women assigned to planned vaginal delivery, 591 (56.7%) delivered by this method. The trial reported significantly lower perinatal mortality, neonatal mortality, or serious neonatal morbidity in the planned cesarean section arm (1.6%) versus in the planned vaginal delivery arm (5.0%).

The TBT has had a major impact on clinical practice, and most countries now recommend planned cesarean section in breech births. Later, several methodological aspects of the study have been questioned. Despite this, planned cesarean section is considered as the safest and therefore the most widely used delivery method according to several European publications. As a response to the TBT, a Norwegian expert group in 2003 reviewed published international literature on breech births and obtained information on perinatal morbidity and mortality in term breech infants in Norway. Their results showed a lower perinatal morbidity among infants born vaginally in breech presentation compared to both study groups of the TBT. The mortality rate was 0.31% when corrected for lethal malformations and 0.09% after the additional correction for death before admission to the maternity clinic. This could be explained by the close fetal monitoring, national procedures, and sufficient skills of obstetric staff, combined with high quality neonatal service, in contrast to many of the participating clinics in the TBT. As a result, Norwegian delivery units have continued a practice with vaginal delivery provided that strict national guidelines are followed. As one of few countries in the western world which has continued to practice planned vaginal delivery in selected women, quality control of own practice is fundamental, and sharing current experience with vaginal breech deliveries has strongly been encouraged.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate prospectively registered neonatal and maternal outcomes in term singleton breech deliveries in a Norwegian hospital ten years after TBT. We aim to compare outcomes in term breech infants after planned vaginal delivery versus after elective cesarean section.

### Revisiting the management of term breech presentation: a proposal for overcoming some of the controversies [^1141bato]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Term breech presentation: are we asking the right questions?

It now appears time to expand our thinking and, considering recent important data that help elucidate the underlying significance of persistent breech presentation at term, to offer more dynamic and multidisciplinary insight into the management of these cases.

Indeed, similar to some older studies, several recent population-based studies strongly suggest that the increased risk observed in foetuses that remain in the breech presentation at term is closely linked to antenatal or underlying disorders that may be associated with the breech presentation and is not solely due to the mode of delivery. Because adverse outcomes can be caused by underlying or gestational disorders, any discussion that is limited to delivery mode seems too restrictive and does not address the whole issue.

### Reducing stillbirths: interventions during labour [^114fuaGs]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The above evidence for planned caesarean section delivery for singleton breech presentation at term indicates that this intervention is associated with a statistically significant reduction in perinatal and neonatal mortality and morbidity, though it is associated with increased short-term maternal morbidity associated with recovery from a Caesarean section. The largest study in the Cochrane review, the Term Breech Trial, demonstrates strong evidence of benefit of planned caesarean section in reducing perinatal mortality, though it should be noted that no point estimates for impact on stillbirths were reported. Additionally, a number of methodological and analytical criticisms have been levied at the largest study in the Cochrane review (the Term Breech Trial, whose principal investigator co-authored the Cochrane review) including a lack of adherence to inclusion criteria, great variability in level of care between facilities and labours (including insufficient monitoring in some cases), and a lack of clinicians with expertise in vaginal breech delivery, Glezerman M: Five years to the term breech trial: the rise and fall of a randomised controlled trial. Am J Obstet Gynecol 2006, 194:20–25.

Although planned Caesarean for breech presentation appears to be a promising intervention, in light of these criticisms and the downstream implications of recommending a policy of Caesarean section in low-resource settings, our recommendation for Caesarean section in term breech presentation carries several caveats. Given the risks associated with Caesarean section, a planned Caesarean section should only be considered after external cephalic version has been unsuccessful and sufficient time has been allowed for spontaneous version and cephalic birth to take place. Caesarean section poses short-term risks of infection and haemorrhage, as well as long-term risks including uterine rupture (particularly where a classical incision is performed), placental invasion of the uterine scar, stillbirth, and maternal death, for women who cannot or do not access facilities with comprehensive essential obstetric care in subsequent pregnancies. For these reasons, in some low-resource settings, the complications associated with Caesarean section may pose greater risks to both mothers' and babies' lives than vaginal delivery for breech presentation. Vaginal birth for breech presentations is advised in these circumstances, as 97% of breech-position singleton infants will be born without complications. Additionally, adoption of a policy of breech delivery by Caesarean section will ultimately lead to the disappearance of the specialised clinical skills required to perform vaginal breech delivery, meaning that women with breech fetuses who do deliver vaginally may face greater risk.

### Revisiting the management of term breech presentation: a proposal for overcoming some of the controversies [^111hkYJd]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

As noted by methodologists, real-world prenatal patient care is subject to decision-making based on the continuous evaluation of risk factors, medical history, comorbidities, behavioural aspects, and other factors that indeed cannot be strictly reproduced in randomized controlled trials. For example, in the TBT, an upper limit of 4000–4500 g was given for estimated foetal weight. However, as the duration between randomization and delivery inevitably lengthened in the planned vaginal delivery group, a significantly higher number of macrosomic neonates were born in the planned vaginal delivery group (P = 0.002). In actuality, an informed woman who opts for vaginal delivery at 36 or 37 weeks of gestation usually changes her mind if she has not delivered several weeks later and if the clinician tells her that the birthweight will probably exceed 3800–4000 g, with an associated increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. Thus, in cases of even minor glycaemic disorder, special attention should be paid in the 37th week of gestation to foetal weight estimates and the possible occurrence of preeclampsia or associated gestational disorders; moreover, cases of SGA foetuses with possible foetal growth restriction should be closely followed, regardless of the delivery mode chosen by the patient.

How might we maximize patient benefit from a safe external cephalic version attempt?

With the restrictive practice of breech vaginal delivery in the last 15 years, national colleges of obstetricians (RCOG, ACOG, SOGC and RANZCOG) and FIGO updated their guidelines and recommended external cephalic version (ECV) at term to limit the increase in elective CS rate for cases of term breech presentation. However, recent data urge us to develop a broader perspective and an accurate assessment of the real impact of various ECV policies.

Indeed, the true impact of ECV may first be limited by the timely detection of breech presentation. In a retrospective cohort study of 394 consecutive cases of breech presentation at term, Hemelaar et al. found that over two periods separated by 10 years (1998–1999 and 2008–2009), the proportion of breech presentations not diagnosed antenatally increased from 23.2 to 32.5% (P = 0.04), causing 52.8% of women who were eligible for ECV to miss an attempt in 2008–2009. The authors also reported that the proportion of women who declined ECV during the same period decreased significantly from 19.1 to 9.0%.

### ACOG committee opinion. mode of term singleton breech delivery. number 265, December 2001. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [^116dLJRv]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2002). Low credibility.

Recently, researchers conducted a large, international multicenter randomized clinical trial comparing a policy of planned cesarean birth with planned vaginal birth. Given the results of this exceptionally large and well-controlled clinical trial, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee on Obstetric Practice recommends that obstetricians continue their efforts to reduce breech presentations in singleton gestations through the application of external cephalic version whenever possible. As a result of the findings of the study, planned vaginal delivery of a term singleton breech may no longer be appropriate. In those instances in which breech vaginal deliveries are pursued, great caution should be exercised. Patients with persistent breech presentation at term in a singleton gestation should undergo a planned cesarean delivery. A planned cesarean delivery does not apply to patients presenting in advanced labor with a fetus in the breech presentation in whom delivery is likely to be imminent or to patients whose second twin is in a nonvertex presentation.

### Revisiting the management of term breech presentation: a proposal for overcoming some of the controversies [^115LBx9J]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Towards a consensus for a global shared vision and management of term breech presentation that could include the following

A policy of breech presentation screening at 36 weeks of gestation is efficient and cost effective.
Such screening should allow timely ECV and a careful evaluation of potential underlying antenatal risks, considering obstetric history, estimated foetal weight/growth and potential gestational disorders.
Foetal weight estimates based on clinical and ultrasound examinations are essential, despite the large confidence interval of all available algorithms for producing such estimates. Vaginal birth may be excluded when the estimated foetal weight approximates the upper limit used for selection in most national guidelines (3800 g), particularly in the absence of previous successful vaginal delivery.
Before vaginal delivery is considered, clinical pelvic examination is universally recommended to rule out pathological pelvic contraction. Radiologic or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pelvimetry is not universally conducted. However, Van Loon et al. demonstrated in a randomized controlled trial that the use of MRI pelvimetry in breech presentation at term allowed better selection of delivery route, with a significantly lower emergency CS rate. More specifically, several recent studies have evaluated the contribution of pelvimetry and found that MRI pelvimetry provided useful criteria for the preselection and counselling of women with breech presentation and the desire for vaginal delivery. Therefore, pelvimetry is diversely used in Europe for the preselection and counselling of women (particularly nulliparous women) with breech presentation and is specifically used in regions where vaginal delivery is still considered an option.
In cases of failed ECV with persistent breech presentation, this policy should allow customized care tailored to each situation in the last weeks of pregnancy.
A discussion with the informed patient is essential. One must thoroughly consider the experience of the health care team/the availability of clinical skills required for conducting a vaginal breech delivery and carefully select women who are eligible for planned vaginal delivery (considering obstetric history and the criteria described above for the choice between planned vaginal and CS deliveries).
Regardless of the planned mode of delivery, adequate follow-up during the last weeks of pregnancy is mandatory, with particular consideration of possible associated underlying disorders (particularly foetal growth restriction or excessive foetal weight in cases of gestational diabetes mellitus). Thus, the foetal weight estimation should be carefully considered in the 37th week of gestation, even in cases of minor glycaemic disorder, with regular reassessments and a plan for CS delivery if the patient remains pregnant for many more weeks and if foetal weight estimates reach approximately 3600–3800 g.
If vaginal delivery is planned, careful labour management by a skilled team is needed, accompanied by continuous foetal heart rate monitoring and a particular focus on the rate of progress in the second delivery stage. When such conditions are not or cannot be fulfilled, a planned CS may be the best choice.
When a CS has been planned, adequate follow-up during the last weeks of pregnancy and careful calculation of the delivery date are needed, taking into account possible comorbidities and gestational disorders.

### SOGC clinical practice guideline: vaginal delivery of breech presentation: no. 226, June 2009 [^1165LdJJ]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review the physiology of breech birth; to discern the risks and benefits of a trial of labour versus planned Caesarean section; and to recommend to obstetricians, family physicians, midwives, obstetrical nurses, anaesthesiologists, pediatricians, and other health care providers selection criteria, intrapartum management parameters, and delivery techniques for a trial of vaginal breech birth.

Options

Trial of labour in an appropriate setting or delivery by pre-emptive Caesarean section for women with a singleton breech fetus at term.

Outcomes

Reduced perinatal mortality, short-term neonatal morbidity, longterm infant morbidity, and short- and long-term maternal morbidity and mortality.

Evidence

Medline was searched for randomized trials, prospective cohort studies, and selected retrospective cohort studies comparing planned Caesarean section with a planned trial of labour; selected epidemiological studies comparing delivery by Caesarean section with vaginal breech delivery; and studies comparing long-term outcomes in breech infants born vaginally or by Caesarean section. Additional articles were identified through bibliography tracing up to June 1, 2008.

Values

The evidence collected was reviewed by the Maternal Fetal Medicine Committee of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) and quantified using the criteria and classifications of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care.

Validation

This guideline was compared with the 2006 American College of Obstetrician's Committee Opinion on the mode of term singleton breech delivery and with the 2006 Royal College of Obstetrician and Gynaecologists Green Top Guideline: The Management of Breech Presentation. The document was reviewed by Canadian and International clinicians with particular expertise in breech vaginal delivery.

### External cephalic version for breech presentation at term [^116xbXcF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Management of breech presentation is controversial, particularly in regard to manipulation of the position of the fetus by external cephalic version (ECV). ECV may reduce the number of breech presentations and caesarean sections, but there also have been reports of complications with the procedure.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of ECV at or near term on measures of pregnancy outcome. Methods of facilitating ECV, and ECV before term are reviewed separately.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Trials Register (28 February 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials of ECV at or near term (with or without tocolysis) compared with no attempt at ECV in women with breech presentation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors assessed eligibility and trial quality, and extracted the data.

Main Results

We included eight studies, with a total of 1308 women randomised. The pooled data from these studies show a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in non-cephalic presentation at birth (average risk ratio (RR) 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29 to 0.61, eight trials, 1305 women); vaginal cephalic birth not achieved (average RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.62, seven trials, 1253 women, evidence graded very low); and caesarean section (average RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.82, eight trials, 1305 women, evidence graded very low) when ECV was attempted in comparison to no ECV attempted. There were no significant differences in the incidence of Apgar score ratings below seven at one minute (average RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.37, three trials, 168 infants) or five minutes (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.36, five trials, 428 infants, evidence graded very low), low umbilical vein pH levels (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.44, one trial, 52 infants, evidence graded very low), neonatal admission (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.34, four trials, 368 infants, evidence graded very low), perinatal death (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.64, eight trials, 1305 infants, evidence graded low), nor time from enrolment to delivery (mean difference -0.25 days, 95% CI -2.81 to 2.31, two trials, 256 women). All of the trials included in this review had design limitations, and the level of evidence was graded low or very low. No studies attempted to blind the intervention, and the process of random allocation was suboptimal in several studies. Three of the eight trials had serious design limitations, however excluding these studies in a sensitivity analysis for outcomes with substantial heterogeneity did not alter the results.

Authors' Conclusions

Attempting cephalic version at term reduces the chance of non-cephalic presentation at birth, vaginal cephalic birth not achieved and caesarean section. There is not enough evidence from randomised trials to assess complications of ECV at term. Large observational studies suggest that complications are rare.

### Breech delivery at a university hospital in tanzania [^112uzUFA]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In 2000, the Term Breech Trial (TBT) concluded that planned Cesarean delivery (CD) (compared to planned vaginal birth) for breech presentation improved fetal outcome, though only modestly increasing maternal morbidity. A systematic review in 2015 by Berhan et al. reports a substantial increase in elective CDs for breech presentation in high-income countries since 2000; at the same time, a two- to fivefold risk increase in perinatal mortality and morbidity has been reported with planned vaginal delivery (VD).

The TBT reports that, in settings with a low perinatal mortality rate (PMR) (≤ 20/1,000), the rate of perinatal mortality/serious morbidity was 0.4% for planned CD and 5.3% for planned vaginal delivery (VD), whereas in settings with a high PMR (> 20/1,000), in one low- and eight middle-income countries, the rate of perinatal mortality/serious morbidity was 2.9% for planned CD and 4.4% for VD. These results challenge the TBT's conclusions with respect to the effect of planned CD on perinatal outcome in a low-income setting, where CDs for breech presentation are increasing.

### Implementation of the external cephalic version in breech delivery. Dutch national implementation study of external cephalic version [^115kp7PT]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Breech presentation occurs in 3 to 4% of all term pregnancies. External cephalic version (ECV) is proven effective to prevent vaginal breech deliveries and therefore it is recommended by clinical guidelines of the Royal Dutch Organisation for Midwives (KNOV) and the Dutch Society for Obstetrics and Gynaecology (NVOG). Implementation of ECV does not exceed 50 to 60% and probably less.

We aim to improve the implementation of ECV to decrease maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality due to breech presentations. This will be done by defining barriers and facilitators of implementation of ECV in the Netherlands. An innovative implementation strategy will be developed based on improved patient counselling and thorough instructions of health care providers for counselling.

Method/design

The ultimate purpose of this implementation study is to improve counselling of pregnant women and information of clinicians to realize a better implementation of ECV.

The first phase of the project is to detect the barriers and facilitators of ECV. The next step is to develop an implementation strategy to inform and counsel pregnant women with a breech presentation, and to inform and educate care providers. In the third phase, the effectiveness of the developed implementation strategy will be evaluated in a randomised trial. The study population is a random selection of midwives and gynaecologists from 60 to 100 hospitals and practices. Primary endpoints are number of counselled women. Secondary endpoints are process indicators, the amount of fetes in cephalic presentation at birth, complications due to ECV, the number of caesarean sections and perinatal condition of mother and child. Cost effectiveness of the implementation strategy will be measured.

Discussion

This study will provide evidence for the cost effectiveness of a structural implementation of external cephalic versions to reduce the number of breech presentations at term.

### Breech vaginal delivery at or near term [^111cz77F]. Seminars in Perinatology (2003). Low credibility.

Three percent to 4% of term fetuses will be breech at delivery. Evidence from randomized controlled trials has found a policy of planned cesarean section to be significantly better for the singleton fetus in breech presentation at term compared to a policy of planned vaginal birth. However, some women may wish to avoid cesarean section and for others, cesarean section may not be possible. We undertook this review to identify factors associated with higher and lower risk of adverse fetal or neonatal outcome at term during vaginal breech delivery. We searched MEDLINE from 1966 to 2002 using the search terms vaginal breech delivery and breech presentation and retrieved all relevant articles. We also reviewed personal references and reference lists of articles retrieved. Women who are older or who have a fetus that is either in footling presentation, has a hyperextended head or is estimated to weigh < 2500 g or > 4000 g may be at higher risk of adverse fetal outcome. Prolonged labor or not having an experienced clinician at vaginal breech birth may also increase the risk. Women with a fetus in breech presentation at term should be offered the option of delivery by planned cesarean section and should be informed that this will reduce their risk of adverse fetal or neonatal outcome. Practitioners should develop and maintain skills at vaginal breech delivery for those women not wishing or not able to be delivered by cesarean section.

### Women's experiences of planning a vaginal breech birth in Australia [^113P41LZ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal mode of birth for women who have a breech presentation has been the subject of controversy over the past decade. In the wake of the Term Breech Trial in 2000, the proportion of vaginal breech births (VBB) significantly reduced and many clinicians currently recommend birth by elective caesarean section (CS). This has led to changes in the care of women with a breech presentation at term including an increased emphasis on external cephalic version. As a result, the pool of expertise to facilitate VBB has diminished and many clinicians complete their education with little or no experience of vaginal breech births and little opportunity to gain experience. It is likely that this results in VBB being rarely supported although there limited data on planned VBB rates.

Several observational studies attest to the safety of vaginal breech birth provided strict criteria are adhered to. These studies and the ongoing critique of the Term Breech Trial have promoted policy shifts in a number of countries supporting VBB. There is some enthusiasm and policy reform in Australia and other countries towards vaginal breech birth being a viable option for carefully selected women with strict protocols in centres with the necessary expertise.

There is little known about the experiences of women who plan a VBB. The Term Breech Trial examined women's views two years after participation using a questionnaire. Women in the planned caesarean group reported less worry about their baby's health with no differences in their rating of staff, quality of intrapartum care or involvement in decision-making. Only two small qualitative studies have examined planning a vaginal breech birth. In Jamaica, a study of nine women found that experiences were affected by the level and timing of information about breech presentation. In Switzerland, a study of 12 women found that a supportive environment and shared decision-making were important. Recently, the dilemma of breech birth has been highlighted in The Lancet with calls to improve the quality of education about vaginal breech birth and to listen to what pregnant women have to say. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the experiences of women who had planned a vaginal breech birth in Australia in the preceding seven years.

### Protocol for the evaluation of a decision aid for women with a breech-presenting baby [^111vr52N]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Breech presentation

Breech presentation occurs when a baby presents with the buttocks or feet rather than head first (cephalic presentation). As breech presentation is related to both fetal size and gestational age, the incidence decreases as pregnancy progresses to 3–4% by full-term. Decades of controversy over the safe management of breech birth at term has recently been resolved by an international multicentre randomised controlled trial (the Term Breech Trial, TBT) of planned vaginal breech birth versus planned caesarean section (CS). This trial was stopped prematurely because of overwhelming benefit favouring planned CS, with a relative risk of 0.33 (95%CI 0.19–0.56) for perinatal/neonatal mortality or serious neonatal morbidity. The TBT results were subsequently added to two small trials in a Cochrane Systematic Review. The reduction in perinatal morbidity and mortality was even more pronounced when the analyses were limited to births in low perinatal mortality countries, such as Australia (RR 0.13; 95%CI 0.05–0.31). However, planned caesarean section was associated with increased maternal morbidity (RR 1.29; 95% CI 1.03–1.61).

These results have dramatically altered a woman's options if she has a breech presentation at term, as CS is now offered as the safest and in many institutions the only, management option. This change has occurred rapidly: The TBT was published in October 2000 and the rate of vaginal breech birth in NSW declined from 17% in 1999 to 14% in 2000 and 4.5% in 2001. However, while safer than vaginal breech birth, planned CS is not without risk. Complications include increased risk of pulmonary embolism, infection, bleeding, damage to bladder and bowel, slower recovery from the birth, longer hospitalisation, respiratory difficulties for the baby, delayed bonding and breastfeeding, and compromise of future obstetric performance. Therefore, the best way to avoid the increased risks associated with term breech presentation is to avoid it altogether, and this is possible via external cephalic version.

### Risk factors associated with adverse perinatal outcome in planned vaginal breech labors at term: a retrospective population-based case-control study [^112kvFiH]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Breech presentation at term occurs in two to three per cent of all singleton term deliveries. The majority of breech pregnancies are delivered nowadays by cesarean section, as planned vaginal breech delivery is controversial. Some studies and most importantly the term breech trial by Hannah M. have reported that planned vaginal breech labor is associated with adverse perinatal outcome. Other studies have been published which show that vaginal breech delivery is safe for mother and child if the women for a trial of labor are carefully selected and labor management takes place in an appropriate obstetric setting. Many national associations of obstetricians and gynecologists have defined guidelines to determine under which circumstances a vaginal breech delivery is feasible, but even under these circumstances adverse perinatal outcomes still occur. In recent literature there are only two articles that review risk factors associated with adverse perinatal outcome in planned vaginal breech delivery, but neither article had the statistical power to analyze risk factors for perinatal mortality and severe neonatal outcome. More evidence and a better understanding of factors associated with adverse perinatal outcome might aid in making optimal selections for a trial of vaginal breech labor. The aim of this study is to determine risk factors for adverse perinatal outcome in planned vaginal breech delivery, to aid practitioners in the selection of women for vaginal breech delivery and to limit the risks of adverse perinatal outcome.

### Adherence to guidelines and suboptimal practice in term breech delivery with perinatal death-a population-based case-control study in Norway [^111ZHVkj]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal mode of delivery of a fetus in breech presentation has been debated for more than half a century. The essential question has centered around the risk for the fetus associated with vaginal delivery versus the risk for the pregnant woman associated with caesarean delivery (CD) in present and future pregnancies.

In 2000, the Term Breech Trial (TBT) was published. This randomized controlled multi-center trial found lower perinatal mortality, neonatal mortality and serious morbidity in a group of women where CD was planned compared to a control group where vaginal delivery was planned. The study concluded that planned CD was better than planned vaginal birth for a fetus in breech presentation at term. The results of the TBT had a huge impact on clinical practice worldwide.

However, the study was also criticized. In Norway, a group of national experts reviewed the evidence underlying these recommendations. Taking into consideration the much lower perinatal mortality in Norway than in the study populations included in the TBT, these experts concluded that vaginal delivery would still be safe, provided careful assessment of maternal and fetal status. Nonetheless, clinical practice also changed in Norway where the vaginal breech delivery rate decreased from around 50 to 30% after 2000.

In a recent study using prospectively recorded data from two national health registers, we found a significantly increased risk of intrapartum or neonatal mortality in singletons without congenital anomalies born vaginally in breech at term compared with singletons born vaginally in cephalic presentation. However, limitations of register-based studies are the lack of detailed information regarding the delivery, as well as potential misclassifications for example due to congenital anomalies not identified at birth. A perinatal audit, defined as a systematic and critical analysis of the quality of the medical care of pregnant women and their newborns complement the findings provided by large register-based studies by identifying and analysing rare events, as well as provide a basis for proposing suggestions for improvement of care.

Therefore, as an expansion of our previous population-based study, we report the results of a case-control study completed as a perinatal audit of breech deliveries in Norway. The main aim was to explore if deviation from Norwegian guidelines was more common in breech deliveries associated with intrapartum or neonatal death than in breech deliveries where the infant survived. We also wanted to assess if death might have been prevented if the child had been delivered by planned CD, and whether suboptimal clinical management was more common in breech deliveries where the offspring died than deliveries where the offspring survived.

### Cost-effectiveness of external cephalic version for term breech presentation [^114VtY3i]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2010). Low credibility.

Quantifying the cost and effectiveness of ECV for breech presentation compared to scheduled cesarean is complicated because ECV does not always result in a cephalic presentation and subsequent vaginal delivery. While the probability of success in ECV is approximately 58%, the fetus may spontaneously revert back to breech before delivery. In addition, vertex presentation at term does not necessarily translate to a vaginal delivery and a cesarean may still be performed for other reasons. An unsuccessful ECV may warrant a second trial of ECV and potential adverse events with each trial, such as emergent caesarean section. Patient preferences need to be factored into the decision.

Cost-effectiveness analysis produces a ratio. The numerator takes into consideration the additional costs that one intervention imposes over another. The denominator considers the incremental improvement in health-related quality of life calculated as quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). The goal of this study was to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, from society's perspective, of ECV compared to directly scheduling a cesarean delivery for term breech presentation. Our base case focuses on a parturient presenting with an ultrasound confirmed singleton breech fetus at ≥ 36 completed weeks gestation, with no contraindications for vaginal delivery. The base case represents a baseline scenario for the initial analysis before any of the assumptions are varied to elucidate key variables in the ECV decision.

### Impact of implementation of a breech clinic in a tertiary hospital [^116Mr899]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Breech presentation occurs in three to 5% of singleton pregnancies after 37 weeks of gestational age (GA). The publication of the Term Breech Trial (TBT) in 2000 had a significant impact on obstetric practice with many countries and international organisations recommending against vaginal birth. However, more recently, and mostly due to concerns surrounding the global rise in caesarean section rates and on-going criticisms about the methodology and the interpretation of the TBT, this option has been re-evaluated. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO), Le Collège National des Gynécologues et Obstétriciens Français (CNGOF), the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) now support the option of vaginal breech birth.

### Revisiting the management of term breech presentation: a proposal for overcoming some of the controversies [^111WDfZ4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

In these 14 studies accounting for 74,094 breech vaginal deliveries, the retrospective observational cohort study from the Finnish Medical Birth Register and the prospective observational study PREMODA (as well as the more recent Norwegian Medical Birth Registry study) applied similar pre-established exclusion criteria for planned vaginal birth. In the PREMODA study, an increased absolute rate of perinatal death or serious neonatal morbidity was observed in both the planned vaginal group (1.60, 95% CI 1.14–2.17) and planned CS delivery group (1.45 [1.16–1.81]) with breech presentation among the total population of 264,105 births, but the planned vaginal group and the planned CS delivery group with breech presentation did not differ significantly for the combined outcome of foetal/neonatal mortality or serious morbidity (odds ratio [OR] = 1.10, 95% CI [0.75–1.61]). The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists proposes comparable pre-established criteria for the management of term breech presentation, recommending that "women should be informed that a higher risk of planned vaginal breech birth is expected where there are independent indications for CS section and in circumstances such as a hyperextended neck on ultrasound, high estimated foetal weight (more than 3,800 g), low estimated weight (less than tenth centile), footling presentation, [and] evidence of antenatal foetal compromise" but considers that "the role of pelvimetry is unclear". Of note concerning this last point, Van Loon et al. showed in a randomized controlled trial that the adequacy of pelvis size, as assessed by pelvimetry, improved the selection of delivery route. In line with them, two recent studies support this view. Other authors also included criteria for the adequate management and continuous monitoring of foetal heart rate during labour (which is common in maternity wards of most high-income countries but could be monitored intermittently in the TBT). Indeed, decreased variability and late decelerations are more prevalent during breech deliveries than vertex deliveries, and good labour progress is a predictor of better neonatal outcomes. In the Finnish Medical Birth Register, 1270 women (43.6%) were selected as candidates for vaginal breech delivery, and the selection quality was confirmed by the low conversion rate of vaginal to CS breech delivery (11.4%). This rate was higher (36.1%) in the TBT.

### Interventions for helping to turn term breech babies to head first presentation when using external cephalic version [^116SN2ND]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Breech presentation is associated with increased complications. Turning a breech baby to head first presentation using external cephalic version (ECV) attempts to reduce the chances of breech presentation at birth, and reduce the adverse effects of breech vaginal birth or caesarean section. Tocolytic drugs and other methods have been used in an attempt to facilitate ECV.

Objectives

To assess interventions such as tocolysis, fetal acoustic stimulation, regional analgesia, transabdominal amnioinfusion or systemic opioids on ECV for a breech baby at term.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2011) and the reference lists of identified studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing the above interventions with no intervention or other methods to facilitate ECV at term.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed eligibility and trial quality. Two review authors independently assessed for inclusion all potential studies identified as a result of the search strategy and independently extracted the data using a designed data extraction form.

Main Results

We included 25 studies, providing data on 2548 women. We used the random-effects model for pooling data due to clinical heterogeneity in the included studies in the various comparisons. The overall quality of the evidence was reasonable, but a number of assessments had insufficient data to provide an answer with any degree of assurance. Tocolytic drugs, in particular betastimulants, were effective in increasing cephalic presentations in labour (average risk ratio (RR) 1.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.85, eight studies, 993 women) and in reducing the number of caesarean sections (average RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.94, eight studies, 1177 women). No differences were identified in fetal bradycardias (average RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.89, three studies, 467 women) although the review is underpowered for assessing this outcome. We identified no difference in success, cephalic presentation in labour and caesarean sections between nulliparous and multiparous women. There were insufficient data comparing different groups of tocolytic drugs. Sensitivity analyses by study quality agreed with the overall findings. Regional analgesia in combination with a tocolytic was more effective than the tocolytic alone in terms of increasing successful versions (assessed by the rate of failed ECVs, average RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.89, six studies, 550 women) but there was no difference identified in cephalic presentation in labour (average RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.75 to 3.53, three studies, 279 women) nor in caesarean sections (average RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.37, three studies, 279 women) or fetal bradycardia (average RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.62 to 3.57, two studies, 210 women). There were insufficient data on the use of vibroacoustic stimulation, amnioinfusion or systemic opioids.

Authors' Conclusions

Betastimulants, to facilitate ECV, increased cephalic presentation in labour and birth, and reduced the caesarean section rate in both nulliparous and multiparous women, but there were insufficient data on adverse effects. Calcium channel blockers and nitric acid donors had insufficient data to provide good evidence. At present we recommend betamimetics for facilitating ECV. There is scope for further research. The possible benefits of tocolysis to reduce the force required for successful version and the possible risks of maternal cardiovascular side effects, need to be addressed further. Further trials are needed to compare the effectiveness of routine versus selective use of tocolysis, the role of regional analgesia, fetal acoustic stimulation, amnioinfusion and the effect of intravenous or oral hydration prior to ECV. Although randomised trials of nitroglycerine are small, the results are sufficiently negative to discourage further trials.

### Expedited versus conservative approaches for vaginal delivery in breech presentation [^111Dekuz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In a vaginal breech birth there may be benefit from rapid delivery of the baby to prevent progressive acidosis. However, this needs to be weighed against the potential trauma of a quick delivery.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of expedited vaginal delivery (breech delivery from umbilicus to delivery of the head within one contraction) on perinatal outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials of expedited vaginal breech delivery compared with delivery not routinely expedited in women undergoing vaginal breech delivery.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the one identified trial for inclusion. If studies are included in future updates, two review authors will assess risk of bias, extract data and check data for accuracy.

Main Results

No studies were included.

Authors' Conclusions

There is not enough evidence to evaluate the effects of expedited vaginal breech delivery.

### Is planned vaginal delivery for breech presentation at term still an option? Results of an observational prospective survey in France and Belgium [^115edc21]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

A large trial published in 2000 concluded that planned vaginal delivery of term breech births is associated with high neonatal risks. Because the obstetric practices in that study differed from those in countries where planned vaginal delivery is still common, we conducted an observational prospective study to describe neonatal outcome according to the planned mode of delivery for term breech births in 2 such countries.

Study Design

Observational prospective study with an intent-to-treat analysis to compare the groups for which cesarean and vaginal deliveries were planned. Associations between the outcome and planned mode of delivery were controlled for confounding by multivariate analysis. The main outcome measure was a variable that combined fetal and neonatal mortality and severe neonatal morbidity. The study population consisted of 8105 pregnant women delivering singleton fetuses in breech presentation at term in 138 French and 36 Belgian maternity units.

Results

Cesarean delivery was planned for 5579 women (68.8%) and vaginal delivery for 2526 (31.2%). Of the women with planned vaginal deliveries, 1796 delivered vaginally (71.0%). The rate of the combined neonatal outcome measure was low in the overall population (1.59%; 95% CI [1.33–1.89]) and in the planned vaginal delivery group (1.60%; 95% CI [1.14–2.17]). It did not differ significantly between the planned vaginal and cesarean delivery groups (unadjusted odds ratio = 1.10, 95% CI [0.75–1.61]), even after controlling for confounding variables (adjusted odds ratio = 1.40, 95% CI [0.89–2.23]).

Conclusion

In places where planned vaginal delivery is a common practice and when strict criteria are met before and during labor, planned vaginal delivery of singleton fetuses in breech presentation at term remains a safe option that can be offered to women.

### Once more unto the breech: planned vaginal delivery compared with planned cesarean delivery [^116Eo3t8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

This article provides a knowledge-based assessment of planned cesarean delivery compared with planned vaginal delivery for breech presentation at term gestation. The most critical evidence on this issue is the intention-to-treat analysis from the Term Breech Trial, which showed that planned cesarean delivery reduced composite perinatal death and serious neonatal morbidity. Although there was no difference in composite death or neurodevelopmental delay at 2 years of age, this finding was based on only 44% of randomized patients and was not an analysis by intention to treat. On the other hand, the design of the nonexperimental Presentation et Mode d'Accouchement: presentation and mode of delivery (PREMODA) study (which showed no difference in composite perinatal mortality or morbidity after planned cesarean delivery compared with planned vaginal delivery), likely favored the planned vaginal delivery group; lack of exclusion criteria led to higher risk women (with contraindications to vaginal delivery) being included in the planned cesarean delivery group. Such selection bias notwithstanding, both the Term Breech Trial and the PREMODA study showed significantly higher rates of 5-minute Apgar score less than 4, 5-minute Apgar score less than 7, intubation, and birth trauma in the planned vaginal delivery group. Finally, studies from the Netherlands, Denmark, and Canada have shown that increases in planned cesarean delivery after the Term Breech Trial led to improved neonatal outcomes. Nevertheless, planned vaginal delivery continues to be associated with higher rates of adverse perinatal outcomes in these countries. The totality of the evidence therefore unequivocally shows the relatively greater safety of planned cesarean delivery for breech presentation at term gestation.

### Cephalic version by moxibustion for breech presentation [^112MBRC5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Breech presentation at term can cause complications during birth and increase the chance of caesarean section. Moxibustion (a type of Chinese medicine which involves burning a herb close to the skin) at the acupuncture point Bladder 67 (BL67) (Chinese name Zhiyin), located at the tip of the fifth toe, has been proposed as a way of changing breech presentation to cephalic presentation. This is an update of a review first published in 2005 and last published in 2012.

Objectives

To examine the effectiveness and safety of moxibustion on changing the presentation of an unborn baby in the breech position, the need for external cephalic version (ECV), mode of birth, and perinatal morbidity and mortality.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (which includes trials from CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and conference proceedings), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (4 November 2021). We also searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, AMED, Embase and MIDIRS (inception to 3 November 2021), and the reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

The inclusion criteria were published and unpublished randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing moxibustion either alone or in combination with other techniques (e.g. acupuncture or postural techniques) with a control group (no moxibustion) or other methods (e.g. acupuncture, postural techniques) in women with a singleton breech presentation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently determined trial eligibility, assessed trial quality, and extracted data. Outcome measures were baby's presentation at birth, need for ECV, mode of birth, perinatal morbidity and mortality, maternal complications and maternal satisfaction, and adverse events. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: This updated review includes 13 studies (2181 women), of which six trials are new. Most studies used adequate methods for random sequence generation and allocation concealment. Blinding of participants and personnel is challenging with a manual therapy intervention; however, the use of objective outcomes meant that the lack of blinding was unlikely to affect the results. Most studies reported little or no loss to follow-up, and few trial protocols were available. One study that was terminated early was judged as high risk for other sources of bias. Meta-analysis showed that compared to usual care alone, the combination of moxibustion plus usual care probably reduces the chance of non-cephalic presentation at birth (7 trials, 1152 women; risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 0.99, I² = 38%; moderate-certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of moxibustion plus usual care on the need for ECV (4 trials, 692 women; RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.21, I² = 78%; low-certainty evidence) because the CIs included both appreciable benefit and moderate harm. Adding moxibustion to usual care probably has little to no effect on the chance of caesarean section (6 trials, 1030 women; RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.05, I² = 0%; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of moxibustion plus usual care on the the chance of premature rupture of membranes (3 trials, 402 women; RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.17 to 10.21, I² = 59%; low-certainty evidence) because there were very few data. Moxibustion plus usual care probably reduces the use of oxytocin (1 trial, 260 women; RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.60; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the chance of cord blood pH less than 7.1 (1 trial, 212 women; RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.32 to 28.38; low-certainty evidence) because there were very few data. We are very uncertain whether the combination of moxibustion plus usual care increases the chance of adverse events (including nausea, unpleasant odour, abdominal pain and uterine contractions; intervention: 27/65, control: 0/57), as only one study presented data in a way that could be reanalysed (122 women; RR 48.33, 95% CI 3.01 to 774.86; very low-certainty evidence). When moxibustion plus usual care was compared with sham moxibustion plus usual care, we found that moxibustion probably reduces the chance of non-cephalic presentation at birth (1 trial, 272 women; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.95; moderate-certainty evidence) and probably results in little to no effect on the rate of caesarean section (1 trial, 272 women; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.04; moderate-certainty evidence). No study that compared moxibustion plus usual care with sham moxibustion plus usual care reported on the clinically important outcomes of need for ECV, premature rupture of membranes, use of oxytocin, and cord blood pH less than 7.1, and one trial that reported adverse events reported data for the whole sample. When moxibustion was combined with acupuncture and usual care, there was very little evidence about the effect of the combination on non-cephalic presentation at birth (1 trial, 226 women; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.94) and at the end of treatment (2 trials, 254 women; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.93), and on the need for ECV (1 trial, 14 women; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.07 to 3.01). There was very little evidence about whether moxibustion plus acupuncture plus usual care reduced the chance of caesarean section (2 trials, 240 women; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.99) or pre-eclampsia (1 trial, 14 women; RR 5.00, 95% CI 0.24 to 104.15). The certainty of the evidence for this comparison was not assessed.

Authors' Conclusions

We found moderate-certainty evidence that moxibustion plus usual care probably reduces the chance of non-cephalic presentation at birth, but uncertain evidence about the need for ECV. Moderate-certainty evidence from one study shows that moxibustion plus usual care probably reduces the use of oxytocin before or during labour. However, moxibustion plus usual care probably results in little to no difference in the rate of caesarean section, and we are uncertain about its effects on the chance of premature rupture of membranes and cord blood pH less than 7.1. Adverse events were inadequately reported in most trials.

### Birth after caesarean study – planned vaginal birth or planned elective repeat caesarean for women at term with a single previous caesarean birth: protocol for a patient preference study and randomised trial [^1124eNHV]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2007). Low credibility.

Sample Size

The incidence of serious adverse infant outcome is the primary endpoint of the study. The true risk of serious adverse infant outcome is estimated as 1.6% for planned elective, repeat caesarean birth. It is proposed that sufficient women are recruited to provide reliable evidence about the effects of a policy of planned VBAC compared with a policy of planned elective, repeat caesarean on serious adverse infant outcomes. The sample size will detect a change in risk from 1.6% to 3.6% as suggested by the systematic reviews. If the ratio of ERC to VBAC is 1:1 a study of 2180 women would have an 80% power of detecting a statistically significant difference at an alpha level of 0.05 (two tailed). Our pilot study has suggested a ratio of 5.5:4.5. Allowing for an ERC to VBAC ratio of 6.5:3.5 and a small loss to follow up (1%) the sample size required will be 2314 women.

The expected rate of serious maternal complications for planned elective repeat caesarean section is likely to be higher than the 3.9% found in the planned caesarean section arm of the Term Breech Trial. Systematic reviews of the cohort studies of VBAC compared with elective repeat caesarean section provide an estimate of the risks for serious maternal complications of 7.7%. A sample size of 2314 women will have 80% power (2-tailed alpha error of 0.05) of finding the following increases in risk for serious maternal complications: 16% to 20.6%, 12% to 16.1%, 8% to 11.5%, 6% to 9.1% and 4% to 6.7%.

### Interventions to help external cephalic version for breech presentation at term [^115Aods8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Breech presentation places a fetus at increased risk. The outcome for the baby is improved by planned caesarean section compared with planned vaginal delivery. External cephalic version attempts to reduce the chances of breech presentation at birth, but is not always successful. Tocolytic drugs to relax the uterus as well as other methods have been used in an attempt to facilitate external cephalic version at term.

Objectives

To assess the effects of routine tocolysis, fetal acoustic stimulation, epidural or spinal analgesia and transabdominal amnioinfusion for external cephalic version at term on successful version and measures of pregnancy outcome.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (September 2003) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2003) were searched.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing routine versus selective or no tocolysis; fetal acoustic stimulation in midline fetal spine positions versus dummy or no stimulation; epidural or spinal analgesia versus no regional analgesia; or transabdominal amnioinfusion versus no amnioinfusion for external cephalic version at term.

Data Collection and Analysis

The reviewer assessed eligibility and trial quality.

Main Results

In six trials, routine tocolysis with beta-stimulants was associated with fewer failures of external cephalic version (relative risk (RR) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 0.87). The reduction in non-cephalic presentations at birth was not statistically significant. Caesarean sections were reduced (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.99). In four small trials, sublingual nitroglycerine used as a tocolytic was associated with significant side-effects, and was not found to be effective. Fetal acoustic stimulation in midline fetal spine positions was associated with fewer failures of external cephalic version at term (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.60). With epidural or spinal analgesia, external cephalic version failure, non-cephalic births and caesarean sections were reduced in two trials but not the other. The overall differences were not statistically significant. No randomised trials of transabdominal amnioinfusion for external cephalic version at term were located.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Routine tocolysis appears to reduce the failure rate of external cephalic version at term. There is not enough evidence to evaluate the use of fetal acoustic stimulation in midline fetal spine positions, nor of epidural or spinal analgesia. Large volume intravenous preloading may have contributed to the effectiveness demonstrated in two of the latter trials.

### External cephalic version beginning at 34 weeks' gestation versus 37 weeks' gestation: a randomized multicenter trial [^1157ZDp3]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

In about 3% to 4% of all pregnancies at term, the fetal presentation will be noncephalic. External cephalic version (ECV) at term has been shown to decrease the rate of noncephalic presentation at birth and to decrease the rate of cesarean section associated with breech presentation. However, success rates for ECV are low. We did a randomized trial to compare a policy of beginning ECV early, at between 34 and 36 weeks' gestation, and beginning ECV at 37 to 38 weeks' gestation.

Study Design

At 25 centers in seven countries, 233 women with a singleton breech fetus were randomly assigned to having an ECV procedure done early (at between 34 weeks 0 days and 36 weeks 0 days), or delayed (at between 37 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 0 days). An experienced practitioner undertook the ECV procedure, and repeat ECV procedures were allowed. Tocolytics and use of epidural analgesia were included as part of the protocol. The primary outcome was the rate of noncephalic presentation at birth. An intention-to-treat analysis was used.

Results

Data were received for 232 women, with 116 women in each of the early and delayed ECV groups. Of these, 86.2% in the early ECV group and 67.2% in the delayed ECV group had at least one ECV performed. The rate of noncephalic presentation at birth in the early ECV group was 66 of 116 (56.9%) and 77 of 116 (66.4%) in the delayed ECV group (relative risk [RR] [95% CI] 0.86 [0.70–1.05], P = 0.09). The rate of serious fetal complications and the rate of preterm birth at < 37 weeks were not significantly increased in the early ECV group compared with the delayed ECV group (6.9% vs 7.8%, RR [95% CI] 0.89 [0.36–2.22], P = 0.69 and 8.6% vs 6.1%, RR [95% CI] 1.42 [0.56–3.59], P = 0.31, respectively). The rate of cesarean section in the early ECV group was 75 of 116 (64.7%) and 83 of 116 (71.6%) in the delayed ECV group (RR [95% CI] 0.90 [0.76–1.08], P = 0.32). Neonatal outcomes were comparable in the two groups. The rate of reversion to noncephalic was low in both groups. The majority of women in both groups indicated that they would consider having an ECV in another pregnancy.

Conclusion

Early ECV performed at 34 to 36 weeks compared with 37 to 38 weeks may reduce the risk of noncephalic presentation at delivery. A large pragmatic trial of early ECV is now required to assess this approach further in terms of cesarean section rates and neonatal outcomes before changes in clinical practice.

With epidural or spinal analgesia, external cephalic version failure, non-cephalic births and caesarean sections were reduced in two trials but not the other. The overall differences were not statistically significant. No randomised trials of transabdominal amnioinfusion for external cephalic version at term were located.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Routine tocolysis appears to reduce the failure rate of external cephalic version at term. Although promising, there is not enough evidence to evaluate the use of fetal acoustic stimulation in midline fetal spine positions, nor of epidural or spinal analgesia. Large volume intravenous preloading may have contributed to the effectiveness demonstrated in two of the latter trials. No randomised trials of transabdominal amnioinfusion for external cephalic version at term were found.

### Breech birth at home: outcomes of 60 breech and 109 cephalic planned home and birth center births [^111EBPFi]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The options for term vaginal breech birth (VBB) have rapidly declined in the western world. This decline began in the 1980s and has led to the removal of training of breech skills from most residency programs. This trend was codified, in large part, by the 2000 Term Breech Trial (TBT), which found poorer outcomes for planned vaginal breech births compared to planned cesareans for term singleton babies. Counseling for term breech pregnancies often steers women towards cesarean section and only addresses short-term risks to the baby. The TBT has drawn criticism for flaws in its study design, case selection, and intrapartum care practices across the 174 participating centers. In addition, the 2-year follow-up study found no long-term difference in death or neurodevelopmental delay among a subset of the overall TBT cohort.

Since that time there have been well over 100 single-center, multi-center, and birth certificate/national registry studies published on term breech outcomes, some of which recommend routine cesarean and others which support the option of a planned vaginal birth. The RCOG's 2017 breech guideline is the most up-to-date compilation of the body of post-TBT literature. The most influential study since the TBT has been the 2006 PREMODA study, a multicenter prospective observational study of 2526 planned vaginal and 5579 planned cesareans births. With a cohort nearly four times the size of the TBT and with strict selection criteria and protocols, the PREMODA study did not find any significant differences in outcomes between planned vaginal breech birth (pVBB) and planned cesarean section (pCS).

### Risk factors associated with adverse perinatal outcome in planned vaginal breech labors at term: a retrospective population-based case-control study [^1131TPS4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Planned vaginal breech delivery at term is associated with adverse perinatal short-term outcome. The main findings of this study showed that nulliparity, gestational diabetes, fetal growth restriction, a history of cesarean section, oligohydramnios and epidural anesthesia were associated with adverse perinatal outcome in vaginal breech deliveries at term. Secondly, the frequency of severe perinatal outcome was with 1.6% (73 out of 4805 cases) much lower than in the term breech trail with 5.1%. These results can be explained with a violation of the stringent criteria for vaginal breech delivery in the term breech trial, as in one third of all cases analyzed in the term breech trial the fetal sizes were considered small (< 3000 g at term). Of all stillbirths and perinatal deaths notified in the term breech trial 69% (11 of 16 cases) were too small for their gestational age. We identified fetal growth restriction (< −2SD /IUGR) also as a main risk factor for severe adverse perinatal outcome in this study. This result is coherent with a secondary analysis of the term breech trial data by Su, which showed that birth weight < 2800 g was associated with adverse perinatal outcome. Fetal growth restriction is a known risk factor for adverse fetal outcomes including stillbirth, cerebral palsy, neonatal death, and hypoxia ischemic encephalopathy. Due to these risks many guidelines for vaginal breech delivery state fetal growth restrictions as a contraindication for a trial of vaginal labor.

### Cost-effectiveness of external cephalic version for term breech presentation [^114w3hp7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2010). Low credibility.

Background

External cephalic version (ECV) is recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to convert a breech fetus to vertex position and reduce the need for cesarean delivery. The goal of this study was to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, from society's perspective, of ECV compared to scheduled cesarean for term breech presentation.

Methods

A computer-based decision model (TreeAge Pro 2008, Tree Age Software, Inc.) was developed for a hypothetical base case parturient presenting with a term singleton breech fetus with no contraindications for vaginal delivery. The model incorporated actual hospital costs (e.g. $8,023 for cesarean and $5,581 for vaginal delivery), utilities to quantify health-related quality of life, and probabilities based on analysis of published literature of successful ECV trial, spontaneous reversion, mode of delivery, and need for unanticipated emergency cesarean delivery. The primary endpoint was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in dollars per quality-adjusted year of life gained. A threshold of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) was used to determine cost-effectiveness.

Results

The incremental cost-effectiveness of ECV, assuming a baseline 58% success rate, equaled $7,900/QALY. If the estimated probability of successful ECV is less than 32%, then ECV costs more to society and has poorer QALYs for the patient. However, as the probability of successful ECV was between 32% and 63%, ECV cost more than cesarean delivery but with greater associated QALY such that the cost-effectiveness ratio was less than $50,000/QALY. If the probability of successful ECV was greater than 63%, the computer modeling indicated that a trial of ECV is less costly and with better QALYs than a scheduled cesarean. The cost-effectiveness of a trial of ECV is most sensitive to its probability of success, and not to the probabilities of a cesarean after ECV, spontaneous reversion to breech, successful second ECV trial, or adverse outcome from emergency cesarean.

Conclusions

From society's perspective, ECV trial is cost-effective when compared to a scheduled cesarean for breech presentation provided the probability of successful ECV is > 32%. Improved algorithms are needed to more precisely estimate the likelihood that a patient will have a successful ECV.

### Neonatal outcome in vaginal breech labor at 32 + 0–36 + 0 weeks of gestation: a nationwide, population-based record linkage study [^114H3uyo]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In developed countries, 5–9% of all deliveries occur preterm. Preterm pregnancy itself is also known as the most significant risk factor for breech presentation at delivery. Risk factors for breech presentation in preterm deliveries are premature rupture of membranes, preeclampsia, oligohydramnios, fetal growth restriction, and congenital anomalies. Many of these factors are associated with adverse perinatal outcomes in vaginal preterm breech delivery.

In term pregnancies, fetal breech presentation at delivery is a risk factor for adverse neonatal outcomes as vaginal breech labor is associated with increased neonatal short-term morbidity compared to cephalic deliveries. In the Term Breech Trial 2000, cesarean section was recommended for breech deliveries at term to reduce the risks of adverse outcomes of vaginal breech labor. Since then the results of the Term Breech Trial have been disputed and nowadays, in well-selected cases, vaginal breech labor at term is an option in many countries. In singleton preterm breech deliveries without other complications, the optimal mode of birth is still widely debated. A lower Apgar score and an increased need for admission to the neonatal intensive care unit have been associated with preterm vaginal breech labor compared to the neonates born in cephalic presentation. However, a trial of vaginal moderate to late preterm breech labor has not increased neonatal adverse outcomes compared to a planned cesarean section. Nevertheless, other studies have reported reduced neonatal deaths with a cesarean section for preterm breech fetuses. Furthermore, a recently published European cohort study (2019) implied that in very preterm breech labor, fetuses born by cesarean section instead of vaginally had reduced mortality and morbidity.

Most of the existing studies compromise deliveries in very preterm gestational weeks. The other problem of the previous studies is the small patient numbers. Our research aims to reduce the uncertainty regarding preterm breech deliveries at 32 + 0 — 36 + 6 weeks of gestation and investigate if vaginal preterm labor at 32 + 0 — 36 + 6 weeks of gestation is feasible.

### Changes in vaginal breech delivery rates in a single large metropolitan area [^1171VaHd]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Vaginal breech delivery rates have been accepted widely to be in decline and the Term Breech Trial (TBT) has recommended delivery of a breech-presenting infant by elective cesarean section delivery. Our aim was to examine the rate of vaginal delivery of term breech pregnancies in the 8 years before and after the publication of the TBT.

Study Design

We retrospectively examined vaginal delivery rates of breech presentations over a 16-year period in 3 large tertiary maternity hospitals that serve a single large metropolitan population. All 3 hospitals are of similar size and serve a population with similar risk profile. We also examined rates of perinatal mortality in the 3 hospitals over the study period.

Results

During the 16-year study period, there were 344,259 deliveries among the 3 hospitals; 11,913 of which were breech deliveries. There were 5655 breech deliveries in the 8 years before the publication of the TBT, with a cesarean delivery rate of 76.9%. There were 6258 breech deliveries in the 8 years since publication of the TBT, and the cesarean delivery rate increased to 89.7% (P < .0001). During the 8 years since publication, the rate of vaginal delivery in nulliparous women decreased from 15.3–7.2% (P < .0001). The vaginal breech delivery rate in multiparous women decreased from 32.6–14.8% (P < .0001). The rates of corrected perinatal mortality showed a significant decrease in the last 4 years of the study.

Conclusion

Our study demonstrates that the results and recommendations of the TBT have contributed to decreasing vaginal breech delivery rates, which were already in decline before its publication.

### Talcum powder or aqueous gel to aid external cephalic version: a randomised controlled trial [^112Q8Xce]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The singleton fetus presents by the breech in 3–4% of pregnancies at term. The Term Breech Trial reported in 2000 that perinatal mortality, neonatal mortality, or serious neonatal morbidity was significantly lower for the planned Caesarean section group than for the planned vaginal birth group without any differences in maternal mortality or serious maternal morbidity. The trial report has led to a rapid change in guideline, opinion and actual practice across the globe. More recently, guidelines have suggested a trial of breech vaginal birth under a strict protocol in well informed women is acceptable.

Following the Term Breech Trial report, a survey of Canadian providers reported 89% offer external cephalic version (ECV) as a means of avoiding Caesarean delivery for breech presentation. Attempting ECV at term reduces the chance of non-cephalic births and of Caesarean delivery. In a recent literature review comprising 84 studies reporting on 12955 version, the pooled complication rate of ECV was 6.1% (mostly transient fetal heart rate abnormalities), 0.24% for serious complications and 0.35% for emergency cesarean deliveries with the conclusion that ECV is a safe procedure. An ECV trial can be cost-effective when compared to a scheduled Caesarean for breech presentation provided the probability of successful ECV is > 32%. Tocolysis and regional anaesthesia improve the success rate of ECV.

### Cost-effectiveness of external cephalic version for term breech presentation [^114R8FhK]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Breech presentation at term occurs in 3–4% of pregnancies and is managed with elective cesarean, assisted vaginal delivery, or external cephalic version (ECV). Approximately 87% of breech presentations in the United States resulted in cesarean delivery, a significant increase from previous years. Breech presentation is the third most common indication for cesarean and in some hospitals breech presentations are managed exclusively by cesarean delivery. This may in part be due to the Term Breech Trial in 2000 that confirmed that breech presentations delivered by cesareans resulted in less neonatal mortality and short-term morbidity compared to vaginal breech delivery. Maternal complications were also found to be similar for cesarean and vaginal delivery in the short and long term.

Practice guidelines from the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists (ACOG) in 2006 recommend that decisions regarding the mode of delivery for breech presentation are dependent on the health care provider's experience. ACOG also suggests that cesarean deliveries are preferred over vaginal breech deliveries. The desire to decrease the number of cesareans has renewed interest in ECV. In fact, ACOG recommends ECV to lower the number of breech presentations. ECV is indicated for women presenting with a confirmed singleton breech fetus at ≥ 36 completed weeks with no contraindications for vaginal delivery.

### Reducing stillbirths: interventions during labour [^113UkvFu]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Literature-based evidence

Our literature search identified 1 Cochrane review and 3 other intervention/observational studies assessing the impact of planned Caesarean section for breech presentation on perinatal mortality outcomes (Table 6). The Cochrane review by Hofmeyr et al. (Additional file 16) evaluated RCTs (3 trials, N = 2396 women), including the large Term Breech Trial, comparing planned Caesarean section with planned vaginal birth for singleton breech presentation at term. Perinatal or neonatal death (excluding fatal anomalies) or serious neonatal morbidity was reduced with planned Caesarean section compared to planned vaginal delivery [3/1166 (0.26%) vs. 14/1222 (1.15%), respectively; RR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.10–0.86; 3 trials; N = 2388 women]. Compared with planned vaginal breech delivery, planned Caesarean section was associated with an increased risk of avoidable short-term maternal morbidity, including postpartum infection, haemorrhage, and anaemia (RR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.03–1.61) [LOE: 1+].

Table 6
Impact of planned Caesarean section for breech presentation on stillbirth and perinatal mortality

In Switzerland, a cohort study by Irion et al. of planned vaginal versus planned Caesarean section for breech singleton presentation at term (N = 705 women) found a non-significant increased risk of neonatal mortality among the group delivering vaginally, but all deaths were attributable to major malformations (1% vs. 0.3% in planned vaginal vs. Caesarean section groups, RR = 3.33, 95% CI: 0.37–29.60 [NS]) [LOE: 2-].

In The Netherlands, Molkenboer et al. conducted a 2-centre retrospective matched cohort study including all singleton breech deliveries from 1998–2000 of at least 37 and less than 42 weeks' gestation, excluding antepartum stillbirths, but no perinatal deaths occurred in either group [LOE: 2-].

### Differences between breech and cephalic neonates born after planned cesarean section: a systematic review [^114nhH3R]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Breech presentation refers to an abnormal fetal position in the uterus, where the fetus's bottom, knee(s) or feet present at the uterine cervix, with the head in the fundus. Of all term deliveries, breech presentation accounts for 3–4% and is always considered more dangerous than cephalic presentation, specifically due to the delivery method. In one study, fetal mortality and morbidity of vaginal breech were found to be higher than those of the vaginal cephalic group, and planned cesarean section (CS) could effectively reduce the rate of disadvantageous fetal outcomes. Although CS has been widely recommended for term breech presentation since the 2000 Term Breech Trial, there are still many debates because some studies believe that the high rates of fetal morbidity and mortality of breech vaginal delivery are partly due to the lack of delivery techniques and strict indications for breech vaginal delivery.

On the other hand, breech presentation might be a marker of preexisting diseases, and the head-up position may have an adverse effect on fetal development. However, a head-down position is not always good. A study by Sekulić SR et al. showed that the fetus is in a hypogravity environment in the uterus during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Thus, the head-down position of the cephalic fetus may lead to differences in heart-cerebral circulation compared with the head-up position of the breech fetus. Head-down tilt (HDT) bed rest is a model used to imitate the effects of spaceflight in astronauts, and the change from breech presentation to head-down cephalic presentation can be considered equivalent to the process of an astronaut flying into space. However, neurocognitive deficits have been reported in astronauts after long-term exposure to microgravity. Therefore, it is necessary to reconsider the influence of cephalic presentation on the development of the fetal brain, especially in terms of long-term outcomes. Moreover, we need to review whether the existing guidelines maximize the health benefits to both mothers and children.

The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the neonatal outcomes of term singleton breech presentation and cephalic presentation after planned CS and to review the literature to summarize the possible differences caused by breech and cephalic postures during pregnancy and their mechanisms.

### Risk factors associated with adverse perinatal outcome in planned vaginal breech labors at term: a retrospective population-based case-control study [^115KzCni]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The study confirmed fetal growth restriction as a risk factor for adverse perinatal outcome. Oligohydramnios, nulliparity, gestational diabetes, epidural anesthesia and a history of cesarean section were identified as new risk factors for adverse perinatal outcome in a trial of labor in pregnancies with the fetus in breech position. These factors should be taken into account when counseling women and included in all national guidelines for vaginal breech delivery. In particular, vaginal delivery with the fetus in breech presentation should be avoided when fetal growth is restricted. Macrosomia as an individual risk factor for adverse perinatal outcome should be reviewed; further studies are needed to investigate this issue. A more careful selection of the women eligible for vaginal breech delivery has the potential to reduce the risk of adverse perinatal outcome. Caution and a willingness to abandon a trial of labor if circumstances are not favorable are essential for the safety of mother and child.

### Reducing stillbirths: interventions during labour [^113zswY7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Approximately 3–4% of term singleton pregnancies are complicated by breech presentation at term, and in most high-income countries, the majority of these births are handled via either planned or emergency Caesarean section. Whether planned caesarean section for breech presentation at term results in better perinatal outcomes is a contentious issue. An alternative to breech Caesarean section or breech vaginal delivery is external cephalic version, which has been shown to reduce numbers of breech births and breech Caesarean sections without impacting perinatal mortality. Until recently the major evidence for Caesarean section for breech presentation has been derived from patient case studies and register studies lacking sufficient rigor on which to make policy or clinical management recommendations. Here, we review the evidence for impact of planned Caesarean section for breech presentation on perinatal mortality and stillbirth rates.

### What is the safest mode of delivery for extremely preterm cephalic / non-cephalic twin pairs? A systematic review and meta-analyses [^114CYTVK]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Extreme prematurity, the birth of an infant before 28 weeks' gestation, contributes significantly to infant mortality and childhood morbidity. Extremely preterm births represent approximately 0.2% of singleton births, but 4.1% of twins births. In extremely preterm twins from 24 to 27 weeks, the most frequent combination of presentations is cephalic/non-cephalic (42.5%) followed by cephalic/cephalic (25.3%) and non-cephalic/non-cephalic (22.6%) which differs significantly from term proportions.

Controversy remains as to the influence of mode of delivery on neonatal outcomes in extremely preterm singletons and twins in general. Some, but not all studies have raised concerns about the safety of vaginal birth for extremely preterm breech singleton infants. In a recent meta-analysis, Grabovac et al. 2017 found that caesarean delivery was associated with a 40% decrease in the odds of mortality and 40% decrease in odds of severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH; grades ≥ 3) in extremely preterm breech singletons who were actively resuscitated.

In twins, determining the safest mode of delivery is more complex than in singletons, since beyond gestational age, birth order and various presentation combinations need to be considered. For cephalic/non-cephalic twins above 32 weeks, the 2013 randomized controlled trial by Barrett et al. found that trial of labor is safe, but due to their inclusion criteria, could not provide guidance on twin birth before 32 weeks.

While a caesarean section is typically performed when the first twin presents as non-cephalic, vaginal birth is generally attempted when both twins are cephalic. When the first twin is cephalic and the second is non-cephalic, there is less clinical consensus, leading to variations in clinical practice depending on the clinicians' level of experience, training, and the prevailing obstetrical culture in their location of practice.

When the second twin is breech, the delivery involves a sequence of events which differs from a singleton breech delivery, including delivery through an already dilated cervix, potential for manoeuvres such as breech extraction and external cephalic version, precluding direct extrapolation of singleton data to the mode of delivery of twins. In face of all these considerations, we decided to perform a systematic review of the literature to assess the evidence regarding the safest mode of delivery of extremely preterm cephalic/non-cephalic twin pairs who were actively resuscitated.

### Implementation of the external cephalic version in breech delivery. Dutch national implementation study of external cephalic version [^115hdkBA]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Breech presentation occurs in 3 to 4% of all term pregnancies. In pregnancies complicated by breech presentation, perinatal mortality, neonatal mortality or serious neonatal morbidity are increased as compared to pregnancies where the fetes is in cephalic position. Breech position at term occurs in 8.000 pregnancies in the Netherlands each year. Until 2000 the mode of breech delivery was controversial. Since publication of the results of the term breech trial, the caesarean delivery rate in women with a fetes in breech presentation in the Netherlands has increased from 45% to around 80%. Although an elective caesarean section is safer for the baby, it increases maternal morbidity. Moreover, the uterine scar carries a risk for future pregnancies. External cephalic version (ECV) reduces the rate of non-cephalic presentations at term with 40–50%, and thus the number of caesarean deliveries performed for at term breech presentation, without any increased risk to the baby. The high caesarean delivery rate for breech presentation makes ECV an important obstetric intervention and it is therefore recommended by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in the Clinical Green Top Guidelines.

A recent inventory among Dutch gynaecologists showed that 5% of the practices never offered ECV, whereas one practice offered ECV only to multipara. In 28% of the practices an ECV was performed by all gynaecologists, whereas in the other 72% ECV was performed by a smaller team of specialists. The palette of relative contraindications differed widely, and only 19% of the responding clinics registered their success rates. The number of patients refusing ECV was estimated to be 20 to 30%. At present, 60 to 70% of the women with a fetes in breech position undergoes ECV in the Netherlands. This rate is probably an overestimation, as they are based on self reported rates by midwives and gynaecologists, in the absence of registrations. The true number of women that undergoes ECV for term breech is probably below 50%.

### Singleton vaginal breech delivery at term: still a safe option [^113D7Rrc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the obstetric and perinatal outcome of pregnancies with singleton breech presentation at term when selection for vaginal delivery was based on clear prelabor and intrapartum criteria.

Methods

The outcomes of all pregnancies with a breech presentation after 37 weeks of gestation were retrospectively reviewed from January 1997 to June 2000. Criteria for prelabor cesarean or trial of vaginal breech delivery included type of breech, estimated fetal weight (more than 3,800 g), maternal preference, and gestation more than 41 weeks. An intrapartum protocol excluded induction and oxytocin augmentation of labor, combined with a low threshold for cesarean delivery for dystocic labor; an experienced obstetrician was in attendance during labor and delivery.

Results

Of 641 women, 343 (54%) underwent prelabor cesarean, and 298 (46%) had a trial of vaginal delivery, of whom 146 (49%) delivered vaginally. Significantly fewer nulliparas (58 of 158, 37%) than multiparas (88 of 140, 63%; P < .001) achieved vaginal delivery after trial of labor. Significantly more infants weighing more than 3,800 g were selected for prelabor (87 of 343, 25%) and intrapartum (31 of 152, 20%) cesarean than delivered vaginally (15 of 146, 10%). Two neonates (0.7%) had Apgar scores of less than 7 at 5 minutes; both were neurologically normal at 6 weeks. There were no nonanomalous perinatal deaths and no cases of significant trauma or neurological dysfunction; 3 infants delivered vaginally died due to lethal anomalies.

Conclusion

Safe vaginal breech delivery at term can be achieved with strict selection criteria, adherence to a careful intrapartum protocol, and with an experienced obstetrician in attendance. Our protocol effectively selects larger infants for cesarean delivery.

### Outcomes associated with cesarean section versus vaginal breech delivery at a university hospital [^116r94w5]. Journal of Perinatology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether vaginal breech delivery is associated with increased morbidity in term breech singletons using strict selection criteria. This study encompasses our previous studies (in 1987 and 1995) and extends our experience to 21 years.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study from 1980 to 2001 including term, non-anomalous singleton breech deliveries selected by strict criteria. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed for neonatal and maternal outcomes.

Results

Five hundred and eleven women underwent cesarean section and 214 a trial of labor. We found greater overall maternal morbidity in the cesarean section group (odds ratio (OR) 1.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.34–2.65). In the vaginal delivery group, neonates were more likely to have had > 1 day of mechanical ventilation (OR 10.0, 95% CI = 1.56–63.9). No maternal deaths occurred and no neonatal deaths or seizures occurred.

Conclusion

Given our findings, offering a trial of vaginal breech delivery to well-counseled strictly selected patients remains an appropriate option.

### Term incomplete breech delivery in an ambulance: a case report [^112LXCzB]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Breech deliveries are the most common form of fetal malpresentations and are associated with significant risk for morbidity and mortality to mother and infant. There is an increased chance that emergency physicians may encounter breech deliveries as more women with known breech presentations are given the option for a trial of labor in lieu of mandatory caesarean section. Emergency physicians should be prepared for the complications that are associated with breech delivery and recognize the different maneuvers required to successfully deliver a breech infant.

### Maternal request cesarean versus planned spontaneous vaginal delivery: maternal morbidity and short term outcomes [^1161x8Nw]. Seminars in Perinatology (2006). Low credibility.

Since no randomized trial evaluates maternal morbidity from planned cesarean versus planned vaginal delivery, the issue must be addressed indirectly from retrospective cohort studies of vertex fetuses by actual or planned delivery route, and retrospective or randomized studies of breech fetuses by planned delivery route. The available data, although limited, suggest that term planned cesarean and planned vaginal delivery have similarly low rates of absolute and relative short-term maternal morbidity. Endometritis and cystitis are more frequent with cesarean, whereas hemorrhage is more frequent with planned vaginal delivery. Much of the morbidity of planned vaginal delivery is the morbidity of unplanned cesarean in labor and operative vaginal delivery, particularly forceps. Thus, the relative risk of short-term maternal morbidity of planned cesarean versus planned vaginal delivery will depend on the proportion of women in each group ultimately delivering in the planned manner and the frequency with which delivery occurs by an alternative unplanned method.

### Birth weight and neurodevelopmental outcome of children at 2 years of age after planned vaginal delivery for breech presentation at term [^113KDaoF]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this prospective cohort study was to determine whether planned vaginal delivery for the term singleton baby in breech position increases the risk of abnormal neurodevelopment at 2 years of age and to assess whether the effect is modified by birth weight.

Study Design

At 2 years of age, all nonrandomized children born in breech position during our participation in the Term Breech Trial were screened for abnormal neurodevelopment with the Ages and Stages Questionnaire.

Results

An Ages and Stages Questionnaire at 2 years of age was obtained in 183 of 203 children (90.1%). Twenty-eight percent of these children showed 1 or more abnormal Ages and Stages Questionnaire domains. There were no differences in the risk of having abnormal Ages and Stages Questionnaire domains between planned vaginal delivery and planned cesarean section (P = 0.99). There was, however, evidence of interaction between mode of delivery and birth weight, with significantly higher risk in neurodevelopmental delay in children with birth weight greater than 3500 g with planned vaginal birth (adjusted odds ratio for interaction term 3.37; 95% confidence interval 1.14 to 9.95).

Conclusion

Based on the Ages and Stages Questionnaire results at 2 years of age, planned vaginal delivery is associated with an increased risk of neurodevelopmental delay at 2 years of age in term breech children with a birth weight greater than 3500 g.

### Cost-effectiveness of external cephalic version for term breech presentation [^111MLE83]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2010). Low credibility.

Although several previous studies have assessed the economics of ECV, investigators did not incorporate quality of life as outcome measures in their findings. Adams et al determined that if ECV was attempted, ECV saved about $3,000 per delivery. Mauldin et al found that ECV saved $2,462 for each successful version. Gifford et al assessed the delivery outcomes and cost of each method of delivery for breech presentation and determined that routine ECV practice can result in more vaginal deliveries and lower costs than strategies that do not include ECV. These studies, however, were published before the results of the Term Breech Trial and therefore incorporated the use of assisted vaginal breech delivery in their management options as an alternative to ECV and cesarean delivery. Furthermore, the chance of an adverse outcome due to vaginal breech delivery or emergency cesarean was not incorporated into these different studies. Although the risk of adverse events, such as in the case of emergency cesarean is low, the high cost from a financial and quality of life standpoint should be incorporated into an economic analysis such as the one presented here. Vaginal breech delivery was not included in our model because of the demonstrated high risk of the procedure over cesarean breech delivery and it not being undertaken in common obstetric practice.

Limitations of this study are similar to those of any cost-effectiveness analysis. The cost-effectiveness for ECV as determined in this study is dependent on accurate estimates of probability and costs as factored into our computer model. To address this, we conducted sensitivity analyses for all probabilities and costs across the range of values found in our literature review. We consider the model robust since the probability of successful ECV, as we suspected a priori, was the key variable in the model.

Another limitation of this study was the use of a standard 6-week and 8-week time horizon for vaginal delivery or cesarean delivery respectively. This time horizon accounted for variations in recovery between vaginal delivery, cesarean delivery and an adverse delivery. However, this time horizon did not include longer-term health effects such as costs of future deliveries including repeated cesarean delivery and vaginal birth after cesarean. While these are important considerations, extending the time horizon further would significantly increase the complexity of the model as many other factors would need to be estimated.

### Breech delivery in low-income settings: a systematic review of perinatal and maternal outcomes in vaginal versus cesarean breech deliveries [^111LCuQQ]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Most studies comparing vaginal breech delivery (VBD) with cesarean breech delivery (CBD) have been conducted in high-income settings. It is uncertain whether these results are applicable in a low-income setting. To assess the neonatal and maternal mortality and morbidity for singleton VBD compared to CBD in low- and lower-middle-income settings, the PubMed database was searched from January 1, 2000, to January 23, 2020 (updated April 21, 2021). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs comparing singleton VBD with singleton CBD in low- and lower-middle-income settings reporting infant mortality were selected. Two authors independently assessed papers for eligibility and risk of bias. The primary outcome was relative risk of perinatal mortality. Meta-analysis was conducted on applicable outcomes. Eight studies (one RCT, seven observational) (12510 deliveries) were included. VBD increased perinatal mortality (relative risk [RR] 2.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.82–3.91; one RCT, five observational studies, 3289 women) and risk of 5-minute Apgar score below 7 (RR 3.91, 95% CI 1.90–8.04; three observational studies, 430 women) compared to CBD. There was a higher risk of hospitalization and postpartum bleeding in CBD. Most of the studies were deemed to have moderate or serious risk of bias. CBD decreases risk of perinatal mortality but increases risk of bleeding and hospitalization.

### Protocol for the evaluation of a decision aid for women with a breech-presenting baby [^114ZVncN]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2004). Low credibility.

Sample size

Sample size calculations for the trial (significance 0.05, power 0.8) were determined using the mean difference we would like to detect in women's decisional conflict scores and knowledge of options and outcomes. Compared with usual care, decisional conflict was shown in the most current systematic review to be significantly reduced by decision aids; the meta-analysed mean difference was -5.75, 95%CI -8.63, -2.87 (on a scale ranging from 1 lowest to 5 highest decisional conflict; median standard deviation 13.25). Assuming a mean difference of -5.75 and standard deviation 13.25, we would need approximately 84 women in each arm to demonstrate changes in decisional conflict. The meta-analysis also showed that for nine trials comparing decision aids and usual care, decision aids improved average knowledge scores by 18.75 points (out of 100) (95%CI 13.1 to 24.4, median standard deviation 20). To show such a difference, assuming mean difference of 18.75 and standard deviation of 20, would require only 18 women in each arm. Because we would like to be able to show differences in decisional conflict if they exist, we have used the larger sample size estimate. Although follow-up will be relatively short term, there will inevitably be some loss to follow-up. To allow for 10% loss to follow-up the sample size calculated above (84) is inflated by 10% to give the effective sample size of 92 women per arm and a total sample of 184 for the trial. This sample size is different from our original application for funding. Originally, we estimated a sample size of 310 women (155 in each arm). This was based on results from a 1999 systematic review of only 2 trials of decision aids versus usual care that had assessed decisional conflict. Subsequent to the submission (January 2001) and funding of this protocol (March 2002) the systematic review was updated (2002) incorporating 6 trials that assessed decisional conflict. At that time we revised the sample size estimate to incorporate the most current research evidence available. Ethics approval was obtained for the protocol amendment.

### Women's experiences of planning a vaginal breech birth in Australia [^113Zm5kb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In many countries, planned vaginal breech birth (VBB) is a rare event. After the Term Breech Trial in 2000, VBB reduced and caesarean section for breech presentation increased. Despite this, women still request VBB. The objective of this study was to explore the experiences and decision-making processes of women who had sought a VBB.

Methods

A qualitative study using descriptive exploratory design was undertaken. Twenty-two (n = 22) women who planned a VBB, regardless of eventual mode of birth were recruited. The women had given birth at one of two maternity hospitals in Australia that supported VBB. In-depth, semi-structured interviews using an interview guide were conducted. Interviews were analysed thematically.

Results

Twenty two women were interviewed; three quarters were primiparous (n = 16; 73%). Nine (41%) were already attending a hospital that supported VBB with the remaining women moving hospitals. All women actively sought a vaginal breech birth because the baby remained breech after an external cephalic version - 12 had a vaginal birth (55%) and 10 (45%) a caesarean section after labour commenced. There were four main themes: Reacting to a loss of choice and control, Wanting information that was trustworthy, Fighting the system and seeking support for VBB and The importance of 'having a go' at VBB.

Conclusions

Women seeking a VBB value clear, consistent and relevant information in deciding about mode of birth. Women desire autonomy to choose vaginal breech birth and to be supported in their choice with high quality care.

### Practice bulletin no. 184: vaginal birth after cesarean delivery [^112BGBbJ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cesarean delivery, more specifically with respect to vaginal birth after Cesarean delivery, technical considerations, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend to recognize that external cephalic version for breech presentation is not contraindicated in females with a previous low transverse uterine incision being candidates for external cephalic version and a trial of labor after Cesarean delivery.

### Mode of delivery and outcome of 699 term singleton breech deliveries at a single center [^114kLxcJ]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Elective cesarean delivery has been postulated to improve the outcome of term fetuses in breech presentation. We retrospectively compared the short- and long-term outcomes of term infants who were delivered from a breech presentation at a single center.

Study Design

We reviewed 699 consecutive term breech presentations according to the intended mode of delivery at a single center between January 1993 and December 1999. The short-term outcome measures were perinatal death, neonatal death, or serious neonatal morbidity; the long-term outcome measures were developmental delay and spasticity.

Results

The rate of serious perinatal morbidity in the trial-of-labor and cesarean delivery groups was 2.3% and 0.5%, respectively (P = 0.12). There was no perinatal or neonatal death in either group. With a median follow-up period of 57 months (range, 13–100 months), the rate of developmental delay was 1.9% and 0.5%, respectively (P = 0.29). Spasticity was not noted in any of the children.

Conclusion

Our data suggest that planned vaginal delivery remains an option for selected term breech presentations.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 340. mode of term singleton breech delivery [^115YiKCG]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

In light of recent studies that further clarify the long-term risks of vaginal breech delivery, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that the decision regarding mode of delivery should depend on the experience of the health care provider Cesarean delivery will be the preferred mode for most physicians because of the diminish-ing expertise in vaginal breech delivery. Planned vaginal delivery of a term singleton breech fetus may be reasonable under hospital-specific protocol guidelines for both eligibility and labor management. Before a vaginal breech delivery is planned, women should be informed that the risk of peri-natal or neonatal mortality or short-term serious neonatal morbidity may be higher than if a cesarean delivery is planned, and the patient's informed con-sent should be documented.

### Fear for external cephalic version and depression: predictors of successful external cephalic version for breech presentation at term? [^1118zRnt]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Objective was to determine whether fear for external cephalic version (ECV) and depression are associated with the success rate of ECV in women with a breech presentation at term.

Methods

Prospective study conducted in the Catharina Hospital Eindhoven between October 2007 and May 2012. Participants fulfilled The Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS) questionnaire and expressed their degree of fear on a visual analogue scale from one to ten before ECV. Obstetric factors were evaluated as well. Primary outcome was the relation between psychological factors (fear for ECV and depression EDS scores) and ECV success rate. Secondary outcome was a possible relation between fear for ECV and increased abdominal muscle tension.

Results

The overall success rate was 55% and was significantly lower (p < 0.001) in nulliparous women (44.3%) compared with parous women (78.0%). Fear for ECV and depression EDS-scores were not related with ECV success rate. Parity, placental location, BMI and engagement of the fetal breech were obstetric factors associated with ECV outcome. There was no relation between fear for ECV and abdominal muscle tone.

Conclusion

Fear for ECV and depression were not related with ECV success rate in this study. Engagement of the fetal breech was the most important factor associated with a successful ECV.

### A qualitative and quantitative cross-sectional study on the past, present, and future of vaginal delivery: Turkey [^111dTkxm]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The field of obstetrics is currently undergoing a visible transformation process, a phenomenon not new but significantly accelerated in the past 2 decades. Historically, before the 19th century, cesarean sections were performed as a last resort for a deceased or dying mother, aiming to save the baby in cases where vaginal delivery was impossible. Such situations included a severely narrow pelvis, tumors obstructing the delivery path, or fetal anomalies. Advances such as anesthesia and antiseptics in the 19th century, along with the introduction of blood groups and safe blood transfusions in the early 20th century, contributed to the increased safety of cesarean delivery, and it has become a safe option in cases of heavy bleeding such as placenta previa and placental abruption. By the 1960s, antibiotics further reduced the difference in mortality and morbidity between cesarean and vaginal deliveries. Finally, in 2000, the Term Breech Trial published its findings, asserting that cesarean delivery was safer than vaginal delivery in cases of breech presentation. Despite conflicting findings, the Term Breech Trial significantly influenced the preference for cesarean deliveries in breech presentations. Although it received intense criticism at the time, this study's results indicate that obstetricians are increasingly adopting this trend.

### This baby is not for turning: women's experiences of attempted external cephalic version [^115TpUrA]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal mode of birth for women who have a baby in the breech position at term is controversial. Since the Term Breech Trial, the availability of planned vaginal breech birth has diminished. In Australia, in 2012, 87% babies in the breech position were born by caesarean section (CS). In an attempt to reduce the need for CS for breech, external cephalic version (ECV) has become a popular, safe practice and is recommended for women who have a straightforward pregnancy with a breech presentation near term. The procedure is offered to women from around 36 weeks gestation with success at early or late gestation being equivocal. Success rates for ECVs are reported between 40 and 60%. As such, an ECV has been identified as a potential way to reduce CS rates although consideration of the subsequent care for women whose babies remain breech is important.

There are few studies about a woman's experience surrounding an ECV and her subsequent preference for mode of birth. These report on the experiences of women who have a persistent breech post ECV and then gave birth by CS, or on women who had successful ECVs that resulted in plans for a vaginal birth. There is a paucity of understanding about the experience of women who attempt an ECV then choose to plan a vaginal breech birth when their baby remains breech. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine women's experience of an ECV that resulted in a persistent breech presentation. This is part of a wider program of research exploring the experiences of women who choose a vaginal breech birth and the midwives and doctors who cared for them.

### Has the cesarean epidemic in czechia been reversed despite fertility postponement? [^115Khz1m]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

A further reason for the increase in CS births concerns the move away from spontaneous delivery when the fetus is in the breech presentation. This trend, initiated by the Term Breech Trial Collaborative Group study, has gradually led to a decline in the experience of such births and, thus, to a further increase in the use of CS. This approach has begun to be applied consistently in Czechia and is frequently referred to in medical study materials. However, spontaneous delivery when the fetus is in the breech presentation remains inadvisable, especially in the case of pre-term births.

The literature shows that a number of maternal health risks are age-related and that the risk of a cesarean birth increases with the maternal age. For example, older mothers are associated with higher risks of the incidence of diabetes mellitus, pre-term births, lower child birth weights and pre-term births associated with diabetes mellitus. Mothers over 30 years of age also face the increased risk of child health complications, spend longer times in hospital following the birth and face a higher risk of more frequent and longer hospital stays in the first two years of the child's life. The application of logistic regression confirmed that both pregnancy health complications (preterm-birth, diabetes, hypertension) and the mother´s age comprise independent risk factors for a CS birth. The Czech results confirmed that mothers who gave birth very pre-term (28–31 weeks) had 3-times higher odds of a CS than women who had an in-term birth. Mothers who suffered from diabetes before pregnancy had more than two-times higher odds of giving birth via CS than women who did not suffer from this condition, while mothers with gestational diabetes had 1.23-times higher odds; these results correspond to those of other published studies. As expected, mothers who suffer from hypertension gave birth via CS twice as often as did those with no such complications.

### Planned caesarean section for women with a twin pregnancy [^1166cAJX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Twin pregnancies are associated with increased perinatal mortality, mainly related to prematurity, but complications during birth may contribute to perinatal loss or morbidity. The option of planned caesarean section to avoid such complications must therefore be considered. On the other hand, randomised trials of other clinical interventions in the birth process to avoid problems related to labour and birth (planned caesarean section for breech, and continuous electronic fetal heart rate monitoring), have shown an unexpected discordance between short-term perinatal morbidity and long-term neurological outcome. The risks of caesarean section for the mother in the current and subsequent pregnancies must also be taken into account.

Objectives

To determine the short- and long-term effects on mothers and their babies, of planned caesarean section for twin pregnancy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (18 November 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing a policy of caesarean section with planned vaginal birth for women with twin pregnancy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed eligibility, quality and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. For important outcomes the quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included two trials comparing planned caesarean section versus planned vaginal birth for twin pregnancies. Most of the data included in the review were from a multicentre trial where 2804 women were randomised in 106 centres in 25 countries. All centres had facilities to perform emergency caesarean section and had anaesthetic, obstetrical, and nursing staff available in the hospital at the time of planned vaginal delivery. In the second trial carried out in Israel, 60 women were randomised. We judged the risk of bias to be low for all categories except performance (high) and outcome assessment bias (unclear). There was no clear evidence of differences between women randomised to planned caesarean section or planned vaginal birth for maternal death or serious morbidity (risk ratio (RR) 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 1.11; 2844 women; two studies; moderate quality evidence). There was no significant difference between groups for perinatal or neonatal death or serious neonatal morbidity (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.67; data for 5565 babies, one study, moderate quality evidence). No studies reported childhood disability. For secondary outcomes there was no clear evidence of differences between groups for perinatal or neonatal mortality (RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.62; 5685 babies; two studies, moderate quality evidence), serious neonatal morbidity (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.64; 5644 babies; two studies, moderate quality evidence) or any of the other neonatal outcomes reported. The number of women undergoing caesarean section was reported in both trials. Most women in the planned caesarean group had treatment as planned (90.9% underwent caesarean section), whereas in the planned vaginal birth group 42.9% had caesarean section for at least one twin. For maternal mortality; no events were reported in one trial and two deaths (one in each group) in the other. There were no significant differences between groups for serious maternal morbidity overall (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.11; 2844 women; two studies) or for different types of short-term morbidity. There were no significant differences between groups for failure to breastfeed (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.38; 2570 women, one study; moderate quality evidence) or the number of women with scores greater than 12 on the Edinbugh postnatal depression scale (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.14; 2570 women, one study; moderate quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Data mainly from one large, multicentre study found no clear evidence of benefit from planned caesarean section for term twin pregnancies with leading cephalic presentation. Data on long-term infant outcomes are awaited. Women should be informed of possible risks and benefits of labour and vaginal birth pertinent to their specific clinical presentation and the current and long-term effects of caesarean section for both mother and babies. There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of planned caesarean section for term twin pregnancy with leading cephalic presentation, except in the context of further randomised trials.

### Impact of implementation of a breech clinic in a tertiary hospital [^112wdzHH]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

The Cochrane Review of 2015 revealed a lower neonatal morbidity and mortality in the planned C-section group compared with the vaginal delivery group with an Odds Ratio (OR) of 0.3 and a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of 0.2–0.6. However the TBT contributed to the majority of cases to the meta-analysis. Multiple criticisms of this trial have already been published with many suggesting that selection was biased and expertise in breech delivery was suboptimal in some participating centres. Perhaps of more significance, was the failure to demonstrate any statistically significant difference in childhood outcomes between the two modes of birth at 2 years of age.

The PREMODA study conducted in Belgium and France used similar outcome criteria as the TBT but the methodology was prospective observational rather than a randomised trial. There was no specific management protocol, but the items used as a basis for deciding the mode of birth were: ultrasound evaluation of fetal size and cephalic flexion, maternal pelvimetry, woman's desire to attempt a vaginal birth. The elements for managing and monitoring the labour were: the obstetrician's self-assessed expertise in vaginal breech and continuous electronic fetal monitoring. The outcomes of 2526 planned vaginal breeches were compared to the outcomes of 5579 planned C-sections in 174 units. Neonatal short-term morbidity (five-minute Apgar score under four, injuries and intubation) was more frequent in the planned vaginal group compared to the planned C-section group (OR 8.92 (95% CI 1.0–79.8), 3.90 (2.4–6.34) and 1.82 (1.08–3.06) respectively). No other difference was found. However since the publication of the TBT, the C-section rate for breech presentation has drastically increased in Europe and expertise in vaginal breech birth has withered away.

### Vaginal breech delivery: results of a prospective registration study [^115LQAWA]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

The present study is not sufficiently powered to demonstrate differences in perinatal morbidity or mortality between the groups, as these outcomes are rare. In a Norwegian paper on breech deliveries, sample size calculation was done based on an anticipated perinatal mortality of 0.25% in the planned vaginal group and 0.1% in the cesarean group. The authors concluded that a Nordic study similar to the TBT would require a total number of 10,000 to be recruited in each group for two-sided testing, a number exceeding practical limits. Randomized controlled trials are considered as the gold standard for clinical trials, but the appropriateness of this design for studies of complex clinical procedures like breech deliveries has been questioned. A strength of the present study is the comprehensive prospective registration conducted by midwifes at our institution. Furthermore, we were able to review the hospital records of all the infants that were admitted to the NICU after birth. In this study, the groups were compared according to planned mode of delivery before onset of birth. However, we have no information on fetuses turned to cephalic before delivery. We cannot control for all confounding factors, including lack of information about education level and maternal pregestational morbidity. Further, we can also assume that there are psychological differences between the groups, as maternal request was the reason for planned cesarean section in 41% of the cases of planned cesarean section. However, antenatal care is uniform in Norway, and more than 90% of pregnant women are followed up by their general practitioner and/or community midwife. Furthermore, pre-labor, all women with known breech presentation are counseled by experienced gynecologists and selected to planned vaginal delivery after a thorough assessment.

### Cesarean delivery is associated with lower neonatal mortality among breech pregnancies: a systematic review and meta-analysis of preterm deliveries ≤ 32 weeks of gestation [^111t7RzX]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the association between actual and planned modes of delivery, neonatal mortality, and short-term outcomes among preterm pregnancies ≤ 32 weeks of gestation.

Data Sources

A systematic literature search was conducted in 3 main databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to November 16, 2022. The protocol was registered in advance in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42022377870).

Study Eligibility Criteria

Eligible studies examined pregnancies ≤ 32nd gestational week. All infants received active care, and the outcomes were reported separately by different modes of delivery. Singleton and twin pregnancies at vertex and breech presentations were included. Studies that included pregnancies complicated with preeclampsia and abruptio placentae were excluded. Primary outcomes were neonatal mortality and intraventricular hemorrhage.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

Articles were selected by title, abstract, and full text, and disagreements were resolved by consensus. Random effects model-based odds ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies - of Interventions-I was used to assess the risk of bias.

Results

A total of 19 observational studies were included involving a total of 16,042 preterm infants in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Actual cesarean delivery improves survival (odds ratio, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.42–0.9) and decreases the incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage (odds ratio, 0.70; confidence interval, 0.57–0.85) compared to vaginal delivery. Planned cesarean delivery does not improve the survival of very and extremely preterm infants compared to vaginal delivery (odds ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.53–1.44). Subset analysis found significantly lower odds of death for singleton breech preterm deliveries born by both planned (odds ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.32–0.98) and actual (odds ratio, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.13–0.88) cesarean delivery.

Conclusion

Cesarean delivery should be the mode of delivery for preterm ≤ 32 weeks of gestation breech births due to the higher mortality in preterm infants born via vaginal delivery.

### Risk factors associated with adverse perinatal outcome in planned vaginal breech labors at term: a retrospective population-based case-control study [^1179NRVw]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Vaginal breech delivery is associated with adverse perinatal outcome. The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with adverse perinatal outcome in term breech pregnancies, and to provide clinicians an aid in selecting women for a trial of vaginal labor with the fetus in breech position.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective, nationwide, Finnish population-based case-control study. All planned singleton vaginal deliveries at term with the fetus in breech position between the years 2005 and 2014 were analyzed. The study's end point was a composite set of adverse perinatal outcomes. All infants with an adverse outcome were compared to the infants with normal outcomes. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to analyze the data.

Results

An adverse perinatal outcome was recorded for 73 (1.5%) infants. According to the study results fetal growth restriction (adjusted odds ratio, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.30–6.67), oligohydramnios (adjusted odds ratio, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.15–7.18), a history of cesarean section (adjusted odds ratio, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.28–6.77, gestational diabetes (adjusted odds ratio, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.54–5.40), epidural anesthesia (adjusted odds ratio, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.29–3.75) and nulliparity (adjusted odds ratio, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.10–3.08) were associated with adverse perinatal outcome.

Conclusions

Adverse perinatal outcome in planned vaginal breech labor at term is associated with fetal growth restriction, oligohydramnios, previous cesarean delivery, gestational diabetes, nulliparity and epidural anesthesia.

### Caesarean section versus vaginal delivery for preterm birth in singletons [^115vRL3H]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Planned caesarean delivery for women thought be in preterm labour may be protective for baby, but could also be quite traumatic for both mother and baby. The optimal mode of delivery of preterm babies for both cephalic and breech presentation remains, therefore, controversial.

Objectives

To assess the effects of a policy of planned immediate caesarean delivery versus planned vaginal birth for women in preterm labour.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (24 April 2012).

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing a policy of planned immediate caesarean delivery versus planned vaginal delivery for preterm birth.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Data were checked for accuracy.

Main Results

We included six studies (involving 122 women) but only four studies (involving only 116 women) contributed data to the analyses. Infant There were very little data of relevance to the three main (primary) outcomes considered in this review: There was no significant difference between planned immediate caesarean section and planned vaginal delivery with respect to birth injury to infant (risk ratio (RR) 0.56, 95%, confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 5.62; one trial, 38 women) or birth asphyxia (RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.84 to 3.14; one trial, 12 women). The only cases of birth trauma were a laceration of the buttock in a baby who was delivered by caesarean section and mild bruising in another allocated to the group delivered vaginally. The difference between the two groups with regard to perinatal deaths was not significant (0.29, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.14; three trials, 89 women) and there were no data specifically relating to neonatal admission to special care and/or intensive care unit. There was also no difference between the caesarean or vaginal delivery groups in terms of markers of possible birth asphyxia (RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.84 to 3.14; one trial, 12 women) or Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.60; four trials, 115 women) and no difference in attempts at breastfeeding (RR 1.40, 95% 0.11 to 17.45; one trial, 12 women). There was also no difference in neonatal fitting/seizures (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.32; three trials, 77 women), hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (RR 4.00, 95% CI 0.20 to 82.01; one trial, 12 women) or respiratory distress syndrome (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.10; three trials, 103 women). There were no data reported in the trials specifically relating to meconium aspiration. There was also no significant difference between the two groups for abnormal follow-up in childhood (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.22; one trial, 38 women) or delivery less than seven days after entry (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.24; two trials, 51 women). Mother: There were no data reported on maternal admissions to intensive care. However, there were seven cases of major maternal postpartum complications in the group allocated to planned immediate caesarean section and none in the group randomised to vaginal delivery (RR 7.21, 95% CI 1.37 to 38.08; four trials, 116 women). There were no data reported in the trials specifically relating to maternal satisfaction (postnatal). There was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to postpartum haemorrhage. A number of non-prespecified secondary outcomes were also considered in the analyses. There was a significant advantage for women in the vaginal delivery group with respect to maternal puerperal pyrexia (RR 2.98, 95% CI 1.18 to 7.53; three trials, 89 women) and other maternal infection (RR 2.63, 95% CI 1.02 to 6.78; three trials, 103 women), but no significant differences in wound infection (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.18 to 7.70; three trials, 103 women), maternal stay more than 10 days (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.65; three trials, 78 women) or the need for blood transfusion (results not estimable).

Authors' Conclusions

There is not enough evidence to evaluate the use of a policy of planned immediate caesarean delivery for preterm babies. Further studies are needed in this area, but recruitment is proving difficult.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 745 summary: mode of term singleton breech delivery [^113M6QyA]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

There is a trend in the United States to perform cesarean delivery for term singleton fetuses in a breech presentation. The number of practitioners with the skills and experience to perform vaginal breech delivery has decreased. The decision regarding the mode of delivery should consider patient wishes and the experience of the health care provider. Obstetrician-gynecologists and other obstetric care providers should offer external cephalic version as an alternative to planned cesarean for a woman who has a term singleton breech fetus, desires a planned vaginal delivery of a vertex-presenting fetus, and has no contraindications. External cephalic version should be attempted only in settings in which cesarean delivery services are readily available. Planned vaginal delivery of a term singleton breech fetus may be reasonable under hospital-specific protocol guidelines for eligibility and labor management. If a vaginal breech delivery is planned, a detailed informed consent should be documented-including risks that perinatal or neonatal mortality or short-term serious neonatal morbidity may be higher than if a cesarean delivery is planned.

### Neonatal outcome in vaginal breech labor at 32 + 0–36 + 0 weeks of gestation: a nationwide, population-based record linkage study [^111uVmEJ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our study's most important finding is that vaginal breech labor at 32 + 0 — 36 + 6 weeks of gestation does not seem to increase severe neonatal short-term morbidity or mortality compared to the outcomes of non-urgent cesarean section. Overall, the need for treatment in a neonatal intensive care unit is high due to fetal prematurity, but neonatal deaths at 32 + — 36 + 6 weeks of gestation are rare.

Our study showed an increase in the five-minute Apgar score below seven in the neonates who were born vaginally in breech presentation at 32 + 0 — 36 + 6 weeks of gestation compared to the neonates born by non-urgent cesarean section. However, there was no longer a significant difference in the five-minute Apgar scores when the limit was reduced to four or below. Another Finnish research in 2018 indicated similar results in breech deliveries at 32 + 0 to 36 + 6 weeks of gestation; the five-minute Apgar scores were comparable between neonates born after a trial of vaginal breech delivery and cesarean section. However, Toivonen and colleagues found that one-minute Apgar scores were lower in breech neonates born vaginally than the vertex controls. In addition, our results showed no difference in the arterial umbilical pH between the groups, which indicates that acidosis was not increased after vaginal breech labor. This is in contrary to the venous umbilical pH and base excess results of Vidovics and colleagues (2014) who compared outcomes of preterm breech neonates delivered vaginally or by cesarean section at 24–37 gestational weeks. However, low patient numbers in their study did not enable further statistical analysis. Besides in our study, women who were permitted to give birth vaginally with a fetus in breech presentation are most likely low-risk patients without acknowledged obstetric risks and this might reflect to the results.

### The likelihood of change in fetal presentation during the third trimester in twin pregnancies [^113Bh9CP]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the likelihood and identify predictors of spontaneous fetal version during the third trimester in twins using data from a multicenter randomized controlled trial on mode of delivery in twin pregnancies.

Methods

Women with twin pregnancies after 32 weeks of gestation in which twin A was vertex were randomized to planned cesarean or planned vaginal delivery. In the current study we analyzed the likelihood of a spontaneous version of any of the twins between ultrasound assessment at the time of randomization and delivery.

Results

A total of 2,603 women were analyzed. Twin A tended to persist in the vertex presentation after 32 weeks of gestation with a spontaneous version rate to nonvertex presentation of 3.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.3–3.7%). Twin B was less stable and underwent spontaneous version in 24.8% (95% CI 23.1–26.5%) of cases; the rate remained higher than 20% even after 34 weeks of gestation. On multivariable analysis, twin A was more likely to undergo version when twin B was smaller (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.0, 95% CI 1.04–3.3), when twin B was breech (adjusted OR 3.7, 95% CI 2.2–6.4) or transverse (adjusted OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.6–5.5), and when the interval to delivery exceeded 4 weeks (adjusted OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.3–5.0). Twin B was more likely to undergo version when it was in the breech presentation (adjusted OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.4–2.1) or transverse lie (adjusted OR 3.1, 95% CI 2.5–3.9) compared with vertex presentation, when it was smaller (adjusted OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1–2.0), when the interval to delivery exceeded 4 weeks (adjusted OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.3–2.4), and in multiparous women (adjusted OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.04–1.5).

Conclusion

The likelihood of spontaneous version of twin A after 32 weeks of gestation is low when twin A is in the vertex presentation but is much higher for twin B, even late during the third trimester.

### Revisiting the management of term breech presentation: a proposal for overcoming some of the controversies [^1174angs]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

In another recent population-based study based on perinatal data of all (650,968) children born in Norway from 1999 to 2009, the authors recognized the limitations of most registry-based studies, as the selection of women with breech presentation and planned vaginal delivery was based on criteria that might have identified pregnancies with a lower risk of adverse outcomes compared with those selected for CS delivery. Moreover, in this study, the intrapartum conversion of some of the planned vaginal deliveries to an emergency CS delivery may have increased the risk for adverse outcome in the CS group. However, Bjellmo et al. conducted an innovative analysis comparing breech deliveries to vaginal cephalic births. Thus, they showed that singleton children born at term without congenital malformations had a higher risk for stillbirth and neonatal mortality if they were born in the breech presentation "regardless of whether they were born vaginally or by CS delivery" (0.9 per 1000 in those actually delivered vaginally and 0.8 per 1000 in those actually born by CS delivery) compared with those born by vaginal cephalic delivery (0.3 per 1000). Of note, among those children born in the breech rather than in the cephalic presentation, these authors found that a higher proportion of infants were born small for gestational age (SGA). However, these authors did not distinguish foetal growth restriction among SGA neonates. In their interpretation, Bjellmo et al. considered that "the overall higher risk for stillbirth and the higher proportion of infants born SGA among children born in the breech than in the cephalic presentation may suggest that foetuses with antenatal acquired risk factors for adverse outcomes are more likely to present in the breech than in the cephalic presentation at birth". According to these authors, the findings were most likely explained by a combination of antenatal acquired risk factors for neonatal death with increased vulnerability to the birth process. Of note, in the TBT group, birth weights of less than 2.8 kg were also associated with adverse perinatal outcomes (P = 0.003). In fact, a limitation in the Norwegian study was that, unlike Macharey et al. the authors did not distinguish foetal growth restriction among these SGA neonates. Indeed, in a large cohort study conducted with the National Health Service region in England through a multivariable analysis of 92,218 normally formed singletons delivered during 2009–2011 from 24 weeks of gestation, including 389 stillbirths, Gardosi et al. showed that foetal growth restriction had the largest population attributable risk for stillbirth which was fivefold greater if it was not detected antenatally than when it was (32.0% v 6.2%). The above data suggest that some antenatal features associated with term breech presentation, notably foetal growth restriction, and some gestational disorders (such as uncontrolled gestational diabetes mellitus) could affect the prognosis in term breech cases. Previous data also support this conclusion; Luterkort M et al. had previously reported in a prospective follow-up of 228 pregnancies with the foetus in the breech presentation in the 33rd gestational week that the 96 foetuses (42%) who remained in the breech presentation at delivery weighed 4.9% less than their vertex controls after adjustments were made for gestational age and had an increased frequency of oligohydramnios. Krebs et al. later confirmed this association between breech presentation and foetal growth restriction from a register-based, case-control cohort of infants with cerebral palsy born between 1979 and 1986 in East Denmark.

1 INTRODUCTION

Twin delivery is perceived as a challenge in modern obstetrics, and high cesarean section (CS) rates of 40%–99% are reported for many European countries and the United States. However, there is no universal international consensus on the optimal mode of delivery for twins.

As there is a trend in many countries towards delivery by CS in the majority of singleton breech deliveries, a first or second twin in breech presentation may also be perceived as an indication for planned CS. The Norwegian National Obstetric Guidelines recommend vaginal delivery in singleton breech presentation from gestational age (GA) 34 + 0 weeks, and individual counseling before GA 34 + 0 weeks. These recommendations are also valid for twin pregnancies with the first twin in breech presentation. Obstetric practice in Norway is characterized by low overall CS rates of < 17%, as well as stable CS rates in singleton breech pregnancies and in multifetal pregnancies over the past two decades. At the same time, fetal and neonatal mortality rates are low.

Previous research into twin pregnancies has mostly focused on management during pregnancy, and few previous studies have assessed the role of the twins' presentations on planned and actual delivery modes. Most of these studies have been single‐center studies and/or conducted as randomized controlled trial settings, and excluded lower GAs. The aim of the present study was to describe the rate of combinations of twin fetal presentations at delivery and to identify their associations with the mode of delivery as well as fetal and maternal birth outcomes.

### Route of breech delivery and maternal and neonatal outcomes [^1116TVTy]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare maternal and neonatal outcomes in elective cesarean vs. attempted vaginal delivery for breech presentation at or near term.

Methods

We reviewed the maternal and neonatal charts of all singleton breech deliveries of at least 35 weeks' gestation or 2000 g delivered between 1986 and 1997 at our institution. Patients delivered by elective cesarean were compared to those attempting a vaginal delivery. The neonatal outcomes analyzed were: corrected mortality; Apgar scores less than 7 at 5 min; abnormal umbilical cord blood gases; birth trauma; and admissions to the intensive care nursery. Maternal morbidity was also assessed and compared.

Results

Of 848 women meeting criteria for evaluation, 576 were delivered by elective cesarean while 272 attempted a vaginal delivery. Of 272 women undergoing a trial of labor, 203 (74.6%) were delivered vaginally, while 69 (25.4%) failed an attempt at vaginal delivery and underwent a cesarean. When comparing patients delivered by elective cesarean with those attempting a vaginal delivery, no significant differences were noted in neonatal outcomes. However, maternal morbidity was higher among women delivered by cesarean, regardless of the indications for the procedure. Similar neonatal and maternal results were noted when nulliparous patients were analyzed separately.

Conclusions

Cesarean delivery of selected near-term infants presenting as breech is associated with increased maternal morbidity without corresponding improvement in neonatal outcomes.

In fact, as reported by Fox and Chapman, up to 21% of all foetuses adopt a noncephalic presentation at 28–29 weeks of gestation, and this proportion progressively decreases to 5% from 37 to 38 weeks. Certain conditions, such as uterine malformation, can disturb both this continuous process of spontaneous cephalic version and normal foetal growth, thereby leading to increased term breech presentation rates in these cases. This point highlights the importance of estimating foetal weight and well-being in cases of persistent breech presentation at term. Furthermore, even some cases of controlled GDM may be associated with excess foetal weight during the last weeks of pregnancy, leading to possible dystocia due to this overgrowth, or with other GDM-related complications, such as preeclampsia; thus, foetal weight estimates should be monitored closely beginning in the 37th week of gestation, with regular reassessment as long as the patient has not delivered.

The impact of strict criteria on the selection of vaginal delivery

From a broad perspective, in the most recent meta-analysis investigating the risks of planned vaginal breech delivery versus planned CS for term breech birth, the overall heterogeneity (I² = 36%) was informative. The variability of neonatal mortality among 14 studies accounting for 74,094 breech vaginal deliveries was low (ranging from 0.08 to 0.37%). On the other hand, neonatal mortality was markedly higher in only 2 studies authored by Singh et al. and Hannah et al. (the TBT). These two studies accounted for 1099 breech vaginal deliveries (1.5% of births) and had perinatal mortality rates as high as 21 and 1.3%, respectively, for planned vaginal births (25.6% of perinatal deaths). The same was true for neurological morbidity, which was 3.4 and 1%, respectively, in the studies by Singh et al. and TBT, while it ranged from 0.07 to 0.2% in the 14 other studies encompassing 74,094 breech vaginal deliveries conducted with the implementation of more stringent exclusion criteria for vaginal breech delivery.

Obstetric outcomes after an ECV attempt

De Hundt et al. conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis and showed that women who have had a successful ECV for breech presentation are at increased risk for CS delivery (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.6–3.0) and instrumental vaginal delivery (OR 1.4; 95% CI 1.1–1.7) compared with women with spontaneous cephalic presentation. Interestingly, stratification by time delay between successful ECV and delivery revealed a trend for increased risk of CS during the first week after ECV. Furthermore, in a cohort of 301 women with successful ECV, De Hundt et al. found that nulliparity was the only of seven factors that predicted the risk of CS and instrumental vaginal delivery (OR 2.7; 95% CI 1.2–6.1). Based on a retrospective, population-based cohort study using the CDC's birth data files from the US in 2006, Balayla et al. also showed that relative to breech controls without an ECV attempt, cases of ECV failure with persistent breech presentation and labour attempts were associated with increased odds of CS delivery (adjusted OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.21–1.57), assisted ventilation at birth (aOR 1.50; 95% CI 1.27–1.78), 5-min Apgar score < 7 (aOR 1.35; 95% CI 1.20–1.51), and neonatal intensive care unit admission (aOR 1.48; 95% CI 1.20–1.82).

This information should also be considered in the dialog with women regarding the way in which late pregnancy and delivery should be managed based on existing data, their own situations and their wishes.

The true benefit of an active and systematic ECV policy is widely appreciated, and such evaluation may be subject to bias. Burgos et al. found that their policy decreased the rate of breech presentation at delivery by 39.0% and decreased the CS rate for cases of breech presentation at term from 59 to 44%. On the other hand, Coppola et al. reported that their CS rate was not significantly reduced in the planned ECV group, even after adjustments were made for age, parity and previous CS delivery. Thus, each perinatal centre should implement an appropriate and coherent policy in accordance with the prevalence of pathologies in the population.

### Breech delivery at a university hospital in tanzania [^1137F2tw]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

The almost threefold increase in CD rate for breech presentation was not associated with an overall improvement in breech births or improved survival for breech-delivered infants. This is contrary to the TBT study and other studies in Western settings. One explanation, at least a partial explanation, for this difference might be selection bias, as there was a gradual improvement in maternity care in Dar-es-Salaam as the surrounding district hospitals improved. Muhimbili National Hospital had a 40% decrease in deliveries between 2000 and 2002 and between 2009 and 2011, which was concomitant to an increase in referral cases, from 7 to 28%. The higher proportion of referred patients also includes patients with breech presentation in labor, and they had worse outcome, irrespective of mode of delivery. Another reason for this difference could have been reduced staff skills in assisted breech delivery, as, in our sample, the number of vaginal breech deliveries decreased from three per week to one every 2 weeks. Van Roosmalen and Meguid highlight that settings that increasingly use CD may not have trained staff with the skills to assist vaginal breech delivery, and that this staff will need skills training in this area. Hannah et al. found that planned CD for breech presentation did not reduce serious morbidity in newborns in high-PMR countries as much as in low-PMR countries. They recognized the possibility of the caregivers being more experienced in breech deliveries in the low-PMR countries, which traditionally have low CD rates.

It is unclear how selection for the two different modes of delivery in this study was carried out. Women who delivered vaginally might have represented good candidates for a trial of labor, although facilities for such assessments are not the same at MNH as in a facility in a high-income country. Lead time from decision to operate can in this low-income setting be extended by several hours, meaning that VDs could represent a group of most urgent cases that did not make the necessary conversion to CD. This might be one explanation for the clustering of VD stillbirths, indicating the difficult conditions prevailing in this setting, especially as the study sample comprised of presumed intrapartal deaths. Birth asphyxia was the cause of neonatal death for all CDs and nine out of ten VDs.

Mothers with private insurance had excellent reported perinatal outcomes, which might indicate socioeconomic disparities and/or different quality of care. However, they constituted only 6% of the sample, and did not influence the overall results.

Cochrane reviews have also moved from certainty regarding recommended mode of delivery for term breech immediately following the TBT to complex uncertainty, acknowledging in 2015 that performing a cesarean should "be weighed against factors such as the mother's preferences for vaginal birth and risks such as future pregnancy complications in the woman's specific healthcare setting". The 2015 review also noted that the TBT data are not generalizable to dissimilar settings or in places where delivery techniques and protocols "differ materially". Due to these developments since the TBT, the national obstetric societies of the United States (ACOG), Canada (SOGC), UK (RCOG), and Australia & New Zealand (RANZCOG) have all reversed their early-2000 guidelines recommending routine cesarean beginning in 2006 and now currently support properly selected VBB for term singleton fetuses.

The 2015 Cochrane review also recommended research on how to "improve the safety of breech delivery". The most notable research and innovations have come from midwives and obstetricians around the world exploring breech birth with mothers in upright positions. In particular, Louwen's 2017 study of 740 term breech births in Frankfurt (433 pVBB and 314 pCS) found that upright vaginal breech birth leads to a shorter 2nd stage, fewer cesareans, less intervention, fewer maneuvers, and fewer injuries to mother and baby, compared to on-the-back positions. In addition to research indicating that cesarean section might not be the universal solution for term breech presentation, there is growing awareness of the importance of vaginal birth and of the risks of cesarean section on the long-term health of the baby and mother.

Medical ethics recognizes that patient autonomy in decision making should be honored. In 2016 ACOG produced a committee opinion strongly supporting maternal autonomy, including the right of pregnant women to refuse a recommended treatment. Despite good evidence, ethical arguments, and organizational support for the option of vaginal breech birth, there has been a concerted effort to eliminate VBB in most American hospitals, including outright bans. As hospitals continue to restrict or ban vaginal breech birth, some women will give birth at home or in birth centers to avoid a mandatory cesarean section. Some women also choose to give birth unassisted (with no care provider). Some state legislatures, including in CA where SJF practices, have recently restricted midwives from attending OOH breech births, further narrowing women's options.

### Revisiting the management of term breech presentation: a proposal for overcoming some of the controversies [^113rxQ5i]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Later, population-based retrospective studies helped refine the consequences of applying recommendations of systematically planned CS for women with term breech presentation at the population level. Hartnack Tharin et al. found that the rate of CS for term breech deliveries increased from 79.6 to 94.2% between 1997 and 2008 in Denmark, while intrapartum or early neonatal mortality decreased from 0.13 to 0.05% [relative risk (RR) 0.38 (95% CI 0.15–0.98)], which was a significant but lower reduction than the difference reported in the TBT. Using the Dutch National Perinatal Registry from 1999 to 2007, Vlemmix et al. stated that after publication of the TBT, the elective CS rate increased from 24 to 60%, and overall perinatal mortality and short-term morbidity decreased. In contrast, these outcomes remained stable in the planned vaginal birth group. However, the authors estimated that 338 CS deliveries would need to be performed to prevent one perinatal death, and Schutte et al. estimated the perinatal case fatality rate for elective CS for breech presentation in 2000–2002 at 0.47/1000 operations. At the same time, in the Netherlands the incidence of severe maternal morbidity (SMM) was estimated at 6.4/1000 during an elective CS compared with 3.9/1000 during an attempted vaginal delivery (OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.4–2.0), with an increased risk for SMM in the next pregnancy (OR 3.0; 95% CI 2.7–3.3), despite the numerous facilities and adequate resources allocated to perinatal care in such a high-income country.

### Factors associated with adverse perinatal outcomes for term breech fetuses with planned vaginal delivery [^1142Hen5]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to identify factors associated with adverse perinatal outcomes (APO) among term breech neonates with planned vaginal deliveries.

Study Design

We conducted univariable and multilevel multivariable analysis of the data collected in the multicenter prospective observational study PREsentation et MODe d'Accouchement (PREMODA) in women with planned vaginal delivery giving birth to singleton term breech babies. The end point was a composite set of APO.

Results

Of 2502 women with planned vaginal delivery recruited in the 174 participating centers, 1772 (71%) delivered vaginally. Adverse outcomes were observed in 165 cases (6.59%). After adjustment, the factors associated with them were geographic origin, gestational age < 39 weeks at birth, birthweight < 10th percentile, and annual number of maternity unit births < 1500.

Conclusion

When strict conditions governed the selection of delivery route and management of labor was rigorous, APO were not associated with any prenatal or peripartum obstetric factors.

### Uptake of external cephalic version for term breech presentation: an Australian population study, 2002–2012 [^111ZLu8J]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Breech presentation refers to fetuses that lie bottom- or feet- first rather than head-first. External cephalic version (ECV) is an effective manipulative procedure for turning a breech-presenting fetus so that it presents head-first for vaginal delivery. Adverse outcomes associated with ECV are rare and the procedure is cost-effective when compared to a scheduled caesarean section.

Australian and international clinical guidelines recommend ECV at or near term (37+ weeks gestation) for all women with uncomplicated breech presentations where there are facilities for an emergency caesarean section. It is unknown how well these recommendations have been translated into practice. Thus the aim of this study was to describe the uptake of ECV in the Australian healthcare setting and the maternal and pregnancy characteristics associated with ECV uptake.

### Brentuximab vedotin with chemotherapy for stage III or IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma (ECHELON-1): 5-year update of an international, open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial [^1118X4cJ]. The Lancet: Haematology (2021). High credibility.

The study ECHELON-1 was published by David J Straus and colleagues in 2021 in the journal Lancet Haematol. This study is related to the following diseases: Hodgkin's lymphoma. In the ECHELON-1 study, the trial question was: what is the role of front-line chemotherapy with brentuximab vedotin, doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine in patients with previously untreated stage III or IV classical Hodgkin's lymphoma? In the ECHELON-1 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the ECHELON-1 study, the population was: 1334 patients (558 female, 776 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with previously untreated stage III or IV classical Hodgkin's lymphoma. The key exclusion criteria were nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma; cerebral/meningeal disease; sensory or motor peripheral neuropathy; prior immunosuppressive chemotherapy, therapeutic radiation, or any immunotherapy within 12 weeks of first study drug dose. In the ECHELON-1 study, the interventions were: n = 664 brentuximab vedotin, doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (at a dose of 1.2 mg/kg, 25 mg/m², 6 mg/m², and 375 mg/m², respectively, IV on days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle for up to 6 cycles) n = 670 doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (at a dose of 25 mg/m², 10 U/m², 6 mg/m², and 375 mg/m², respectively, IV on days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle for up to 6 cycles). In the ECHELON-1 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in progression-free survival at 5 years (82.2% vs. 75.3%; HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.89). In the ECHELON-1 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in progression-free survival at 5 years, among patients with PET scan negativity rate at cycle 2 (84.9% vs. 78.9%; HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.13 to 2) No significant difference in progression-free survival at 5 years, among patients with PET scan positivity rate at cycle 2 (60.6% vs. 45.9%; HR 1.42, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.56). In the ECHELON-1 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in improvement or resolution of peripheral neuropathy. In the ECHELON-1 study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with previously untreated stage III or IV classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, brentuximab vedotin, doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine were superior to doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine with respect to a progression-free survival at 5 years.
