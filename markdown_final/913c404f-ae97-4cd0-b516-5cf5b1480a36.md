Cual es el valor de deficiencia de vitamina b12?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the diagnostic cut-off value for vitamin B12 deficiency is and how to interpret it clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative guideline thresholds. Then, I should verify unit conversions and ensure I'm quoting the correct numbers. Next, I will consider the "grey zone" and when to use confirmatory tests like MMA. After that, I need to check special populations such as pregnancy where cut-offs behave differently. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded answer and note caveats about assay variability and the primacy of clinical context [^112TSbGP] [^111LKYto].

> Let me first confirm the primary diagnostic threshold. The British Society for Haematology (BSH) 2014 guideline recommends diagnosing vitamin B12 deficiency when serum cobalamin is less than 148 pmol/L, which is equivalent to less than 200 ng/L, or when the level is below the local laboratory lower limit of normal in the presence of strong clinical suspicion [^111jsvta].

> Wait, let me verify the unit conversion so I don't misstate it. I initially thought 148 pmol/L might equal 180 ng/L, but that would be incorrect; 148 pmol/L is indeed 200 ng/L, and this equivalence is consistently cited in authoritative reviews and laboratory guidance, so I should correct myself and stick with 148 pmol/L = 200 ng/L [^111jsvta] [^115i7Tip].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single number. There is a recognized indeterminate or grey zone around 148–221 pmol/L (about 200–300 ng/L) where biochemical deficiency may still be present despite a "normal" total B12, so I need to ensure we consider confirmatory testing in that range when clinical suspicion persists [^111LKYto] [^116X2VPz].

> I should confirm which second-line tests best clarify indeterminate results. Serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) and, to a lesser extent, total homocysteine are recommended to document functional deficiency when total B12 is borderline or when clinical suspicion remains high; MMA is more specific than homocysteine for B12 deficiency, and holotranscobalamin can be considered where available, though access varies [^116X2VPz] [^117XBUaq] [^112TSbGP].

> Let me consider special populations before finalizing. In pregnancy, serum B12 physiologically declines and becomes less reliable, so if deficiency is suspected, holotranscobalamin is preferred over total B12 when available, and interpretation must account for gestational changes to avoid overcalling deficiency [^114rnp3w] [^114FUYQb].

> But wait, what if the lab uses different assay methods or reference intervals. I need to ensure we acknowledge that there is no single gold standard for B12 status and that local reference ranges and assay platforms matter; in discordant cases with strong clinical features, treatment should not be delayed to prevent neurological harm, and decisions should integrate symptoms, risk factors, and metabolic markers rather than a single assay value [^112TSbGP] [^116HYE4W].

> Putting this together, the diagnostic cut-off for vitamin B12 deficiency is serum cobalamin less than 148 pmol/L, which equals less than 200 ng/L; values in the 148–221 pmol/L (approximately 200–300 ng/L) range warrant confirmatory testing with MMA and clinical correlation, and pregnancy requires cautious interpretation with holotranscobalamin preferred when available [^111jsvta] [^111LKYto] [^116X2VPz] [^114rnp3w].

The diagnostic threshold for vitamin B12 deficiency is **< 148 pmol/L (200 ng/L)** [^111jsvta] by serum B12, confirmed by elevated methylmalonic acid (MMA) and/or homocysteine when B12 is borderline or clinical suspicion is high [^117XBUaq] [^113vsPr6]. Holotranscobalamin (active B12) **< 40 pmol/L** is an early marker of deficiency [^112GQcN7]. Clinical context is essential because no single test is definitive, and treatment should not be delayed if neurological symptoms are present [^116HYE4W].

---

## Serum vitamin B12 concentration thresholds

Serum vitamin B12 is the **first-line test**, but no single cutoff is definitive; interpret results with clinical context and confirmatory tests [^112TSbGP].

| **Serum b12 level** | **Interpretation** | **Clinical action** |
|-|-|-|
| < 148 pmol/L (< 200 ng/L) | Deficiency | Confirm with MMA/homocysteine; treat if confirmed [^111jsvta] [^112TSbGP] |
| 148–221 pmol/L (200–300 ng/L) | Possible deficiency | Confirm with MMA/homocysteine; treat if elevated or symptoms present [^111LKYto] [^117XBUaq] |
| > 221 pmol/L (> 300 ng/L) | Normal | Deficiency unlikely; consider other causes if symptoms persist [^111LKYto] |

---

## Confirmatory biochemical markers

Because serum B12 can be falsely normal, **confirm functional deficiency** with MMA and homocysteine [^114du8ut].

- **Methylmalonic acid (MMA)**: Elevated (> 280 nmol/L) in B12 deficiency; more specific than homocysteine [^115i7Tip] [^112TSbGP].
- **Homocysteine**: Elevated (> 20 µmol/L) in B12 deficiency but less specific; also elevated in folate deficiency [^115i7Tip] [^114du8ut].
- **Holotranscobalamin (active B12)**: Early marker; < 40 pmol/L suggests deficiency [^112GQcN7].

---

## Clinical context and symptoms

Clinical features guide interpretation because **no single test is definitive** [^116HYE4W].

- **Hematological symptoms**: Macrocytic anemia, hypersegmented neutrophils, pancytopenia [^117WuFCr].
- **Neurological symptoms**: Peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, cognitive impairment, subacute combined degeneration [^1126iHxg].
- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Glossitis, diarrhea, weight loss [^1145Smpv].

---

## Special populations and considerations

Certain populations require **tailored interpretation**:

- **Elderly**: Higher prevalence; consider age-specific reference ranges [^113VrFbh].
- **Pregnancy**: Physiological decline in B12; interpret cautiously [^114rnp3w] [^114FUYQb].
- **Patients on metformin**: Increased risk; monitor periodically [^111tYivt] [^116FKWmi].
- **Post-bariatric surgery**: High risk; monitor MMA and B12 regularly [^1114J9u5].

---

## Summary of diagnostic criteria

Diagnosis relies on a combination of findings: **serum B12 < 148 pmol/L (200 ng/L)** or below the local lower limit of normal, with confirmation by elevated MMA and/or homocysteine when B12 is borderline or suspicion remains high [^111jsvta] [^117XBUaq]. Holotranscobalamin **< 40 pmol/L** is an early marker of deficiency [^112GQcN7]. Clinical context is essential, and treatment should not be delayed in the presence of neurological symptoms [^116HYE4W].

### Diagnosis and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency – an update [^111b7Xx4]. Haematologica (2006). Low credibility.

We represent an update on diagnosing and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency should be suspected in all patients with unexplained anaemia and/or neurological symptoms, as well as in patients at risk of developing vitamin B12 deficiency such as the elderly and patients with intestinal diseases. Measurement of plasma cobalamins is suggested as the primary analysis followed by measurement of plasma methylmalonic acid in unsettled cases. Accumulating evidence indicates that the biologically active cobalamin, plasma holotranscobalamin (holoTC), may be superior to plasma cobalamins, and measurement of holoTC is currently introduced in the clinical setting. No consensus exists concerning evaluation of the cause for vitamin B12 deficiency, and pros and cons on the different tests mainly aiming at evaluation of the function of the gastric mucosa are presented. Once the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency has been confirmed efficient treatment can be ensured either by injections every 2–3 month or by a daily dose of 1 mg vitamin B12.

### How I treat cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency [^1123to9s]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

The challenges in medical management of cobalamin deficiency lie in attention to the unique pathophysiology that underlies cobalamin deficiency, more than in the mechanics of therapy. The central physiologic principles are that clinically important deficiency is more likely to occur (and progress) when intrinsic factor-driven absorption fails than when diet is poor and that most causes take years to produce clinically obvious deficiency. Transient defects have little clinical impact. The key management principle is the importance of follow-up, which also requires knowing how the deficiency arose. The virtues of these principles are not always fully appreciated. Recent developments have made diagnosis and management more difficult by diminishing the ability to determine cobalamin absorption status. Clinicians must also grapple with premature medicalization of isolated, mild biochemical changes that added many asymptomatic cases of still undetermined medical relevance to their caseload, often expanded by inflated cobalamin level criteria. The potential for misattribution of cobalamin-unrelated presentations to nongermane cobalamin and metabolite abnormalities has grown. Pathophysiologically based management requires systematic attention to each of its individual components: correctly diagnosing cobalamin deficiency, reversing it, defining its underlying cause, preventing relapse, managing the underlying disorder and its complications, and educating the patient.

### Vitamin B deficiency [^113VrFbh]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2017). Medium credibility.

Vitamin B 12 (B12; also known as cobalamin) is a B vitamin that has an important role in cellular metabolism, especially in DNA synthesis, methylation and mitochondrial metabolism. Clinical B12 deficiency with classic haematological and neurological manifestations is relatively uncommon. However, subclinical deficiency affects between 2.5% and 26% of the general population depending on the definition used, although the clinical relevance is unclear. B12 deficiency can affect individuals at all ages, but most particularly elderly individuals. Infants, children, adolescents and women of reproductive age are also at high risk of deficiency in populations where dietary intake of B12-containing animal-derived foods is restricted. Deficiency is caused by either inadequate intake, inadequate bioavailability or malabsorption. Disruption of B12 transport in the blood, or impaired cellular uptake or metabolism causes an intracellular deficiency. Diagnostic biomarkers for B12 status include decreased levels of circulating total B12 and transcobalamin-bound B12, and abnormally increased levels of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid. However, the exact cut-offs to classify clinical and subclinical deficiency remain debated. Management depends on B12 supplementation, either via high-dose oral routes or via parenteral administration. This Primer describes the current knowledge surrounding B12 deficiency, and highlights improvements in diagnostic methods as well as shifting concepts about the prevalence, causes and manifestations of B12 deficiency.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency [^111tiPE5]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency is a common cause of macrocytic anemia and has been implicated in a spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders. The role of B12 deficiency in hyperhomocysteinemia and the promotion of atherosclerosis is only now being explored. Diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency is typically based on measurement of serum vitamin B12 levels; however, about 50 percent of patients with subclinical disease have normal B12 levels. A more sensitive method of screening for vitamin B12 deficiency is measurement of serum methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels, which are increased early in vitamin B12 deficiency. Use of the Schilling test for detection of pernicious anemia has been supplanted for the most part by serologic testing for parietal cell and intrinsic factor antibodies. Contrary to prevailing medical practice, studies show that supplementation with oral vitamin B12 is a safe and effective treatment for the B12 deficiency state. Even when intrinsic factor is not present to aid in the absorption of vitamin B12 (pernicious anemia) or in other diseases that affect the usual absorption sites in the terminal ileum, oral therapy remains effective.

How patients were involved in the creation of this article

This article has been shared with Martyn Hooper, chairperson of the Pernicious Anaemia Society (PAS), for comments and feedback. Input from Martyn and other patients, some being members of the PAS, is much appreciated. They suggested recommendations for reporting specific signs and symptoms often mentioned by members/patients; however, as this is a therapeutics article, these recommendations are not included. They also reported on the barriers patients experience in healthcare (which can also be found in the scientific literature,) and several additional case descriptions.

Search strategy

We searched PubMed (NLM database) with the terms "B12" OR "cobalamin" AND "deficiency" OR "therapeutics" OR "supplementation" for relevant publications of clinical observations and studies published from 1950 to 2022. We prioritised systematic reviews and studies on the benefits, harms, and cost effectiveness of B 12 supplementation. We also searched clinical guidelines and our personal archives of references, and screened the reference lists of studies retrieved by the searches.

Introduction

Vitamin B12 is a corrin-like compound containing a corrin ring. It is involved in the metabolism of human somatic cells, affects the synthesis and regulation of DNA, and participates in the synthesis of fatty acids and energy generation. Inside the cell, vitamin B12 is converted into two forms: adenosine cobalamin and mecobalamin. Among them, mecobalamin is a coenzyme of N5-CH3-FH4 transmethylase (methionine synthase), which is involved in methionine-homocysteine metabolism (also known as the methionine cycle). As a key nutrient in early pregnancy, vitamin B12 is an important substance involved in one-carbon metabolism, DNA methylation and cell metabolism.

In a 2023 cross-sectional descriptive study, Benson J and colleagues reported a high prevalence of low vitamin B12 levels among women. Separately, de Macedo TSG conducted a systematic review focusing on vitamin B deficiency in three specific groups of Brazilian women: those of childbearing age, pregnant women, and lactating women. This review showed that the prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency in these female populations was as high as 29.4%. Vitamin B12 plays a fundamental role in cellular metabolism and epigenetic regulation. The reproductive axis — encompassing oocyte maturation, embryonic development, and placental formation — involves rapid cell division and intricate gene regulation, processes highly dependent on the proper functioning of one-carbon metabolism. Thus, vitamin B12 inadequacy is likely to exert the most prominent effects in these sensitive reproductive contexts.

### Biomarkers of cobalamin (vitamin B-12) status in the epidemiologic setting: a critical overview of context, applications, and performance characteristics of cobalamin, methylmalonic acid, and holotranscobalamin II [^115wscRB]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Cobalamin deficiency is relatively common, but the great majority of cases in epidemiologic surveys have subclinical cobalamin deficiency (SCCD), not classical clinical deficiency. Because SCCD has no known clinical expression, its diagnosis depends solely on biochemical biomarkers, whose optimal application becomes crucial yet remains unsettled. This review critically examines the current diagnostic concepts, tools, and interpretations. Their exploration begins with understanding that SCCD differs from clinical deficiency not just in degree of deficiency but in fundamental pathophysiology, causes, likelihood and rate of progression, and known health risks (the causation of which by SCCD awaits proof by randomized clinical trials). Conclusions from SCCD data, therefore, often may not apply to clinical deficiency and vice versa. Although many investigators view cobalamin testing as unreliable, cobalamin, like all diagnostic biomarkers, performs satisfactorily in clinical deficiency but less well in SCCD. The lack of a diagnostic gold standard limits the ability to weigh the performance characteristics of metabolic biomarkers such as methylmalonic acid (MMA) and holotranscobalamin II, whose specificities remain incompletely defined outside their relations to each other. Variable cutoff selections affect diagnostic conclusions heavily and need to be much better rationalized. The maximization of reliability and specificity of diagnosis is far more important today than the identification of ever-earlier stages of SCCD. The limitations of all current biomarkers make the combination of ≥ 2 test result abnormalities, such as cobalamin and MMA, the most reliable approach to diagnosing deficiency in the research setting; reliance on one test alone courts frequent misdiagnosis. Much work remains to be done.

### Comparing the efficacy and tolerability of a new daily oral vitamin B12 formulation and intermittent intramuscular vitamin B12 in normalizing low cobalamin levels: a randomized, open-label, parallel-group study [^112GQcN7]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin B(12) deficiency is routinely treated with parenteral dosing and less often with high-dose oral vitamin B(12). Oral vitamin B(12) formulations have low bioavailability in patients with malabsorption and are considered less reliable than parenteral treatments.

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety profile of a new proprietary oral vitamin B(12) formulation (oral B(12)) with intramuscular (IM) vitamin B(12) (IM B(12)) in restoring normal serum B(12) concentrations in patients with low cobalamin levels (< 350 pg/mL).

Methods

Patients were recruited from 5 centers and randomly assigned to receive oral B(12) 1000 μg, taken daily for 90 days, or IM B(12) 1000 μg, given on study days 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, 21, 30, 60, and 90. The patients were aged ≥ 60 years or aged ≥ 18 years and had gastrointestinal abnormalities or were on a restricted diet. The primary efficacy outcome compared the proportion of patients in each treatment arm in whom cobalamin levels were normalized (≥ 350 ng/mL) following 60 days of treatment. Secondary objectives included comparing the efficacy of the 2 formulations after 90 days of treatment, assessing time to normalization of B(12) levels, and evaluating the changes in the levels of biomarkers methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine (HC). The effect on holotranscobalamin II (active B(12)) levels was assessed as an exploratory end point and correlated to serum cobalamin levels in both treatment groups. Blood samples were collected at baseline (day 1) and on days 15, 31, 61, and 91.

Results

Fifty patients were recruited. Forty-eight patients (96.0%) completed the study (22 patients [91.7%] in the oral B(12) group and 26 patients [100%] in the IM B(12) group). All patients (100%) in both treatment groups and in both populations had a cobalamin level ≥ 350 pg/mL on day 61 and maintained it on day 91. The difference between the IM and oral treatment groups did not reach the planned level of statistical significance (P < 0.05) for mean percent change from baseline (PCFB) in serum cobalamin levels on day 61 and day 91. The difference between the IM and oral treatment groups did not reach the planned level of statistical significance for mean PCFB in serum MMA levels on day 61. There was a statistical difference between the IM and oral treatment groups for mean PCFB in serum MMA levels on day 91 (P = 0.033), with lower values in the oral B(12) group. The difference between the IM and oral treatment groups did not reach the planned level of statistical significance for mean PCFB in plasma HC levels on day 61 and day 91. All patients in each treatment group achieved normalization of serum cobalamin levels by day 15. All patients in both treatment groups and in both populations had plasma holotranscobalamin levels ≥ 40 pmol/L on day 61 and on day 91. No statistical analysis was planned or performed for safety end points, which were reported only descriptively. Most observed adverse effects were considered mild or moderate in intensity. All adverse effects that were considered severe in intensity were also considered by the investigator to be not related to the study drug.

Conclusions

In this selected study population comprising individuals with low cobalamin levels but who otherwise were in good health, patients received oral B(12) (1000 μg/d) or IM B(12) (1000 μg in 9 injections over 3 months) for a total of 3 months. Both the oral and IM formulations were effective in restoring normal levels of serum cobalamin in all patients studied (100%). Both formulations used in this study were well tolerated at the dose studied. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01312831.

### Hypervitaminosis B12: an indicator of potential significant morbidity [^1137SHhF]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

A woman in her 60s with a history of vitamin B12 deficiency treated with intramuscular hydroxocobalamin was attending a specialist clinic for the management of persisting breathlessness following a previous pulmonary embolism. She reported that a persistently elevated vitamin B12 had been identified several months previously, despite the withdrawal of replacement therapy, and that the cause could not be explained to her by her general practitioner. Recognition of the potentially serious implications of this finding led to the identification of a pancreatic tumour which, by the time of diagnosis, had become too advanced for active management. We describe the metabolism of vitamin B12 in the context of hypervitaminosis B12 as a reflection of elevated transcobalamin consequent to underlying disease and the need to identify promptly the underlying cause.

Closing remarks

These guidelines are the result of the evaluation of available information from the literature based on the GRADE methodology and are aimed at delivering recommendations based on the best available data. The rarity of cobalamin-related remethylation disorders and MTHFR deficiency, the absence of larger data samples from international registries until recently and data mainly derived from case reports, case series or expert opinion results in a low quality of the evidence for several of the recommendations made. The working group responsible for this guideline commits itself to revise this work in the future.

Reliable assessment methods — vitamin B12 (B12) deficiency and parenteral nutrition: Serum B12 interpretation is limited because plasma or serum values can be normal despite tissue deficiency and, in parenteral patients receiving daily B12 infusions, serum B12 levels are hard to interpret. For adults, the lower limit is 120–180 pmol/L or 170–250 pg/mL, with normal serum values 300–900 pg/mL. Measurement of serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) is the most sensitive and specific test; in established B12 deficiency or inadequate supplementation, MMA rises in 95%, whereas serum B12 is low (< 200 pg/mL) in only 69%. Elevated homocysteine and the FIGLU test occur in both B12 and folic acid deficiency and are not as specific as MMA for pinpointing B12 depletion.

How is B 12 deficiency treated?

The therapeutic goals of B 12 treatment are the reversal of metabolic abnormalities and the prevention or reduction of clinical symptoms (fig 1). Treatment depends in part on the severity of symptoms and the cause of the deficiency. In individuals with symptomatic B 12 deficiency despite normal dietary B 12 intake, B 12 malabsorption is the most likely cause and should guide parenteral therapy.

The three key treatment areas are outlined below.

Insufficient dietary intake

To prevent deficiency, oral cyanocobalamin supplementation once daily 20–50 mcg or 50–150 mcg is most commonly recommended. In some countries, methyl- and adenosylcobalamin-containing preparations are available; however, one observational study suggests better efficacy with cyanocobalamin than with methylcobalamin. Exercise caution when using combination preparations to avoid excessive folate or B 6 intake. With advancing age, B 12 absorption declines, and a higher supplemental B 12 dose may be needed. Yearly monitoring of B 12 status and suitable adjustment of the supplementation dose is recommended.

For symptomatic deficiency (box 1) caused by insufficient dietary intake, intramuscular B 12 therapy is usually initiated with the aim of progressing to oral supplements once symptoms have resolved.

### A 2-year randomized controlled trial with low-dose B-vitamin supplementation shows benefits on bone mineral density in adults with lower B12 status [^117BSQz8]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Osteoporosis, characterized by a reduction in bone mineral density (BMD) and deterioration of bone microarchitecture, represents a substantial public health challenge that affects more than 200 million people globally. Osteoporotic fractures are a particular source of disability in older adults and carry a huge economic burden, with costs estimated at more than €56 billion annually in Europe alone. Nutrition is a key modifiable factor in the development of osteoporosis and an obvious cost‐effective measure for maintaining adequate bone health and preventing the onset of osteoporosis. Although calcium and vitamin D have well‐established roles in maintaining BMD and preventing osteoporotic fracture, there is international evidence to suggest protective roles of folate, vitamin B12, and the interrelated B‐vitamins, as well as potential adverse effects of the related metabolite, homocysteine, in bone health.

### Subnormal vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older people: a systematic review [^111kySvh]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Pernicious anaemia is a form of anaemia that is undeniably associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. Finding the cure for pernicious anaemia even led to the discovery of vitamin B12. Nowadays, vitamin B12 deficiency is not only associated with (pernicious) anaemia, but is also linked with other conditions such as dementia, neuropathy and subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Therefore, individuals with low serum concentrations of vitamin B12 are frequently given vitamin B12 supplements. Also, since low serum vitamin B12 concentrations are very common in older individuals, screening older people for vitamin B12 deficiency has often been recommended.

Although the biological role of vitamin B12 in haematopoiesis is well-defined, the outcomes of some studies cast doubt on the relationship between low vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older individuals. The association between low vitamin B12 and anaemia has become even more difficult to study because various cut-off values for serum vitamin B12 are used and serum concentrations of vitamin B12 appear not to be an accurate reflection of vitamin B12 status at the tissue level.

Therefore, in order to evaluate the association between subnormal vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older subjects, we performed a systematic review of relevant observational (cross-sectional and longitudinal) studies and randomized placebo-controlled trials that have been published in the medical literature to date.

### Laboratory assessment of vitamin B12 status [^115i7Tip]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

The detection and correction of vitamin B 12 (B 12) deficiency prevents megaloblastic anaemia and potentially irreversible neuropathy and neuropsychiatric changes. B 12 status is commonly estimated using the abundance of the vitamin in serum, with ∼148pmol/L (200ng/L) typically set as the threshold for diagnosing deficiency. Serum B 12 assays measure the sum of haptocorrin-bound and transcobalamin-bound (known as holotranscobalamin) B 12 It is only holotranscobalamin that is taken up by cells to meet metabolic demand. Although receiver operator characteristic curves show holotranscobalamin measurement to be a moderately more reliable marker of B 12 status than serum B 12, both assays have an indeterminate range. Biochemical evidence of metabolic abnormalities consistent with B 12 insufficiency is frequently detected despite an apparently sufficient abundance of the vitamin. Laboratory B 12 status markers that reflect cellular utilisation rather than abundance are available. Two forms of B 12 act as coenzymes for two different reactions. Methionine synthase requires methylcobalamin for the remethylation of methionine from homocysteine. A homocysteine concentration > 20µmol/L may suggest B 12 deficiency in folate-replete patients. In the second B 12 -dependent reaction, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase uses adenosylcobalamin to convert methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. In B 12 deficiency excess methylmalonyl-CoA is hydrolysed to methylmalonic acid. A serum concentration > 280nmol/L may suggest suboptimal status in young patients with normal renal function. No single laboratory marker is suitable for the assessment of B 12 status in all patients. Sequential assay selection algorithms or the combination of multiple markers into a single diagnostic indicator are both approaches that can be used to mitigate inherent limitations of each marker when used independently.

### Update on cobalamin, folate, and homocysteine [^112WMVAg]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2003). Low credibility.

Three topics affecting cobalamin, folate, and homocysteine that have generated interest, activity, and advances in recent years are discussed. These are: (I). the application of an expanded variety of tools to the diagnosis of cobalamin deficiency, and how these affect and are affected by our current understanding of deficiency; (II). the nature of the interaction between homocysteine and vascular disease, and how the relationship is affected by vitamins; and (III). the improved understanding of relevant genetic disorders and common genetic polymorphisms, and how these interact with environmental influences. The diagnostic approach to cobalamin deficiency now allows better diagnosis of difficult and atypical cases and more confident rejection of the diagnosis when deficiency does not exist. However, the process has also become a complex and sometimes vexing undertaking. Part of the difficulty derives from the lack of a diagnostic gold standard among the many available tests, part from the overwhelming numerical preponderance of patients with subclinical deficiency (in which isolated biochemical findings exist without clinical signs or symptoms) among the cobalamin deficiency states, and part from the decreased availability of reliable tests to identify the causes of a patient's cobalamin deficiency and thus a growing deemphasis of that important part of the diagnostic process. In Section I, Dr. Carmel discusses the tests, the diagnostic issues, and possible approaches to the clinical evaluation. It is suggested no single algorithm fits all cases, some of which require more biochemical proof than others, and that differentiating between subclinical and clinical deficiency, despite their overlap, may be a helpful and practical point of departure in the evaluation of patients encountered in clinical practice. The arguments for and against a suggested expansion of the cobalamin reference range are also weighed. The epidemiologic data suggest that homocysteine elevation is a risk factor for vascular and thrombotic disease. In Section II, Dr. Green notes that the interactions of metabolism and clinical risk are not well understood and a causative relationship remains unproven despite new reports that lowering homocysteine levels may reduce vascular complications. Genetic and acquired influences may interact in important ways that are still being sorted out. The use of vitamins, especially folate, often reduces homocysteine levels but also carries potential disadvantages and even risks. Folate fortification of the diet and supplement use have also markedly reduced the frequency of folate deficiency, and cobalamin deficiency is now the more common deficiency state, especially among the elderly. Although genetic disorders are rare, they illuminate important metabolic mechanisms and pose diagnostic challenges, especially when clinical presentation occurs later in life. In Section III, Drs. Rosenblatt and Watkins use selected disorders to illustrate the subject. Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome, a hereditary disorder of cobalamin absorption at the ileal level, demonstrates genetic heterogeneity. Finnish patients show mutation of the gene for cubilin, the multiligand receptor for intrinsic factor. Surprisingly, Norwegian and other patients have been found recently to have mutations of the AMN (amnionless) gene, mutations that are lethal in mice at the embryonic stage. Two disorders of cobalamin metabolism, cblG and cblE, are now known to arise from mutations of the methionine synthase and methionine synthase reductase genes, respectively. These disorders feature megaloblastic anemia and neurologic manifestations. The folate disorder selected for illustration, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) deficiency, paradoxically causes neurological problems but no megaloblastic anemia. This rare deficiency is the most common inborn error of folate metabolism. It is distinct from the very common MTHFR gene polymorphisms, mutations that cause mild to moderate reductions in MTHFR activity but no direct clinical manifestations. The MTHFR polymTHFR polymorphisms, especially the 677C→T mutation, may contribute to vascular and birth defect risks, while reducing the risk of certain malignancies, such as colon cancer. These polymorphisms and those of genes for other enzymes and proteins related to cobalamin, folate, and homocysteine metabolism may be important role players in frequent interactions between genes and the environment.

### Vitamin B [^114QQraS]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Tips for safer prescribing

Pregnancy and breastfeeding

Continued or new B12 therapy of women with deficiency during pregnancy and lactation is mandatory and safe.B 12 deficiency increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including early pregnancy loss, neural tube defects, pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, and low birth weight, as well as insulin resistance and adiposity. It also may lead to neurological complications in newborns, such as hypotonia, failure to thrive, central apnoeas, and seizures.

Children

Evidence based treatment advice on treatment in children is lacking; each case is judged individually. Solid evidence on the safety of parenteral, lifelong, high dose hydroxocobalamin is available from decades of treating patients with inborn errors of B 12 metabolism (eg, cobalamin C deficiency).

Symptom monitoring

Monitor symptoms regularly (eg, every two to three months) as they may reappear, even after several months, if injection frequency is reduced. Measuring serum biomarkers such as B 12 or MMA is neither helpful nor indicated in assessing or monitoring clinical improvement. Base the injection frequency on symptoms, and not on biomarker assessment.

Shared decision making

Use shared decision making to establish a long term frequency of B 12 injections for each patient and teach them how to self-inject.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cobalamin and folate disorders [^112TSbGP]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). Low credibility.

The clinical picture is the most important factor in assessing the significance of test results assessing cobalamin status because there is no 'gold standard' test to define deficiency. Serum cobalamin currently remains the first-line test, with additional second-line plasma methylmalonic acid to help clarify uncertainties of underlying biochemical/functional deficiencies. Serum holotranscobalamin has the potential as a first-line test, but an indeterminate 'grey area' may still exist. Plasma homocysteine may be helpful as a second-line test, but is less specific than methylmalonic acid. The availability of these second-line tests is currently limited. Definitive cut-off points to define clinical and subclinical deficiency states are not possible, given the variety of methodologies used and technical issues, and local reference ranges should be established. In the presence of discordance between the test result and strong clinical features of deficiency, treatment should not be delayed to avoid neurological impairment. Treatment of cobalamin deficiency is recommended in line with the British National Formulary. Oral therapy may be suitable and acceptable provided appropriate doses are taken and compliance is not an issue. Serum folate offers equivalent diagnostic capability to red cell folate and is the first-line test of choice to assess folate status.

### Association between cognitive impairment and vitamin B12, folate, and homocysteine status in elderly adults: a retrospective study [^116kpQHe]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cognitive disorders in old age have a serious impact on the health and social aspects of patients and their families.

Objective

The scope of this paper is to explore the role of cobalamin and folate that has been linked to cognitive decline, not only as a deficiency state depending on malnutrition, but also a determinant in cognitive impairment.

Methods

A 6-year observational, retrospective study was conducted by collecting the routine blood analyses and cognitive screening scores of patients aged 60 years or older, followed at our Centre for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Cognitive Disorders.

Results

In a linear regression with a multi-vitamin model, higher folate concentrations were correlated with better cognitive performances through MMSE score, even after correction for sex, age, and years of education (beta = 0.144, p = 0.001). Estimated MMSE marginal means for folate versus homocysteine showed that folate deficiency was associated with worse cognitive performances, with a more severe cognitive impairment when hyperhomocysteinemia was present.

Conclusion

The assessment of B-vitamin status among elderly adults can contribute to an economic and practical approach to the prevention and management of cognitive decline. Future studies focused to define optimal vitamin status are warranted.

Cobalamin and parenteral nutrition (PN) — In pregnancy and lactation, the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) and standard PN dosing are specified: RDA in pregnancy is 2.6 mcg B12 per day, and the usual parenteral dose of 5 mcg B12 per day exceeds this; during lactation, secretion is approximately 0.33 mcg B12 per day in breast milk, decreasing to 0.25 mcg B12 per day after 6 months, while the RDA is 2.8 mcg B12 per day with PN providing 5 mcg B12 per day. For adults, the current dose of 5 mcg/d generously meets requirements. When patients with short bowel syndrome are weaned off PN, B12 adequacy needs to be checked at interval, and if the patient smokes, hydroxocobalamin, rather than cyanocobalamin, is the compound of choice.

### Cobalamin status in children [^115ijWf6]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Cobalamin and the metabolic markers methylmalonic acid and total homocysteine undergo marked changes during childhood. In breastfed infants a metabolic profile indicative of cobalamin deficiency is common. Symptoms of cobalamin deficiency in children differ with age, presenting a continuum from subtle developmental delay to life-threatening clinical conditions. The symptoms may be difficult to detect, particularly in infants, and there tends to be a diagnostic delay of several months in this age group. Several reports show that even moderate deficiency in children may be harmful, and long-term consequences of neurological deterioration may persist after cobalamin deficiency has been treated. Given the crucial role of cobalamin for normal growth and development, possible widespread infantile deficiency needs attention. Cobalamin deficiency should be considered a differential diagnosis in children with subtle symptoms, and strategies to prevent cobalamin deficiency in mothers and children should be addressed.

PRECAUTIONS:

General Precautions: Vitamin B12deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than 3 months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg per day may result in hematologic remission in patients with vitamin B12deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with vitamin B12, irreversible damage will result.

Doses of cyanocobalamin exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis.

Information for Patients: Patients with pernicious anemia should be informed that they will require monthly injections of vitamin B12for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and in development of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of vitamin B12, because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration.

A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any vitamin B12. Patients following such a diet, should be advised to take oral vitamin B12regularly. The need for vitamin B12is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Vitamin B12is essential to growth, cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, and nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis.

Cyanocobalamin is quantitatively and rapidly absorbed from intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of injection; the plasma level of the compound reaches its peak within 1 hour after intramuscular injection. Absorbed vitamin B12is transported via specific B12binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues. The liver is the main organ for vitamin B12storage.

Within 48 hours after injection of 100 or 1000 mcg of vitamin B12, 50 to 98% of the injected dose may appear in the urine. The major portion is excreted within the first eight hours. Intravenous administration results in even more rapid excretion with little opportunity for liver storage.

Gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin B12depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor and calcium ions. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Prompt parenteral administration of vitamin B12prevents progression of neurologic damage.

The average diet supplies about 5 to 15 mcg/day of vitamin B12in a protein-bound form that is available for absorption after normal digestion. Vitamin B12is not present in foods of plant origin, but is abundant in foods of animal origin. In people with normal absorption, deficiencies have been reported only in strict vegetarians who consume no products of animal origin (including no milk products or eggs).

Vitamin B12is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and vitamin B12enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. Oral absorption is considered too undependable to rely on in patients with pernicious anemia or other conditions resulting in malabsorption of vitamin B12.

Cyanocobalamin is the most widely used form of vitamin B12, and has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the antianemia factor in purified liver extract. Hydroxycobalamin is equally as effective as cyanocobalamin, and they share the cobalamin molecular structure.

The following main questions and outcomes of interest in males and females with any type of onset (early or late) of one of the diseases of interest were addressed (outcomes in parentheses).
Which clinical signs are characteristic and allow timely diagnosis (Outcome: timely clinical diagnosis; this outcome is considered important)
Which biochemical parameters allow timely and valid diagnosis? (Outcome: valid, timely laboratory diagnosis; this outcome is considered important)
How can we prevent death and avoid/treat severe organ damage (Outcome: survival, severe organ complications; this outcome is considered critical)
How can we prevent or treat eye disease and neurocognitive impairment? (Outcome: visual and neurocognitive function; this outcome is considered critical)

In a first step, all reports made available to the panelists were graded according to the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) criteria by the authors who had assigned themselves according to their expertise to five major working groups focusing on the topics "clinical signs and symptoms"; "differential diagnosis"; "laboratory/biochemical parameters"; "disease course and outcome"; "treatment". Due to the rarity of the diseases, studies and reports of all types of designs (from case reports and case series to metaanalyses) were included; randomised controlled trials were not available.

The working groups prepared drafts on their topics, which were carefully evaluated in moderated discussion groups. Elaboration and grading of recommendations was accomplished by moderated, consensus-oriented discussions according to the "Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) working group" approach (Guyatt et al,); a patient representative was present at these meetings. Finally, for each outcome the quality of the evidence was rated in one of three categories (low, moderate, high) as defined by the GRADE working group. The strength of a recommendation (strong recommendation, recommendation and suggestion; for more information see Supplementary material) was summarised from written assessments from the panelist using the following set of questions:
Are you confident that the benefits outweigh the harms/burden or vice versa?
Is there high, moderate or low quality evidence? Please consider: Risk of bias Study design Directness and consistency of results Magnitude of effect Dose–response gradient Publication bias
Are you confident that the recommendation meets typical values and preferences of the target population (e.g. patients, parents)?
Are the resources worth the expected net benefit following the recommendation?
Overall strength of recommendation: weak or strong?

### Severe vitamin B12 deficiency in an exclusively breastfed 5-month-old Italian infant born to a mother receiving multivitamin supplementation during pregnancy [^116wkqTy]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

The possible development of severe clinical signs of vitamin B12 deficiency in infants born to undernourished mothers has been repeatedly described. A recent review of 134 cases of childhood vitamin B12 deficiency published over the last 20 years found that 69 were due to maternal B12 deficiency, and that more than 50% of these were directly related to an inadequate consumption of meat and other animal products such as that usually characterising strict vegetarians. The children of women with low vitamin B12 levels during pregnancy and lactation may have smaller stores of the vitamin at birth, and its concentration in breast milk is likely to be low. Such children tend to develop signs of vitamin B12 deficiency generally not before the fourth month of life, although neonatal cases have also been reported.

Childhood vitamin B12 deficiency is probably significantly more frequent than usually thought. Various studies carried out in the developing world or in countries where vegetarian diets are common have shown that a large number of mothers and children have low serum vitamin B12 levels that closely correlate with albeit mild clinical problems mainly involving the central nervous system. It has been reported that approximately one-third of low-income women and children in Guatemala have deficient (< 148 pmol/L) or marginal (148–220 pmol/L) plasma vitamin B12 concentrations, and that the lowest levels are strictly related to poor growth and development. In India, where people tend to be vegetarians, vitamin B12 deficiency during pregnancy is common, and the infants of deficient mothers are affected by a syndrome including mild developmental regression and alterations in skin pigmentation.

Age, gender, and pregnancy considerations — vitamin B12: Women have higher serum B12 values and higher transcobalamin levels compared with men, but this does not indicate a higher B12 requirement. In infants, the liver of well-nourished babies contains only 25–30 mcg B12, breast milk from vegan mothers tends to be low at 0.23 mcg/d, and infants may develop increased urinary MMA concentrations at 2–14 months indicating B12 deficiency; there are no known adverse consequences of providing this generous amount of B12. During pregnancy, serum B12 concentrations decline early and by the sixth month they are about half the prepregnancy concentration.

We describe a case of functional vitamin B12 deficiency where the repeated measurement of a serum B12 level within the normal range led to delay in the diagnosis of subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, and possibly permanent neurological damage as a result. Failure of intracellular transport of B12 by transcobalamin-2 can lead to functional B12 deficiency but with apparently normal serum levels, and is suggested by raised levels of either serum methylmalonic acid or homocysteine, associated with low levels of transcobalamin-2. Such patients may respond to repeated high-dose injections of B12.

### Vitamin B12 concentrations in pregnant Colombian women: analysis of nationwide data 2010 [^114FUYQb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 is a cofactor of methionine synthase in the synthesis of methionine, the precursor of the universal methyl donor S-Adenosylmethionine (SAMe), involved in different epigenomic regulatory mechanisms and especially in fetal growth. In addition, vitamin B12 plays an essential role in folate metabolism and there is increasing evidence that poor maternal vitamin B12 status may increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as neural tube defects (NTD). Considering the lack of a defined cut-off value for vitamin B12 deficiency in pregnant women, the prevalence of this condition may be overestimated due to a dilution effect in the second trimester of pregnancy. Measurement of the total vitamin B12 concentration in plasma is the usual method for assessing vitamin B12 status. However, neurological and hematological symptoms of depletion can occur in individuals with plasma vitamin B12 concentrations in the low-normal range. Moreover, the plasma vitamin B12 concentration is not a reliable indicator of vitamin B12 status in pregnancy since there is a gradual, physiologically normal decline in the plasma concentration of vitamin B12 during an uncomplicated pregnancy. However, vitamin B12 concentration has been used in at least four nutritional surveys in Latin American countries.

This decline is thought to be due to hemodilution, hormonal changes, alterations in the concentration of vitamin B12 binding proteins, or active transport of vitamin B12 across the placenta. Nevertheless, associations between vitamin B 12 marginal deficiency and adverse health outcomes in observational studies are of concern and urgently need further evaluation in clinical trials.

On the order hand, several factors can affect vitamin B 12 concentrations, such as individual genetic variation, disease conditions, prescription and other drug use, and pregnancy. Approximately 20% of pregnant women with lower vitamin B12 concentrations have neither clinical nor metabolic signs of vitamin B 12 deficiency. One of the important causes about lower status of vitamin B12 could be deficient dietary intake. Based on our dietary survey among indigenous in Colombia, the intake of animal protein intake was very low among pregnant women. Herrán et al. reported the high prevalence of vitamin B-12 deficiency in Colombia population may be caused by a low intake of animal source foods (ASF), which is the only dietary source of the vitamin except in the unusual situation where foods are fortified with vitamin B-12. Thus, increasing ASF intake should reduce the prevalence of vitamin B-12 deficiency among Colombian pregnant women. These results suggest that meat- or dairy-based programs may represent an effective way of improving the vitamin B-12 concentration among antenatal care.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with diabetes mellitus: is routine screening and supplementation justified? [^1136ppXf]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin B12 or cobalamin is a water soluble vitamin that plays a very fundamental role in DNA synthesis, optimal haemopoesis and neurological function. The clinical picture of vitamin B12 deficiency hence, is predominantly of features of haematological and neuro-cognitive dysfunction.

This review will mainly discuss the physiological roles of vitamin B12, the varied pathophysiological mechanisms of vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and perspectives on screening for vitamin B12 deficiency and supplementation of vitamin B12 among diabetic patients.

Absorption of vitamin B12

The principal source of vitamin B12 is animal proteins. The preliminary step in the metabolism of vitamin B12 involves its release from animal sources, a process mediated by the action of pepsin and gastric acid. After the release, dietary vitamin B12 binds to the R-protein secreted by the salivary glands. In the duodenum, in the presence of an alkaline medium and pancreatic proteases, the R- protein is hydrolysed to release vitamin B12 which later binds with the intrinsic factor (IF) secreted by the gastric parietal cells.

The vitamin B12 –IF complex is highly resistant to proteolytic degradation. The complex attaches at its specific receptors on the mucosa of the terminal ileum, a site where its absorption occurs. This stage of vitamin B12 absorption is calcium mediated.

The intracellular vitamin B12 is released following IF degradation. This free vitamin B12 attaches to another protein carrier, transcobalamin –II (TC-II) and is later released into the circulation. This vitamin B12 – TC-II complex, also referred to as holo TC-II is then actively taken up by the liver, bone marrow and other vital body cells. The liver serves as the principal storage site of up to 90% of the body's total vitamin B12.

A disruption in any of the described steps above will result into clinical or biochemical vitamin B12 deficiency. This includes insufficient dietary intake especially among alcoholics and vegetarians and malabsorption due to several conditions like chronic atrophic gastritis mainly in the elderly, pernicious anemia, celiac disease, chronic pancreatitis and drugs like metformin and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).

### Vitamin B12 deficiency: the great masquerader [^115UcM5t]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is rare in children, with nonspecific symptoms including failure to thrive, vomiting, anorexia, and neurologic changes with or without hematologic disturbances. The neuropathy can be severe and irreversible. We report four cases of children with B12 deficiency secondary to adult type pernicious anemia, a presumed transport protein abnormality, and a metabolic defect. All demonstrated neurologic compromise that improved after initiation of B12 therapy. Hematologic manifestations may be preceded by constitutional, gastrointestinal, or neurologic changes, and must raise concern for B12 deficiency. Therapy should be initiated promptly in this setting to prevent irreversible neuropathy.

### Neurological consequences of vitamin B12 deficiency and its treatment [^111RQfgA]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2008). Low credibility.

In developed countries, the vitamin B12 deficiency usually occurs in children exclusively breast-fed, whose mothers are vegetarians, causing low stores of vitamin B12. Symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency appear during the second trimester of life and include failure to thrive, lethargy, hypotonia, and arrest or regression of developmental skills. A megaloblastic anemia can be present. One half of the infants exhibit abnormal movements before the start of treatment with intramuscular cobalamin, which disappear 1 or 2 days after. More rarely, movement disorders appear a few days after treatment, whereas neurological symptoms are improving. These abnormal movements can last for 2 to 6 weeks. If not treated, vitamin B12 deficiency can cause lasting neurodisability. Therefore, efforts should be directed to preventing deficiency in pregnant and breast-feeding women on vegan diets and their infants by giving them vitamin B12 supplements. When preventive supplementation has failed, one should recognize and treat quickly an infant presenting with failure to thrive and delayed development.

Background

Maternal nutritional status is a determining factor of fetal growth and birth weight. Globally, the prevalence of maternal malnutrition ranges from 10% to 20%; however, it is more common among low-income populations. Short-term changes in maternal nutrition can result in fetal growth retardation and complications unique to human pregnancy, such as preeclampsia, eclampsia and pregnancy-induced hypertension. The long-term effects of growth retardation have been associated with an increased risk of non-communicable diseases, such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia.

Given the risk of malnutrition in developing countries, it is necessary to measure its prevalence in vulnerable populations, such as children, pregnant women and minorities, to identify high risk groups and develop preventive interventions. To estimate the magnitude of this problem, the use of direct indicators to assess various nutrient levels, such as iron, vitamin A, zinc and vitamin B12, has been proposed. Lack of these nutrients in the diet also contributes to Vitamin B12 deficiency. These biochemical indicators determine the concentrations of micronutrients based on factors such as absorption, which reflects the nutritional status of biological processes, including cognitive development, physical growth and immune response. Vitamin B12 deficiency and folate deficiency causes neural tube defects, such as spina bifida and anencephaly, due to the failure of cell growth and replication in the fetus and placenta. Therefore, children who are breastfed by vegetarian mothers are at greater risk of serious complications related to vitamin B12 deficiency, which include hematologic [megaloblastic anemia], neurologic [hypotonia, ataxia, developmental delays] and gastrointestinal [inflammatory complications] symptoms. The consequences of anemia are not limited to poor pregnancy outcomes, impaired physical and cognitive development, and increased risk of morbidity in children but also affect national productivity and economics.

### Laboratory diagnosis of vitamin B12 and folate deficiency… [^111LKYto]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

Depending on the technique used in measurement, the lower limit of normal for serum Cbl is variable; usually it is set at about 148 pmol/L. Published estimates of the sensitivity and specificity of the test in the diagnosis of Cbl deficiency vary widely. This relates in part to the lack of a consistently defined gold standard for the diagnosis and in part to varying study designs. For example, in considering the sensitivity of the test, one study23 estimated that 90% to 95% of patients with Cbl deficiency had levels of less than 148 pmol/L, 5% to 10% had levels of 148 to 221 pmol/L, and less than 1% had levels greater than 221 pmol/L. The reported specificity of a low serum Cbl level in predicting Cbl deficiency is also variable.

28, 29 In a study of unselected patients with suspected Cbl deficiency and levels below 148 pmol/L, 60% of evaluable patients had a hematologic or neurologic response to parenteral Cbl administration. 28 The specificity of a serum Cbl level below 74 pmol/L was 90% in this study. If after administration of folate low serum Cbl levels do not return to normal, concurrent Cbl deficiency may be present.
30. Patients with low serum Cbl levels usually have Cbl deficiency. Figure 3 summarizes the diagnostic approach. Because the serum folate level is more likely to increase than to decrease in patients with Cbl deficiency, patients with low levels of both vitamins are likely to have a mixed deficiency. However, if RBC folate level rather than serum folate level is measured, the finding of low levels of both vitamins may be explained by isolated Cbl deficiency because of the propensity of the RBC folate level to decrease in Cbl-deficient patients.

Patients with slightly low or borderline serum Cbl levels may have Cbl deficiency, but a higher standard of proof is required than for patients with a serum Cbl level of less than 74 pmol/L. It is reasonable to order serum MMA and Hcy determinations in this setting and to use the res.
