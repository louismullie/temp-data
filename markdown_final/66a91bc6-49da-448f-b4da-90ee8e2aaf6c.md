pro bnp 970 should the patien be refr to whom

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and act on an NT-proBNP of 970 pg/mL in a patient with suspected heart failure, including urgency, referral destination, and next steps. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether heart failure is suspected. Then, I should verify the correct NT-proBNP thresholds for non-acute care and classify the severity of elevation. Next, I will determine the appropriate referral urgency and the specialist target. After that, I need to consider alternative diagnoses that can elevate natriuretic peptides and outline the initial workup. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation and note any caveats that could modify interpretation or timing.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. NT-proBNP is most informative when interpreted alongside symptoms and signs suggestive of heart failure such as exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, fatigue, or edema, so I need to ensure the pretest probability is at least intermediate before using the biomarker to guide referral decisions [^112PLGK6] [^112vuRN9].

> Now, I should verify the correct diagnostic thresholds. In the non-acute, ambulatory setting, the ESC recommends NT-proBNP less than 125 pg/mL to rule out heart failure, whereas NICE uses a higher rule-out threshold of 400 pg/mL and defines 400–2000 pg/mL as moderate elevation and greater than 2000 pg/mL as high elevation warranting urgent referral. I initially thought the NICE moderate range was 300–2000 pg/mL, but wait, let me verify — yes, it is 400–2000 pg/mL, so 970 pg/mL falls in the moderate-risk category, not the high-risk category [^114To6SV] [^11414zcV].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the diagnosis itself. A value of 970 pg/mL is above the ESC rule-out threshold and within the NICE moderate range, which increases the likelihood of heart failure but is not diagnostic; importantly, natriuretic peptides lack specificity and can be elevated in atrial fibrillation, valvular disease, renal dysfunction, pulmonary disease, anemia, and with aging, so I need to ensure we do not overcall heart failure solely on this number [^112PLGK6] [^111zKeQV] [^112xTEbr].

> Next, I should review referral urgency. According to NICE, patients with suspected heart failure and NT-proBNP 400–2000 pg/mL should be referred for specialist assessment and echocardiography within 6 weeks. Given 970 pg/mL sits in this band, a 6-week referral is appropriate unless there are red flags such as decompensation, hypotension, syncope, or chest pain, in which case I should expedite to a 2-week pathway or urgent evaluation. I should double-check that the 2-week pathway applies to NT-proBNP greater than 2000 pg/mL, which it does, confirming that 970 pg/mL maps to the 6-week target [^114To6SV] [^114BoqKc] [^112oZUuv].

> I will now examine the referral destination. The most appropriate specialist is a general cardiologist or a heart failure clinic for diagnostic confirmation, echocardiography, and initial management planning. If advanced therapies are needed or the course is refractory, escalation to an advanced heart failure specialist is reasonable, but at 970 pg/mL routine cardiology is the correct first stop unless other high-risk features are present [^114AyKQD] [^115h6F5Q].

> Let me consider the diagnostic yield to set expectations. Real-world cohorts of patients referred with NT-proBNP above 400 pg/mL show that only about 29% ultimately have heart failure, with the remainder having conditions like valvular disease or atrial fibrillation, so I should counsel that an elevated NT-proBNP signals cardiac disease requiring evaluation but does not guarantee a heart failure diagnosis. This reinforces the need for echocardiography and specialist review rather than presumptive treatment [^112xTEbr] [^112fepWY] [^116T8yCq].

> Next, I should review the initial workup while awaiting cardiology. I need to check a 12-lead ECG, basic labs including renal function and hemoglobin, thyroid function, and a chest radiograph if dyspnea is prominent. I should also screen for atrial fibrillation, ischemia, and left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG, and consider precipitating or mimicking conditions such as anemia, hyperthyroidism, or pulmonary disease that could explain symptoms and the biomarker elevation [^112PLGK6] [^111kDHkp].

> But wait, what if the patient is obese or has renal impairment. Obesity can suppress natriuretic peptide levels and may blunt the apparent elevation, so a value of 970 pg/mL in an obese patient may actually reflect a relatively higher true burden; conversely, renal dysfunction elevates NT-proBNP, so I should interpret 970 pg/mL cautiously in CKD and avoid overattributing to heart failure without corroborating echocardiography and clinical findings [^117Ka9nV] [^114dk7gf].

> I should confirm that the final recommendation aligns with guidelines. For a patient with suspected heart failure and NT-proBNP 970 pg/mL, I recommend referral to a general cardiologist or heart failure clinic for specialist assessment and transthoracic echocardiography within 6 weeks, with earlier review if symptoms worsen or red flags emerge. In parallel, obtain ECG, renal function, hemoglobin, thyroid function, and chest radiograph as indicated, and avoid anchoring on heart failure until echocardiography and clinical correlation are complete [^114To6SV] [^114BoqKc] [^111kDHkp].

A pro-BNP of 970 pg/mL is **moderately elevated** and warrants referral to a **cardiologist** for further evaluation. This level is above the usual outpatient rule-out threshold (< 125 pg/mL) [^112fthaD] but below the high-risk threshold (> 2,000 pg/mL) [^114To6SV], so **urgent but not emergency referral** is appropriate. The cardiologist will assess for heart failure, valvular disease, or other cardiac conditions and arrange echocardiography and guideline-directed testing [^114BoqKc]. If the patient is acutely symptomatic (e.g. severe dyspnea, edema, chest pain), refer urgently or to the emergency department [^116sEz4R].

---

## Clinical significance of pro-BNP 970 pg/mL

- **Normal range**: Typically < 125 pg/mL in non-acute settings [^112fthaD].
- **Moderate elevation**: 400–2,000 pg/mL suggests possible heart failure or other cardiac stress [^114To6SV].
- **High elevation**: > 2,000 pg/mL indicates high likelihood of heart failure and warrants urgent evaluation [^114To6SV].

At 970 pg/mL, the result is **moderately elevated** and suggests possible heart failure or other cardiac pathology, but not at a level that mandates immediate emergency care.

---

## Recommended clinical actions

### Initial evaluation

- **Clinical assessment**: Evaluate for dyspnea, fatigue, edema, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and chest pain [^notfound].
- **Comorbidities**: Identify risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, renal dysfunction, and obesity [^115gURyi].
- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: Perform to detect arrhythmias, ischemia, or structural abnormalities [^111kDHkp].

---

### Specialist referral

- **Cardiology referral**: Refer to a cardiologist for comprehensive evaluation, including echocardiography and risk stratification [^114BoqKc].
- **Timing**: Urgent referral within 2–6 weeks is appropriate given the moderate elevation and clinical context [^114To6SV].
- **Advanced HF specialist**: Consider if severe symptoms, recurrent hospitalizations, or refractory cases [^115h6F5Q].

---

### Additional diagnostic tests

Additional diagnostic tests may include **echocardiography** to assess ventricular function, wall motion, and valvular disease [^112PLGK6]; chest X-ray to evaluate cardiomegaly, pulmonary congestion, or pleural effusion; and laboratory tests such as renal function, liver function, thyroid function, and additional cardiac biomarkers (e.g. troponin) [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

- **ESC guidelines**: NT-proBNP > 400 pg/mL in non-acute settings suggests possible heart failure and warrants further evaluation [^notfound].
- **NICE guidelines**: NT-proBNP > 400 pg/mL indicates referral for specialist assessment and echocardiography [^114To6SV].
- **AHA/ACC guidelines**: NT-proBNP is useful for diagnosis, risk stratification, and monitoring in heart failure [^113wsKXx].

---

## Potential underlying conditions

Several **cardiac and non-cardiac conditions** can elevate pro-BNP levels:

| **Cardiac conditions** | **Non-cardiac conditions** |
|-|-|
| Heart failure (HFrEF, HFpEF) | Renal dysfunction |
| Valvular heart disease | Pulmonary hypertension |
| Atrial fibrillation | Sepsis |
| Myocardial infarction | Liver cirrhosis |
| Cardiomyopathies | Obesity |
| Pericardial effusion | Thyroid dysfunction |

---

## Prognostic implications

Pro-BNP levels correlate with heart failure severity and prognosis; **higher levels indicate worse outcomes** [^114jELau]. A level of 970 pg/mL suggests moderate risk and warrants timely evaluation and management to prevent progression and adverse events [^114To6SV].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Referral**: Refer to a cardiologist for comprehensive evaluation and management [^114AyKQD].
- **Echocardiography**: Essential to assess cardiac structure and function [^114d2Vns].
- **Risk stratification**: Use clinical assessment and biomarkers to guide therapy and follow-up [^111kDHkp].
- **Urgent care**: If symptomatic (e.g. severe dyspnea, edema, chest pain), refer urgently or to the emergency department [^notfound].

---

A pro-BNP level of 970 pg/mL is **moderately elevated** and warrants referral to a **cardiologist** for further evaluation and management. This level suggests possible heart failure or other cardiac pathology, but not at a level requiring immediate emergency care.

### PRospective evaluation of natriuretic peptide-based reFERral of patients with chronic heart failure in primary care (PREFER): a real-world study [^113xyZaM]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess current management practice of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in multinational primary care (PC) and determine whether N-terminal-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP)-guided referral of HFrEF patients from PC to a cardiologist could improve care, defined as adherence to European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guideline-recommended pharmacotherapy.

Methods

PRospective Evaluation of natriuretic peptide-based reFERral of patients with chronic HF in PC (PREFER) study enrolled HFrEF patients from PC considered clinically stable and those with NT-pro-BNP ≥ 600 pg/mL were referred to a cardiologist for optimisation of HF treatment. The primary outcome of adherence to ESC HF guidelines after referral to specialist was assessed at the second visit within 4 weeks of cardiologist's referral and no later than 6 months after the baseline visit. Based on futility interim analysis, the study was terminated early.

Results

In total, 1415 HFrEF patients from 223 PCs from 18 countries in Europe were enrolled. Of these, 1324 (96.9%) were considered clinically stable and 920 (65.0%) had NT-pro-BNP ≥ 600 pg/mL (mean: 2631 pg/mL). In total, 861 (60.8%) patients fulfilled both criteria and were referred to a cardiologist. Before cardiologist consultation, 10.1% of patients were on ESC guideline-recommended HFrEF medications and 2.7% were on recommended dosages of HFrEF medication (defined as ≥ 50% of ESC guideline-recommended dose). Postreferral, prescribed HFrEF drugs remained largely unchanged except for an increase in diuretics (+4.6%) and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (+7.9%). No significant increase in patients' adherence to guideline-defined drug combinations (11.2% post-referral vs 10.1% baseline) or drug combinations and dosages (3.3% postreferral vs 2.7% baseline) was observed after cardiologist consultation.

Conclusions

PREFER demonstrates substantial suboptimal treatment of HFrEF patients in the real world. Referral of patients with elevated NT-pro-BNP levels from PC to cardiologist did not result in meaningful treatment optimisation for treatments with known mortality and morbidity benefit.

Results

Over a 12-month period, 679 patients with suspected HF and a 'high' NT-proBNP were referred from primary care to a secondary care, specialist HF service. The analytic population comprised 654 patients (figure 1). As shown in table 1, patients were aged 78.5 ± 9.72 years. They were mostly women (54.1%) and the median NT-proBNP was 2411 ng/L (IQR: 668–2489 ng/L).

Primary diagnoses

A cardiac diagnosis was reached in 562 (85.9%) patients and 1 or more abnormality of the ECG or echocardiogram were observed in 601 (91.9%) patients (table 2). The primary diagnoses made by HF specialists, after ECG an echocardiography, were valvular disease (39.4%), HF (of any type) (29.2%) and AF (17.3%) (online supplemental file 2 and table 2). Among patients with HF, 13.3% had HFrEF.

### Guiding and monitoring of heart failure therapy with NT-proBNP: concepts and clinical studies [^114vLPpJ]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Since 1988 with the discovery of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), many reports have confirmed the elevation of plasma BNP in symptomatic heart failure and confirmed that plasma levels are an independent predictor of death and cardiovascular events in both acute and chronic heart failure.

Methods and Results

A more slender evidence base attests that knowledge of plasma BNP levels can be used to produce clinical benefit. One randomized controlled trial demonstrated that measurements of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) can be used to improve diagnostic accuracy in patients with heart failure in the community. A second study demonstrated that the provision of plasma BNP data improves the speed of diagnosis and reduces the rates of hospital admission and length of hospital stay (while reducing the costs of care) in patients with heart failure who are seen the emergency department with acute dyspnea. Finally, a randomized controlled pilot study demonstrated that serial measurements of NT-proBNP can be used to more effectively optimize heart failure pharmacotherapy with a concomitant improvement in outcome.

Conclusion

The large body of observational data, coupled with this small but promising evidence base from controlled trials (which attests to beneficial effects on clinical outcomes) encourages an optimistic outlook for the further implementation of plasma BNP and/or NT-proBNP in the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure.

Heart failure

Patients with no cardiac diagnosis had the lowest NT-proBNP levels, while the highest were observed in patients with HF (table 2 and figure 2). In patients with HF, those with HFrEF had higher NT-proBNP levels than those with HFpEF (p < 0.001) and similar levels to those with HFmrEF and patients with valvular HF (figure 3).

In univariate analyses, both log NT-proBNP and an abnormal ECG emerged as predictors of HFrEF and HF of any type. The results of ROC analyses are shown in the online supplemental file 1. In multivariable logistic regression using log NT-proBNP and ECG (normal or abnormal) as independent variables (table 3), NT-proBNP emerged as a predictor of HFrEF (OR: 10.2, 95% CI: 5.63 to 18.3) and HFrEF/HFmREF/HFpEF (OR: 6.13, 95% CI: 3.79 to 9.93), while ECG did not reach statistical significance.

### B-type natriuretic peptide-guided treatment for heart failure [^116aJkeG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Heart failure is a condition in which the heart does not pump enough blood to meet all the needs of the body. Symptoms of heart failure include breathlessness, fatigue and fluid retention. Outcomes for patients with heart failure are highly variable; however on average, these patients have a poor prognosis. Prognosis can be improved with early diagnosis and appropriate use of medical treatment, use of devices and transplantation. Patients with heart failure are high users of healthcare resources, not only due to drug and device treatments, but due to high costs of hospitalisation care. B-type natriuretic peptide levels are already used as biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of heart failure, but could offer to clinicians a possible tool to guide drug treatment. This could optimise drug management in heart failure patients whilst allaying concerns over potential side effects due to drug intolerance.

Objectives

To assess whether treatment guided by serial BNP or NT-proBNP (collectively referred to as NP) monitoring improves outcomes compared with treatment guided by clinical assessment alone.

Search Methods

Searches were conducted up to 15 March 2016 in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (OVID), Embase (OVID), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database in the Cochrane Library. Searches were also conducted in the Science Citation Index Expanded, the Conference Proceedings Citation Index on Web of Science (Thomson Reuters), World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry and ClinicalTrials.gov. We applied no date or language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of NP-guided treatment of heart failure versus treatment guided by clinical assessment alone with no restriction on follow-up. Adults treated for heart failure, in both in-hospital and out-of-hospital settings, and trials reporting a clinical outcome were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data and evaluated risk of bias. Risk ratios (RR) were calculated for dichotomous data, and pooled mean differences (MD) (with 95% confidence intervals (CI)) were calculated for continuous data. We contacted trial authors to obtain missing data. Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, we assessed the quality of the evidence and GRADE profiler (GRADEPRO) was used to import data from Review Manager to create a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

We included 18 randomised controlled trials with 3660 participants (range of mean age: 57 to 80 years) comparing NP-guided treatment with clinical assessment alone. The evidence for all-cause mortality using NP-guided treatment showed uncertainty (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.01; patients = 3169; studies = 15; low quality of the evidence), and for heart failure mortality (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.30; patients = 853; studies = 6; low quality of evidence). The evidence suggested heart failure admission was reduced by NP-guided treatment (38% versus 26%, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.80; patients = 1928; studies = 10; low quality of evidence), but the evidence showed uncertainty for all-cause admission (57% versus 53%, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.03; patients = 1142; studies = 6; low quality of evidence). Six studies reported on adverse events, however the results could not be pooled (patients = 1144; low quality of evidence). Only four studies provided cost of treatment results, three of these studies reported a lower cost for NP-guided treatment, whilst one reported a higher cost (results were not pooled; patients = 931, low quality of evidence). The evidence showed uncertainty for quality of life data (MD -0.03, 95% CI -1.18 to 1.13; patients = 1812; studies = 8; very low quality of evidence). We completed a 'Risk of bias' assessment for all studies. The impact of risk of bias from lack of blinding of outcome assessment and high attrition levels was examined by restricting analyses to only low 'Risk of bias' studies.

Authors' Conclusions

In patients with heart failure low-quality evidence showed a reduction in heart failure admission with NP-guided treatment while low-quality evidence showed uncertainty in the effect of NP-guided treatment for all-cause mortality, heart failure mortality, and all-cause admission. Uncertainty in the effect was further shown by very low-quality evidence for patient's quality of life. The evidence for adverse events and cost of treatment was low quality and we were unable to pool results.

### Natriuretic peptides: role in the diagnosis and management of heart failure: a scientific statement from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Heart Failure Society of America and Japanese heart failure society [^114jELau]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Natriuretic peptides in heart failure — brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), N-terminal prohormone of BNP (NT-proBNP), and midregional proatrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP) — are useful to establish the presence and severity of heart failure and can support diagnosis as a cause of symptoms in ambulatory and emergency department settings; high levels of BNP and NT-proBNP are associated with a greater risk for adverse short- and long-term outcomes including all-cause and cardiovascular death, and predischarge BNP and NT-proBNP levels are strong predictors of the risk of death or hospital readmission for heart failure, but the efficacy for treatment guidance using serial BNP or NT-proBNP measurements remains unestablished; BNP and NT-proBNP have similarities diagnostically and either can be used, yet BNP, but not NT-proBNP, is a substrate for neprilysin, so an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) can increase BNP levels but not NT-proBNP levels; natriuretic peptide measurements are also useful in patients at risk of heart failure, although standardized screening remains challenging due to heterogeneous risk factors, and use of natriuretic peptides is recommended in clinical guidelines of heart failure.

### Clinical applications of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) testing [^116wQKQM]. European Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Many claims have been made in recent years regarding the utility of plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentration measurements in the diagnosis, risk stratification and monitoring of patients with heart failure. This paper summarizes the current evidence and provides guidance for practising clinicians. Overall, plasma BNP testing appears to be of most value in the diagnostic arena, where it is likely to improve the performance of non-specialist physicians in diagnosing heart failure. In clinical practice, BNP testing is best used as a 'rule out' test for suspected cases of new heart failure in breathless patients presenting to either the outpatient or emergency care settings; it is not a replacement for echocardiography and full cardiological assessment, which will be required for patients with an elevated BNP concentration. Although work is ongoing in establishing the 'normal' values of BNP, heart failure appears to be highly unlikely below a plasma concentration of 100 pg/ml. However, as BNP levels rise with age and are affected by gender, comorbidity and drug therapy, the plasma BNP measurement should not be used in isolation from the clinical context.

Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Acute heart failure — testing recommendation and clinical utility: In acute HF care settings, natriuretic peptide testing has the potential to augment physicians' decision making across the spectrum of care, and natriuretic peptides have the advantages of objectivity, reproducibility, and widespread availability with evidence they define risk better than clinician judgment alone; importantly, natriuretic peptides should be measured in all patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of new-onset or worsening HF.

### B-type natriuretic peptide-guided treatment for heart failure [^1133B38L]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Our objectives are:

to assess whether treatment guided* by serial BNP or NT‐proBNP (collectively referred to as NP) monitoring improves outcomes compared with treatment guided by clinical assessment alone;
to assess the extent to which improved outcomes are explained by up‐titration of medication and/or reductions in BNP levels; and
to determine which groups of patients benefit most from monitoring in terms of their age, gender, severity of symptoms or stage of heart failure (with the use of the NYHA classification), and baseline NP.

*Treatment guided within this review refers to lifestyle and medication changes for the management of heart failure (i.e. no device therapy or transplantation).

### The diagnostic accuracy of plasma BNP and NTproBNP in patients referred from primary care with suspected heart failure: results of the UK natriuretic peptide study [^116FcDtR]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the measurement of plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal pro-BNP (NTproBNP) in patients referred by their general practitioners (GPs) with symptoms suggestive of heart failure. Additionally, to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the resting 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) with that of the peptides.

Design

A diagnostic accuracy study.

Setting

Rapid-access heart failure clinics in five hospitals.

Participants

306 patients referred by their GPs with suspected heart failure.

Main Outcome Measures

Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) and positive and negative likelihood ratios for BNP, NTproBNP and the ECG for the diagnosis of heart failure. Area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves for the two natriuretic peptides.

Results

The diagnosis of heart failure was confirmed in 104 (34%) patients. The area under the ROC curve was 0.84 [95% CI 0.79–0.89] for BNP and 0.85 [0.81–0.90] for NTproBNP. At the manufacturers' recommended decision cut-points, NTproBNP provided a higher NPV (0.97) than BNP (0.87), but at lower PPV (0.44 versus 0.59). An abnormal ECG did not add any further predictive value to that of NTproBNP.

Conclusions

We have confirmed the value of the measurement of plasma BNP or NTproBNP as a 'rule-out' test for heart failure in patients currently referred by GPs to rapid access diagnostic clinics. A simple classification of the 12-lead ECG into 'normal' or 'abnormal' adds little value to ruling out heart failure in these circumstances. Further work is necessary to establish the best decision cut-points for use in clinical practice.

### Diagnostic yield of a heart failure referral pathway using N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide [^112xTEbr]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the largest study to explore the diagnostic yield of NT-proBNP in patients with suspected HF referred from primary care to a specialist HF service. Several findings have emerged. First, among patients with a raised NT-proBNP, less than a third had a primary diagnosis of HF while the majority had valvular disease or AF. Second, only 13.5% of patients had HFrEF. Third, although the highest values of NT-proBNP were observed in patients with HF, there was considerable overlap in levels across the diagnostic groups. Fourth, over 90% of patients with a raised NT-proBNP had an abnormal ECG or echocardiogram and 86% had a cardiac diagnosis. Last, a high NT-proBNP was unable to discriminate among HF, valvular disease and AF.

Diagnostic yield

Numerous studies have explored the diagnostic utility of BNP and NT-pro-BNP in HF using ROC analyses. In the latter, NT-proBNP levels of > 125 pg/mL in the non-acute setting were associated with NPVs between 94% and 98%. In the general population, NT-proBNP of > 304.5 ng/L has an NPV of 100% (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.92). In a pooled analysis of three studies, the UK's NICE found that NT-proBNP ≥ 400 ng/L was associated with an NPV of 90%. Clearly, NT-proBNP is excellent at excluding HF, which is essential for primary care in identifying patients who do not require specialist referral.

For secondary care services, the main concern is to identify, or 'rule in' patients with HF, which depends on the PPV. In this regard, PPVs for NT-proBNP are not as high as the NPVs. For example, NICE found that an NT-proBNP had a PPV of 58% at a cut-off of 400 ng/L. In the present study, which is restricted to patients with an NT-proBNP ≥ 400 ng/L, 29.2% of patients had HF of any type and only 13.3% had HFrEF. In practice, this low diagnostic yield means that the majority of patients referred to specialist HF services do not have HF, but other cardiac conditions or none at all.

### NT-proBNP: a new diagnostic screening tool to differentiate between patients with normal and reduced left ventricular systolic function [^1179RUQb]. Heart (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether measurements of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) can be used to differentiate patients with normal and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in an unselected consecutive group of hospital inpatients.

Setting

City general hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.

Patients and Design

During a 10 month period 2230 admissions to a city general hospital (80% of targeted patients) had an echocardiographic evaluation of left ventricular function, a comprehensive clinical evaluation, and blood analysis of N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) within 24 hours of admission. Exclusions resulted from lack of informed consent or failure to obtain the required evaluations before death or discharge from hospital. Echocardiography was unsatisfactory in 37 patients, so the final number studied was 2193.

Results

A raised NT-proBNP (≥ 357 pmol/l) identified patients with an LVEF of ≤ 40% (n = 157) with a sensitivity of 73% and a specificity of 82%. The negative predictive value of having an NT-proBNP concentration below 357 pmol/l was 98%. Concentrations of NT-proBNP increased with increasing age and with decreasing LVEF (p < 0.05). A predicted concentration of NT-proBNP (corrected for age, sex, and serum creatinine) was determined for each patient. In patients with an NT-proBNP value less than predicted, the probability of having an LVEF of > 40% was more than 97%. This probability rapidly decreased to 70% as the measured NT-proBNP increased to 150% of the predicted value.

Conclusions

A single measurement of NT-proBNP at the time of hospital admission provides important information about LVEF in unselected patients.

### Long term trends in natriuretic peptide testing for heart failure in UK primary care: a cohort study [^111xLMCy]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Heart failure (HF) is a malignant condition affecting over 40 million people worldwide and has a worse prognosis than most cancers. Timely diagnosis is key to allow initiation of evidence-based treatments which can improve quality of life and prolong survival. Natriuretic peptides (NP) are produced by the heart in response to fluid overload and NP measurement is a key step in the HF diagnostic pathway. International HF guidelines, including those of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA), recommend that patients presenting to primary care with HF symptoms (breathlessness, fatigue, ankle swelling) have an NP blood test to determine whether referral for specialist assessment is required.

Across Europe, survival rates following a HF diagnosis remain low and there has been little improvement over the last two decades. This differs from cancer where prognosis for many cancer types has greatly increased in recent years. Investment in cancer diagnostic and treatment services, including rapid referral pathways for patients with symptoms, is associated with improved outcomes for some cancers. The same investment has not been seen in HF services and a high proportion of people with new-onset HF are diagnosed on emergency hospital admission.

In the UK, approximately one million people are living with HF and 200 000 are newly diagnosed each year, with 80% of new diagnoses occurring on hospitalization. In patients with symptoms and signs of HF, the addition of an NP test can aid general practitioner's (GP) decision-making, with a low NP level being particularly helpful to rule out HF. Since 2003, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recommended NP testing in primary care to guide referral for specialist diagnostic assessment, with a strengthened recommendation in 2010 which included time limits for specialist review based on NP level [6 weeks for N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)400 pg/mL or B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)100 pg/mL and 2 weeks if NT-proBNP2000 pg/mL or BNP400 pg/mL]. However, there is evidence that this guidance is not followed in practice and outcomes for people with HF remain poor, particularly if baseline NP level is high. The British Heart Foundation recently published a report highlighting the importance of earlier diagnosis of HF in primary care to improve morbidity and mortality. Our main aim was to report trends in NP testing in UK primary care over time, and by individual patient factors, and HF diagnosis rate.

### Few geriatric heart failure patients investigated according to clinical guidelines: a retrospective review of patient records [^112N4BJT]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Research on heart failure (HF) has often focused on younger patients. The aim of this study was to analyze extent of investigation and treatment among older patients prior to referral to inpatient geriatric care for worsening of HF.

Methods

Data on etiology, ejection fraction (EF) by echocardiography (ECHO), level of functioning according to New York Heart Association (NYHA), analysis of N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-Pro-BNP), ongoing treatment, adherence to guidelines, and information from previous caregiver were collected from patient records prior to admission from a sample of 134 patients.

Results

Few patients had been examined by a cardiologist (14%) during the year prior to referral. EF assessment had been performed in 78% (n = 105). The patients were categorized as having HF with reduced (HFrEF 28%), preserved (HFpEF 53%) or mid-range (HFmrEF 19%) EF. HFpEF patients had older EF assessments (mean 517days) than those with HFrEF (385days). In 61% (n = 82) at least one assessment with NT-Pro-BNP had been performed, being older among patients with HFpEF (290days vs 16days). There was a strong positive correlation (OR 4.9, p = 0.001) between having recent assessments of EF and NT-Pro-BNP (n = 30, 21%) and being presented with etiology in the referral, adjusted for EF, age, sex, and comorbidity. Among the HFrEF patients, 78% were treated with ACEI/ARB and BB according to ESC guidelines but reaching only half of target doses. In the HFpEF group the corresponding treatment was 46%. Among patients with EF ≤ 35% only 14% were treated with mineral receptor antagonists, ie low adherence to guidelines.

Conclusions

HF care in this population of older individuals showed deficiencies. There was little contact with cardiologists, lack of information of etiology in referrals and low adherence to treatment guidelines. Improving adherence to HF guidelines regarding investigation and treatment for HF in older people is therefore urgent and calls for more collaboration between specialists in cardiology and geriatric medicine.

### Real-world presentation with heart failure in primary care: do patients selected to follow diagnostic and management guidelines have better outcomes? [^112ZoQ7a]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Around 40 million people have heart failure (HF) worldwide, with 550 000 in the UK. Timely diagnosis is necessary to allow initiation of appropriate management, but this can be difficult, and with no single diagnostic screening test professionals traditionally rely on the classic symptoms of breathlessness, ankle swelling and fatigue to alert them to the possibility of the diagnosis. Patients with HF often present first in primary care where diagnosis and initial management are supported by professional guidelines. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) provides recommendations on the use of serum B-type natriuretic peptide (NP) or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide testing for patients with symptoms suggestive of HF, as well as echocardiographic imaging of the heart ('echo'), specialist referral, and prescription of medications shown to improve symptoms and prognosis in HF with a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) (beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II blockers (ARB), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists).

We have previously describedthe different diagnostic and management approaches ('pathways') in primary care in patients in England subsequently diagnosed with HF. In this study, we use the same linked primary and secondary care data to describe associations between general practitioner (GP) initial diagnostic work-up and management pathway and subsequent emergency hospitalisation for HF or death.

### The effect of digoxin on renal function in patients with heart failure [^111jA2jg]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Consecutive patients referred to a community heart failure clinic, from both primary and secondary care physicians, were enrolled at a single clinic serving a local population of about 500,000 people (The Hull LifeLab). Patients were consented for the use of their medical information as part of the Hull Lifelab registry prior to investigation. PS, PP, JZ and ALC are all co-investigators for the Hull LifeLab registry and had patient level identifiable information as part of the study. Some patients had no prior diagnosis of heart failure and were treatment naive, therefore requiring initiation of guideline-recommended therapy; others had a pre-existing diagnosis of heart failure and had already been initiated on treatment that might, however, require optimisation. Patients with chronic heart failure (defined as symptoms/ signs of heart failure with either reduced left ventricular ejection fraction or amino terminal pro brain type natriuretic peptide; NTproBNP > 220 ng/l) were included.2.

Patients were reviewed by heart failure specialist nurses and doctors at regular intervals, usually at 4 and 12 months, and then annually, unless an appointment was requested sooner by the patient, physician or specialist nurse. Information on demography, symptoms & signs, haematology and biochemistry profiles (including amino terminal pro B type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP), electrocardiograms and echocardiograms were systematically recorded at each time-point in a dedicated electronic health record stored on a secure NHS server. Titration of treatment was coordinated by the clinic but often implemented by community heart failure nurses or general practitioners.

The patients were divided into four groups on the basis of digoxin use: never on digoxin (N = 394); on digoxin throughout (N = 449); started digoxin at some point after baseline (N = 367); and stopped digoxin at some point after baseline (N = 31).

### Natriuretic peptides: role in the diagnosis and management of heart failure: a scientific statement from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Heart Failure Society of America and Japanese heart failure society [^111eKzvo]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Natriuretic peptide testing for suspected acute heart failure — diagnostic thresholds and interpretation include the following: In suspected acute heart failure, a BNP cut-off concentration of 100 pg/mL provides an excellent negative predictive value to exclude acute heart failure, whereas higher values (> 400 pg/mL) deliver excellent positive predictive value. For NT-proBNP, age-dependent rule-in cut-offs are preferred (450/900/1800 pg/mL), and independent of age an NT-proBNP concentration < 300 pg/mL provides a very high negative predictive value for heart failure. When using rule-in thresholds, identification of any potential relevant confounder should be required, and patients with levels in the gray zone need extra physician attention and ancillary testing, such as chest x-ray and echocardiography. A change of 25%–30% or more from presentation usually indicates a change in clinical status, and individualized interpretation of biomarker levels, particularly in special populations and in the setting of comorbidities, is recommended.

Journal of Cardiac Failure (2021). High credibility.

Perspective for the noncardiologist — timely diagnosis and referrals: The universal definition is intended to support noncardiologists in timely diagnosis and management. Key points include to "optimally identify and treat patients at risk for HF to prevent or delay the development of HF", to recognize that pre-HF patients such as asymptomatic patients with elevated natriuretic peptides will likely require cardiology referral to prevent progression, to ensure that diagnosis and timely treatment are not missed or delayed in symptomatic patients, and that patients with elevated natriuretic peptides, evidence of congestion/elevated filling pressures, or advanced HF would be considered for referral to HF specialists.

### Natriuretic peptide-based screening and collaborative care for heart failure: the STOP-HF randomized trial [^111es1B1]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

The study STOP-HF was published by Ledwidge M and colleagues in 2013 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the STOP-HF study, the trial question was: what is the role of screening program using brain-type natriuretic peptide and collaborative care in patients with cardiovascular risk factors? In the STOP-HF study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the STOP-HF study, the population was: 1374 patients (751 female, 623 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with cardiovascular risk factors. The key exclusion criteria were refused to provide informed consent, LV systolic dysfunction, history of symptomatic HF, or diagnosis compromising survival. In the STOP-HF study, the interventions were: n = 697 screening with BNP (with BNP ≥ 50 pg/mL undergoing echocardiography plus collaborative care between their primary care physician and specialist cardiovascular service) n = 677 no routine BNP screening (usual primary care). In the STOP-HF study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in LV dysfunction with or without HF (5.3% vs. 8.7%; OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.82). In the STOP-HF study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in emergency hospitalization for major cardiovascular events (per 1,000 patient-years) (22.3 vs. 40.4; IRR 0.6, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.81) Significant decrease in asymptomatic LV dysfunction (4.3% vs. 6.6%; OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.88) No significant difference in HF (1% vs. 2.1%; OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.2 to 1.2). In the STOP-HF study, the conclusion was: in patients with cardiovascular risk factors, screening with BNP was superior to no routine BNP screening with respect to LV dysfunction with or without HF.

Testing and medication titration following diagnosis of HFrEF outlines an initial evaluation, iterative medication adjustment, timelines, reassessment, and referral triggers. Studies to consider initially include BNP/NT-proBNP, CBC and basic metabolic panel, ECG, chest X-ray, echocardiogram, and, as appropriate, coronary angiogram/CMR/endomyocardial biopsy. Serial evaluation and titration specify clinic visits with history, vitals, exam, and labs; if volume status requires treatment, adjust diuretic agents with follow-up in 1–2 weeks; if euvolemic and stable, start/increase/switch GDMT with follow-up in 1–2 weeks via virtual visit or repeat clinic visit with basic metabolic panel, as indicated, and repeat the cycle until no further changes are possible or tolerated. The pathway labels intensification as 1–3 week cycles during lack of response/instability, and notes stabilization ~3 months, after which response and cardiac remodeling are assessed by repeating labs (e.g. BNP/NT-proBNP and basic metabolic panel), repeating echocardiogram, repeating ECG, and considering EP referral for those eligible for CRT or ICD; end‑intensification/maintenance emphasizes ongoing assessment, additional adjustments, and repeating objective data as needed. To assist in decision making for referral to an advanced heart failure specialist, the I‑NEED‑HELP acronym lists triggers including Ejection fraction ≤ 35% and Hospitalizations > 1, along with intravenous inotropes, NYHA IIIB/IV or persistently elevated natriuretic peptides, end-organ dysfunction, defibrillator shocks, edema despite escalating diuretics, low blood pressure/high heart rate, and prognostic medication intolerance or down‑titration of GDMT. Additionally, among patients with HFrEF, lowering NT‑proBNP to < 1,000 pg/mL was associated with significant reverse remodeling and improved outcomes.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^116f11oz]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Acute dyspnea — B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal prohormone precursor (NTproBNP) may help evaluate heart failure as the cause of dyspnea and can expedite evaluation and treatment; however, routine use of BNP in all patients with acute dyspnea is not recommended. In acute care settings such as an ED, sensitivity of BNP or NTproBNP is substantially higher than specificity and utility is greatest for ruling out heart failure when pretest probability is low to intermediate, while the utility of serial BNP testing in known heart failure is uncertain.

Screening and prognostication using natriuretic peptides — STOP-HF and predischarge use show that in the STOP-HF study, participants in the intervention group with BNP levels ≥ 50 pg/mL underwent echocardiography and referral to a cardiovascular specialist and BNP-based screening reduced the composite endpoint of incident asymptomatic LV dysfunction or overt HF; additionally, predischarge BNP and NT-proBNP levels are strong predictors of the risk of death or hospital readmission for HF, and although decreases during treatment are associated with better outcomes than no change or a rise, targeting a certain threshold, value, or relative change during hospitalization has not been shown to be consistently effective in improving outcomes.

### Natriuretic peptide-based screening and heart failure… [^116vggA9]. JAMA Network (2013). Excellent credibility.

BNP indicates brain-type natriuretic peptide. BNP indicates brain-type natriuretic peptide. Major adverse cardiovascular events included arrhythmia, transient ischemic attack, stroke, myocardial infarction, peripheral or pulmonary thrombosis/embolus, or heart failure. In the full sample, 51 of 697 patients were admitted for major adverse cardiovascular events in the intervention group and 71 of 677 were admitted in the control group. Conclusion and Relevance Among patients at risk of heart failure, BNP-based screening and collaborative care reduced the combined rates of LV systolic dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction, and heart failure. Trial Registration clinicaltrials. gov Identifier: NCT00921960. Patients with an initial BNP level of 50 pg/mL or higher also received ongoing collaborative care with at least an annual specialized cardiovascular review, including repeat Doppler echocardiography, BNP measurement, and other investigations as appropriate.

In all patients with an initial BNP of less than 50 pg/mL, annual BNP testing by their primary care physician resulted in specialist referral with management as outlined above if the value increased to 50 pg/mL or higher. Participants' primary care physicians were informed of all clinical investigations performed by the specialist cardiovascular center and were involved in any change in management strategy. The IRR was 0.
85. A full list of the cardiovascular and noncardiovascular emergency and elective admissions and outpatient visits is presented in eTables 11 and 12 in the Supplement. STOP–HF is the first prospective, randomized study, to our knowledge, to demonstrate a reduction in newly diagnosed HF, asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, and emergency cardiovascular hospitalizations using BNP-guided collaborative care in a broad community cohort.

It confirms BNP as a risk identifier for HF and cardiovascular events and provides unique data on the potential benefit of using levels of this peptide as a guide for care. The positive clinical effect of this intervention was associated with improved risk factor control, increased use of agents that modulate the RAAS targeted at those with elevated BNP levels, and increased use of some cardiovascular diagnostics. These data suggest that a targeted strategy for HF prevention using BNP and collaborative care in a community population may be effective and that benefits extend beyond prevention of HF to an overall reduction in emergency cardiovascular admissions.

6 USE OF NATRIURETIC PEPTIDES IN HEART FAILURE

The area where most is known about the role of natriuretic peptides is in patients with heart failure. The use of natriuretic peptides for the diagnosis of heart failure is now common and standard practice. Given the overwhelming evidence that natriuretic peptide levels are raised in heart failure, the definition of heart failure incorporates raised natriuretic peptides as a key aspect of making the diagnosis. What is less clear, however, is the precise threshold to be used to rule in or rule out a diagnosis. Currently, the European Society of Cardiology guidelines use a value of BNP < 35 pg/mL or NT‐proBNP < 125 pg/mL to rule out heart failure in a non‐acute setting. In the acute setting, values of BNP < 100 pg/mL or NT‐proBNP < 300 pg/mL are suggested as appropriate thresholds to rule out heart failure. These thresholds apply to patients in sinus rhythm; however, as will be discussed later, a number of other conditions can raise natriuretic peptides and lower natriuretic peptides, and therefore care must be taken into account when interpreting high or low levels (Figure 2). Currently, guidelines do not give any guidance on how these levels should be adjusted according to factors known to influence natriuretic peptides and therefore alter the sensitivity and specificity of a cut‐off threshold value for ruling out or ruling in heart failure. Some suggestions for age and sex‐related cut‐offs have been made but are not universally used. The one comorbidity where there is more consensus about adjusting the cut‐off is in the presence of atrial fibrillation. It is suggested that thresholds are increased by 50–100% in the presence of atrial fibrillation. There is currently no evidence to support different cut‐offs according to whether heart failure with reduced or preserved ejection fraction is suspected.

Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Natriuretic peptides across acute heart failure care — Natriuretic peptide (NP) levels fluctuate with left ventricular (LV) filling pressures during decompensation and improvement and exhibit intrinsic biological variability of 25–30% for NT-proBNP and 40% for BNP; in the emergency department (ED) NP use includes accuracy of diagnosis with high negative predictive value (NPV), stratification and triage, shortening decision time, and prognosis, in-hospital applications include correlation to LV filling pressure, monitoring response to intravenous (IV) therapies, assessing hemodynamic congestion, guiding discharge decisions and prognosis, and post-discharge uses include identification of residual congestion, prompting early interventions to reduce congestion, and prognosis at 1 week and 1 month; these biomarkers have the highest class of recommendation for exclusion of heart failure because of very high NPV (94%–97%), are helpful in judging whether reported worsening symptoms are related to increased left-sided cardiac filling pressures, but lack a prognostic effect in predominant right-sided HF such as severe tricuspid regurgitation.

Acute heart failure syndromes — emergency department evaluation using B-type natriuretic polypeptide (BNP) or NT-proBNP — Level B recommendations state that the addition of a single BNP or NT-proBNP measurement can improve the diagnostic accuracy compared to standard clinical judgment alone in patients presenting with acute dyspnea, with Level A recommendations and Level C recommendations noted as none specified. Rule-out and rule-in thresholds are provided: BNP < 100 pg/mL or NT-proBNP < 300 pg/mL makes acute heart failure syndrome unlikely (Approximate LR− = 0.1), while BNP > 500 pg/mL or NT-proBNP > 1,000 pg/mL makes it likely (Approximate LR+ = 6). In one study, using a cut point of 50 pg/mL yielded sensitivity 0.97 and specificity 0.62; at 100 pg/mL sensitivity was 90% and specificity 76%, and specificity increased up to 0.90 at 1,000 pg/mL at the expense of lower sensitivity, with an ROC AUC of 0.91. Compared with clinical evaluation alone, AUCs were 0.86 for clinical assessment, 0.90 for a single BNP, and 0.93 for the combination of clinical evaluation and BNP. Additional studies reported AUCs ranging 0.82 to 0.99 for single BNP measurements, and one rigorously defined acute severe dyspnea cohort reported an AUC of 0.87 for a single BNP measurement.

### Amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptides: testing in general populations [^116pquiA]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Screening of general populations with amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptides (NT-proBNP) holds promise for the detection of significant underlying cardiac structural and functional abnormalities, as well as for the early detection of the propensity to develop future cardiovascular events. In comparative studies to date, NT-proBNP performs at least as well as BNP in the detection of heart disease and prognostication in the general population. In some studies and subgroups, NT-proBNP appears to outperform BNP in population screening. More needs to be learned about noncardiac sources of NT-proBNP variation in "apparently well" populations. Better understanding of these factors may allow optimization of thresholds for screening of apparently well patients and concomitant delineation of patient populations in whom NT-proBNP screening is less appropriate.

### Diagnostic yield of a heart failure referral pathway using N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide [^111zKeQV]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

After their discovery in 1981, physicians envisioned that natriuretic peptides (NPs), specifically brain-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and its pro-peptide N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP), could be used to detect and monitor heart failure (HF) in the same way as hormone levels are used in endocrinology. In 1998, Cowie showed that a circulating BNP has a negative predictive value of 98% for the diagnosis of HF. This, together with other studies showing that BNP and NT-proBNP are reliable 'rule out' testsformed the basis of a class I recommendation for the use of BNP and NT-proBNP in the diagnostic pathway for HF.

A 'rule out' test is undoubtedly useful in primary care, insofar as a negative test can avoid referral for a specialist opinion and echocardiography. In secondary care HF services, the primary concern is not so much to exclude patients with HF, but to positively identify them. Unfortunately, the positive predictive value (PPV) of BNP or NT-proBNP is, at best, modest. In this context, we should consider that elevations in NP levels do not just occur in HF, but also in atrial fibrillation (AF), valvular disease, cardiomyopathies, acute coronary syndromes, myocarditis and left ventricular hypertrophy. Non-cardiac factors, which also contribute to variations in NP levels, include anaemia, renal disease, sepsis, pulmonary disease, cirrhosis and cancer chemotherapy. In healthy individuals, NP levels vary according to age, sex, body mass indexand time of day.

On the basis of personal experience of an HF service, we hypothesised that at the point of referral from primary care physicians, a raised NT-proBNP level may not be specific for HF, but a non-specific biomarker for heart disease in general. This study explores the diagnostic yield of patients referred to a specialist HF centre with suspected HF and a raised NT-proBNP. The ability of NT-proBNP to discriminate between different cardiac conditions is also assessed.

### Measuring plasma B-type natriuretic peptide in heart failure: good to go in 2004? [^117NoJgQ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Elevated plasma brain natriuretic (BNP) concentrations correlate with increased cardiac filling pressures. Therefore, increased BNP has been proposed as a marker for asymptomatic ventricular dysfunction, as an aid in the diagnosis of cardiac dyspnea, as an end point to assess the efficacy of heart failure therapy, and as a prognostic marker in heart failure. An understanding of the utility of BNP requires an appreciation of the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of BNP in each of these clinical situations. At this time, there is strong evidence for the value of BNP in the evaluation of dyspnea of uncertain cause. Further population studies will need to be performed to refine the application of BNP to community cohorts and to determine its clinical value and cost-effectiveness as a screening tool in the early diagnosis of ventricular dysfunction. To make optimal use of BNP for the assessment of heart failure therapy and prognosis in individual patients, physicians will require additional information on the biological variability of BNP. Studies comparing the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of the available BNP and N-terminal pro-BNP assays need to be conducted in each of these clinical settings.

Conclusions

In this study of an HF referral pathway based on NT-proBNP, the minority of patients had HF. Over 90% had some ECG or echocardiographic abnormality and most had either valvular disease or AF. Given this diagnostic yield, NT-proBNP may be best employed in detecting heart disease in general, rather than, specifically, HF.

Heart failure diagnosis rates

The number of new cases of HF (confirmed in primary or secondary care) increased by 25% from 13 538 in 2004 to 16 910 in 2017, with a corresponding age and sex-standardized HF incidence rate of 4.71 per 1000 person-years to 5.49 per 1000 person-years (Table 2). The majority of these new cases were not linked to an NP test in the 6 months prior to diagnosis, decreasing from 99.6% (13 484) in 2004 to 76.7% (12 978) in 2017, and of these, most did not have an NP test recorded at any time prior to diagnosis [100% (13 484) in 2004, 78.8% (10 223) in 2017].

Table 2
Crude and standardized heart failure incidence rates by year of diagnosis

Figure 4 presents the summary NP levels over the study period by test subtype. Minor fluctuations in both NT-proBNP and BNP levels were observed in the early years but were relatively constant over the past decade, with median (interquartile range) of NT-proBNP in those with HF confirmed within 6 months, of 1345 pg/mL (488–3790) in 2008 to 1206 pg/mL (486–2915) in 2017, compared to levels of those without HF confirmed over this follow-up period, ranging from 127 pg/mL (59–322) in 2008 to 124 pg/mL (57–288) in 2017 (Supplementary material online, Table S12).

The percentage of NP tests with a subsequent confirmed HF diagnosis within 6 months has remained at around 10% over the last decade (Figure 5 and Table 3). Similarly, the proportion of patients diagnosed with HF, among those above the NP thresholds recommended by UK guidelines, has not increased significantly over the period, with PPV ranging from 28.1% (95% CI 26.1–30.2) in 2008 to 29.5% (95% CI 28.6–30.3) in 2017 (Table 3).

### Natriuretic peptides: role in the diagnosis and management of heart failure: a scientific statement from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Heart Failure Society of America and Japanese heart failure society [^112fthaD]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Chronic heart failure — prognostic use and diagnostic rule-out cutoffs indicate that natriuretic peptides are recommended for use in establishing prognosis in chronic HF by major society guidelines with the highest level of evidence, and 2021 ESC Guidelines proposed that BNP < 35 pg/mL, NT-proBNP < 125 pg/mL, or MR-proANP < 40 pmol/L make a diagnosis of HF unlikely; BNP and NT-proBNP generally provide similar information but may diverge after initiating sacubitril/valsartan while both provide prognostic value during longitudinal treatment.

### Plasma amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and accuracy of heart-failure diagnosis in primary care: a randomized, controlled trial [^113N8ApM]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (N-BNP) on the diagnostic accuracy of heart failure (HF) in primary care.

Background

The accurate diagnosis of patients with suspected HF presenting in primary care is difficult. Amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide is present in high levels in cardiac dysfunction and may improve the diagnostic accuracy of HF in primary care.

Methods

The Natriuretic Peptides in the Community Study was a prospective, randomized controlled trial of the effect of N-BNP on the accuracy of HF diagnosis. Patients presenting to their general practitioner (GP) with symptoms of dyspnea and/or peripheral edema were included. The GPs formulated an initial diagnosis based on clinical assessment. All patients underwent a full cardiologic assessment that included echocardiography and N-BNP. Each patient was randomized to the BNP group (GP received the N-BNP result) or the control group (GP did not receive the N-BNP result). Patients were then reviewed by their GP, and their diagnosis was reviewed. The primary end point was the accuracy of the GPs' diagnoses compared with the panel standard.

Results

A total of 305 patients were included; mean age was 72 years, 65% were female. Seventy-seven patients met the panel criteria for HF. The diagnostic accuracy improved 21% in the BNP group and 8% in the control group (p = 0.002). The main impact of N-BNP measurement on diagnostic accuracy was the GPs' correctly ruling out HF. The number needed to diagnose by N-BNP measurement was seven patients.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates that N-BNP measurement significantly improves the diagnostic accuracy of HF by GPs over and above customary clinical review.

### Characteristics and outcomes of patients with suspected heart failure referred in line with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance [^1131LMFB]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) is a common, chronic disease causing a significant public health and financial burden. Prevalence is estimated to be 1%–2% and increasing. Despite improvements in treatment the prognosis remains poor. Late diagnosis is common and increases the burden on patients and healthcare systems further. Early diagnosis and treatment represents an opportunity to improve morbidity and reduce hospitalisation and mortality, in particular for patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction.

Natriuretic peptide measurements have been established as the single most useful simple test to identify patients with possible HF and consequently are central in international diagnostic guidelines. Exactly how natriuretic peptides are effectively incorporated into systems of care is poorly defined. For example, optimal thresholds of natriuretic peptides and waiting time targets for specialist assessment for patients with suspected HF are unclear. Furthermore, in order to be useful in practice, guidelines often oversimplify complex clinical situations. Consequently, there is a lack of consensus between guidelines for evaluating patients when there is a clinical suspicion of HF.

In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) introduced guidelines and quality standards for the management of chronic HF to improve care. Natriuretic peptides and waiting time targets are central in these guidelines. It is recommended that patients with suspected HF and raised natriuretic peptides are referred for specialist HF assessment and echocardiography. Those with very high natriuretic peptides (N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide, NTproBNP > 2000 pg/mL) should be seen within 2 weeks and those with more modest elevation (NTproBNP 400–2000 pg/mL) within 6 weeks. This waiting time-based recommendation is modelled on similar NICE referral pathways for suspected cancer and recognition that higher natriuretic peptide levels are associated with a worse prognosis. However, the natriuretic peptide thresholds and waiting time targets are arbitrary and as such this is an untested model. The population identified and associated patient outcomes using this approach have not been described but are important, both to evaluate the model and to shape future services. The aim of this study is to describe patient characteristics, HF diagnostic rates, and 1-year hospitalisation and mortality rates in a multicentre, real-world setting using this NICE model.

### Natriuretic peptide-based screening and collaborative care for heart failure: the STOP-HF randomized trial [^113spMs4]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Prevention strategies for heart failure are needed.

Objective

To determine the efficacy of a screening program using brain-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and collaborative care in an at-risk population in reducing newly diagnosed heart failure and prevalence of significant left ventricular (LV) systolic and/or diastolic dysfunction.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The St Vincent's Screening to Prevent Heart Failure Study, a parallel-group randomized trial involving 1374 participants with cardiovascular risk factors (mean age, 64.8 [SD, 10.2] years) recruited from 39 primary care practices in Ireland between January 2005 and December 2009 and followed up until December 2011 (mean follow-up, 4.2 [SD, 1.2] years).

Intervention

Patients were randomly assigned to receive usual primary care (control condition; n = 677) or screening with BNP testing (n = 697). Intervention-group participants with BNP levels of 50 pg/mL or higher underwent echocardiography and collaborative care between their primary care physician and specialist cardiovascular service.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was prevalence of asymptomatic LV dysfunction with or without newly diagnosed heart failure. Secondary end points included emergency hospitalization for arrhythmia, transient ischemic attack, stroke, myocardial infarction, peripheral or pulmonary thrombosis/embolus, or heart failure.

Results

A total of 263 patients (41.6%) in the intervention group had at least 1 BNP reading of 50 pg/mL or higher. The intervention group underwent more cardiovascular investigations (control, 496 per 1000 patient-years vs intervention, 850 per 1000 patient-years; incidence rate ratio, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.61–1.83; P < .001) and received more renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system-based therapy at follow-up (control, 49.6%; intervention, 56.5%; p = 0.01). The primary end point of LV dysfunction with or without heart failure was met in 59 (8.7%) of 677 in the control group and 37 (5.3%) of 697 in the intervention group (odds ratio [OR], 0.55; 95% CI, 0.37–0.82; p = 0.003). Asymptomatic LV dysfunction was found in 45 (6.6%) of 677 control-group patients and 30 (4.3%) of 697 intervention-group patients (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.37–0.88; p = 0.01). Heart failure occurred in 14 (2.1%) of 677 control-group patients and 7 (1.0%) of 697 intervention-group patients (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.20–1.20; p = 0.12). The incidence rates of emergency hospitalization for major cardiovascular events were 40.4 per 1000 patient-years in the control group vs 22.3 per 1000 patient-years in the intervention group (incidence rate ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.45–0.81; p = 0.002).

Conclusion and Relevance

Among patients at risk of heart failure, BNP-based screening and collaborative care reduced the combined rates of LV systolic dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction, and heart failure.

### Triage of patients with moderate to severe heart failure: who should be referred to a heart failure center? [^112RAmYJ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to evaluate simple criteria for referral of patients from the general practitioner to a heart failure (HF) center.

Background

In advanced HF, the criteria for heart transplantation, left ventricular assist device, and palliative care are well known among HF specialists, but criteria for referral to an advanced HF center have not been developed for generalists.

Methods

We assessed observed and expected all-cause mortality in 10,062 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III to IV HF and ejection fraction < 40% registered in the Swedish Heart Failure Registry between 2000 and 2013. Next, 5 pre-specified universally available risk factors were assessed as potential triggers for referral, using multivariable Cox regression: systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mm Hg; creatinine ≥ 160 μmol/l; hemoglobin ≤ 120 g/l; no renin-angiotensin system antagonist; and no beta-blocker.

Results

In NYHA functional class III to IV and age groups ≤ 65 years, 66 to 80 years, and > 80 years, there were 2,247, 4,632, and 3,183 patients, with 1-year observed versus expected survivals of 90% versus 99%, 79% versus 97%, and 61% versus 89%, respectively. In the age ≤ 80 years group, the presence of 1, 2, or 3 to 5 of these risk factors conferred an independent hazard ratio for all-cause mortality of 1.40, 2.30, and 4.07, and a 1-year survival of 79%, 60%, and 39%, respectively (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

In patients ≤ 80 years of age with NYHA functional class III to IV HF and ejection fraction < 40%, mortality is predominantly related to HF or its comorbidities. Potential heart transplantation/left ventricular assist device candidacy is suggested by ≥ 1 risk factor and potential palliative care by multiple universally available risk factors. These patients may benefit from referral to an advanced HF center.

### Natriuretic peptides: role in the diagnosis and management of heart failure: a scientific statement from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Heart Failure Society of America and Japanese heart failure society [^114dk7gf]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Ambulatory heart failure — interpretation nuances include that diagnostic performance characteristics in the ambulatory setting differ from those of the acute setting because concentrations are generally lower with greater overlap with normal values, comorbidities such as atrial fibrillation, renal dysfunction, aging, and obesity can modify levels, major clinical guideline authors recommended use of natriuretic peptide assessment in the ambulatory setting with the highest recommendation and level of evidence though proposed diagnostic cut-points differ somewhat, and patients with disproportionately low natriuretic peptide levels should be observed carefully to avoid underestimation of hemodynamic congestion and prognosis, especially those with high body mass indexes or HF with preserved EF (HFpEF).

### Natriuretic peptide level at heart failure diagnosis and risk of hospitalisation and death in england 2004–2018 [^11532iJ8]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

In total, 40 247 patients met all inclusion criteria across both databases (see online supplemental figure S2). Of these, 240 died on the same day as the recorded diagnosis of HF and were excluded from further analysis. The characteristics of the remaining 40 007 patients are given in table 1 (48% men and mean age at HF diagnosis of 78.5 years). Baseline NT-proBNP and BNP values were recorded in 27 258 and 13 529 patients, respectively, and values for both were highly skewed (online supplemental figures S2 and S3). Overall, 33.6%, 39.4% and 27.1% of patients had NT-proBNP values of < 400, 400–2000 and > 2000 pg/mL, respectively, and 26.3%, 42.1% and 31.6% of patients had BNP values of < 100, 100–400 and > 400 pg/mL, respectively.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics of patients overall, and in BNP and NT-proBNP analysis

Time between NP test and HF diagnosis

Overall, the median time between any NP test and HF diagnosis was 101 days (IQR 19–581); 97 days (IQR 19–570) for NT-proBNP and 136 days (IQR 22–729) for BNP. For patients with a moderate NT-proBNP (400–2000 pg/mL) median time from test to diagnosis was 72 days (IQR 16–398) and for a high NT-proBNP (> 2000 pg/mL) was 28 days (IQR 7–105). For BNP, the time from test to diagnosis was longer: BNP 100–400 pg/mL: 112 days (IQR 23–631) and BNP > 400 pg/ml: 41 days (IQR 9–200).

### Which patients with heart failure should receive specialist palliative care? [^114ayegY]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with heart failure (HF) have a major symptom burden, considerable impairment of quality of life (QoL) and high rates of admission, re‐admission and death. 1, 2 Palliative care (PC) is defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as an approach that improves the QoL of patients and their families facing a life‐threatening illness. 3 It seems intuitive that some or even many patients with HF would benefit from PC and several guidelines advocate use of PC, alongside usual care, in selected patients with HF. 4, 5 A recent policy statement goes further, recommending that PC is integrated into the routine care of all patients with advanced HF, with most needs managed by the usual care team. 6 Those with more challenging PC needs should have access to specialist PC (SPC) providers working in collaboration with the usual‐care team. 6 While PC is a treatment which, in principle, can be delivered by all health care professionals, SPC is provided by multi‐professional team who have undergone specialist training in PC. SPC services often include access to additional resources such as inpatient or outpatient hospice care. However, which patients should be selected is not clear and most clinicians do not find it easy to identify those who should be referred to SPC services. 7 This issue has been highlighted as requiring further research in the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Heart Failure Association position statement on PC use in HF. 8 Existing studies on this subject have many limitations. For example, most enrolled highly selected cohorts, did not follow patients over time (i.e. used one‐off assessments), or did not fully characterise the patients studied (for example by recording the severity of HF or treatment received). 9

Therefore, our goal was to develop and to test a simple and practical definition of who needs SPC in a cohort of near‐consecutive patients admitted to hospital with worsening HF. We also compared patients who actually received PC with those in need of SPC, according to our definition.

Referral of selected patients with HF from PC to cardiologists could improve adherence to GDMTs, resulting in better clinical outcome. To test this hypothesis, we assessed whether one time referral of clinically stable, high-risk HFrEF patients (with elevated NT-pro-BNP) from PCPs to cardiologist across Europe would lead to treatment optimisation. Here treatment optimisation was defined as adherence to HF treatment recommendations per ESC guidelines. In addition, data from this study were used to understand demographic, clinical and treatment characteristics of clinically stable patients with HF with elevated NT-pro-BNP levels who are managed in the PC setting across Europe.

### Clinical implications of the universal definition for the prevention and treatment of heart failure [^1165hJVx]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

4.2 Primary care physicians

Individuals with undetected HF exist and continue to grow within our communities. This is largely attributable to a high level of misdiagnosis, missed diagnoses, disparities in access to healthcare, and late presentations to healthcare providers (especially relevant during the COVID‐19 pandemic). Approximately one in six patients aged over 65 years presenting with breathlessness in primary care centres have unrecognized HF. Nearly 80% of all HF diagnoses are made following unscheduled hospitalizations despite 50% of patients having symptoms much earlier. The diagnosis of non‐acute HF in a primary care setting is notoriously difficult without echocardiography, especially in the early stages of HF. The universal definition recommends NT‐proBNP biomarker‐based screening to diagnose early stages of HF. Referrals for echocardiography may follow, as needed. Recent data from two large contemporary primary care studies of suspected HF showed that the NT‐proBNP cut‐off of 125 ng/L is diagnostically accurate in detecting new‐onset HF in a primary care setting. Primary care providers should be equipped to recognize patients in the early stages of HF (in the absence of symptoms) who need more proactive management to prevent and delay the onset of symptomatic HF in the future. How this is best achieved will need to be more fully explored from a research perspective and then articulated in expert clinical guidelines and reimbursement of coordinated activities of care.

4.3 Emergency and ambulatory care

Most patients presenting with acute HF are first evaluated and managed in emergency departments (EDs). Approximately one million annual ED visits in the United States are for acute HF, incurring nearly $39.2 billion in healthcare expenditure. Adjusting healthcare structures, systems, and processes in both ED setting and ambulatory care to promote the reach of the universal definition document will be required for effective implementation. Revision of medical record documentation will be necessary to capture the new definition, stages, and classification introduced. Accurate capture and linkage of clinical information during repeated visits will be key to understanding an individual's clinical trajectory.

Limitations

We acknowledge all the limitations of a retrospective study. However, a prospective design may have led to selection bias and may not have reflected 'real-world' clinical practice. As patients with an NT-proBNP < 400 ng/L were excluded, the ROC analyses presented herein were not designed to address the diagnostic value of NT-proBNP in primary care but rather, the diagnostic utility once referred to secondary care, after excluding patients with an NT-proBNP < 400 ng/L.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for heart failure, more specifically with respect to natriuretic peptide biomarkers, ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines recommend to obtain BNP or NT-proBNP-based screening followed by team-based care including a cardiovascular specialist, to prevent the development of LV dysfunction or new-onset HF in patients at risk of developing HF.

### Echocardiography reporting in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: Delphi consensus study [^114d2Vns]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This Delphi consensus resulted in a set of recommendations aimed at addressing significant gaps and improving healthcare services and outcomes for patients with HFpEF.

HFpEF pathways should be standardised across the UK with timely referral for specialist review and echocardiography assessment

At the policy level, there is widespread recognition of the need to improve the prioritisation of HFpEF across all levels of healthcare settings. The management of these patients is a significant problem within the UK healthcare system due to the complexity of the condition.

A standardised approach to reporting suspected HFpEF, including relevant diagnostic features, may help to minimise duplicate requests (eg, from primary and secondary care). However, it is recognised that increased availability of echocardiography services and specialists is needed to reduce waiting times, which can exceed a year in some regions. The need for a standardised approach for diagnosis and treatment was also identified in the 2023 American College of Cardiology expert consensus on HFpEF.

Services should consider the development and adoption (or incorporation into existing processes) of a referral form for specialist assessment to serve as a basic diagnostic algorithm and encourage appropriate referrals

The term 'form' here could represent an example structure for information flow to ensure collection of a minimum dataset to standardise the referral process. At its most basic, this may be in the form of a printed copy but may also be adopted into current electronic reporting systemsin use in the NHS and potential integration into AI-driven reporting algorithms supported by an evidence base.

This Delphi consensus demonstrated national agreement with NICE guidance, which outlined that diagnosing HF requires a full specialist assessment, with echocardiography being a key component.NICE guidelines recommend that echocardiography be performed within 2 weeks for patients with significantly elevated NT-proBNP levels and within 6 weeks for moderately elevated values. Results of this study demonstrate a strong awareness of these guidelines among specialists. However, there is significant variation across the UK in meeting these timelines. While some regions have urgent referral pathways, others do not, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment that negatively impact patient outcomes.

Timely referral of patients to HF specialists can reduce hospital admissions, alleviate demand on outpatient clinics, and improve patient outcomes and experience. However, patients with HF face challenges in accessing specialist services in the UK, indicating that the referral process is inconsistent. In practice, current referral forms often lack essential information and do not effectively facilitate communication between specialists. An amended referral form could include NT-proBNP, signs and symptoms of HF as a minimum data set to address these gaps.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute heart failure syndromes: approved by ACEP board of directors, June 23, 2022 [^114NWCEs]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Emergency department shortness of breath — B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) diagnostic accuracy is reported from a prospective, single-center observational study (N = 251) of consecutive emergency department patients, with final diagnosis determined by a blinded reviewer and exclusions of those without a reference standard (n = 11) or with "inconclusive" diagnoses (n = 9). Final diagnosis counts were CHF: 137; Non-CHF: 114. For BNP, cut point 100 pg/mL sensitivity 0.96 specificity 0.61; cut point 118 pg/mL sensitivity 0.95 specificity 0.64; cut point 160 pg/mL sensitivity 0.90 specificity 0.73; cut point 295 pg/mL sensitivity 0.80 specificity 0.86; AUC = 0.92. For NT-proBNP, cut point 292 pg/mL sensitivity 0.95 specificity 0.53; cut point 125 pg/mL (age < 75), 450 pg/mL (age ≥ 75) sensitivity 0.94 specificity 0.46; cut point 476 pg/mL sensitivity 0.90 specificity 0.65; cut point 825 pg/mL sensitivity 0.87 specificity 0.81; AUC = 0.90. Age and renal function had no impact on diagnostic utility of either test, and limitations included explicit criteria for CHF potentially missing isolated diastolic dysfunction and an overwhelming predominance of men (93%).

### Practical approaches to treating patients with acute decompensated heart failure [^112KzaP5]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2001). Low credibility.

Finding a simple blood test to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with congestive heart failure would have a favorable impact on the costs associated with the disease. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is synthesized in the cardiac ventricles and correlates with left ventricular pressure, amount of dyspnea, and the state of neurohormonal modulation, making this peptide the first potential "white count" for heart failure. Data indicate that serial point-of-care testing of BNP should be helpful in patients presenting to urgent care clinics with dyspnea. BNP might serve as a screen for patients referred for echocardiography. A low BNP level makes echocardiographic indices of left ventricular dysfunction (both systolic and diastolic) highly unlikely. BNP may also be effective in improving in-hospital management of patients admitted with decompensated congestive heart failure. In some cases BNP levels may obviate the need for invasive hemodynamic monitoring and, when such monitoring is used, may help tailor treatment of decompensated patients. Finally, the role of BNP in outpatient cardiac or primary care clinics may be important in the titration of therapies and assessment of the state of neurohormonal compensation of patients.

### Brain natriuretic peptide levels for ruling out heart failure… [^112vuRN9]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Can brain natriuretic peptide levels be used to rule out heart failure. Evidence-Based Answer A BNP level less than 100 pg per mL can rule out heart failure. BNP levels should be used when the pretest probability of heart failure based on overall clinical assessment is of an intermediate likelihood. 2 A BNP level less than 100 pg per mL decreased the posttest likelihood of heart failure. The Breathing Not Properly trial, a prospective study of 1, 586 patients, demonstrated that a BNP level less than 100 pg per mL can eliminate the diagnosis of heart failure in patients presenting to the emergency department with dyspnea, regardless of age, sex, or ethnicity.
3.

A meta-analysis of 30 studies assessed the diagnostic utility of BNP levels versus a reference standard of echocardiography and/or clinical findings in patients with symptoms of heart failure. BNP levels demonstrated an LR– of 0. 19, whereas the clinical risk score had an LR– of 0.
14. Clinical risk scoring is better than BNP testing for confirming heart failure. 1 The Heart Failure Society of America recommends evaluation for symptoms, signs, and cardiac abnormalities suggestive of heart failure. When the diagnosis of heart failure is uncertain, the Heart Failure Society of America recommends measuring BNP levels.

7 The European Society of Cardiology guidelines suggest that a normal BNP level in an untreated patient has a high negative predictive value and makes heart failure an unlikely cause of symptoms. 8.

### Practical algorithms for early diagnosis of heart failure and heart stress using NT-proBNP: a clinical consensus statement from the heart failure association of the ESC [^115gURyi]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnosing heart failure is often difficult due to the non-specific nature of symptoms, which can be caused by a range of medical conditions. Natriuretic peptides (NPs) have been recognized as important biomarkers for diagnosing heart failure. This document from the Heart Failure Association examines the practical uses of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in various clinical scenarios. The concentrations of NT-proBNP vary according to the patient profile and the clinical scenario, therefore values should be interpreted with caution to ensure appropriate diagnosis. Validated cut-points are provided to rule in or rule out acute heart failure in the emergency department and to diagnose de novo heart failure in the outpatient setting. We also coin the concept of 'heart stress' when NT-proBNP levels are elevated in an asymptomatic patient with risk factors for heart failure (i.e. diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease), underlying the development of cardiac dysfunction and further increased risk. We propose a simple acronym for healthcare professionals and patients, FIND-HF, which serves as a prompt to consider heart failure: Fatigue, Increased water accumulation, Natriuretic peptide testing, and Dyspnoea. Use of this acronym would enable the early diagnosis of heart failure. Overall, understanding and utilizing NT-proBNP levels will lead to earlier and more accurate diagnoses of heart failure ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.

### Diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care natriuretic peptide testing for chronic heart failure in ambulatory care: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1168Gy4U]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

An estimated 800 000 people in the UK currently have heart failure, with more than 250 000 new cases every year. Incidence increases with age and is highest in adults aged more than 75 years. The aging population and improved survival of people with ischaemic heart disease are likely to lead to a continuing increase in the prevalence of heart failure. Overall, a general practitioner with a patient population of 2000 will care for about 40–50 patients with heart failure and see two or three new cases each year.

Since heart failure may be reversible with appropriate treatment in the early stages of disease, early diagnosis is important. Considering the low prevalence of heart failure, however, general practitioners are unlikely to have enough experience to identify more subtle signs. Although heart failure is often diagnosed by general practitioners, on the basis of clinical signs, symptoms, and the results of 12 lead electrocardiography, the diagnosis is only confirmed by echocardiography in about one third of cases. Cardiologists generally perform better than general practitioners in using electrocardiography to rule out chronic heart failure (CHF); however, electrocardiography is not a reliable test to diagnose CHF because of its non-specific nature. Therefore, recent guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, and the European Society for Cardiology (ESC) on the initial diagnosis of CHF and referral for echocardiography recommend the use of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) tests in combination with clinical assessment.

BNP is a protein produced by heart muscle cells as a prohormone (proBNP) and released into the cardiovascular system in response to ventricular dilation and pressure overload. The prohormone is split by a protease and secreted as the physiologically active C terminal fragment (BNP) and the inactive N terminal fragment (NTproBNP), which has a longer half life than BNP.

No clear consensus exists about the appropriate BNP threshold for diagnosing CHF. The 2016 ESC guidelines recommend an upper limit of normal of 35 pg/mL for BNP and 125 pg/mL for NTproBNP in the non-acute setting to exclude heart failure. In the acute setting, higher values should be used (BNP < 100 pg/mL, NTproBNP < 300 pg/mL). In contrast, NICE suggests a BNP threshold of 100 pg/mL and an NTproBNP threshold of 400 pg/mL for referral of patients with suspected heart failure.

### Reference ranges for NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) and risk factors for higher NT-proBNP concentrations in a large general population cohort [^11414zcV]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Measurement of BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide) or NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) is now a cornerstone of many clinical guidelines in the diagnosis of heart failure. The recent universal definition of heart failure position paper specifies an ambulatory NT-proBNP at 125 pg/mL as a corroborating definition of heart failure when accompanied by symptoms or signs of the disease. Recently updated guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology also specify the rule out heart failure thresholds of NT-proBNP at 125 pg/mL in the nonacute setting, a threshold which is also supported by a position paper on the use of natriuretic peptides. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines specify a rule-out threshold for chronic heart failure at NT-proBNP of 400 pg/mL, with guidance to refer for echocardiography above this level. The higher threshold in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence model was chosen due to an original cost-effectiveness analysis (based on data from a diagnostic accuracy study), conducted for the guidelines.

As well as the heart failure diagnosis pathway, there is also increasing interest in using NT-proBNP in a wider range of indications and patient populations, including to predict cardiovascular disease risk in those without established heart failure, – to screen for heart failure in the general population as part of an integrated cardiovascular disease risk screening approach, and to use NT-proBNP in emerging conditions such as prognosis of COVID-19 infection. In each of these settings, higher NT-proBNP concentrations predict future heart failure onset or its complications; however, when using lower NT-proBNP cut-points (such as 125 pg/mL), it is reasonable to expect a significant overlap between those with unsuspected structural heart disease and those without obvious prevalent disease. To incorporate more widespread NT-proBNP testing into clinical practice, it is important to understand what NT-proBNP levels are typically seen in the general population across a wide range of ages. Although consensus has developed around use of an NT-proBNP cut-point of 125 pg/mL as a moderate elevation that may be clinically significant, more understanding is needed regarding factors influencing the biomarker among individuals without established cardiovascular disease.

### Diagnostic yield of a heart failure referral pathway using N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide [^114CZZpY]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the diagnostic yield of a 'high' N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in patients with suspected heart failure (HF) referred from primary to secondary care.

Methods

In this retrospective study, cardiac diagnoses were quantified in consecutive patients with an NT-proBNP > 400ng/L referred from primary care centres to a specialist HF service.

Results

Among 654 consecutive patients (age: 78.5 ± 9.72 years; 45.9% men; left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF): 55.4 ± 12.5% (mean ± SD)), the primary diagnoses were: valvular disease (39.4%), HF (29.2%; 13.3% with LVEF < 40%) and atrial fibrillation (AF; 17.3%). In terms of primary or secondary diagnoses, 68% of patients had valve disease, 46.9% had AF and 29.2% had HF. A cardiac diagnosis was made in 85.9%. In multivariable analyses, NT-proBNP predicted HF with LVEF < 40% (OR: 10.2, 95% CI: 5.63 to 18.3) and HF with any LVEF (OR: 6.13, 95%CI: 3.79 to 9.93). In canonical linear discriminant analyses, NT-proBNP correctly identified 54.5% of patients with HF. The remainder were misclassified as valvular disease, AF or no cardiac diagnosis.

Conclusion

Among patients with an NT-proBNP > 400ng/L referred through a primary care HF pathway, most patients had valve disease or AF rather than HF. NT-proBNP cannot discriminate among HF, valve disease and AF. On this basis, NT-proBNP may be best employed in detecting cardiac disease in general rather than HF per se.

### PRospective evaluation of natriuretic peptide-based reFERral of patients with chronic heart failure in primary care (PREFER): a real-world study [^111b1mmT]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

In the PREFER study, all-cause mortality rate was low (3.5%) during the 6-month follow-up. In a previous study, mortality in patients without symptoms at the clinic visit was 22% at 5 years. This was 40% in patients who were symptomatic at 5 years, which was significantly higher than for patients who had never had symptoms nor signs (4% mortality at 5 years).

Elevated NT-pro-BNP levels predict a significantly increased risk of adverse outcomesand have shown similar predictive validity on mortality and cardiovascular events as traditional outcomes in HF. Although cut-offs of NT-pro-BNP indicating an increased risk are not well defined, early treatment of high-risk patients with HF based on BNP/NT-pro-BNP testing might prevent or delay onset of HF. Whether NT-pro-BNP-based management improves outcomes in high-risk patients with stable HFrEF remains uncertain. Previous studies have shown that early treatment of those identified at high risk of HF based on BNP/NT-pro-BNP testing might prevent or delay onset of HF, suggesting that NPs have a potential for optimising HF management. However, these findings have not been consistently reported and further research is needed from more trials on NP-guided therapy.

To our knowledge, PREFER is the first study to use NT-pro-BNP in stable HFrEF patients as a clinical tool for a referral from PC to cardiologists. The rationale for the cut-off value for NT-pro-BNP (600 pg/mL) in PREFER was pragmatic, based on insights from RCTs and, specifically, the 2016 ESC HF guidelines. Even in asymptomatic patients with HF (NT-pro-BNP > 600 pg/mL), studies indicate that cardiologist referral may be beneficialand a study using BNP-guided collaborative care showed that an NP-based screening (BNP > 50 pg/mL) approach reduced the incidence of left ventricular dysfunction and HF by ~50%. However, these cut-off values are not based on any specific underlying cardiac pathophysiology and there is currently limited evidence regarding the utility of higher/lower NT-pro-BNP cut-off values (figure 6).

### Characteristics and outcomes of patients with suspected heart failure referred in line with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance [^114HP5Mt]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

The period of time studied meant patients were managed according to the 2010 NICE guidelines. These guidelines have since been simplified in 2018 such that a history of MI has been removed and all patients are simply triaged according to NTproBNP level. We only included patients with positive natriuretic peptides in our study. However, this resulted in the exclusion of < 2% of patients as most with a history of MI had NTproBNP measured regardless, so this is unlikely to have materially affected the results.

Finally, as with all retrospective data analyses involving health records, we relied on the accuracy of hospital episode statistic coding and medical records, which are relatively reliable but can at times be incomplete, unclear or inaccurate. A systematic review of UK discharge summary coding data reported a median accuracy of 90%, while the Audit Commission reports an accuracy of 87%.

### Natriuretic peptides: role in the diagnosis and management of heart failure: a scientific statement from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Heart Failure Society of America and Japanese heart failure society [^1167ZtW8]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Heart failure diagnostics and prognosis — natriuretic peptides: Natriuretic peptides play a central role in both the diagnosis of heart failure (HF) and the assessment of short- and long-term prognosis, and their plasma measurement (BNP and NT-proBNP) constitutes a marker of disease severity and a predictor of prognosis. Given HF is a clinical syndrome with recognizable signs and symptoms where additional diagnostics are valuable, abundant data support natriuretic peptides for establishing the diagnosis of HF in many clinical settings, including initial diagnosis in ambulatory patients with undifferentiated symptoms such as fatigue or dyspnea on exertion.

### N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide measurements in patients with aortic stenosis… [^1171tXMC]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Question Is a concentration of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide within the reference range or unchanged during follow-up associated with low clinical risk in patients with asymptomatic nonsevere aortic stenosis. Findings. A normal NT-proBNP level was defined as an NT-proBNP ratio less than or equal to 1 and an increased level was defined as an NT-proBNP ratio greater than 1. A relative NT-proBNP change was defined as. Adjusted NT-proBNP level was normal in 77. 0% of patients at baseline and
70. 8% of patients at year 1. Increased NT-proBNP levels were measured in
20. 5% of patients with mild AS and 37. 1% of those with moderate AS at year

1.

From baseline to year 1, patients with moderate AS had a median increase of 21% in the NT-proBNP level compared with a 10% increase in those with mild AS. Specifically, the AVE rates per 100 patient-years for normal vs increased adjusted NT-proBNP levels at year 1 were 1. 39 vs
7. 05 in mild AS, and 10. 38 vs
26. 20 in moderate AS. For patients with mild AS, a normal NT-proBNP level carries less than 5% AVE risk for at least 24 months, supporting the recommended 2- to 3-year interval for repeated echocardiography. The frequency of echocardiography may need to be individualized, however, for patients with mild AS with increased NT-proBNP levels, especially those with a 50% or greater increase during 1 year. Similar concerns relate to patients with moderate AS.

### Diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care natriuretic peptide testing for chronic heart failure in ambulatory care: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114ygKn2]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care natriuretic peptide tests in patients with chronic heart failure, with a focus on the ambulatory care setting.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sources

Ovid Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Embase, Health Technology Assessment Database, Science Citation Index, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index until 31 March 2017.

Study selection

Eligible studies evaluated point-of-care natriuretic peptide testing (B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N terminal fragment pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP)) against any relevant reference standard, including echocardiography, clinical examination, or combinations of these, in humans. Studies were excluded if reported data were insufficient to construct 2×2 tables. No language restrictions were applied.

Results

42 publications of 39 individual studies met the inclusion criteria and 40 publications of 37 studies were included in the analysis. Of the 37 studies, 30 evaluated BNP point-of-care testing and seven evaluated NTproBNP testing. 15 studies were done in ambulatory care settings in populations with a low prevalence of chronic heart failure. Five studies were done in primary care. At thresholds > 100 pg/mL, the sensitivity of BNP, measured with the point-of-care index device Triage, was generally high and was 0.95 (95% confidence interval 0.90 to 0.98) at 100 pg/mL. At thresholds < 100 pg/mL, sensitivity ranged from 0.46 to 0.97 and specificity from 0.31 to 0.98. Primary care studies that used NTproBNP testing reported a sensitivity of 0.99 (0.57 to 1.00) and specificity of 0.60 (0.44 to 0.74) at 135 pg/mL. No statistically significant difference in diagnostic accuracy was found between point-of-care BNP and NTproBNP tests.

Conclusions

Given the lack of studies in primary care, the paucity of NTproBNP data, and potential methodological limitations in these studies, large scale trials in primary care are needed to assess the role of point-of-care natriuretic peptide testing and clarify appropriate thresholds to improve care of patients with suspected or chronic heart failure.

Advanced heart failure (HF) specialist referral in HFpEF — although many individuals may not be candidates for advanced HF therapies due to advanced age or substantial comorbidities, referral from cardiovascular specialists to advanced HF specialists might be perceived as less useful; however, referral to an HF specialist can be helpful in cases of diagnostic or therapeutic uncertainty and to identify potential clinical trial candidates. Triggers for referral might include persistent or worsening symptoms, adverse clinical events such as hospitalization, or other features suggesting that the individuals are at high risk for disease progression, hospitalization, or death.

### Natriuretic peptide level at heart failure diagnosis and risk of hospitalisation and death in england 2004–2018 [^114To6SV]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) is a malignant condition affecting around a million people in the UK and has a worse prognosis than most cancers. Survival rates have not, unlike cancer, improved substantially over the last two decades. A timely diagnosis is key to receiving evidence-based treatments which can both prevent hospitalisation and improve outlook. Guidelines recommend patients with symptoms suggestive of HF (breathlessness, fatigue, ankle swelling) have a natriuretic peptide (NP) blood test in primary care to determine whether, and how quickly, a specialist diagnostic assessment is required.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England recommends echocardiography and cardiology review within 6 weeks if the NP level is raised (BNP ≥ 100 pg/mL or NT-proBNP ≥ 400 pg/mL) and within 2 weeks for those with a high NP (BNP > 400 pg/mL or NT-proBNP > 2000 pg/mL). The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) has lower thresholds for referral and specialist assessment (BNP ≥ 35 pg/mL or NT-proBNP ≥ 125 pg/mL) but does not specify a time interval. Both guidelines recommend that an alternative diagnosis should be sought for patients with a low NP level.

There is evidence of significant delays in the HF diagnostic pathway with almost 80% of patients first diagnosed on emergency hospital admission. This is distressing for patients, costly to the health service and usually denotes progression to a later stage of disease. In England, despite NICE guidance, the 2-week target for people with high NP to be seen by a specialist is not compulsory. This differs from cancer pathways where hospitals are mandated to see patients within 2 weeks of primary care referraland there is evidence that use of urgent '2-week wait' cancer referral pathways is associated with reduced mortality.

The aim of this study was to determine the risk of hospitalisation and death by NP level at time of HF diagnosis using linked routine primary and secondary care data.

### Natriuretic peptides in heart failure: should therapy be guided by BNP levels? [^112daB2p]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2010). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Testing for natriuretic peptide markers, such as B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP), has emerged as an important tool for the diagnosis and risk stratification of patients with HF. However, questions remain regarding the potential role for natriuretic peptides to guide therapy in patients with HF. In this Review, we address the underlying assumptions and the existing evidence supporting a natriuretic-peptide-guided approach to the outpatient management of HF.

### Adherence to guidelines in management of symptoms suggestive of heart failure in primary care [^1121wVLA]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Clinical guidelines on heart failure (HF) suggest timings for investigation and referral in primary care. We calculated the time for patients to achieve key elements in the recommended pathway to diagnosis of HF.

Methods

In this observational study, we used linked primary and secondary care data (Clinical Practice Research Datalink, a database of anonymised electronic records from UK general practices) between 2010 and 2013. Records were examined for presenting symptoms (breathlessness, fatigue, ankle swelling) and key elements of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence-recommended pathway to diagnosis (serum natriuretic peptide (NP) test, echocardiography, specialist referral).

Results

42 403 patients were diagnosed with HF, of whom 16597 presented in primary care with suggestive symptoms. 6464 (39%) had recorded NP or echocardiography, and 6043 (36%) specialist referral. Median time from recorded symptom(s) to investigation (NP or echocardiography) was 292days (IQR 34–844) and to referral 236days (IQR 42–721). Median time from symptom(s) to diagnosis was 972days (IQR 337–1468) and to treatment with HF-relevant medication 803days (IQR 230–1364). Factors significantly affecting timing of referral, treatment and diagnosis included patients' sex (p = 0.001), age (p < 0.001), deprivation score (p = 0.001), comorbidities (p < 0.001) and presenting symptom type (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Median times to investigation or referral of patients presenting in primary care with symptoms suggestive of HF considerably exceeded recommendations. There is a need to support clinicians in the diagnosis of HF in primary care, with improved access to investigation and specialist assessment to support timely management.

### Diagnostic yield of a heart failure referral pathway using N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide [^112fepWY]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the diagnostic yield of a 'high' N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in patients with suspected heart failure (HF) referred from primary to secondary care.

Methods

In this retrospective study, cardiac diagnoses were quantified in consecutive patients with an NT-proBNP > 400 ng/L referred from primary care centres to a specialist HF service.

Results

Among 654 consecutive patients (age: 78.5 ± 9.72 years; 45.9% men; left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF): 55.4 ± 12.5% (mean ± SD)), the primary diagnoses were: valvular disease (39.4%), HF (29.2%; 13.3% with LVEF < 40%) and atrial fibrillation (AF; 17.3%). In terms of primary or secondary diagnoses, 68% of patients had valve disease, 46.9% had AF and 29.2% had HF. A cardiac diagnosis was made in 85.9%. In multivariable analyses, NT-proBNP predicted HF with LVEF < 40% (OR: 10.2, 95% CI: 5.63 to 18.3) and HF with any LVEF (OR: 6.13, 95% CI: 3.79 to 9.93). In canonical linear discriminant analyses, NT-proBNP correctly identified 54.5% of patients with HF. The remainder were misclassified as valvular disease, AF or no cardiac diagnosis.

Conclusion

Among patients with an NT-proBNP > 400 ng/L referred through a primary care HF pathway, most patients had valve disease or AF rather than HF. NT-proBNP cannot discriminate among HF, valve disease and AF. On this basis, NT-proBNP may be best employed in detecting cardiac disease in general rather than HF per se.

Alibay et al — emergency department patients with acute dyspnea — evaluated BNP and NT-proBNP diagnostic performance for congestive heart failure (CHF) in a prospective, single-center, observational cohort (N = 160), with the criterion standard being diagnosis of CHF by 2 senior cardiologists; inclusion specified patients referred to ED with "acute dyspnea", and BNP was measured with triage (Biosite) while NT-proBNP used Elecsys 2010 (Roche). Final diagnoses were CHF: 60; Non-CHF: 100. For BNP, cut point 50 pg/mL had sensitivity 0.99 and specificity 0.31; 100 pg/mL sensitivity 0.98 and specificity 0.47; 150 pg/mL sensitivity 0.94 and specificity 0.61; 200 pg/mL sensitivity 0.87 and specificity 0.64; AUC = 0.82. For NT-proBNP, cut point 280 pg/mL had sensitivity 1.00 and specificity 0.05; 600 pg/mL sensitivity 1.00 and specificity 0.51; 1,000 pg/mL sensitivity 0.97 and specificity 0.63; 1,250 pg/mL sensitivity 0.87 and specificity 0.66; AUC = 0.84, and BNP and NT-proBNP were highly correlated (r = 0.85). Limitations/comments noted a "Convenience sample; vague inclusion criteria; lack of blinding?".

### B-type natriuretic peptide levels: a potential novel "white count" for congestive heart failure [^114skNkD]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2001). Low credibility.

Finding a simple blood test to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with congestive heart failure could have a favorable impact on the costs associated with the disease. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is synthesized in the cardiac ventricles, and its level correlates with left ventricular pressure, amount of dyspnea, and the state of neurohormonal modulation, thus making peptide the first potential "white count" for heart failure. Data indicate that serial point-of-care testing of BNP should be helpful in patients presenting to urgent care clinics with dyspnea. BNP may also serve as a screen for patients referred for echocardiography. A low BNP level makes left ventricular dysfunction (both systolic and diastolic) highly unlikely. BNP may also provide an effective means of improving in-hospital management of patients admitted with decompensated congestive heart failure. In some cases, BNP level observations may obviate the need for invasive hemodynamic monitoring and, when such monitoring is used, may help tailor treatment of the decompensated patient. Finally, the role of BNP in the outpatient cardiac or primary care clinic may be one of critical importance in titration of therapies as well as in assessing the state of neurohormonal compensation of the patient.

NT-proBNP as a test for heart disease in general

The early observation that circulating NP levels correlate inversely with cardiac outputsupported the use of NT-pro-BNP for the detection of HFrEF. However, the primary stimulus for secretion of BNP is myocardial stretchrather than reductions in cardiac output. Accordingly, many cardiac conditions, including valve disease and AF, also lead to elevations in NP levels, as we have indeed found. The fact that conditions other than HF also lead to elevations in NT-proBNP has been recognised by guideline groups. However, the diagnostic cut-offs for NT-proBNP remain unchanged at 125 ng/Lor 400 ng/L.

If an elevated NT-proBNP occurs in manifold cardiac and non-cardiac conditions, we may ask why it is used specifically in the diagnostic pathway for HF. In this respect, we found that 86% of patients referred with an NT-proBNP ≥ 400 ng/L had a cardiac diagnosis and 92% had some ECG or echocardiographic abnormality. Most patients had an identifiable cardiac 'issue', but not necessarily HF.

### Characteristics and outcomes of patients with suspected heart failure referred in line with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance [^112oZUuv]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

This is a multicentre, retrospective analysis of patients with suspected HF seen in dedicated HF clinics for specialist (HF consultant or a supervised senior HF trainee) assessment and echocardiography, in line with the contemporary NICE guidelines. Data were collected from two centres: Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust, a large district general hospital serving approximately 675 000 patients, and University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, a large university hospital serving approximately 500 000 patients.

Consecutive patients with suspected HF and raised natriuretic peptides referred from primary care and seen in a specialist HF clinic from January 2014 to December 2016 (Portsmouth) and from December 2014 to December 2016 (Southampton) were included. One-stop HF clinics involve all patients undergoing an ECG and echocardiography by a cardiographer and cardiac physiologist, respectively, and specialist assessment by a physician, during a single visit, as previously described. The data period was covered by the 2010 version of the NICE guidelines. These guidelines recommend that patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI) do not require natriuretic peptide levels and should be seen within 2 weeks. Those without a history of MI are triaged according to natriuretic peptide level. Those with NTproBNP > 2000 pg/mL should be seen within 2 weeks (2-week pathway, 2WP) and those with NTproBNP 400–2000 pg/mL within 6 weeks (6-week pathway, 6WP).

Following clinical assessment, ECG and echocardiography, a diagnosis of HF was either confirmed or excluded by a HF specialist. HF was subdivided into HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) or HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) based on accepted definitions and the clinical decision of the HF specialist. Generally, HFrEF is defined as a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40% or moderate or worse impairment of left ventricular systolic function, and HFpEF as LVEF > 40% or normal or mildly impaired left ventricular systolic function. Patients were investigated and managed in accordance with NICE and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) HF guidelines, individualised as appropriate. Patients with HFrEF routinely received ongoing follow-up from a multidisciplinary team, mainly from community HF specialist nurses supported by HF specialists. Those with HFpEF and those without HF (NHF) were usually discharged to primary care with a diagnosis and management plan where possible.

### Diurnal variations in natriuretic peptide levels: clinical implications for the diagnosis of acute heart failure [^114kHkqX]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Background:

Current guidelines recommend interpreting concentrations of NPs (natriuretic peptides) irrespective of the time of presentation to the emergency department. We hypothesized that diurnal variations in NP concentration may affect their diagnostic accuracy for acute heart failure.

Methods:

In a secondary analysis of a multicenter diagnostic study enrolling patients presenting with acute dyspnea to the emergency department and using central adjudication of the final diagnosis by 2 independent cardiologists, the diagnostic accuracy for acute heart failure of BNP (B-type NP), NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type NP), and MR-proANP (midregional pro-atrial NP) was compared among 1577 daytime presenters versus 908 evening/nighttime presenters. In a validation study, the presence of a diurnal rhythm in BNP and NT-proBNP concentrations was examined by hourly measurements in 44 stable individuals.

Results:

Among patients adjudicated to have acute heart failure, BNP, NT-proBNP, and MR-proANP concentrations were comparable among daytime versus evening/nighttime presenters (all P = nonsignificant). Contrastingly, among patients adjudicated to have other causes of dyspnea, evening/nighttime presenters had lower BNP (median, 44 [18–110] versus 74 [27–168] ng/L; P < 0.01) and NT-proBNP (median, 212 [72–581] versus 297 [102–902] ng/L; P < 0.01) concentrations versus daytime presenters. This resulted in higher diagnostic accuracy as quantified by the area under the curve of BNP and NT-proBNP among evening/nighttime presenters (0.97 [95% CI, 0.95–0.98] and 0.95 [95% CI, 0.93–0.96] versus 0.94 [95% CI, 0.92–0.95] and 0.91 [95% CI, 0.90–0.93]) among daytime presenters (both P < 0.01). These differences were not observed for MR-proANP. Diurnal variation of BNP and NT-proBNP with lower evening/nighttime concentration was confirmed in 44 stable individuals (P < 0.01).

Conclusions:

BNP and NT-proBNP, but not MR-proANP, exhibit a diurnal rhythm that results in even higher diagnostic accuracy among evening/nighttime presenters versus daytime presenters.

### Characteristics and outcomes of patients with suspected heart failure referred in line with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance [^114TFbn7]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Patient population

The study included 1271 patients referred to the specialist HF clinics: 1014 patients at Portsmouth and 257 at Southampton. Twenty-one additional patients with suspected HF and a history of MI but without NTproBNP levels were seen on the 2WP in the same time period but were not included.

Of the patients referred, 667 (53%) were seen on the 2WP and 604 (47%) on the 6WP. At Portsmouth, 91% (2WP) and 96% (6WP) of patients were offered an appointment within waiting time targets with mean waiting times of 11 ± 6 days and 36 ± 20 days, respectively. At Southampton, the equivalent data were 56% and 86% with waiting times of 20 ± 28 days and 29 ± 24 days, respectively. The baseline characteristics of the patients comparing the 2WP and 6WP groups are shown in table 1. Patients on the 2WP were slightly older than those on the 6WP and had higher rates of atrial fibrillation (AF) and previous MI (ie, many patients with a history of MI had NTproBNP checked in primary care regardless).

### Heart failure diagnosis in the general community-who, how and when? A clinical consensus statement of the heart failure association (HFA) of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) [^115t6bf6]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

A significant proportion of patients experience delays in the diagnosis of heart failure due to the non-specific signs and symptoms of the syndrome. Diagnostic tools such as measurement of natriuretic peptide concentrations are fundamentally important when screening for heart failure, yet are frequently under-utilized. This clinical consensus statement provides a diagnostic framework for general practitioners and non-cardiology community-based physicians to recognize, investigate and risk-stratify patients presenting in the community with possible heart failure.

Heart failure natriuretic peptide testing — diagnostic context and caveats indicate that a substantial evidence base supports the use of natriuretic peptide biomarkers for excluding HF as a cause of symptoms in ambulatory and emergency department settings, and in the emergency setting BNP and NT-proBNP levels have higher sensitivity than specificity and may be more useful for ruling out HF than ruling in HF; measurement in the ambulatory setting can provide incremental diagnostic value when dyspnea etiology is unclear, but obesity is associated with lower levels of BNP and NT-proBNP thereby reducing their diagnostic sensitivity.

### Amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide testing to assist the diagnostic evaluation of heart failure in symptomatic primary care patients [^1121qVSG]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

When used for the evaluation of symptomatic patients in general practice, amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) testing is highly sensitive, with an excellent negative predictive value for cost-effective exclusion of the diagnosis of heart failure (HF). Importantly (similar to other NP assays), lower values for NT-proBNP are expected among patients with HF in the primary care setting compared with patients with acute dyspnea. Among primary care patients with dyspnea, a noncardiac source of dyspnea is most likely in patients with findings below the recommended age-stratified NT-proBNP cut points. Conversely, an NT-proBNP result above the age-stratified primary care cut points does not absolutely indicate the presence of HF; a more directed cardiovascular workup is indicated.

2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA heart failure guideline — use of biomarkers for prevention, initial diagnosis, and risk stratification states the following recommendations: In patients presenting with dyspnea, measurement of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is useful to support a diagnosis or exclusion of heart failure (HF) (1 A). In patients with chronic HF, measurements of BNP or NT-proBNP levels are recommended for risk stratification (1 A). In patients hospitalized for HF, measurement of BNP or NT-proBNP levels at admission is recommended to establish prognosis (1 A). In patients at risk of developing HF, BNP or NT-proBNP–based screening followed by team-based care, including a cardiovascular specialist, can be useful to prevent the development of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction or new-onset HF (2a B-R). In patients hospitalized for HF, a predischarge BNP or NT-proBNP level can be useful to inform the trajectory of the patient and establish a postdischarge prognosis (2a B-NR).

### Characteristics and outcomes of patients with suspected heart failure referred in line with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance [^114BoqKc]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe the population, heart failure (HF) diagnosis rate, and 1-year hospitalisation and mortality of patients with suspected HF and elevated N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) investigated according to UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines.

Methods

NICE recommends patients with suspected HF, based on clinical presentation and elevated NTproBNP, are referred for specialist assessment and echocardiography. Patients should be seen within 2 weeks when NTproBNP is > 2000 pg/mL (2-week pathway: 2WP) or within 6 weeks when NTproBNP is 400–2000 pg/mL (6-week pathway: 6WP). This is a retrospective, multicentre, observational study of consecutive patients with suspected HF referred from primary care between 2014 and 2016 to dedicated secondary care HF clinics based on the NICE 2WP and 6WP. Data were obtained from hospital records and episode statistics. Mortality and hospitalisation rates were calculated 1 year from NTproBNP measurement.

Results

1271 patients (median age 80; IQR 73–85) were assessed, 680 (53%) of whom were female. 667 (53%) were referred on the 2WP and 604 (47%) on the 6WP. 698 (55%) were diagnosed with HF (369 HF with reduced ejection fraction) and 566 (45%) as not HF (NHF). 1-year mortality was 10% (n = 129) and hospitalisation was 33% (n = 413). Patients on the 2WP had higher mortality and hospitalisation rates than those on the 6WP, 14% vs 6% (p < 0.001) and 38% vs 27% (p < 0.001), respectively. All-cause mortality (11% vs 9%; p = 0.306) and hospitalisation rates (35% vs 29%; p = 0.128) did not differ between HF and NHF patients, respectively.

Conclusions

Outcomes using the NICE approach of short waiting time targets for specialist assessment of patients with suspected HF and raised NTproBNP are not known. The model identifies an elderly population a high proportion of whom have HF. Irrespective of diagnosis, patients have high rates of adverse outcomes. These contemporary real-world data provide a platform for discussions with patients and shaping HF services.

### BNP and precision medicine: tip of an iceberg [^115v9WGo]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2021). Medium credibility.

First is that the authors left unanswered the question of whether this genetic variant should somehow be taken into account when implementing a STOP-like program. Consistent with previous genetic data but paradoxic to traditional biomarker view, the patients with the favorable genotype were lower risk but had higher BNP levels. Should the BNP threshold for intervention (in this case referral to cardiology) be different based on genotype? And if so, what should it be? The authors may be able to tease this apart from the data they already have, but it is not apparent in the current report. More difficult to address are bigger questions about genetic screening. Being able to identify a low-risk genetic group would seem to make biomarker screening less useful in these patients and conversely more efficient in the higher-risk genotype group. Could genetic screening be used as a first layer of population screening, informing in which patients and how often BNP levels should be obtained?

Stretching beyond these direct questions takes us quickly into the realm of genomic population health. The current analysis of a single variant is simplistic but offers proof of concept, and a glimpse of a possible future. Although NPPB has been cited in previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of NP and blood pressure, it did not appear in the most recent and largest GWAS study of HF, which identified 12 additional loci associated with HF risk. Viewing these new STOP-HF findings in the larger genomic context makes it easy to imagine that combining the various genetic markers (for example, via polygenic risk scores) may be able improve risk-stratification even further. The single variant reported here seemed to help stratify risk within patients with Stage A/B HF; perhaps a more complete genomic assessment could identify patients at risk (and thus deserving of biomarker screening) even among those without established HF risk factors (pre-HF).

Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Natriuretic peptide–guided therapy in acute decompensated heart failure — evidence summary indicates limited benefit for target-based reduction: Results of the PRIMA II trial demonstrated that NT-proBNP–guided therapy targeting an NT-proBNP reduction of ≥ 30% did not improve 6-month clinical outcomes. Observational data reported that 37%–47% of patients did not achieve the targeted BNP reduction of 30% despite inpatient therapy for acute decompensated heart failure, and failure to reach the targeted threshold for BNP improvement was associated with significantly increased risk of mortality. In a recent study, 44% of admitted patients did not achieve the 30% target BNP threshold and were at significantly increased risk for 180-day mortality compared to patients whose BNP levels responded to treatment.

NTproBNP = N terminal fragment pro B-type natriuretic peptide; BNP = B-type natriuretic peptide; SOB = shortness of breath.

Various thresholds were used for the index tests, ranging from 5.1 to 412 pg/mL for BNP and 117 to 1000 pg/mL for NTproBNP (table 2). Thirty three studies reported data for BNP and seven for NTproBNP. Of the studies that gave diagnostic accuracy statistics at unique threshold values, the most common threshold for BNP was 100 pg/mL (15 of 33 studies) — the BNP threshold recommended by NICE and ESC (acute setting). The most common threshold for NTproBNP was 125 pg/mL (4 of 7 studies) — the threshold recommended by ESC (non-acute setting). No studies reported BNP data at 35 pg/mL — the BNP threshold recommended by ESC (non-acute setting), and none reported NTproBNP data at 300 pg/mL — the threshold recommended by ESC (acute setting). Two studies reported NTproBNP data at 400 pg/mL — the threshold recommended by NICE.

### PRospective evaluation of natriuretic peptide-based reFERral of patients with chronic heart failure in primary care (PREFER): a real-world study [^113aURee]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Study outcomes

The primary study objective was to assess whether NT-pro-BNP measurement-guided cardiologist referral of chronic HFrEF patients, otherwise considered clinically stable by their PCPs, would lead to optimisation of HFrEF treatment as recommended in ESC HF guidelines. Two levels of guideline adherence were used for the analysis (table 1). Guideline adherence was defined as prescription of HFrEF indicated drugs (level I-A) for a given patient's clinical status at a dose ≥ 50% of ESC guideline-recommended daily dose. Only pharmacotherapies with established HF disease-modifying doses based on randomised clinical trials (RCTs) in HFrEF as defined in the 2016 ESC HF guidelinesand/or with an HFrEF indication (drugs recommended for the treatment of HFrEF by the ESC guidelines) were considered relevant for the primary analysis. The cardiologist's advice was analysed within the follow-up set (online supplemental information) on cardiologist's advice). The primary outcome of adherence to ESC HF guidelines after referral to specialist was assessed at visit 2 (within 4 weeks of cardiologist's referral and no later than 6 months after the baseline visit).

Table 1
Definitions of levels of guideline adherence*

A key secondary objective of the study was to document the current PC management practice of HFrEF patients (online supplemental table S1). The HF treatment was analysed by assessing prescription rates for HF treatments derived from the patient's PC chart.

HF hospitalisation history and emergency department admissions due to HF over the 12 months before baseline were recorded. All adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) were documented.

### Prognostic value of serial B-type natriuretic peptide testing during follow-up of patients with unstable coronary artery disease… [^116vSpsZ]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Each group is labeled by the B-type natriuretic peptide levels at baseline and month 4. For example, the group with BNP higher than 80 pg/mL at both visits is labeled as "high-high" and the group with elevated BNP at baseline and BNP of 80 pg/mL or lower at follow-up is labeled as "high-low". Log-rank P values compared with those with BNP of 80 pg/mL or lower at both visits are P <. 001 for the "high-high" group; P <. 001 for the "low-high" group; and P = 0.05 for the "high-low" group. Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. There were 77 patients who had a newly elevated concentration of BNP at 4 months. Among the 2901 patients with plasma samples at 4 months and at 12 months, 173 had levels of BNP that were higher than 80 pg/mL at 4 months; of these 173 patients, 85 had levels that remained elevated at 12 months. At 12 months, 125 patients had a newly elevated concentration of BNP.

During 2 years of follow-up, there were 230 deaths and 163 cases of incident CHF. Patients with a BNP level higher than 80 pg/mL at entry to phase Z were at significantly higher risk of death or new CHF through 2 years. After adjustment for other clinical predictors, a baseline BNP level higher than 80 pg/mL was associated with a 2-fold higher long-term risk of death and death or new CHF. Patients with a persistently elevated level of BNP were at highest risk of death or new CHF. Notably, compared with patients who had BNP levels that were lower than 80 pg/mL at both visits, patients who had a BNP level lower than 80 pg/mL at baseline but presented with an elevated BNP level at 4 months had a 4-fold higher risk of death or new CHF.

### B-type natriuretic peptide-guided treatment for heart failure [^116DS9Pa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

To date, five out of seven systematic reviews with meta‐analyses have demonstrated that NP‐guided treatment reduces all‐cause mortality in patients with congestive heart failure compared with usual clinical care (Felker 2009; Li 2013; Li 2014; Porapakkham 2010; Savarese 2013), especially in patients younger than 75 years of age (Porapakkham 2010). In 2014, Troughton et al (Troughton 2014) published an individual patient meta‐analysis and Xin et al (Xin 2015) published a meta‐analysis which contradicted this finding for all‐cause mortality in all patients. Uncertainty remains as to whether the monitoring of NP may lead to more harm than benefit compared with usual care. No other review has examined heart failure mortality. Fewer reviews have examined whether NP‐guided treatment increases or reduces heart failure admissions (Li 2013; Li 2014; Savarese 2013, Troughton 2014; Xin 2015) or all‐cause hospital admissions (Porapakkham 2010; Savarese 2013; Troughton 2014; Xin 2015).

Two reviews have examined adverse events (Li 2014; Xin 2015) and no review has examined the cost of treatment. Only Xin 2015 has examined quality of life data.

Monitoring with NP is recommended by NICE only for some patients by a specialist after hospital admission or when up‐titration of medication is problematic (NICE 2010). It is not recommended by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guideline (McMurray 2012) due to uncertainty about whether it is a more effective approach than simply optimising treatment (combinations and doses of drugs, devices) according to guidelines.

In this review, we examined the seven outcomes described above and in addition included heart failure mortality, which has not been examined previously. In addition, we aimed to evaluate whether factors such as age, gender, severity of symptoms or stage of heart failure, and context of care (community or hospital) predicted whether a patient will benefit from NP monitoring, furthermore whether monitoring leads to a greater change in NP. However, only one of these pre‐specified subgroup analyses was possible due to lack of data or inconsistency in reporting for these factors. Four further subgroup analyses were considered post‐hoc: baseline LVEF, duration of follow‐up, type of control, and type of biomarker.

### Which patients with heart failure should receive specialist palliative care? [^1169uZXX]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Definition of need for specialist palliative care

We defined need for SPC as severe impairment of any PROM persisting for two or more consecutive study visits without improvement, or severe impairment of any PROM followed by death before the PROM was repeated, i.e. no improvement was reported in the PROM before death (Figure 1). Patients who missed a study assessment were assumed to have the same PROM score as previously recorded, that is, we used last observation carried forward. There was no limit on how far forward observations were carried.

Figure 1
Definition of specialist palliative care (SPC) needs: persistent impairment (≥ 2 consecutive assessments) of any patient‐reported outcome measure (PROM) without recovery, or severe impairment of any PROM without recovery preceding death. Patient 1 did not have SPC needs as there was improvement of PROM(s) whereas there was persistent impairment without improvement in patient 3. Patient 4 has SPC needs as there was severe impairment of PROM(s) preceding death, whereas patient 2 did not have severe impairment preceding death.

Natriuretic peptide testing in heart failure — guideline-directed uses and evidence are as follows: 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA states that in patients presenting with dyspnea, measurement of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is useful to support a diagnosis or exclusion of heart failure (HF) (Class I, Evidence A), in patients with chronic HF, measurements of BNP or NT-proBNP levels are recommended for risk stratification (Class I, Evidence A), and in patients hospitalized for HF, measurement of BNP or NT-proBNP levels at admission is recommended to establish prognosis (Class I, Evidence A); it also notes that in patients at risk of developing HF, BNP or NT-proBNP-based screening followed by team-based care, including a cardiovascular specialist, can be useful to prevent the development of LV dysfunction or new-onset HF (Class IIa, Evidence B-R), and in patients hospitalized for HF, a predischarge BNP or NT-proBNP level can be useful to inform the trajectory of the patient and establish a postdischarge prognosis (Class IIa, Evidence B-NR). 2021 ESC recommends that plasma concentrations of natriuretic peptides are recommended as initial diagnostic tests in patients with symptoms suggestive of HF to rule out the diagnosis, with elevated concentrations supporting a diagnosis of HF, being useful for prognostication, and potentially guiding further cardiac investigation (Class I, Evidence B). 2017 JCS/JHFS indicates use to confirm the diagnosis of HF (Class I, Evidence A), assess the severity of HF (Class I, Evidence A), assess the prognosis of HF (Class I, Evidence A), monitor the efficacy of HF treatment (Class I, Evidence B), and screen patients susceptible to HF (Class IIa, Evidence C).
