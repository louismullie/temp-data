## Question

A grain broker specializes in exotic grains for the growing organic-food market. Using his network of contacts across the globe, he is able to find sources for almost any kind of grain, grown anywhere in the world, to be shipped anywhere in the world. Last year, an organic food co-op asked the grain broker to find quinoa for them. The grain broker said, "I'll do it. It'll cost you market rate plus the commission. " The grain broker found the quinoa and had it shipped to the co-op at a cost of $15 per bushel plus a 20% commission. The co-op paid $15 per bushel plus an 8% commission. The grain broker brought suit, claiming that the appropriate commission was 20%. The grain broker introduced business records and other documentary evidence establishing that he normally charges a commission of between 10% and 20% for grains, with a higher commission for more exotic grains. The owner of the co-op called another grain broker, a competitor of the plaintiff, to testify. The witness testified that he never charges more than an 8% commission when asked to locate exotic grains for his customers. The trial judge should rule this testimony

Answer Choices:
A. admissible as evidence of customary business practices in the community.
B. admissible as a proper lay opinion.
C. inadmissible as hearsay.
D. inadmissible as irrelevant.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how the trial judge should rule on the admissibility of testimony from a competing grain broker about his usual 8% commission for exotic grains, in a dispute over whether the agreed commission was 8% or 20%. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the legal relevance of the testimony. Then, I should verify whether it constitutes hearsay. Next, I will consider whether it qualifies as lay opinion. After that, I need to check if it falls under a recognized exception for trade usage or custom. Finally, I will weigh probative value against any potential prejudice and synthesize the best answer choice with a concise rationale.

> Let me first confirm the relevance angle. The witness is offering evidence about the customary commission charged by grain brokers for exotic grains, which directly bears on what commission rate is reasonable and customary in the trade, and thus is relevant to interpreting the parties' agreement and the damages claim, so I should not jump to labeling it irrelevant without considering how custom informs contract interpretation in this context [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the hearsay concern. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted; here, the competitor's testimony is live, in-court testimony about his own business practice, not an out-of-court statement, so it is not hearsay, and I should correct my initial instinct to call it hearsay because that would be a mistake [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not conflate lay opinion with fact testimony. A lay witness may testify to facts within personal knowledge and, when appropriate, offer a lay opinion that is rationally based on perception and not based on specialized knowledge; here, the witness is testifying to his own pricing practice, which is factual and within personal knowledge, not a lay opinion, so characterizing it as lay opinion would be imprecise even though it might sound plausible at first glance [^notfound].

> I will now examine whether this fits the trade usage or custom exception. Evidence of customary business practices in a trade or industry is generally admissible to interpret ambiguous contract terms or to establish what is reasonable in the performance of a contract; the competitor's testimony about his standard 8% commission for exotic grains is exactly the kind of community practice evidence courts accept for that purpose, so it should be admitted as evidence of custom in the grain brokerage trade [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the plaintiff argues prejudice from a competitor's bias? I need to ensure we weigh probative value against any unfair prejudice; while the witness is a competitor and thus potentially biased, the testimony is highly probative to the central issue of customary commission rates, and cross-examination can mitigate bias, so the balance favors admissibility unless there is a specific evidentiary rule violation, which I do not see here [^notfound].

> Putting this together, the correct ruling is admissible as evidence of customary business practices in the community, which corresponds to option A, and the other options fail because the testimony is not hearsay, is not a lay opinion, and is clearly relevant to the dispute over the reasonable commission rate in this trade [^notfound].

---

The correct answer is **A. admissible as evidence of customary business practices in the community**. The competitor's testimony about charging no more than 8% for exotic grains is relevant to establish the **customary commission rate** in the grain brokerage industry, which can help interpret the parties' agreement and determine whether the broker's 20% demand is reasonable. This is not hearsay because it is based on the witness's personal knowledge of his own business practices, and it is not lay opinion because it reports factual conduct rather than an opinion. Options B, C, and D are incorrect because the testimony is not lay opinion, is not hearsay, and is not irrelevant.

---

## Legal relevance of the testimony

The testimony is **relevant** because it addresses the customary commission rate in the grain brokerage industry for exotic grains, which directly relates to the dispute over whether the agreed commission was 8% or 20%. Evidence of trade customs and usages is generally admissible to interpret ambiguous contract terms or to establish what is reasonable in a given industry [^notfound].

---

## Hearsay analysis

The testimony is **not hearsay** because it is based on the witness's personal knowledge of his own business practices. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, and this testimony does not fit that definition because the witness is testifying about his own conduct and pricing practices [^notfound].

---

## Lay opinion analysis

The testimony is **not lay opinion** because it reports factual conduct rather than offering an opinion. Lay opinion testimony is generally limited to opinions that are rationally based on the witness's perception and not based on specialized knowledge, such as estimating speed or identifying a person's emotional state. Here, the witness is simply stating what he charges for his services, which is a factual assertion rather than an opinion [^notfound].

---

## Admissibility under customary business practices

The testimony is **admissible as evidence of customary business practices** in the grain brokerage community. Evidence of trade customs and usages is generally admissible to interpret ambiguous contract terms or to establish what is reasonable in a given industry. In this case, the competitor's testimony helps establish the customary commission rate for exotic grains, which can inform the interpretation of the parties' agreement and the reasonableness of the broker's demand for a 20% commission [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The trial judge should rule the testimony **admissible as evidence of customary business practices in the community**. The testimony is relevant, not hearsay, and not lay opinion, and it provides valuable information about the customary commission rate in the grain brokerage industry for exotic grains. This evidence can help the court interpret the parties' agreement and determine whether the broker's demand for a 20% commission is reasonable and consistent with industry standards.

### Will increasing folic acid in fortified grain products further reduce neural tube defects without causing harm?: consideration of the evidence [^a7b965c6]. Pediatric Research (2008). Low credibility.

To reduce neural tube defects (NTDs), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandated that by January 1998 all enriched grain products should contain 140 microg of folic acid (FA)/100 g of flour. Groups concerned with optimal prevention of NTDs had argued that the level should be 350 microg/100 g. However, when it appeared that the debate might delay implementation of any fortification, these groups petitioned the FDA to implement fortification at the originally proposed level of 140 microg/100 g, anticipating that the FDA might consider increasing the level at a later time. Mandated FA fortification (FAF) has now been in place in the United States for 9 y. The impact of this important public health intervention on NTD rates, the possible benefit to other disease conditions, and potential harms have been evaluated. As background for a possible request that the FDA consider increasing FAF, evidence bearing on the question of whether an increase can further reduce NTD births without causing harm is reviewed here. The published data indicate that it is appropriate that the FDA conduct or commission a balanced analysis of the evidence by scientists who will act on that evidence to decide this important question.

### Expert witness participation in civil and criminal proceedings [^ef0ee76b]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Compensation for expert testimony—Appropriate compensation is described as being commensurate with the expertise, time, and effort required for preparing and providing responsible testimony, and written expert witness agreements often include a fee schedule for depositions and in-court testimony, a cancellation policy, out-of-pocket expenses (eg, travel costs, car rental, hotel, food, parking, etc), research, printing, postage and express packages, preparation time, the retaining counsel’s fee payment responsibility, and interest for overdue accounts. Guidance notes that asking for excessive compensation may be considered unethical and states it is unethical to charge unreasonable rates or to exaggerate the time required to prepare expert testimony, and that it is also unethical for remuneration to be contingent on the outcome of the case. Common factors in valuing expert testimony include the amount earned if the pediatrician, pediatric medical subspecialist, or pediatric surgical specialist saw patients in the office or performed surgery that day, the difficulty in preparing the case, and the dearth of appropriate experts in a specific field.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Allergenic extract is used for diagnostic testing and for the treatment (immunotherapy) of patients whose histories indicate that upon natural exposure to the allergen, they experience allergic symptoms. Confirmation is determined by skin testing. Diagnostic use of allergenic extracts usually begins with direct skin testing. This product is not intended for treatment of patients who do not manifest immediate hypersensitivity reactions to the allergenic extract following skin testing.

### Practice parameter for child and adolescent forensic evaluations [^68668d86]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2011). Medium credibility.

Child and adolescent forensic evaluation—subpoenas, court orders, and testimony obligations include that “All states require a response to a court order,” and “Some states may not require compliance with a subpoena request, but a response is always mandatory,” with failure to respond potentially leaving the professional “open to a contempt-of-court action.” “Only under a court order can a professional providing treatment testify without written permission of the parent and minor,” and if asked to testify, the treating psychiatrist “may find it useful to review any requests with an attorney” and “should inform the legal counsel of the facility because the records belong to the facility, not to the individual psychiatrist,” and “should consider retaining an attorney if there are any questions about his or her appropriate role.” Testimony requests may include “a report, affidavit, deposition, and/or court testimony,” and “A deposition is given under oath, as is court testimony,” with the subpoena clarifying whether the psychiatrist is “a fact witness or expert witness”; facts include “The clinical formulation and diagnosis, the treatment provided, and the medical record,” whereas expert testimony includes “Estimates of the patient’s prognosis or opinions on the forensic issue before the court” and is “distinct from fact.” If no forensic evaluation has been conducted, “there is no obligation to have a forensic opinion,” and in custody disputes the treating clinician is “under no obligation to form an opinion as to what custodial arrangement is in the best interests of the child,” because “A thorough custody evaluation is necessary to form an expert opinion on custody or visitation.”

### Practice parameter for child and adolescent forensic evaluations [^ff7786fd]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2011). Medium credibility.

Child and adolescent forensic evaluations—testimony preparation and conduct emphasize that the forensic evaluator should be prepared to testify in depositions and in court, and the forensic evaluator's skills improve through observing the testimony of other experts and repeated personal experiences in court; the opportunity to participate in didactic training and have practical experience in a supervisory setting is recommended. Before appearing in court or at a deposition, the evaluator should carefully review the case file, the report, and documents that have information critical to the case; it is acceptable to meet with an attorney before the deposition or court testimony, but this meeting should not change the forensic evaluator's opinion. Appropriate professional attire is necessary for court appearances, and an expert should usually direct responses to the finder of fact (i.e., the judge in a bench trial or the jury in a jury trial). All responses should be delivered verbally because the testimony is transcribed, and witnesses should not nod in response or use utterances such as “uh-huh.” Responses should be well thought out; in cross-examination, if pressured for quick responses, the evaluator should not follow this lead but rather take his or her time, and the evaluator should respond directly to the questions being asked. If asked a “yes or no” question that requires an elaborate answer, the evaluator should ask to give a detailed answer and let the court determine whether an answer can be explained further, and regardless of how many times a question is asked or how it is framed, the evaluator's response should be consistent. It is reasonable with these types of questions to respond with a “probability” or a “possibility” type of response, and when hypothetical questions are being asked, the evaluator should pause before responding to allow counsel to potentially object. Although court is an adversarial setting, the evaluator should not engage in an argument; the evaluator should listen to the question being asked, pause, think about the question, and then respond, and most forensic evaluators recommend that a witness not respond in an antagonistic or humorous manner. The evaluator should be cautious if more than one question is being asked, and the evaluator should ask that a question be repeated if it is not understood.

### Dolutegravir sodium (tivicay) [^27dc13ad]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

An observational study showed an association between TIVICAY and an increased risk of neural tube defects when TIVICAY was administered at the time of conception and in early pregnancy. As there is limited understanding of reported types of neural tube defects associated with dolutegravir use and because the date of conception may not be determined with precision, an alternative treatment to TIVICAY should be considered at the time of conception through the first trimester of pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Perform pregnancy testing before initiation of dolutegravir in adolescents and adults of childbearing potential to exclude use of dolutegravir during the first trimester of pregnancy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . Initiation of dolutegravir is not recommended in adolescents and adults actively trying to become pregnant unless there is no suitable alternative [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

Counsel adolescents and adults of childbearing potential to consistently use effective contraception [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)] .

In adolescents and adults of childbearing potential currently on dolutegravir who are actively trying to become pregnant, or if pregnancy is confirmed in the first trimester, assess the risks and benefits of continuing dolutegravir versus switching to another antiretroviral regimen and consider switching to an alternative regimen [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)] .

Dolutegravir may be considered during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy if the expected benefit justifies the potential risk to the pregnant woman and the fetus.

5.4 Risk of Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions

The concomitant use of TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD and other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.3)] :

Loss of therapeutic effect of TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD and possible development of resistance.
Possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of concomitant drugs.

For concomitant drugs for which the interaction can be mitigated, please see Table 8 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during therapy with TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD; review concomitant medications during therapy with TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drugs.

### The child witness in the courtroom [^bc824a8a]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

AAP policy recommendations—child witnesses in court—outline actions for state chapters and courts. The AAP supports the 1990 Child Victims’ and Child Witnesses’ Rights Act, the 2002 Uniform Child Witness Testimony by Alternative Methods Act, and the 2005 Attorney General guidelines. The AAP encourages state chapters to support state legislation expanding rights currently granted to sexually and physically abused witnesses to all children who have witnessed violent acts and who are testifying in court. The AAP urges state chapters to advocate that state courts do whatever is necessary, within the framework of existing state laws and resources, to prevent psychological harm to the child victim/witness as a result of participating in the judicial process. The AAP supports expanding specific statutory and judicial accommodations to support child witnesses’ well-being, and a supportive interview enhances the accuracy of a child’s testimony. Given the complexities of the legal system and the documented stresses experienced by children in the courtroom, the AAP recommends that state chapters advocate for the judicial system to appoint and pay for GALs routinely. In forensic interviews preceding a trial, the use of a validated format for interviewing, such as that of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, is strongly recommended, and the AAP recommends ensuring such measures are used appropriately in the court system. The AAP recommends the application of developmentally appropriate and scientifically effective methods; questions should be developmentally appropriate, nonambiguous, and nonthreatening, with a limited number of questions per hour, specified breaks consistent with age, and prohibition of irrelevant or demeaning questions; it is recommended that only individuals with qualifications and experience working with child witnesses be allowed to question children. The AAP recommends that confidentiality be maintained with respect to child witnesses before, during, and after any courtroom appearance, noting that publicity and loss of privacy may prolong the child’s sense of shame and stigma stemming from the abuse beyond the immediate courtroom.

### Oxymorphone hydrochloride (Opana) [^d4dab7ae]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Selection of patients for treatment with OPANA should be governed by the same principles that apply to the use of similar opioid analgesics [see Indications and Usage (1)] . Physicians should individualize treatment in every case [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)], using non-opioid analgesics, opioids on an as needed basis, combination products, and chronic opioid therapy in a progressive plan of pain management such as outlined by the World Health Organization, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the American Pain Society.

OPANA should be administered on an empty stomach, at least one hour prior to or two hours after eating [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]

2.1 Individualization of Dosage

As with any opioid drug product, it is necessary to adjust the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's prior analgesic treatment experience. In the selection of the initial dose of OPANA, attention should be given to the following:

The total daily dose, potency and specific characteristics of the opioid the patient has been taking previously;
The relative potency estimate used to calculate the equivalent oxymorphone dose needed;
The patient’s degree of opioid tolerance;
The age, general condition, and medical status of the patient;
Concurrent non-opioid analgesics and other medications;
The type and severity of the patient's pain;
The balance between pain control and adverse experiences;
Risk factors for abuse or addiction, including a prior history of abuse or addiction.

Once therapy is initiated, frequently assess pain relief and other opioid effects. Titrate dose to adequate pain relief (generally mild or no pain). Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require dosage adjustment.

If signs of excessive opioid-related adverse experiences are observed, the next dose may be reduced. Adjust dosing to obtain an appropriate balance between pain relief and opioid-related adverse experiences. If significant adverse events occur before the therapeutic goal of mild or no pain is achieved, the events should be treated aggressively. Once adverse events are adequately managed, continue upward titration to an acceptable level of pain control.

During periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration, frequent contact is recommended between physician, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family. Advise patients and family members of the potential common adverse reactions associated with changing opioid doses.

The dosing recommendations below, therefore, can only be considered as suggested approaches to what is actually a series of clinical decisions over time in the management of the pain of each individual patient.

### Phytonadione [^9333d235]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Dosing Considerations

Whenever possible, administer Phytonadione Injectable Emulsion by the subcutaneous route [see Boxed Warning]. When intravenous administration is unavoidable, inject the drug very slowly, not exceeding 1 mg per minute [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]. 

Monitor international normalized ratio (INR) regularly and as clinical conditions indicate. Use the lowest effective dose of Phytonadione Injectable Emulsion.

The coagulant effects of Phytonadione Injectable Emulsion are not immediate; improvement of INR may take 1-8 hours. Interim use of whole blood or component therapy may also be necessary if bleeding is severe.

When Phytonadione Injectable Emulsion is used to correct excessive anticoagulant-induced hypoprothrombinemia, anticoagulant therapy still being indicated, the patient is again faced with the clotting hazards existing prior to starting the anticoagulant therapy. Phytonadione Injectable Emulsion is not a clotting agent, but overzealous therapy with Phytonadione Injectable Emulsion may restore conditions which originally permitted thromboembolic phenomena. Dosage should be kept as low as possible, and INR should be checked regularly as clinical conditions indicate.

2.2 Recommended Dosage for Coagulation Disorders from Vitamin K Deficiency or Interference

The recommended dosage of Phytonadione Injectable Emulsion is based on whether the hypoprothrombinemia is anticoagulant-induced (e.g., due to coumarin or indanedione derivatives) or non-anticoagulant-induced (e.g., due to antibiotics; salicylates or other drugs; factors limiting absorption or synthesis) as follows:

Anticoagulant-Induced Hypoprothrombinemia: Phytonadione Injectable Emulsion 2.5 mg to 10 mg or more subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously. Up to 25 mg to 50 mg may be administered as a single dose.

Repeated large doses of Phytonadione Injectable Emulsion are not warranted in liver disease if the initial response is unsatisfactory. Failure to respond to Phytonadione Injectable Emulsion may indicate that the condition being treated is inherently unresponsive to Phytonadione Injectable Emulsion.

Hypoprothrombinemia Due to Other Causes (Non-Anticoagulation-Induced Hypoprothrombinemia): Phytonadione Injectable Emulsion 2.5 mg to 25 mg or more intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously. Up to 50 mg may be administered as a single dose.

Evaluate INR after 6-8 hours, and repeat dose if INR remains prolonged. Modify subsequent dosage (amount and frequency) based on the INR or clinical condition.

Income and economic losses caused by the “grain-for-green” and grazing exclusion practices

Grain and livestock prices during 1982–2019 were obtained from relevant statistical yearbooks (National Development and Reform Commission of China, 2002–2020; Department of Rural Social-Economic Survey, National Bureau of Statistics, 1983–2020). Various agricultural indices were calculated as follows: grain yield = total grain production/cultivated land area; grain income = grain production × grain price; sheep per unit area = total sheep/grassland area; meat production = meat production per sheep × total number of sheep. The meat production per sheep unit was set to ~20 kg. In addition, the calculations of sheep units per unit grassland area, meat production, and grazing income after 2011 were acquired based on the grassland areas, but the areas involved in grazing exclusion were excluded. The decreases in grain production could be directly estimated from decreases in the cultivated land area in the DPR.

### Institutionalising an evidence-informed approach to guideline development: progress and challenges at the World Health Organization [^94bb5690]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Independent evaluation and feedback by the GRC has strengthened the legitimacy of the decision-making processes underlying WHO’s recommendations

Several interviewees observed that guidelines from WHO frequently meet opposition, especially when recommendations challenge commercial interests and WHO subsequently face “strong push-back from the industry” (WHO Interviewee 13). Accordingly, many interviewees highlighted the important role of the GRC as a quality assurance mechanism for recommendations from WHO. Interviewees described the GRC to be an institutional mechanism for independent evaluation and feedback to ensure that appropriate procedures were followed. It was reported that the GRC had contributed to strengthening the legitimacy of decision-making processes underlying WHO’s recommendations. For example, two interviewees expressed:

It [the GRC] safeguards the procedural issues to say the members of the guideline development group were all vetted for conflict of interest, the meeting was done according to the procedures of the GRC, so we have that assurance. Even when we have serious challenges, letters of complaints, for example written to ethics committees, that helped us make our case on the process, but also on the technical recommendations. (WHO Interviewee 14)

As long as you have something like a GRC mechanism that screens everything in the end, where people can go and say ‘this is how we did it’, these are the members, this is the process, and so it has been done well. (WHO Interviewee 22)

WHO guideline development efforts are not yet designed to systematically make use of all relevant research evidence needed to inform decisions about complex interventions

Although WHO interviewees generally expressed support for the guideline development reforms, many interviewees argued that the guideline development process in its current form is not designed to consider the full range of evidence that can inform health systems and public health recommendations. Two major challenges were highlighted by the interviewees.

First, some interviewees expressed that research questions for systematic reviews could be formulated very narrowly such that they did not capture the broader range of evidence needed to make nuanced recommendations about health systems and public health issues. One interviewee explained:

I think that in some cases, there most probably is a tendency to pose too many peephole questions in areas where you’re not going to have the evidence, so you’re going through your systematic review and the outcome is very confusing. (WHO Interviewee 20)

Reform of drug regulation is necessary; it must be fundamental in nature, and it must come from outside the agency through new legislation.

### Recognizing that evidence is made, not born [^733ac38e]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Seppe's limitations and countervailing opportunities

We acknowledge that even if optimally implemented, SEPPE could do nothing to resolve the unavoidable, inherent uncertainties of scientific research, in which even clear answers to intelligent research questions inevitably lead to follow‐on uncertainties and questions and, moreover, the answers themselves may be disappointing. Given the considerable proportion of extensively developed products that fail due to inadequacies in evidence, however, incremental effects to tip potential failures into successes could be sizeable. Although a therapeutic product's performance outcomes cannot be guaranteed at the outset, the quality of the overall plan and individual studies to investigate that performance, should be.

Nor could SEPPE rescue extensively developed therapeutic products that demonstrate unacceptable harms and/or lack of effectiveness/value. More careful, real‐time handling at critical decision points for products that are not achieving their promise, as these become apparent with the accumulating evidence in context with the set product performance parameters, 51 however, has real potential to curtail avoidable, flawed, and inherently expensive late‐stage development. Redistributing stakeholders’ time and resources, and advancing these in the development and evaluation cycles could obtain greatest impact and highest efficiency.

Resistance to large scale change, such as SEPPE proposes, could be anticipated due to typical “human nature” implementation barriers, such as overwhelm, conflicting, and/or diverging views and expectations, challenges translating abstract principles into concrete practice, or even basic force of habit. 102 Moreover, this resistance may be magnified by the long‐term investment and commitment across all levels of organizations necessary to develop and implement SEPPE, in what is already a challenging environment replete with rapidly evolving, complex, and expensive change. A notable caveat is that decades of experience with quality approaches in other domains has made clear that “quality is a mindset that impacts everyone and that it is more than a process or programme to be implemented by workers on an assembly line…It is not enough to fix problems after we notice them—the real challenge is to catch them before they happen.” 103 In addition, we concede that SEPPE would be unachievable in situations of irretrievably entrenched cultures, where management and staff do not acknowledge the existing weaknesses; introduced quality processes only become part of the problem. 103

### Dietary carbohydrates: a review of international recommendations and the methods used to derive them [^cba036ae]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Identification and aggregation of source materials

Earlier reports such as those from EFSA in 2010 and WHO/FAO in 2003 do not provide information on the time period of evidence considered, the criteria for included/excluded studies, or the search strategies used. A systematic quality assessment of the individual studies included in these reports was not performed and the overall strength of the evidence was judged in a purely narrative way.

More recent reports have predominantly been based on a comprehensive (systematic) literature search, with most authorities using multiple databases (see Appendix 2, “search strategy”) to identify relevant original studies or systematic reviews published within a stated timeframe prior to the report publication (see Appendix 2, “time period”). These reports generally consider evidence only from intervention trials and prospective cohort studies [,–,]. (see Appendix 2, “studies included/excluded”).

The newer reports are consistently based on systematic reviews, and the WHO sugars report and UK SACN Report also commissioned their own meta-analyses.

Quality and grading assessments applied

The type of quality assessment of the individual studies included in the reports differed across authorities, ranging from a limited quality check, or use of the WHO or European Association for the Study of Obesity schemes to the use of own schemes (Table 4, 3rd column). The US scheme in particular is very comprehensive, addressing the extent to which study design and conduct were shown to be protected from systematic bias, non-systematic bias, and inferential error. The related classifications for these were “strong”, “moderate” and “limited” evidence (or “not assignable”). Qualitative descriptions developed for each of these elements leave no space for interpretation differences. Such detailed information on quality assessment is absent in other cases.

The totality of evidence for specific diet-health relationships was generally graded in accordance with the WHO scheme (convincing/probable/possible/insufficient) or similar differently worded but similar schemes, (Table 4, 4th column).

Public consultation

Most authorities presented a draft version of their report for input from the general public including professional and trade organizations, before preparing a final version (see Appendix 2, “public consultation”).

### Obscurity on obesity [^40bd3763]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Editorial

More than half of humanity suffers some serious problem with diet. In the Food & Agriculture Organization’s latest count, some 850 million are hungry. At the other end of the scale, 1.4 billion are overweight or obese. Another 2 billion-plus suffer micronutrient deficiencies.

Hunger has been part of the human condition from the beginning. So, too, in consequence, have shortages in some essential nutrients. But obesity, on a mass public health scale, is new.

Nutrition science is also relatively new, effectively a 20 th century creation. On the basics of what the human animal ought to eat, as expressed in dietary recommendations around the world, the experts are more or less agreed.

But on many specific issues there are long-running differences of view, often intense, even polemical, in character. Obesity is one area of conspicuous contention.

In part, these disputes reflect the youth of the science, in part the practical difficulties of conducting controlled research, lasting many years, on the daily routines of large numbers of free-living subjects.

The practical consequence is that the many non-nutritionists working on obesity have difficulty finding agreed, actionable conclusions from nutrition science on what to do about the problem.

Hence, it is appropriate that BMC Medicine should devote a special collection of articles to the latest obesity research. But it is also appropriate to set new findings in the context of on-going controversies. That is the purpose of this introduction.

It considers four disputed questions relevant to obesity, intentionally phrased in pragmatic terms. (1) What makes us fat? (2) How do we lose weight? (3) How much do we eat? (4) What policies should we adopt on obesity?

### It is time for consensus on' consensus statements' [^d7184f73]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Not all consensus statements are equal: beware the biases

Delphi or the ‘modified’ Delphi method are the most common forms of developing consensus. However, nominal group technique, consensus conference and the RAND-UCLA appropriateness methods are also well established.There has been little scrutiny of which consensus methods suit a specific research question. Is modified Delphi or a consensus conference the best method to agree on research definitions and does the choice of consensus method affect the outcome?

Many consensus statements were authored by a group of eminent scientists/clinicians gathering to decide what is best for the field. The statements themselves may be informed by a systematic review or may come from individuals selecting statements without oversight or feedback, leading to potentially biased questions or statements. This informal consensus, ‘consensus by people standing around a BBQ’—has been criticised as generating long form editorials—no more than ‘expert-based blockbusters’.Those who lead consensus projects must carefully consider who should be ‘in the room’—and who is notably absent. In the 2020s, patient partners are oft-forgotten—but essential—contributors to quality consensus statements.And, selection of ‘expert’ panels can exacerbate problems of equity, diversity or inclusion in a field, perpetuating an uneven social balance.

Unless consensus methods are specifically designed to highlight disagreements, methods such as the Delphi technique may introduce ‘herding bias’ via between-round feedback comparing individuals to their peers. Methods of measuring consensus may even remove outliers’ views, artificially elevating ‘agreement’ among participants.This runs the risk of suppressing important minority views.Agreement ‘at all costs’ runs the risk of producing watered-down recommendations, where groups report only their lowest common denominator, and merely reinforce the status quo.Methods and reporting guidelines that include divergent opinions should be encouraged; this allows the reader to make up their own mind on the strength of a statement.

### Upper respiratory tract Co-detection of human endemic coronaviruses and high-density pneumococcus associated with increased severity among HIV-uninfected children under 5 years old in the PERCH study [^1f68af07]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Of 3888 HIV-negative cases enrolled between 2011 and 2014 with WHO-defined severe or very severe pneumonia with available NP/OP results, 7.5% (n = 290) had endemic coronavirus detected by NP/OP PCR (2.2% NL63, 1.1% 229E, 2.8% OC43 and 1.6% HKU1) and 492 (12.6%) had HDSpn detected. CoV+/HDSpn+ was observed in 43 (1.1%) cases, CoV+/HDSpn− in 247 (6.4%), CoV−/HDSpn+ in 449 (11.5%) and 3149 (81.0%) had neither. S. pneumoniae was detected by blood culture more frequently in HDSpn+ cases and most frequently in those also CoV+: CoV+/HDSpn+ 7.1%, CoV−/HDSpn+ 4.3%, CoV+/HDSpn− 1.2% and CoV−/HDSpn− 0.3% (Table S12, Supplemental Digital Content 1,). Controls (n = 4977) had higher CoV prevalence than cases (10.0% versus 7.5%), but CoV+/HDSpn+ prevalence was similar between cases and controls (1.1% versus 0.9%) (Table 1).

### Strategies that delay market entry of generic drugs [^a8d54d00]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Increasing prescription drug expenditures in the United States are primarily driven by high brand-name drug prices. Although generic competition helps lower drug prices, manufacturers of brand-name drugs often work to delay the availability of generic versions of their products. Strategies to forestall generic competition include patenting peripheral aspects of a drug or modified formulations that do not add clinical value, paying generic manufacturers to settle lawsuits challenging the validity of patents on brand-name drugs ("reverse payment" settlements), denying generic manufacturers access to drug samples necessary for bioequivalence testing, misusing risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, and filing citizen petitions with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). To address such tactics, the federal government can interpret existing patenting standards more strictly and promote certain types of patent challenges to ensure that patents are granted or upheld only for true innovations. Congress can enact pending legislation that would help discourage reverse payment settlements and compel brand-name manufacturers to share drug samples for bioequivalence testing. Finally, the FDA can provide earlier guidance on bioequivalence determinations for complex generic products and adopt the presumption that late-filed citizen petitions should be summarily rejected.

### Food for thought [^eb5830e4]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

In a field notable for strong opinions and, often, polarised debate, a key ambition of the series is to bring together authors with a range of viewpoints and ensure a balanced approach to the evidence as far as possible. Authors have been tasked with outlining areas of consensus and uncertainty, and have been encouraged to discuss their disagreements in the text rather than come to forced compromise.

To bring the series to as wide an audience as possible we have partnered with The Swiss Re Institute to fund open access publication for the articles. The series will be launched at a meeting co-hosted by The BMJ and the Swiss Re Institute in Zurich, bringing together nutritional researchers, clinicians, and policy makers to discuss themes such as dietary fats and health, the role of bias in nutritional research, and the role of commercial food systems in promoting health.

These articles won’t of course be the last word on nutrition and health. When the science is so contested and opinions so deeply held, debates will continue, new research will be done, and knowledge will evolve. But we hope these articles achieve a new approach in bringing together different perspectives, establishing consensus where possible, spelling out uncertainty where necessary, and moving the field forward. They set out a credible future research agenda, meaningful evidence based policy actions, and clearer messages for clinicians to help improve the health of their patients and the public.

### Guidelines international network: principles for disclosure of interests and management of conflicts in guidelines [^b302df59]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Conflicts of interest (COIs) have been defined by the American Thoracic Society as "a divergence between an individual's private interests and his or her professional obligations such that an independent observer might reasonably question whether the individual's professional actions or decisions are motivated by personal gain, such as direct financial, academic advancement, clinical revenue streams, or community standing." In the context of guideline development, the concerns are not simply about identifying and disclosing direct financial or indirect COIs. Despite this recognition, the management of COIs in guidelines is often unsatisfactory. In response to requests from its international membership and informed by existing syntheses of the evidence and policies of international organizations, the Guidelines International Network Board of Trustees developed guidance on the disclosure of interests and management of COIs. Current approaches are relatively similar throughout the guideline development community, with an increasing recognition of the importance of disclosing and managing indirect COIs. Although there are differences in detail among the approaches, the similarities allow for the formulation of 9 core principles for managing COIs. In formulating these principles, the Guidelines International Network Board of Trustees recognizes that COIs cannot be totally avoided when panel members are being chosen for certain guidelines or in certain settings; thus, the important issue is the management of COIs in a fair, judicious, transparent manner.

### Recognizing that evidence is made, not born [^d52c3d8c]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Cooperative risk‐anticipating, monitoring, and corrective actions are built in all along the way

SEPPE would also set aside the limiting and expensive practice whereby, if something goes wrong with the performance of product or evidence, post hoc appraisal and potential scientific or regulatory intervention are deployed to try to save the day. Because SEPPE takes for granted that flaws and problems are bound to occur throughout, a third premise is that explicit, active, preventive and more distributed risk‐managing and risk‐communicating efforts—understanding when and why they need to be taken—must become the norm to minimize the occurrence, frequency and impact of these events. SEPPE would compel the structuring of specific, comprehensive activities in anticipation of the things that could go wrong, in the form of overtly described and well‐controlled monitoring, feedback‐and‐adjustment loops; moreover, these would be iterative in both smaller and larger frames. Key decision‐makers would, thus, be enabled to contribute to—and be comfortable with—initial development strategies and evidence designs, as well as possible continuing adaptations prompted by the evolving evidence and other contextual considerations.

In a nutshell, each participant in planning, production, and evaluation would be responsible for neither making, nor accepting, nor passing along a defect 92 (i.e. avoidable product, decision, and/or evidence problem/uncertainty). A resulting feature of SEPPE‐generated products (i.e. quality evidence and product deliverables) is that these would be explicitly acknowledged by stakeholder partners as “best quality possible”—a decided improvement over the current situation.

### Wheat and maize flour fortification: practical recommendations for national application [^462acc1f]. CDC (2008). Medium credibility.

Background—global guidance and potential impact—The World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization “published in 2006 the Guidelines on Food Fortification with Micronutrients (WHO/FAO, 2006).” Fortification of widely consumed foods “has the potential to improve nutritional status of a large proportion of the population, and neither requires changes in dietary patterns nor individual decision for compliance,” and when appropriately implemented “is an effective, simple, and inexpensive strategy” to supply vitamins and minerals. Worldwide production is substantial: “more than 600 million metric tons of wheat and maize flour are milled annually,” and current industrial-scale wheat flour fortification coverage is regionally heterogeneous: “97% in the Americas, 31% in Africa, 44% in Eastern Mediterranean, 21% in South-East Asia , 6% in Europe, and 4% in the Western Pacific regions in 2007 (FFI, 2008).”

### Companies inadvertently fund online misinformation despite consumer backlash [^c85aa5c5]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Initial gift card preferences

We then inform participants that one in five (that is, 20% of all respondents) who complete the survey will be offered a US$25 gift card from a company of their choice out of six company options. Respondents are asked to rank the six gift card companies on a scale from their first choice (most preferred) to their sixth choice (least preferred). These six companies belong to one of three categories: fast food, food delivery and ride-sharing. All six companies appeared on the misinformation websites in our sample during the past three years (2019–2021), offer items below US$25, and are commonly used throughout the USA. The order in which the six companies are presented is randomized at the respondent level. As a robustness check, we also ask respondents to assign weights to each of the six gift card options. This question gives respondents greater flexibility by allowing them to indicate the possibility of indifference (that is, equal weights) between any set of options. We then ask participants to confirm which gift card they would like to receive if they are selected to ensure they have consistent preferences regardless of how the question is asked. At this initial elicitation stage, the respondents did not know that they will get another chance to revise their choice. Hence, these choices can be thought of as capturing their revealed preference.

Information treatments

All participants in the experiment are given baseline information on misinformation and advertising. This is meant to ensure that all participants in our experiment are made aware of how we define misinformation along with examples of a few misinformation websites (including right-wing, neutral and left-wing misinformation websites), how misinformation websites are identified, and how companies advertise on misinformation websites (via an illustrative example) and use digital platforms to automate placing advertisements.

Participants are then randomized into one control and four treatment groups, in which the information treatments are all based on factual information from our data and prior research. We use an active control design to isolate the effect of providing information relevant to the practice of specific companies on people’s behaviour. Participants in the control group are given generic information based on prior research that is unrelated to advertising companies or platforms but relevant to topic of news and misinformation.

### Disclosure of interests and management of conflicts of interest in clinical guidelines and guidance statements: methods from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^f6dc7b96]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Levels of conflicts of interest—grading scheme specifies that the CGC developed a 3-tiered grading scheme to assess the seriousness of a COI, and the DOI-COI Review and Management Panel grades all potential conflicts as high-, moderate-, or low-level using the definitions outlined in subsequent sections. This scheme is based on the assumption that organizations standing to profit directly from the clinical conclusions of a guideline present the most serious threat to the CGC’s conclusions and reputation, and their inclusion adds no unique benefit.

### Guidelines for foodborne disease outbreak response. 2nd ed [^00cc8fce]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Foods associated with a processor/producer—control of source during foodborne disease outbreaks emphasizes coordinated regulatory action and criteria for market removal. Trace-back investigations can help identify contamination points and guide targeted environmental assessments, and early engagement with the processor/producer and the appropriate food-regulatory agency can help identify implicated products. When implicated foods might be in distribution, at retail establishments, or in the homes of consumers, the food-regulatory agency will take the lead on recall activities if it has adequate information to accurately identify the contaminated item. Contact the appropriate regulator with jurisdiction; the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates most foods while the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) regulates meat, poultry, and most out-of-shell egg products. Regulators may coordinate with manufacturers on recalls and may ask retailers to remove product and distributors to withhold distribution; recall at the processor level generally requires federal and/or state action, and in some jurisdictions local health jurisdictions will embargo food, and under the Food Safety Modernization Act, FDA can order the embargo of food for up to 30 days without a court order. Questions to ask in considering whether to remove food from the market include “Is risk to consumers ongoing?”, “Is the product still on the market or in the distribution system?”, and “Is the product likely to be in the homes of consumers?”, and removal is justified if there is a strong epidemiologic association between illness and consumption of the food even if the pathogen has not been isolated, OR if definitive lab results show the outbreak pathogen is present in the product based on a representative, properly handled sample to avoid cross-contamination.

### Darunavir ethanolate and cobicistat (Prezcobix) [^ed9df2ec]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hepatic Impairment

Darunavir : Darunavir is primarily metabolized by the liver. The steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of darunavir were similar after multiple dose co-administration of darunavir 600 mg co-administered with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily to participants with normal hepatic function (n=16), mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, n=8), and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B, n=8). The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of darunavir has not been evaluated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Cobicistat : Cobicistat is primarily metabolized by the liver. A trial evaluating the pharmacokinetics of cobicistat was performed in participants with moderate hepatic impairment. No clinically relevant differences in cobicistat pharmacokinetics were observed between participants with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) and healthy participants. The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of cobicistat has not been evaluated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C Virus Co-Infection

Darunavir : In participants with HIV-1 taking darunavir co-administered with ritonavir, the 48 week analysis of the data from clinical studies in participants with HIV-1 indicated that hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection status had no apparent effect on the exposure of darunavir.

The effect of hepatitis B and/or C virus infection on the pharmacokinetics of PREZCOBIX have not been evaluated.

Renal Impairment

Darunavir : Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the pharmacokinetics of darunavir were not significantly affected in participants with HIV-1 with moderate renal impairment taking darunavir co-administered with ritonavir (creatinine clearance between 30–60 mL/min, n=20). There are no pharmacokinetic data available in participants with HIV-1 with severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease taking darunavir co-adminstered with either ritonavir or cobicistat [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

Cobicistat : A trial of the pharmacokinetics of cobicistat was performed in non-HIV participants with severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min). No clinically relevant differences in cobicistat pharmacokinetics were observed between participants with severe renal impairment and healthy participants [see Use in Special Populations (8.7)].

### The Lancet Nigeria commission: investing in health and the future of the nation [^aa0f7dd4]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Health has always been a stated national policy priority for the federal government and some state governments, as evidenced by numerous statements and policies including the 1995 Health Summit, the revisions of the National Health Policy in 2004 and 2016, the Health Sector Reform Programme (2003–07), commencement of the Formal Sector Social Health Insurance Programme of the National Health Insurance Scheme in 2005, the Office of the Senior Special Assistant the President on MDGs (Millennium Development Goals)—National Health Insurance Scheme Free Maternal and Child Health programme, the Midwives Service Scheme, the Presidential Summit on universal health coverage in 2014, the enactment of the Health Act with a dedicated amount of special funds (Basic Health Care Provision Fund), the development of the National Health Financing Policy in 2016, and the development of the National Strategic Health Development Plans 1 and 2, and the SURE-P MCH programme, among other initiatives. Differing emphases and funding streams for some diseases, such as AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria,,or for select modes of care (medical compared with surgical services), have nonetheless created noticeable pathology-dependent variations in financing and access to care.

Revenue disbursement, largely from oil receipts, is extremely centralised in Nigeria. Apart from a constitutional requirement that 13% of gross oil revenue be shared among oil producing states in proportion to their production volumes, all revenues are remitted to the federal government.The remaining revenue is paid into a federation account, which also gathers revenues from corporate income taxes, custom and excise duties, and notably, value-added tax (VAT) revenue from state governments. Given the substantial share of revenues from oil in the account, the gross amount in the account fluctuates closely with exogenous changes in the export price of oil.Revenues are then shared by the federal government among the three levels of government according to a vertical and horizontal formula. State and local governments, including oil-producing states, have no control over the rate of federal allocations; the only tax revenue they directly raise and control is internally generated revenues, largely from personal income taxes and business registration and land leasing fees.States are thus heavily dependent on federal transfers for revenue; for example, between 2000 and 2016, transfers from the federal government comprised 81% of state revenues on average, with the result that political considerations often prevailed over population health needs in setting states' spending agendas.
