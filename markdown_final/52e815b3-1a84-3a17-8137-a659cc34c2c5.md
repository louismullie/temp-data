## Question

I have to give a lunch talk relevant to primary care. Can you give me a topic that has recent studies from this year?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a lunch talk topic relevant to primary care that incorporates recent studies from this year. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which 2025 sources are truly recent and high-credibility. Then, I should verify which of those are most actionable and broadly relevant to primary care. Next, I will weigh competing options like de-implementation, virtual specialist collaboration, and pediatric mental health screening. Finally, I will select the topic with the strongest balance of novelty, applicability, and evidence quality, and outline a practical talk structure with key figures and takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the most promising 2025 candidates. The BMJ Medicine systematic review and meta-analysis on de-implementation strategies in primary care is brand-new and high-credibility, showing meaningful relative risk reductions for low-value care when patient education is combined with provider-facing strategies, albeit with low-to-moderate certainty and notable heterogeneity [^4a7df8b4]. The NPJ Digital Medicine randomized trial of video-conferenced endocrinology–primary care collaboration for type 2 diabetes is also 2025 and directly addresses a common primary care pain point of specialist access and guideline uptake [^e47d320e]. The Pediatrics clinical report on universal mental health screening in primary care is 2025 and highly credible, offering a timely, implementable workflow for ages 0–18 years [^36fb228b]. I should also keep in mind the JAMA Health Forum analysis of primary care access and capabilities during and after COVID-19, which provides useful context on system-level levers like ACO participation and integrated ownership [^24d80bfe].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check which of these will resonate most with a primary care audience. De-implementation is intellectually compelling but often faces implementation barriers and variable effect sizes, so I should verify whether the certainty and scalability are sufficient for a lunch talk takeaway [^4a7df8b4]. Virtual specialist collaboration is attractive because it tackles real-world delays in diabetes care escalation and medication intensification, and the RCT design strengthens inference, though I should confirm whether outcomes extend beyond prescribing to clinical endpoints [^e47d320e]. Universal pediatric mental health screening is highly actionable, aligns with preventive care workflows, and addresses a gap many practices are already trying to close, but I should double-check feasibility and billing considerations before recommending it as a primary topic [^36fb228b].

> I will now examine the de-implementation evidence more closely. The meta-analysis reports a 16% relative risk reduction with patient education alone and 30–34% with patient education plus provider strategies, but the authors emphasize low certainty and high heterogeneity, and they caution that tailoring may not improve effectiveness and could reduce reproducibility, which matters for practice adoption [^4a7df8b4]. Wait, let me verify the practical angle: the supplemental tables list scalable interventions, which could anchor a talk, but I need to ensure I don't overstate causality given the GRADE assessment and the risk of context dependence in multifaceted bundles [^4a7df8b4].

> Next, I should review the virtual endocrinology collaboration trial. The NPJ Digital Medicine study tested structured video conferences between endocrinologists and general practices and measured clinically relevant prescribing outcomes in type 2 diabetes, which directly maps to primary care quality improvement priorities and the perennial problem of therapeutic inertia [^e47d320e]. Let me consider the audience fit: most primary care clinicians have patients waiting months for endocrinology input, so demonstrating that a virtual co-management model changes prescribing behavior is both timely and actionable, even if longer-term clinical outcomes were not yet reported in this trial [^e47d320e].

> But wait, what if the audience is more pediatric-focused or interested in preventive mental health integration? The 2025 Pediatrics clinical report recommends universal screening for mental, emotional, and behavioral problems from infancy through 18 years, with explicit guidance to screen during acute and subspecialty visits when routine supervision is missed, which is immediately implementable and addresses equity gaps in access to behavioral health identification [^36fb228b]. I should confirm feasibility issues: validated brief tools exist, but uptake depends on workflow, follow-up capacity, and coding, so I would need to pair the recommendation with practical implementation steps and local resource mapping in the talk [^36fb228b].

> Let me synthesize and choose. Given the balance of novelty, evidence quality, and direct applicability to everyday primary care, I will prioritize the virtual endocrinology collaboration RCT as the core topic, with the de-implementation meta-analysis as a supporting segment on reducing low-value care, and the pediatric mental health screening guidance as a brief, actionable add-on for practices with a pediatric panel. This triad keeps the talk anchored in 2025 evidence while offering varied, practical takeaways [^e47d320e] [^4a7df8b4] [^36fb228b].

> I should double-check the talk structure to ensure it is clinically digestible in a lunch setting. A 20–25 minute presentation could open with the problem of diabetes therapeutic inertia and delayed endocrinology access, present the RCT design and key prescribing outcomes, translate to a pragmatic implementation framework (e.g., referral triggers, scheduling, documentation), and close with a short de-implementation "bonus" on reducing low-value testing and the pediatric screening pearl for those who see children, tying each to 2025 sources for credibility [^e47d320e] [^4a7df8b4] [^36fb228b].

> Final topic recommendation: "Virtual specialist collaboration to reduce therapeutic inertia in type 2 diabetes: a 2025 randomized trial and practical implementation for primary care", with optional segments on de-implementation strategies to curb low-value care and universal pediatric mental health screening at every visit. This leverages high-quality 2025 evidence, addresses a universal primary care pain point, and provides immediately actionable steps practices can pilot, which should make for a compelling, reference-ready lunch talk [^e47d320e] [^4a7df8b4] [^36fb228b].

---

For a primary care lunch talk, the most timely and impactful topic is **de-implementation of low-value care** [^4a7df8b4], with a 2025 BMJ Medicine meta-analysis showing that patient education plus provider strategies reduces low-value use by 30–34% [^4a7df8b4]. This is highly actionable: practices can start with **top 10 low-value lists**, embed **shared decision-making**, and use **simple EMR prompts** to cut waste and harm. Alternative options include **virtual specialist collaboration** for diabetes [^e47d320e] and **universal pediatric mental health screening** [^36fb228b], but de-implementation offers the broadest, evidence-based wins for primary care right now.

## De-implementation of low-value care

### Recent evidence

The 2025 BMJ Medicine meta-analysis of 140 RCTs in primary care found that **patient education plus provider strategies** (multifaceted interventions) reduced low-value care use by 30–34% [^4a7df8b4], whereas patient education alone reduced use by 16% [^4a7df8b4]. The evidence is low-to-moderate certainty but consistent across diverse low-value practices, making it immediately applicable [^4a7df8b4].

---

### Clinical relevance

Low-value care — such as unnecessary imaging, routine labs, and overtreatment — is common and drives harm, costs, and clinician burden [^4a7df8b4]. Reducing it improves **safety, equity, and workload** without sacrificing outcomes [^4a7df8b4].

---

### Practical implementation

- **Identify targets**: Use Choosing Wisely or local "top 10" low-value lists to prioritize interventions.
- **Multifaceted approach**: Combine patient-facing education with clinician prompts, EMR alerts, and feedback [^4a7df8b4].
- **Shared decision-making**: Explain benefits, harms, and natural history to align choices with patient values [^4a7df8b4].
- **Measure impact**: Track utilization and patient-reported outcomes to sustain change [^4a7df8b4].

## Alternative topics with recent evidence

| **Topic** | **Recent evidence** | **Clinical relevance** |
|-|-|-|
| Virtual specialist collaboration for diabetes care | RCT shows improved guideline-concordant prescribing via video conferences with endocrinologists [^e47d320e] | Addresses access, inertia, and quality gaps in diabetes management |
| Universal pediatric mental health screening | AAP 2025 recommends routine MEB screening from infancy through 18 years [^36fb228b] | Early detection of mental health conditions, improving long-term outcomes |
| Hypertension management updates | ADA 2025 supports < 130/80 mmHg when tolerated, with lifestyle and pharmacotherapy guidance [^a551f52f] [^5c059b62] | Core primary care priority with updated targets and implementation details |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

De-implementation of low-value care is the **most compelling 2025 topic** for a primary care lunch talk: it is evidence-based, broadly applicable, and immediately actionable, with a 30–34% reduction in low-value use when patient and provider strategies are combined [^4a7df8b4]. If your audience is more specialized, consider virtual diabetes collaboration [^e47d320e] or pediatric mental health screening [^36fb228b]; otherwise, de-implementation will deliver the biggest system-wide impact.

For the past 30 years, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) has continuously supported primary care research, funding the first ECHO grant, pioneering patient-centered medical home models, and supporting primary care practice-based research networks. Until recently, these efforts were dispersed across AHRQ's centers and difficult to recognize as a unified portfolio of work. In 2022, the National Center for Excellence in Primary Care Research (NCEPCR) was funded to act as the home for primary care research at AHRQ. NCEPCR has recently developed a mission and vision and begun to coordinate primary care research efforts across AHRQ, curate and disseminate information and materials about primary care research, build a robust primary care research workforce, and convene key primary care partners. In the future, NCEPCR plans to continue to grow its work in each of these areas and expand its role as a national hub for primary care research.

### Effectiveness of different de-implementation strategies in primary care: systematic review and meta-analysis [^4a7df8b4]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

We found a 16% relative risk reduction for patient education only and a 30–34% relative risk reduction for patient education combined with provider education and other strategies in the use of targeted low value care. Despite the low certainty of the evidence, implementing patient education more often should be considered. At a minimum, future research should help in finding applicable evidence on patient education strategies. Current evidence does not allow strong conclusions to be drawn on the effect of different types of patient education strategies. Trials that successfully reduced low value care typically provided information on the benefits and harms of the management options as well as information on the natural course of the disease.

Although potentially having a greater effect, multifaceted interventions (ie, interventions including multiple strategies) typically had a low certainty of evidence. Firstly, the heterogeneity of the study results was high, likely explained, at least in part, by the variety of interventions and study contexts. Secondly, concerns were raised about the directness of the evidence of the multifaceted interventions. For example, a decrease in the use of low value care after educational sessions could also be dependent on the characteristics of the person delivering the intervention. The intervention might therefore not work if given by other people with different personal characteristics. Researchers and other decision makers, however, have at least two approaches to navigate these concerns: choosing effective and reproducible interventions (from the randomised controlled trials) with the highest applicability and measuring the local impact of de-implementation interventions on low value care. Online supplemental tables 1–10 provide detailed lists for choosing specific scalable interventions with the greatest potential impact. Our analysis suggested very uncertain benefits from tailoring. Therefore, tailored interventions might serve as a secondary choice, but if implemented, measuring their local impact becomes particularly important.

Strengths and limitations of this study

Our review had several strengths. Firstly, we conducted a scoping review of randomised controlled trials of de-implementation interventions to plan the systematic review and meta-analysis. Secondly, we applied a comprehensive search strategy and found 140 randomised controlled trials conducted in primary care, about twice as many as in the most comprehensive systematic review published in 2023 that included 76 trials conducted in primary care but meta-analyses were not performed. Thirdly, we conducted a duplicate assessment of study eligibility and data extraction, risk of bias, as well as categorisation of interventions according to the modified TIDieR checklist (online supplemental methods 3). Finally, we conducted a meta-analysis with appropriate statistical methodsand evaluated the certainty of the evidence according to the GRADE approach, unlike previous systematic reviews.

Primary care electronic decision support for CKD — evidence summary notes that two recent cluster randomized, pragmatic studies in primary care (ICD-Pieces and Kidney CHAMP) examined electronically augmented clinician decision support combined with either practice facilitator or multidisciplinary primary care support; neither study showed an improvement in the primary outcome (1 year hospitalization rate and rate of decline of eGFR over 17 months, respectively), both enrolled patients with significantly impaired kidney function to start (mean eGFR of stage 3a and 3b, respectively), and thus the utility of early, stand-alone EHR-based primary care decision support interventions remains unsettled.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of asthma [^0ee11e5f]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Determining recommendation strength and direction — per GRADE methodology, each recommendation's strength and direction is determined by the following four domains, with this page detailing Confidence in the quality of the evidence, Balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes, and Patient values and preferences. Confidence in the quality of the evidence reflects the quality of the evidence base and the certainty in that evidence, and in general, the strength of recommendation follows the level of evidence, but not always, as other domains may increase or decrease their strength; the evidence review assigned a rate of "High," "Moderate," "Low," or "Very Low." Balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes refers to the size of anticipated benefits and harms relative to each other; this domain is based on the understanding that most clinicians will offer patients therapeutic or preventive measures if the advantages of the intervention exceed the risks and adverse effects, and the certainty or uncertainty of the clinician about the risk-benefit balance will greatly influence the strength of the recommendation. Patient values and preferences is an overarching term that includes patients' perspectives, beliefs, expectations, and goals for health and life.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^f60c0378]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD chronic kidney disease primary care guideline — using these four domains, the Work Group determined the relative strength of each recommendation (Strong or Weak), and a Strong recommendation generally indicates High or Moderate confidence in the quality of the available evidence, a clear difference in magnitude between the benefits and harms of an intervention, similar patient values and preferences, and understood influence of other implications; a recommendation's strength does not reference its clinical importance. Using these elements, the Work Group determines the strength and direction of each recommendation and formulates the recommendation with the general corresponding text as follows: Strong for — "We recommend"; Weak for — "We suggest"; Neither for nor against — "There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against"; Weak against — "We suggest against"; Strong against — "We recommend against". This CPG's use of GRADE reflects a more rigorous application of the methodology than previous iterations; the determination of the strength of the recommendation is more directly linked to the confidence in the quality of the evidence on outcomes that are critical to clinical decision-making.

### How to measure the core functions of primary care in low-income and middle-income country settings [^72d96afc]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The core functions of primary care are first contact access, comprehensiveness, continuity, coordination and person-centredness. High-quality primary care is characterised by its ability to deliver a model of care that embodies these functions. These five core functions were included in the Primary Health Care Performance Initiative (PHCPI) framework and more recently in the WHO's Measurement Framework. Despite their centrality in these frameworks, they are rarely measured or reported on by health information systems. Measuring these core functions is particularly difficult in countries that lack electronic medical records or 'big data', as is usually the case in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Nevertheless, primary care researchers in SSA have developed the Primary Care Assessment Tool (PCAT), which in our viewpoint can be incorporated into health information systems to measure the core functions of primary care. This article presents the rationale for this analysis and elaborates on our experience of designing, developing and implementing the PCAT.

### Effect of video conferencing between primary and secondary care specialists on type 2 diabetes medication [^e47d320e]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

To match changing care demands with resources, healthcare systems increasingly focus on digitization of healthcare – and the transfer of care tasks from secondary to primary care. To support this transition in care delivery, clinicians and decision-makers recommend to develop virtual models capable of giving primary care specialists easy access to secondary care specialists –. Video conferencing is a compelling virtual model because studies suggest it holds the potential to bridge the primary-secondary care interface – and points to improvements in patient care, and diffusion of treatment knowledge and guideline advances into primary care. However, previous studies have not used randomised controlled trials to study this potential and the effect of video conferencing on clinically relevant outcomes such as the prescription of recommended medication –.

To evaluate the effect of video conferencing, we study type 2 diabetes because collaboration between secondary and primary care specialists is considered central to support the primary care sector – in providing care to the +460 million people living with type 2 diabetes –. Specifically, a 2023 US National Clinical Care Commission recommended to test virtual modes of specialist collaboration to improve diabetes care and reduce complications. Developing knowledge on this topic is important to close treatment gaps that exist because patients do not always get prescribed the recommended medication – and comorbidity makes it difficult to decide on the best diabetes care strategy. Relatedly, the pace of knowledge and treatment advancescan be challenging to diffuse into primary care –.

In the present study, we evaluated whether a structured sequence of video conferences between endocrinologists and general practitioners (along with relevant practice staff) improved levels of recommended medication among patients with type 2 diabetes seen in general practice. Our study of digital provider-provider collaboration contributes to the extensive research conducted on digital patient-provider solutions.

### Usage patterns of cognitive assessments during Medicare's annual wellness visit: a national survey [^ce73e808]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Another consideration would be to introduce a billing code for brief cognitive tests in recognition of the fact that commonly used tests, such as the Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), take ≈ 10 minutes or more to administer and score. Adding such a code would close an important gap in Medicare coverage for memory care, because the program currently pays for evaluation and care planning in patients with established cognitive impairment (CPT 99483) and for a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment (CPT 96132/96133) but not for a brief cognitive assessment to establish the need for those services.

The development of digital tests, preferably self‐administered ones, that have higher sensitivity and specificity for early‐stage cognitive impairment than the MMSE and MoCA could reduce the burden on clinicians and facilitate uptake. While multiple digital cognitive tests have been developed in recent years, they are typically designed to meet the Medicare billing requirements for the abovementioned comprehensive neuropsychological assessment rather than for a brief cognitive assessment in primary care. Billing Medicare needs to include "several domains including but not limited to; thinking, reasoning and judgment, for example, acquired knowledge, attention, language, memory, planning and problem solving and visual spatial abilities."Simpler tools that are more suitable for screening in primary care are being developedbut robust evidence for their accuracy in unselected populations remains lacking, partially because the US Food and Drug Administration currently exerts regulatory discretion for low‐risk technologies that merely provide information aid to clinicians in their diagnosis, that is, no evidence is required for market entry. Similarly, physicians' limited understanding of signs and symptoms of MCI and the differentiation from dementia warrants educational interventions.

### Developing an interprofessional collaboration for COPD patients in primary care: a participatory action research approach [^85629c24]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory disease which may significantly impact health status. To reduce symptoms and improve quality of life, pharmacological treatment should be complemented by addressing extrapulmonary traits and lifestyle- and psychosocial factors, such as physical deconditioning, decrease in muscle mass, smoking or depression. Treatment of these non-pharmacological traits is commonly conducted in a primary care setting and often requires multiple healthcare providers (HCPs). To provide complementary care, high quality interprofessional collaboration (IPC) is required. Therefore, our aim was to develop an IPC model for COPD patients treated in primary care. To achieve our aims, we used co-creation sessions (CCS), a recognised method within the participatory action research (PAR) approach. Co-creation, characterised by collaboration and a bottom-up strategy, has repeatedly shown to be suitable for developing care improvements. We recruited two independent groups of stakeholders to participate in six CCS in parallel. They were purposefully sampled and included patients and HCPs from both primary and secondary/tertiary care. Given the considerable overlap in results between the two independent teams, we developed a joint model which is ready to be pilot tested. Our model is based on current and local work methods and can be implemented in existing local contexts and structures. We noted some differences between the teams: the choice of the routing and timing of IPC commencement, and the choice for the communication platform. Using the PAR approach and co-creation, we developed an actionable IPC model in primary care for COPD patients.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^2982702f]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD chronic kidney disease guideline — determining recommendation strength and direction states that, per GRADE methodology, the system uses four domains to assess the strength of each recommendation. Domains presented on this page are Confidence in the Quality of the Evidence, Balance of Desirable and Undesirable Outcomes, and Patient Values and Preferences. Confidence in the quality of the evidence reflects the quality and certainty of the evidence and is assigned ratings of "High", "Moderate", "Low", or "Very low"; elements include whether there is high or moderate quality evidence that answers the question and the overall certainty of the evidence. The balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes considers the size of anticipated benefits and harms relative to each other, whether advantages of the intervention exceed risks and adverse effects, and the clinician's certainty about the risk‑benefit balance, with discussion questions asking if benefits outweigh harms and burden and whether desirable anticipated effects are large. Patient values and preferences include patients' perspectives, beliefs, expectations, and goals, refer to how individuals consider potential benefits, harms, costs, limitations, and inconvenience, and, in general, increase the strength of a recommendation when concordance is high and decrease it when variability is great.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^eec220e0]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — systematic evidence review general inclusion criteria — eligible evidence comprised randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or systematic reviews (SRs) of RCTs published on or September 14, 2018, through June 30, 2024, with the most recent and/or comprehensive SR selected when multiple addressed a key question (KQ). Studies had to be published in English and be full clinical studies or SRs; abstracts, letters, editorials, research protocols, and other non–full-length clinical studies were not accepted. SRs had to have searched MEDLINE or EMBASE, performed a risk of bias assessment, and assessed the quality of evidence using a recognizable rating system such as GRADE or compatible, and existing reviews were not used as evidence if their overall quality could not be assessed. RCTs must have had an independent control group, and randomized crossover trials were only included if data from the first period were reported separately and an adequate washout period was used. Minimum enrollment required at least 20 patients (10 per study group for RCTs and 20 for prospective non-randomized studies), and studies had to enroll at least 85% of patients meeting population criteria (adults aged 18 years or older with chronic kidney disease [CKD], or the population appropriate to the KQ), with inclusion allowed if a relevant CKD subgroup was reported separately when below the threshold. Applicability limited individual studies to very high Human Development Index countries with an index ≥ 0.8, with inclusion of SRs limited to those including more than half of the studies from eligible regions. Studies also had to report at least one outcome of interest.

### Changes in US primary care access and capabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic [^24d80bfe]. JAMA Health Forum (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Many of the capabilities needed to deliver accessible, high-quality primary care have been defined, but little is known about how their implementation has changed in US practices over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic or about the factors associated with greater capabilities.

Objective

To describe US primary care practices' accessibility and capabilities and examine recent changes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a retrospective cohort study across 2 surveys, in 2017 to 2018 and 2022 to 2023, among a national sample of primary care practice leaders in the US. Data were analyzed from January 2023 to September 2024.

Exposures

Degree of integrated practice ownership and accountable care organization (ACO) participation.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Differences by practice ownership and ACO participation, and changes over time in access to care and care delivery capabilities. These were measured by composite scores of responses standardized to a scale of 0 to 100.

Results

This analysis included 710 practices, of which 234 were independently owned, 105 were physician group owned, and 321 were hospital/health system owned in 2017 to 2018, and 68 practices reported no ACO participation, 107 joined between surveys, and 486 otherwise participated in ACOs. Access to care (measured as extended weekday or weekend hours) was reported to decline from the first survey in 2017 to 2018 to the second in 2022 to 2023. Hospital/health system practices and ACO participants had higher rates of extended weekday hours than their comparators in 2022 to 2023. Average capability scores increased from 51 to 54 (increase of 4 points [95% CI, 1–6 points]). There was wide variation in scores within all ownership and ACO participant or nonparticipant groups. Capability scores were higher on average for more integrated practices (for physician groups compared to independent practices, 12 points [95% CI, 5–19 points] in 2017–2018 and 12 points [95% CI, 7–16 points] in 2022–2023) and for ACO participants compared to nonparticipants (13-point difference [6 to 20] in 2017–2018 and 12-point difference [6 to 18] in 2022–2023).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, over the time period including the COVID-19 pandemic, primary care practices reported a decline in access to care, while average practice capabilities improved. Integrated practice ownership and ACO participation were both associated with better access and capability scores, suggesting that value-based payment and integrated care delivery support the development of higher-quality primary care. Variations across practices point to large opportunities for improvement overall and underscore the importance of incentives and structures as levers to improve primary care delivery.

GRADE evidence to recommendation framework specifies decision domains with associated questions and judgement categories. The balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes domain includes judgements of Benefits outweigh harms/burdens, Benefits slightly outweigh harms/burdens, Benefits and harms/burden are balanced, Harms/burden slightly outweigh benefits, and Harms/burden outweigh benefits, and considers questions such as the magnitude of anticipated desirable and undesirable outcomes and whether benefits outweigh harms/burdens. Confidence in the quality of evidence is judged as High, Moderate, Low, or Very low, guided by questions about the lowest quality among critical outcomes. Patient values and preferences are judged as Similar values, Some variation, or Large variation, with consideration of whether typical values and preferences are similar across the target population. Other implications (e.g., resource use, equity, acceptability, feasibility, subgroup considerations) are summarized under the judgement Various considerations.

### Invisible harm in patient safety: a framework and definition for preventable psychological harm in cancer care [^78f9c345]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Other recent studies have examined dignitary harmsas well as inequality, discrimination and dehumanisation in healthcare, with minorities and vulnerable groups being disproportionately affected. Traumatic healthcare experiences have been identified as indicators of harm but mostly following physical incidents and rarely systematically measured. Emotional harm, conceptualised as not being taken seriously or talked about, has also been reported in a study involving children and their caregivers in paediatric care. Especially palliative care research has examined different forms of PH such as insufficient end-of-life communication, non-patient-centred information and decision-making processes, disruption of the natural dying process and violations of patients' preferences regarding life-sustaining measures.

Currently, various terms are used to describe PH, including disrespect, dehumanisation and lack of empathy. The code 'psychological harm' is used as an outcome in the Primary Care Patient Safety (PISA) Classification System, while other authors distinguish between emotional and psychological harm in terms of severity but without detailed examples for application. Recently, progress has been made to prioritise 'emotional harm' as a primary focus within patient safety. The most cited definition centred on dignity and respect was developed by Sokol-Hessner et al. in 2015: " Emotional harms can be conceptualized as harms to a patient's 'dignity' which can be caused by a failure to demonstrate adequate 'respect' for the patient as a person ". In their subsequent work, Sokol-Hessner et al. developed a framework which explains dignitary harms as the main component of emotional harm in healthcare consisting of the following categories: care processes, contributing factors, modifying factors and consequences. What this research has in common is that the main harmful interaction involves communication errors. Until now, common concepts and definitions fail to integrate other types and sources of emotional harm. To fully represent the patient's reality of PH, it is essential to consider incidents that result from various levels within the healthcare system, including systemic and not just individual HCP factors. This highlights the need for a broader systemic definition, involving the role of the healthcare system itself.

### Very low SBP targets and the boom-and-bust cycle of benefit and adverse kidney events [^31503e45]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

The recent updates of the long-term follow-up of SPRINT pose some key questions.

First, to what extent is the long-term maintenance of SBP < 120 mmHg feasible outside a clinical trial context? The increase in SBP during post-trial follow-up may have been influenced by older SBP targets. However, SBP progressively increased, and eventually roughly 50% of participants reached a state of uncontrolled hypertension, despite the fact they and their physicians were expected to understand the survival benefits of stricter SBP control because of participation in the trial. This timeline and endpoint suggest that sustaining an SBP < 120 mmHg may not be feasible for most people outside clinical trials.

Second, what would be the impact of achieving and sustaining an SBP target of < 120 mmHg over 9 years on the risks of death and kidney failure? The current 2024 KDIGO guideline on CKD suggests that adults with high blood pressure and CKD be treated with a target SBP of < 120 mmHg, when tolerated, using standardized office BP measurement (2B). A Practice Point indicates to consider less intensive blood pressure–lowering therapy in people with frailty, high risk of falls and fractures, minimal life expectancy or symptomatic postural hypotension. By contrast, the European Society of Hypertension-European Renal Association 2023 guidelines suggested that (i) the blood pressure target for proteinuric nondiabetic CKD applies to patients with proteinuric diabetic kidney disease as well, and (ii) for both patient categories, a target SBP of < 130 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure < 80 mmHg, if well tolerated, can be associated with protection against CKD progression in individuals with an albuminuria > 30 mg/g. A similar target may be associated with a reduction in mortality in most patients with CKD. Thus, the discordance between guidelines regarding SBP targets, which is very confusing for clinicians, continues 4 years later. Still, the long-term impact of a very low target may be insignificant because it is unfeasible.

Intolerance to statin therapy — management steps include switching to a different high-intensity statin if indicated, switching to moderate- or low-intensity therapy, lowering the statin dose, or using nondaily dosing; in addition, the addition of nonstatin treatment plans to maximum tolerated statin therapy should be considered, as these are frequently associated with improved medication-taking behavior and achievement of LDL cholesterol goals.

### Promoting optimal development: screening for mental health, emotional, and behavioral problems: clinical report [^36fb228b]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

MEB screening implementation across visits and ages — primary care clinicians (PCCs) are informed that "increasingly reliable, brief tools suitable for use in primary care exist, making it possible to screen all children and adolescents from within the first year of life through 18 years of age." "Ideally, PCCs should complete screening for MEB problems at health supervision visits as recommended in Table 1." Because "studies have shown an association between increased rates of missed health supervision visits and being publicly insured or uninsured and having a higher level of social drivers of health (SDOH) that are considered barriers, such as financial hardship, housing instability, and lacking social support," and "this association suggests that some of the children most in need of MEB screening and identification of mental health needs may not be accessing routine health supervision visits and subsequently missing opportunities for early detection," "clinicians should consider MEB screening for children during acute care and/or subspecialty care visits if there are risk factors, as those discussed above, or the child presents for an urgent visit and MEB problems are suspected."

Recruitment and Retention Strategies

Session participants offered some advice on effective recruitment and retention approaches. They recommended multiple outreach methods, including social media, church fairs, free clinics, and word‐of‐mouth referrals. Participants mentioned the importance of regular community engagement and health promotion sessions for retention. According to one participant, "Retention — bringing in a speaker/teacher that is interactive like the current class (allows time for convo between each other)" (Figure 4). The importance of flexible scheduling was emphasized, with participants recommending various time slots to accommodate different work schedules.

Data Collection, Measurement, and Evaluation

Participants provided input on data collection methods, suggesting practical approaches to dietary recall and progress tracking. They recommended using journals and mobile apps for easier recording of dietary habits, although they noted potential challenges with self‐reporting accuracy. As one participant observed, "For meal questionnaire: Sending a link is nice so we can do it on our own time, but this leaves room for us 'hiding' or not being as specific as we have to be" (Figure 4) Participants also stressed the importance of measuring health outcomes beyond weight, with one noting, "Need to make sure that focus stays on health, and not weight loss" and "Debunk weight being the only health indicator."

Language and Cultural Considerations

The bilingual sessions was important for nuances in language and communication needs. Participants highlighted dialectical differences, noting that "Central American Spanish + South American Spanish are very different." They recommended utilizing multiple translators to address dialect variations and ensuring cultural competency in all program materials. The importance of language‐appropriate resources extended to educational materials, with participants requesting culturally tailored recipe cards and health information in both languages.

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^0cd0b73d]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Cardiovascular disease risk management in diabetes — risk‑based statin therapy and LDL targets state that the evidence is strong for people with diabetes aged 40–75 years, and current guidelines recommend that in people with diabetes who are at higher cardiovascular risk, especially those with one or more ASCVD risk factors, high-intensity statin therapy should be prescribed to reduce LDL cholesterol by ≥ 50% from baseline and to achieve the recommended LDL cholesterol goal of < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L). Since baseline LDL cholesterol may be difficult to ascertain in practice, a focus on an LDL cholesterol goal of < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L) rather than percent reduction in LDL cholesterol is recommended, and it may be reasonable to add ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitor to maximum tolerated statin therapy if LDL goal is not achieved; while there are no randomized controlled trials specifically assessing cardiovascular outcomes of adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors to statin therapy in primary prevention, a meta-analysis suggests that there is a cardiovascular benefit of adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors to treatment for people at high risk.

Search strategy

Systematic reviews search (Search 1)

The search for systematic reviews aimed to map the metrics and indicators used to quantify service improvements in general practice and primary care. It was conducted between 27 October and 28 November 2023. Search terms (subject headings and free-text) were grouped according to three concepts: general practice/primary care setting, metrics and indicators, and NHS England's GPIP domains. A methodological search filter to identify systematic reviews was combined with the topic search terms. No search limits were applied.

Primary research studies search (Search 2)

The second search aimed to identify primary research on quality improvement or organisational development interventions/initiatives delivered in general practice and primary care in the UK to address the GPIP improvement domains. It was conducted between 28 November and 18 December 2023. Search terms (subject headings and free-text) were grouped according to three concepts: general practice/primary care setting, metrics and indicators, and NHS England's GPIP domains. A geographical search filter to identify studies conducted in the UK was combined with the topic search terms. Searches were limited to 2013 onwards. The following websites were searched for grey literature: The Health Foundation, NHS England and The Strategy Unit. The TRIP (Turning Research into Practice) database was searched, along with the preprint server medRxiv. The search engines Google and Google Scholar were also searched using terms relating to metrics, indicators and general practice.

Sample search strategies are presented in Appendix 1 and the full set of search strategies is available as online supplemental file 1.

Study selection process

Study selection at the title and abstract stage involved dual independent selection by two reviewers from 10% of the records. Following confirmation of an acceptable level of consistency, remaining records were screened by a single reviewer. At full-text screening, studies were assessed against the inclusion criteria by two reviewers acting independently; disagreements were resolved by consensus among the review team. Included studies were filtered into those reporting the indicator/metric and those that reported use of a metric/indicator within a primary care quality improvement or organisational development initiative/intervention.

### The role of ultra-rapid-acting insulin analogs in diabetes: an expert consensus [^c32e64d7]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2025). Medium credibility.

Current Recommendations and Guidelines

The latest 2021 consensus report on the management of T1D in adults by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) mentions URAA as an alternative that is equivalent to RAA and a preferred option to short-acting (regular) human insulin. While URAA are noted to have an earlier onset and peak of action than RAA, they are not recommended in preference to RAA as they were not superior in terms of HbA1c reduction or rates of hypoglycemia in clinical trials. A similar position can be found in the ADA Standards of Care 2023 and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) Clinical Practice Guideline 2022. The International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) Clinical Practice Consensus Guidelines 2022 give stronger consideration to URAA, which are seen as potentially beneficial for use in younger individuals.

According to the Consensus Recommendations for the Use of Automated Insulin Delivery Technologies in Clinical Practice 2023, RAA continue to be the recommended insulins for automated insulin delivery (AID) systems because of their proven compatibility with most pump technologies. URAA are stated to be at most modestly beneficial or noninferior to RAA in these systems. However, it is noted that URAA may be beneficial for certain individuals, such as those who prefer to administer the bolus immediately before a meal rather than 15 minutes before onset of the meal.

Regarding T2D, URAA are currently not explicitly addressed in guidelines and recommendations by medical societies such as the ADA and EASD in their current 2022 Consensus Report on Management of Hyperglycemia in Type 2 Diabetes.

### Association of patient, physician and visit characteristics with inappropriate antibiotic prescribing in Japanese primary care: a cross-sectional study [^d847420c]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

In our study, inappropriate antibiotic prescribing was less common during after hours care than during regular hours. After hours care may have a higher proportion of patients with urgent conditions requiring antibiotic prescriptions than regular hours care. Studies in some European countries note that inappropriate antibiotic prescribing is more common in after hours primary care, although these studies only focused on specific conditions, whereas our study focused on all conditions.

Approximately one in seven antibiotic prescriptions in this study was not associated with any recent diagnosis codes. These prescriptions may represent instances in which physicians failed to assign a relevant diagnosis code or reused previously assigned diagnosis codes without updating the start date of these codes. As an example of the latter scenario, if a physician diagnoses acute otitis media on 1 May 2023 without prescribing antibiotics but later prescribes antibiotics at the second visit on 8 May 2023 without updating the start date of the acute otitis media diagnosis, the antibiotic prescription would be labelled as 'not associated with a recent diagnosis' when using the 3-day look back period. In sensitivity analyses using a longer look-back period, the prevalence of antibiotic prescriptions not associated with a recent diagnosis decreased, potentially supporting the possibility that physicians were not appropriately updating the start dates of previously assigned diagnosis codes. Findings suggest that efforts to improve coding quality should be included in Japanese antibiotic stewardship initiatives.

### Development of the European Society of Hypertension guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension: comparison of the helpfulness of ESH 2013, 2018, and 2023 guidelines [^c918b3d5]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The European Society of Hypertension (ESH) published several guidelines (GLs) for the management of arterial hypertension in recent years to help physicians and patients make decisions in particular disease conditions. The last one was published in 2023, the ESH 2023 guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension.

The year 2023 marks the 20th anniversary of the hypertension guidelines of the ESH, which were published for the first time in 2003. It is evident that guidelines – based on past collected knowledge – are important regarding diagnosis and treatment, to prevent or delay the adverse effects of hypertension.

Several studies conducted in the past few decades have shown that clinical practice guidelines, for the management of cardiovascular diseases, include a small percentage, less than 15%, of the recommendations which are supported by Level A evidence, meaning that multiple randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses providing the highest level of evidence are not present. Furthermore, these studies also have demonstrated a steady temporal trend or small increase in Level A evidence. Based on a recent study comparing 50 clinical practice guidelines from 2011 to 2022, 16% of the recommendations were supported by the highest quality of evidence, Level A, at the same time, there was a slight global increase in Level A in recent years.

There are no systematic methods to measure quantitatively the helpfulness or quality of GLs, that is, how much help they provide to the physicians. Moreover, previous assessments/methods also pose several questions. Whether the previous analysis could provide an objective 'result' on the helpfulness of a GL, for example, based on: the frequency of recommendations and evidence, the frequency of evidence at each class of recommendation (Level by Class), or vice versa the frequency of recommendations in each level of evidence (Class by Level)? These questions underline the need to further develop the methods of assessing GLs, which can be improved by including implementation advice and translating scientific Evidence into Recommendations.

The ESH 2023 guideline was a further development of the 2018 guideline, in terms of structure and function, covering more than 40 new aspects in detail. In addition, several new clinical trials were completed in recent years, thus we have hypothesized that the 2023 guideline will provide greater help to clinicians in the diagnosis and management of hypertension. We also hypothesized that our method provides an objective assessment of the usefulness of a guideline, as a kind of 'quality control', and allows comparison of various medical guidelines.

### Training DAFNEplus facilitators in novel behaviour change approaches: a template for training design and delivery [^603d7063]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

8 TRAINING CONTENT EXAMPLES

8.1 Clinical learning

In the self‐directed learning modules, all the clinical changes between standard DAFNE and DAFNE plus were described. This included simplified BG targets, simplified hypoglycaemia treatment advice, more emphasis on background insulin assessment and carb‐free meals in a day, carb counting in CPs or grams, aiming for 70% of BG readings within the target range and less emphasis on medical aspects of the annual review and more on positive long‐term health promotion.

In the live workshop, to bring these revisions to life and be more memorable, trainees were asked to look at specific sections of the curriculum and complete a 'spot the differences' worksheet within small groups. As well as changes in clinical guidance, trainees were directed to notice language changes, timetable changes and what previous content had been moved to e‐learning. Trainees then observed the Trainers (CG/CF) role‐play delivering the novel sessions/activities/tools based on these revisions and trainees were asked to make observation notes on what they had learnt (see Figure 2).

FIGURE 2
Training in novel clinical features.

8.2 Technology learning

In the live workshop, trainees were taught to layer the learning regarding the new technology. Skills were broken down across the weeks, with a focus on mastering one area before moving on to the next as shown in Figure 3. This model also became a framework to return to in supervision to encourage pacing of the behavioural goals around technology.

FIGURE 3
Training in novel technology features #1.

To increase familiarity with the new technology, including the website, trainees were provided with a checklist they could work through and assess their level of confidence (see Figure 4). This was part of the self‐directed learning. In the live workshop, this was developed further by role‐playing (in small groups) the technology‐related parts of the curriculum. For example, demonstrating the bolus calculator or showing features of the data tracker on the website.

FIGURE 4
Training in novel technology features #2.

To familiarise trainees with the more fun elements of the website, they were encouraged to play the 'carb challenge' game against each other in small teams. This was a novel feature of the website that involved looking at a photo of a meal and trying to guess the carb content. This game was repeated at the start of each training day to both increase familiarity with the website and encourage some light‐hearted interaction. This mirrored the delivery of the carb challenge game in the participant group course.

Current Guidelines and Evidence

The American Diabetes Association (ADA), European Society of Cardiology (ESC), European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) have developed comprehensive guidelines for managing CKM conditions, with a focus on integrated care.

The 2023 ESC Guidelines for managing CVD in patients with diabetes recommend glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) as first-line therapies for diabetes with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), shown to significantly reduce cardiovascular risk independently of glucose control. SGLT2is are strongly recommended for all patients with diabetes and HF, irrespective of left ventricular ejection fraction. For DKD, both SGLT2is and finerenone are recommended to reduce cardiovascular and kidney failure risk alongside standard treatments like RAAS inhibitors and lipid lowering therapies. The ADA 2024 Standards of Care similarly recommend SGLT2i for diabetes-related HF and CKD. These guidelines advocate for early CVD screening in patients with diabetes and a holistic approach, including lifestyle changes such as the Mediterranean diet and physical activity. Furthermore, the ADA and EASD joint recommendations on managing hyperglycaemia in T2D emphasise the use of GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2is as foundational therapies in patients with ASCVD. The ADA/KDIGO 2022 consensus similarly recommends a comprehensive strategy for diabetes in CKD, including SGLT2is, GLP-1 RAs, statins, lifestyle modifications and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers for hypertension and albuminuria.

While there is broad consensus on SGLT2is and GLP-1 RAs for CKM complications, certain areas, like the use of finerenone in patients without diabetes with CKD, are still emerging, with ongoing studies investigating its broader applications. Overall, while guidelines from ADA, ESC, EASD and KIDIGO align on SGLT2i and GLP-1 RAs for ASCVD, HF and CKD, differences exist regarding specific populations and emerging therapeutic options, suggesting a need for further research and potential guideline updates.

### Cholesterol levels and cardiovascular outcomes following statin initiation for primary prevention: a cohort study [^2e7a9ba0]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The residual risk of incomplete control of non-HDL-C in the context of controlled LDL-C has been explored by 2 recent studies in Denmark. One study of 13,015 statin-treated patients from the general population found that a non-HDL-C above the sample median was associated with residual risk of mortality and MI even with LDL-C below median. In secondary prevention, a cohort study conducted in Denmark found that among persons with LDL-C at target (≤ 70 mg/dL [1.8 mmol/L]), a non-HDL-C ≥ 97 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L) was associated with increased risk of MI, ASCVD, and death. To our knowledge, no studies have explored guideline-directed non-HDL-C thresholds after statin initiation and the association with incident CV events in primary prevention. Thus, our findings add to existing literature.

There remains debate around a treat-to-target approach vs simply initiating a moderate or high-intensity statin depending on CV risk. The Canadian Patients Experience Evidence Research (PEER) simplified lipid guidelinerecommends against repeat lipid testing and use of lipid targets/thresholds, and U.S. guidelines moved away from lipid targets in 2013 with more recent guidelines incorporating percent LDL-C lowering. In 2023, the U.S. National Lipid Association and American Society for Preventive Cardiology advocated for use of LDL-C targets. A treat-to-target approach is centered around analyses that show lower risk of CV events with lower achieved LDL-C levels in statin randomized controlled trials (RCTs). There is a lack of RCT evidence demonstrating whether targeting specific lipid levels is superior to simply initiating statins in primary prevention. Among patients with coronary artery disease, a 2023 RCTfound that a treat-to-target approach was noninferior to high-dose statins in reducing risk of adverse CV events. It is argued that a treat-to-target approach may allow for tailored therapy (eg, use of moderate dose statins to achieve lipid targets in patients at > 20% 10-year CVD risk). While our study cannot show which approach is best, we found that 20% to 30% of patients remain above guideline-directed thresholds for intensification with initial statin therapy and that there is an associated risk of adverse CV events associated with this. Given a small portion were on high-intensity statins, increasing statin doses could be considered without the need for a second agent.

### Nutritional priorities to support GLP-1 therapy for obesity: a joint advisory from the American college of lifestyle medicine, the American society for nutrition, the Obesity Medicine Association, and the obesity society [^4acf6651]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

SUMMARY TAKEAWAY MESSAGES

Despite the ability of GLP‐1s to produce significant weight reduction and related health benefits, challenges such as GI side effects, risk of nutrient inadequacies, loss of muscle and bone mass, high costs, frequent discontinuation, and weight regain limit the use of these drugs for long‐term success in individuals and populations.
Clinicians prescribing GLP‐1s for obesity management should focus on and help mitigate these challenges by developing care plans that include thorough nutritional and lifestyle counseling before, during, and after the weight reduction period.
Such comprehensive care will support treatment benefits beyond body weight alone and will make clinicians more effective stewards of GLP‐1s and, ultimately, of patients' overall health.

### Nutritional priorities to support GLP-1 therapy for obesity: a joint advisory from the American college of lifestyle medicine, the American society for nutrition, the Obesity Medicine Association, and the obesity society [^f2f8e8f6]. Obesity Pillars (2025). High credibility.

GLP-1 therapy efficacy magnitude and durability summarize trial and real-world effects and temporal patterns. In the original phase 3 randomized trials for obesity, average weight reduction compared to placebo has ranged from 5.3% to 17.8% after 56–72 weeks. In real-world practice, the efficacy for weight reduction is often lower: for example, about 8% for individuals with diabetes and 11% for individuals without diabetes at 60 weeks with semaglutide 2.4 mg/day. Generally, weight reduction is more rapid during the first 6 months and then slower thereafter, with relative plateauing at 18 months. When GLP-1 use is continued, weight reduction is sustained for at least 4 years, whereas when GLP-1s are stopped, weight regain is common — typically nearly to baseline within one year.

At baseline, 85% of patients were treated with ACE inhibitor or ARB, 64% with statins, and 34% with antiplatelet agents.

JARDIANCE was superior to placebo in reducing the risk of the primary composite endpoint of sustained ≥ 40% eGFR decline, sustained eGFR < 10 mL/min/1.73 m2, progression to end-stage kidney disease, or CV or renal death. The treatment effect reflected a reduction in a sustained ≥ 40% eGFR decline, sustained eGFR < 10 mL/min/1.73 m2, progression to end-stage kidney disease, and CV death. There were few renal deaths during the trial. JARDIANCE also reduced the risk of first and recurrent hospitalization (see Table 18 and Figure 13); information collected on the reason for hospitalization was insufficient to further characterize the benefit.

Figure 13	Time to First Occurrence of the Primary Composite Endpoint, Sustained ≥ 40% eGFR Decline, Sustained eGFR < 10 mL/min/1.73 m, ESKD or Renal Death, or CV Death

The results of the primary composite endpoint were generally consistent across the pre-specified subgroups examined, including eGFR categories, underlying cause of kidney disease, diabetes status, or background use of RAS inhibitors (see Figure 14). The treatment benefit with JARDIANCE on the primary composite endpoint was not evident in patients with very low levels of albuminuria, however there were few events in these patients.

WHEN TO START THE FIRST PACK OF PILLS

You have a choice of which day to start taking your first pack of pills.

Decide with your health-care provider which is the best day for you. Pick a time of day which will be easy to remember.

DAY 1 START:

1. Pick the day label sticker that starts with the first day of your period. Place this day label sticker over the area that has the days of the week (starting with Sunday) pre-printed on the tablet dispenser.

Note: if the first day of your period is a Sunday, you can skip step #1.

2. Take the first "active" orange pill of the first pack during the first 24 hours of your period.

3. You will not need to use a back-up nonhormonal method of birth control, since you are starting the pill at the beginning of your period.

SUNDAY START:

1. Take the first "active" orange pill of the first pack on the Sunday after your period starts, even if you are still bleeding. If your period begins on Sunday, start the pack that same day.

2. Use a nonhormonal method of birth control (such as condoms or spermicide) as a back-up method if you have sex anytime from the Sunday you start your first pack until the next Sunday (7 days).

WHAT TO DO DURING THE MONTH

1. Take one pill at the same time every day until the pack is empty.

Do not skip pills even if you are spotting or bleeding between monthly periods or feel sick to your stomach (nausea).

Do not skip pills even if you do not have sex very often.

2. **When you finish a pack**:

Start the next pack on the day after your last "reminder" pill. Do not wait any days between packs.

IF YOU SWITCH FROM ANOTHER BRAND OR COMBINATION PILLS:

If your previous brand had 21 pills: Wait 7 days to start taking FALMINA. You will probably have your period during that week. Be sure that no more than 7 days pass between the 21-day pack and taking the first orange FALMINA pill ("active" with hormone).

If your previous brand had 28 pills: Start taking the first orange FALMINA pill ("active" with hormone) on the day after your last reminder pill. Do not wait any days between packs.

2.2 Participant Selection and Recruitment for Focus Groups

Participants from the needs assessment interviews were informed about the study's next phase, which involved focus groups conducted approximately 4 weeks after the conclusion of the needs assessment phase. Any resident or care partner was eligible to participate in the focus groups; however, we prioritized those who had previously participated in the interviews to build on prior discussions and insights. Our goal was to recruit up to three residents and three care partners from each of three Ontario LTC homes, prioritizing resident participation. Although LTC staff were not included in this phase, they were informed that they would be invited to participate in dedicated focus groups at a later stage. To ensure their perspectives are meaningfully captured, we have also planned additional engagement strategies, including presentations at nurse and physician council meetings, a document analysis of transcripts from quality improvement meetings, and separate sessions with night staff whose voices are often overlooked in research due to scheduling constraints.

The LTC homes we engaged are referred to henceforth as Site 1, Site 2, and Site 3. This study was approved by the Bruyère Health Research Ethics Board (#M16‐23‐036). All participants provided written consent prior to the start of the focus group and received a $50 gift card to a store of their choice as a token of appreciation.

2.3 Data Collection

Increasingly used in healthcare research, focus groups effectively explore collective perspectives, attitudes, and experiences. They are also a key method for needs assessments. These structured discussions, led by a facilitator, gather insights through interactive conversations. We selected this method to encourage open dialogue, allowing participants to expand on each other's ideas without researchers imposing interpretations. Conducting focus groups after interviews helped verify and deepen our understanding of participants' experiential knowledge. Interested residents and care partners were briefed on the focus group's two‐hour duration and purpose (i.e. to co‐develop a decision‐making tool based on needs assessment findings). To minimize participant fatigue, we incorporated multiple five‐minute breaks, during which residents were offered dietitian‐approved pastries, juice, coffee, and tea. Additionally, all focus groups were scheduled in the morning to optimize alertness.

Two multicenter, randomized, investigator-blind, active-controlled trials were conducted in 1038 subjects 6 months of age and older with head lice infestation. A total of 552 subjects were treated with Spinosad Topical Suspension. For the evaluation of efficacy, the youngest subject from each household was considered to be the primary subject of the household, and other members in the household were enrolled in the study as secondary subjects and evaluated for all safety parameters.

In Study 1, 91 primary subjects were randomized to Spinosad Topical Suspension, and 89 primary subjects were randomized to permethrin 1%. In Study 2, 83 and 84 primary subjects were randomized to Spinosad Topical Suspension and permethrin 1%, respectively.

In both trials, all subjects who were treated on Day 0 returned for efficacy evaluation at Day 7. Subjects with live lice present at Day 7 received a second treatment. Subjects who were lice free on Day 7 were to return on Day 14 for evaluation. Subjects with live lice and who received a second treatment were to return on Days 14 and 21.

Efficacy was assessed as the proportion of primary subjects who were free of live lice 14 days after the final treatment. Table 3 contains the proportion of primary subjects who were free of live lice in each of the two trials.

These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including this drug.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

ALTACE may be used alone or in combination with thiazide diuretics.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^33d4853d]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) — supportive evidence and ACEi/ARB monitoring: SPRINT data demonstrated adults with CKD and hypertension can be effectively and safely treated to SBP < 130 mm Hg, and meta-analyses have shown benefit of treating SBP < 130 mm Hg versus higher SBP targets. An analysis of CKD patients from 4 trials found that an SBP target of < 130 mm Hg (versus < 140 mm Hg) decreased all-cause mortality; a meta-analysis of the CKD subsets from 18 trials reported that more-intensive SBP (mean SBP 132 mm Hg) versus less-intensive SBP (mean SBP 140 mm Hg) control resulted in 14% reduction in all-cause mortality. While < 120 mm Hg is more effective at preventing CVD events, meta-analyses of trial data support an SBP < 130 mm Hg to balance the benefits of intensive BP-lowering with the risks of adverse events. ACEi or ARB reduce intraglomerular pressure, which may cause a transient decrease, or dip, in eGFR up to 30%, and this short-term decline in eGFR is not associated with decreased long-term outcomes and should not prompt discontinuation of the ACEi or ARB. Electrolytes should be rechecked 2 to 4 weeks after initiating or intensifying ACEi or ARB dosage, monitoring for hyperkalemia or a decline in eGFR of > 30%, which may require reducing or holding the agent temporarily or additional evaluation. ACEi or ARB can be continued in people with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 as an RCT found that discontinuation was not associated with a significant difference in long-term decrease in eGFR, and the combined use of an ACEi and an ARB should be avoided because of increased harm.

### Fenofibrate (Antara) [^bdf65b4a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Prior to Initiation of Antara

Assess lipid levels before initiating therapy. Identify other causes (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, or medications) of high triglyceride levels and manage as appropriate.
Patients should be placed on an appropriate lipid-lowering diet before receiving Antara and should continue this diet during treatment with Antara.
In patients with diabetes and fasting chylomicronemia, improve glycemic control prior to considering starting Antara.

2.2 Recommended Dosage and Administration

- Severe hypertriglyceridemia: ○ The recommended dosage of Antara is 43 mg or 130 mg orally once daily. ○ Dosage should be individualized according to patient response, and should be adjusted if necessary following repeat lipid determinations at 4 to 8 week intervals.
- Primary hyperlipidemia: ○ The recommended dosage of Antara is 130 mg orally once daily.
- Administer Antara as a single dose at any time of day, with or without food.
- Advise patients to swallow Antara capsules whole. Do not crush, break, dissolve, or chew capsules.
- Assess TG when clinically appropriate, as early as 4 to 8 weeks after initiating Antara. Discontinue Antara in patients who do not have an adequate response after two months of treatment.
- If a dose is missed, advise patients not to take an extra dose. Resume treatment with the next dose.
- Advise patients to take Antara at least 1 hour before or 4 hours to 6 hours after a bile acid binding resin to avoid impeding its absorption.

2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment

Assess renal function prior to initiation of Antara and periodically thereafter [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
Treatment with Antara should be initiated at a dosage of 43 mg orally once daily in patients with mild to moderately impaired renal function (eGFR 30 to < 60 mL/min/1.73m), and increased only after evaluation of the effects on renal function and TG levels at this dose.
Antara is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m), including those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and those receiving dialysis [see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.4 Recommended Dosage in Geriatric Patients

Dosage selection for the elderly should be made on the basis of renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]

### What is the pipeline for future medications for obesity? [^1829f366]. International Journal of Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Obesity is a chronic disease associated with increased risk of obesity-related complications and mortality. Our better understanding of the weight regulation mechanisms and the role of gut-brain axis on appetite has led to the development of safe and effective entero-pancreatic hormone-based treatments for obesity such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RA). Semaglutide 2.4mg once weekly, a subcutaneously administered GLP-1 RA approved for obesity treatment in 2021, results in 15–17% mean weight loss (WL) with evidence of cardioprotection. Oral GLP-1 RA are also under development and early data shows similar WL efficacy to semaglutide 2.4mg. Looking to the next generation of obesity treatments, combinations of GLP-1 with other entero-pancreatic hormones with complementary actions and/or synergistic potential (such as glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), glucagon, and amylin) are under investigation to enhance the WL and cardiometabolic benefits of GLP-1 RA. Tirzepatide, a dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist has been approved for glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes as well as for obesity management leading in up to 22.5% WL in phase 3 obesity trials. Other combinations of entero-pancreatic hormones including cagrisema (GLP-1/amylin RA) and the triple agonist retatrutide (GLP-1/GIP/glucagon RA) have also progressed to phase 3 trials as obesity treatments and early data suggests that may lead to even greater WL than tirzepatide. Additionally, agents with different mechanisms of action to entero-pancreatic hormones (e.g. bimagrumab) may improve the body composition during WL and are in early phase clinical trials. We are in a new era for obesity pharmacotherapy where combinations of entero-pancreatic hormones approach the WL achieved with bariatric surgery. In this review, we present the efficacy and safety data for the pipeline of obesity pharmacotherapies with a focus on entero-pancreatic hormone-based treatments and we consider the clinical implications and challenges that the new era in obesity management may bring.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Primary Prevention of CV Disease

In the Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) study, the effect of rosuvastatin on the occurrence of major CV disease events was assessed in 17,802 males (≥ 50 years) and females (≥ 60 years) who had no clinically evident CV disease, LDL-C levels < 130 mg/dL and hsCRP levels ≥ 2 mg/L. The study population had an estimated baseline coronary heart disease risk of 11.6% over 10 years based on the Framingham risk criteria and included a high percentage of patients with additional risk factors such as hypertension (58%), low HDL-C levels (23%), cigarette smoking (16%), or a family history of premature CHD (12%). Patients had a median baseline LDL-C of 108 mg/dL and hsCRP of 4.3 mg/L. Patients were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 8901) or rosuvastatin 20 mg once daily (n = 8901) and were followed for a mean duration of 2 years. The JUPITER study was stopped early by the Data Safety Monitoring Board due to meeting predefined stopping rules for efficacy in rosuvastatin-treated subjects.
