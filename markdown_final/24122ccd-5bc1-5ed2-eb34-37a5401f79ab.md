## Question

Treatment of lactic acidosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of lactic acidosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and airway, breathing, and circulation. Then, I should verify the etiology and classify type A versus type B lactic acidosis. Next, I will review targeted management by cause, including sepsis, metformin toxicity, malignancy, and mitochondrial disease. After that, I need to examine the role and risks of sodium bicarbonate, including guideline positions and the BICAR-ICU trial. Finally, I will consider adjuncts like renal replacement therapy, lactate-guided resuscitation, and special populations, and close with a concise, practical algorithm and key takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the priorities in the first hour: secure the airway, support breathing to avoid hypercarbia, and establish circulation with fluids and vasopressors as indicated, because tissue hypoperfusion is the most common driver of lactic acidosis and must be corrected urgently to reduce ongoing lactate production and mitigate organ dysfunction [^e13d663d] [^85d20524].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "lactic acidosis" being a single entity; I need to classify the pathophysiology into type A (hypoxic, low-flow states) versus type B (non-hypoxic, impaired clearance or overproduction), because treatment hinges on the underlying mechanism and not on the lactate level alone, and misclassification leads to ineffective therapy [^e13d663d] [^6bc12f6b].

> For sepsis or septic shock, I should confirm that the cornerstone is source control, antibiotics, and hemodynamic optimization with fluids and vasopressors; routine sodium bicarbonate does not improve hemodynamics or vasopressor requirements when pH is ≥ 7.15, so I should avoid it in that scenario and focus on restoring perfusion instead [^88419a0a] [^1ba8e990] [^305edbb5].

> Wait, let me verify the bicarbonate exception in sepsis: the BICAR-ICU randomized trial showed no overall benefit, but in the prespecified AKI stratum (AKIN 2–3) with pH ≤ 7.20, bicarbonate reduced 28-day mortality, so a cautious, selective use in severe acidemia with AKI is reasonable while monitoring for hypernatremia and hypocalcemia [^0958b73f] [^554dc8d3].

> For metformin-associated lactic acidosis, I need to ensure immediate drug cessation and consider urgent hemodialysis when there is severe acidemia, hemodynamic instability, or rising lactate, because metformin is dialyzable and dialysis both removes the drug and corrects acidosis; prognosis is often better than other etiologies at similar pH, but delays worsen outcomes [^b7c305df] [^dbc7d374] [^54f359ff].

> But wait, what if the lactate is from beta-agonists like albuterol rather than hypoperfusion; I should double-check the medication history and reduce the frequency or dose of beta-agonists, because lactate typically normalizes within 24–72 hours after dose adjustment, preventing unnecessary sepsis workups and fluids [^f75f1f75] [^cee02940].

> In malignancy-associated type B lactic acidosis, I should confirm that definitive oncologic therapy is the key intervention; lactate often declines with effective chemotherapy, and while supportive care is necessary, bicarbonate is not curative and should be reserved for severe acidemia with caution [^feaf76a5] [^d7461d47].

> For mitochondrial disease or MELAS, let me reconsider the role of L-arginine; although some guidelines suggest arginine for stroke-like episodes, high-quality evidence is limited and mixed, so I should prioritize seizure control and supportive care, and use arginine selectively with shared decision-making given potential harms and uncertain benefit [^691845ff] [^0b8e195c] [^cf2e38ff].

> I should confirm the general stance on sodium bicarbonate: routine use in lactic acidosis is not recommended because of lack of hemodynamic benefit and risks of CO2 generation, intracellular acidosis, hypernatremia, and hypocalcemia; if considered at all, it should be in severe acidemia (often pH ≤ 7.20) with careful monitoring and as a bridge while treating the cause [^88419a0a] [^554dc8d3] [^049b8541].

> Next, I should review lactate-guided resuscitation; although lactate clearance is associated with better outcomes, the evidence for lactate-targeted algorithms is mixed, with some trials showing signal for improved mortality when lactate is used to guide therapy, so I should integrate lactate trends with clinical endpoints rather than treat the number alone [^b3564f32] [^e33886b3] [^345b44f1].

> I will now examine renal replacement therapy: beyond metformin removal, RRT can partially correct acidosis and remove lactate, but in shock states lactate production often outpaces clearance, so RRT is adjunctive and should be timed for severe acidemia, AKI, or intoxications rather than used routinely for lactate alone [^a9da95d3] [^f2fd528f] [^6bc12f6b].

> Let me think about special populations and buffers: in pediatrics, emerging retrospective data suggest sodium bicarbonate may reduce mortality in hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis but could worsen outcomes in non–hyperchloremic cases, so I should avoid routine bicarbonate and consider it only in the right chloride phenotype with caution pending prospective trials [^f7c5b2ea] [^f022dd9b] [^65038273].

> I should double-check that lactated Ringer's is not contraindicated in lactic acidosis; the FDA labeling advises against lactate-containing solutions in lactic acidosis, but contemporary practice often permits balanced crystalloids with close monitoring, so I will individualize based on severity and context rather than reflexively avoiding lactate [^1744a939] [^0d6c3e4d].

> To synthesize, let me verify the practical algorithm: stabilize ABCs, classify type A versus B, treat the underlying cause aggressively, avoid routine bicarbonate except in select severe acidemia with AKI or specific intoxications, consider RRT for severe acidemia or drug removal, and use lactate trends to guide resuscitation while avoiding lactate-only endpoints; this aligns with SSC 2021, BICAR-ICU, and toxicology guidance [^88419a0a] [^0958b73f] [^dbc7d374].

> Key takeaway, and I need to ensure I state this clearly: lactic acidosis is a marker of severity and a driver of dysfunction, but mortality improves when we correct the cause of hypoperfusion or toxicity rather than chasing lactate with buffers; bicarbonate is not benign and should be reserved for carefully selected scenarios while we prioritize source control, perfusion, and organ support [^e13d663d] [^049b8541] [^88419a0a].

The cornerstone of lactic acidosis management is to **identify and treat the underlying cause** (e.g. sepsis, hypoperfusion, toxins, mitochondrial disease) while providing supportive care [^e13d663d] [^85d20524]. Routine sodium bicarbonate is **not recommended** for lactic acidosis with pH ≥ 7.15, as it does not improve hemodynamics or outcomes and may cause harm [^88419a0a] [^1ba8e990]. Reserve bicarbonate for **severe acidemia (pH < 7.1)** with shock or life-threatening arrhythmias, and use with caution due to risks of hypernatremia, hypocalcemia, and CO2 load [^bd1d86e4] [^554dc8d3]. Renal replacement therapy is indicated for **severe metformin toxicity**, refractory acidosis, or AKI [^b7c305df] [^dbc7d374]. Lactate-guided resuscitation and close monitoring are advised, but lactate is a marker, not a target [^b3564f32] [^345b44f1].

---

## General principles of management

- **Identify and treat the underlying cause**: The most critical step is to identify and address the root cause of lactic acidosis, such as sepsis, hypoperfusion, toxins, or mitochondrial disorders [^e13d663d] [^85d20524].

- **Supportive care**: Provide hemodynamic support with fluids and vasopressors to restore tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery [^e13d663d].

- **Monitor lactate levels**: Serial lactate measurements are essential for assessing response to therapy and guiding resuscitation efforts [^345b44f1].

---

## Role of sodium bicarbonate therapy

Sodium bicarbonate has long been used to correct metabolic acidosis, but its role in lactic acidosis is **controversial** [^bd1d86e4].

---

### Evidence against routine use

- **No improvement in hemodynamics**: Multiple studies have shown that sodium bicarbonate does not improve hemodynamic stability or reduce vasopressor requirements in lactic acidosis [^554dc8d3] [^afba4b67].

- **Potential harm**: Bicarbonate therapy can cause hypernatremia, hypocalcemia, and increase CO2 load, potentially worsening intracellular acidosis [^554dc8d3] [^656b7dd0].

- **Guideline recommendations**: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends against routine bicarbonate use in lactic acidosis with pH ≥ 7.15 [^88419a0a] [^1ba8e990].

---

### Situations where bicarbonate may be considered

Bicarbonate therapy may be considered in **specific scenarios**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication for bicarbonate** |
|-|-|
| Severe acidemia (pH < 7.1) | Short-term use to prevent life-threatening arrhythmias or hemodynamic collapse [^bd1d86e4] |
| Metformin-associated lactic acidosis | Part of supportive care, especially if acidosis is severe [^b7c305df] |
| Acute kidney injury with severe acidosis | May be considered in conjunction with renal replacement therapy [^0958b73f] |

---

## Alternative therapies

Several **alternative therapies** have been explored, though evidence is limited:

- **THAM (tris-hydroxymethyl aminomethane)**: A non-bicarbonate buffer that may correct acidosis without increasing CO2 load, but clinical evidence is limited [^afba4b67].

- **Carbicarb**: A mixture of sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate that buffers without significant CO2 generation, primarily studied in animal models [^6bc12f6b].

- **Renal replacement therapy (RRT)**: Effective in removing lactate and correcting acidosis, particularly in metformin-associated lactic acidosis and severe renal impairment [^b7c305df] [^dbc7d374].

---

## Special considerations

- **Metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA)**: Immediate discontinuation of metformin and consideration of hemodialysis are critical. MALA has a relatively favorable prognosis compared to other forms of lactic acidosis [^b7c305df] [^54f359ff].

- **Mitochondrial disorders**: Management focuses on supportive care, dietary modifications, and specific therapies such as thiamine supplementation [^cf080b45].

- **Pediatric patients**: Evidence for bicarbonate use is limited; cautious, individualized use is recommended [^f7c5b2ea].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Continuous monitoring of **lactate levels**, acid-base status, and organ function is essential. Lactate-guided resuscitation is recommended in sepsis, but lactate should be viewed as a marker rather than a therapeutic target [^b3564f32] [^345b44f1].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Treat the underlying cause**: Essential for resolution of lactic acidosis [^e13d663d].

- **Avoid routine bicarbonate**: Not recommended for lactic acidosis with pH ≥ 7.15 [^88419a0a].

- **Consider bicarbonate cautiously**: Only in severe acidemia (pH < 7.1) or specific scenarios [^bd1d86e4].

- **Use alternative therapies**: THAM, Carbicarb, and RRT may be considered in select cases [^afba4b67].

- **Monitor closely**: Serial lactate, acid-base status, and organ function are critical [^345b44f1].

---

Effective management of lactic acidosis centers on **identifying and treating the underlying cause**, with supportive care and selective use of bicarbonate. Routine bicarbonate use is not recommended, and alternative therapies should be considered in specific scenarios.

Conclusion

Deleterious hemodynamic effects of severe lactic acidosis are largely suggested by experimental data, although not fully confirmed by human studies. Pending the effectiveness of an etiological treatment, there is no efficient and validated symptomatic therapy at hand to correct a life-threatening metabolic acidosis. Upcoming research in this field should be focused on the optimal strategy to treat severe metabolic acidosis, including symptomatic therapy.

### Hemodynamic consequences of severe lactic acidosis in shock states: from bench to bedside [^656b7dd0]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis is a very common biological issue for shock patients. Experimental data clearly demonstrate that metabolic acidosis, including lactic acidosis, participates in the reduction of cardiac contractility and in the vascular hyporesponsiveness to vasopressors through various mechanisms. However, the contributions of each mechanism responsible for these deleterious effects have not been fully determined and their respective consequences on organ failure are still poorly defined, particularly in humans. Despite some convincing experimental data, no clinical trial has established the level at which pH becomes deleterious for hemodynamics. Consequently, the essential treatment for lactic acidosis in shock patients is to correct the cause. It is unknown, however, whether symptomatic pH correction is beneficial in shock patients. The latest Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines recommend against the use of buffer therapy with pH ≥ 7.15 and issue no recommendation for pH levels < 7.15. Furthermore, based on strong experimental and clinical evidence, sodium bicarbonate infusion alone is not recommended for restoring pH. Indeed, bicarbonate induces carbon dioxide generation and hypocalcemia, both cardiovascular depressant factors. This review addresses the principal hemodynamic consequences of shock-associated lactic acidosis. Despite the lack of formal evidence, this review also highlights the various adapted supportive therapy options that could be putatively added to causal treatment in attempting to reverse the hemodynamic consequences of shock-associated lactic acidosis.

Is there any proven benefit of systemic alkalinization in severe metabolic (including lactic) acidosis?

Literature regarding the potential beneficial effect of alkalinization in correcting metabolic acidosis is controversial. As reported above, severe lactic acidosis with pH ≤ 7.15 appears to be experimentally detrimental for organ functions. Consequently, even if not formally demonstrated in clinical trials, it would appear reasonable to quickly correct the pH in order to restore cellular functions. In the absence of conclusive clinical studies, however, most of the following treatment options are consequently based on experimental data.

Sodium bicarbonate

Sodium bicarbonate has been removed from the treatment algorithm in advanced cardiac life support. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign also recommends against the use of sodium bicarbonate therapy for the purpose of improving hemodynamics or reducing vasopressor requirements in patients with severe lactic acidosis with pH > 7.15. Despite these strong guidelines, in the most recent survey on this topic, 67% of intensivists recommend administration of base to patients with metabolic acidosis, including lactic acidosis. The blood pH at which base therapy should be initiated remains nonetheless controversial. Thirty-seven percent of these intensivists continue to begin symptomatic treatment of metabolic acidosis for a pH ≥ 7.1. Such discrepancy between the literature and bedside practice warrants further explanation.

Clinical studies investigating sodium bicarbonate therapy in situations of severe lactic acidosis have always reported an increase in extracellular pH whereas experimental data are more divergent. By contrast, intracellular pH always decreases after sodium bicarbonate administration (Table 1). The main explanation for this so-called paradoxical intracellular acidosis is based on the reaction of sodium bicarbonate with a proton to form water and carbon dioxide:

### Lactic acidosis in sepsis: It's not all anaerobic: implications for diagnosis and management [^85d20524]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Increased blood lactate concentration (hyperlactatemia) and lactic acidosis (hyperlactatemia and serum pH < 7.35) are common in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In some patients, most of the lactate that is produced in shock states is due to inadequate oxygen delivery resulting in tissue hypoxia and causing anaerobic glycolysis. However, lactate formation during sepsis is not entirely related to tissue hypoxia or reversible by increasing oxygen delivery. In this review, we initially outline the metabolism of lactate and etiology of lactic acidosis; we then address the pathophysiology of lactic acidosis in sepsis. We discuss the clinical implications of serum lactate measurement in diagnosis, monitoring, and prognostication in acute and intensive care settings. Finally, we explore treatment of lactic acidosis and its impact on clinical outcome.

### MALAdaptive: do we avoid metformin unnecessarily? [^0e93d5cd]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Convention holds that the use of metformin is contraindicated in many patients secondary to concerns about lactic acidosis. However, current evidence suggests that metformin-associated lactic acidosis is at most idiosyncratic. Awareness of the current evidence should permit broader use of this valuable medication.

### Treatment of lactic acidosis: appropriate confusion [^42c41349]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Lactic acidosis (LA) is common in hospitalized patients and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. There have been major recent advances in our understanding of lactate generation and physiology. However, treatment of LA is an area of controversy and uncertainty, and the use of agents to raise pH is not clearly beneficial.

Aim and Methods

We reviewed animal and human studies on the pathogenesis, impact, and treatment of LA, published in the English language and available through the PubMed/MEDLINE database. Our aim was to clarify the physiology of the generation of LA, its impact on outcomes, and the different treatment modalities available. We also examined relevant data regarding LA induced by medications commonly prescribed by hospitalists: biguanides, nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), linezolid, and lorazepam.

Results/Conclusions

Lactic acid is a marker of tissue ischemia but it also may accumulate without tissue hypoperfusion. In the latter circumstance, lactic acid accumulation may be an adaptive mechanism-a novel possibility quite in contrast to the traditional view of lactic acid as only a marker of tissue ischemia. Studies on the treatment of LA with sodium bicarbonate or other buffers fail to show consistent clinical benefit. Severe acidemia in the setting of LA is a particularly poorly studied area. In the settings of medication-induced LA, optimal treatment, apart from prompt cessation of the offending agent, is still unclear.

### Bicarbonate therapy in severe metabolic acidosis [^bd1d86e4]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

The utility of bicarbonate administration to patients with severe metabolic acidosis remains controversial. Chronic bicarbonate replacement is obviously indicated for patients who continue to lose bicarbonate in the ambulatory setting, particularly patients with renal tubular acidosis syndromes or diarrhea. In patients with acute lactic acidosis and ketoacidosis, lactate and ketone bodies can be converted back to bicarbonate if the clinical situation improves. For these patients, therapy must be individualized. In general, bicarbonate should be given at an arterial blood pH of ≤ 7.0. The amount given should be what is calculated to bring the pH up to 7.2. The urge to give bicarbonate to a patient with severe acidemia is apt to be all but irresistible. Intervention should be restrained, however, unless the clinical situation clearly suggests benefit. Here we discuss the pros and cons of bicarbonate therapy for patients with severe metabolic acidosis.

### Lactic acidosis in a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^61fceed2]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis occurs when lactate production exceeds its metabolism. There are many possible causes of lactic acidosis, and in any given patient, several causes may coexist. This Attending Rounds presents a case in point. Metformin's role in the pathogenesis of lactic acidosis in patients with diabetes mellitus is complex, as the present case illustrates. The treatment of lactic acidosis is controversial, except for the imperative to remedy its underlying cause. The use of sodium bicarbonate to treat the often alarming metabolic derangements may be quite efficacious in that regard but is of questionable benefit to patients. Renal replacement therapies (RRTs) have particular appeal in this setting for a variety of reasons, but their effect on clinical outcomes is untested.

### Expanding the evidence for managing metformin poisoning to support decision-making [^dbc7d374]. Clinical Toxicology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is a well-described and commonly encountered condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Patients with metformin-associated lactic acidosis are frequently managed in the intensive care unit with supportive care, including volume resuscitation and consideration of an extracorporeal treatment to correct metabolic acidemia and remove metformin and lactate.

Extracorporeal Treatments In Poisoning Workgroup

The Extracorporeal Treatments in Poisoning Workgroup published evidence-based consensus recommendations in 2015 regarding the use of extracorporeal treatment in metformin toxicity. These recommendations list both clinical and biochemical indications, and they outline the rationale and evidence supporting each recommendation.

New Research Since Recommendations Were Published

Subsequent publications have provided new information regarding metformin-associated lactic acidosis and its treatment. A retrospective study showed that patients who did not meet the Extracorporeal Treatments in Poisoning Workgroup criteria for initiation of an extracorporeal treatment had a 100% survival. In patients who met the criteria, survival was approximately 75%; only 66% of these patients received an extracorporeal treatment, and this treatment did not appear to impact survival. Two other retrospective studies in patients diagnosed with metformin-associated lactic acidosis noted that extracorporeal treatments did not improve survival. However, those who received an extracorporeal treatment were more severely ill, potentially supporting a benefit from this intervention. A systematic review of patients receiving continuous kidney replacement therapy identified an overall survival that was higher than the overall survival in patients included in the Workgroup publication. This led the authors to suggest that intermittent hemodialysis may not be the preferred treatment for metformin toxicity. However, a closer look at the Workgroup data identified improved survival with each decade since the initial reports in the 1970s. Furthermore, there are multiple reports of persistent metformin-associated lactic acidosis that did not improve with standard continuous kidney replacement therapy, prompting an increase in the dosage of the extracorporeal treatment. The data supporting these observations are largely derived from retrospective studies, which have inherent biases, so prospective studies are required.

Prescribing Extracorporeal Treatments For Patients With Metformin Poisoning

Case-based decision-making is always necessary, but in general, we continue to follow the Extracorporeal Treatments in Poisoning Workgroup criteria because a convincing reason for changing these has not yet been presented. This includes the use of intermittent hemodialysis where possible, particularly in cases of severe poisoning. For patients with less severe poisoning or when intermittent hemodialysis is not readily available, it is reasonable to trial continuous modalities with careful observation for deterioration.

### Metformin-induced lactic acidosis: no one left behind [^816efc5c]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Metformin is a safe drug when correctly used in properly selected patients. In real life, however, associated lactic acidosis has been repeatedly, although rarely, reported. The term metformin-induced lactic acidosis refers to cases that cannot be explained by any major risk factor other than drug accumulation, usually due to renal failure. Treatment consists of vital function support and drug removal, mainly achieved by renal replacement therapy. Despite dramatic clinical presentation, the prognosis of metformin-induced lactic acidosis is usually surprisingly good.

### Lactic acidosis: current treatments and future directions [^afba4b67]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Mortality rates associated with severe lactic acidosis (blood pH < 7.2) due to sepsis or low-flow states are high. Eliminating the triggering conditions remains the most effective therapy. Although recommended by some, administration of sodium bicarbonate does not improve cardiovascular function or reduce mortality. This failure has been attributed to both reduction in serum calcium concentration and generation of excess carbon dioxide with intracellular acidification. In animal studies, hyperventilation and infusion of calcium during sodium bicarbonate administration improves cardiovascular function, suggesting that this approach could allow expression of the positive aspects of sodium bicarbonate. Other buffers, such as THAM or Carbicarb, or dialysis might also provide base with fewer untoward effects. Examination of these therapies in humans is warranted. The cellular injury associated with lactic acidosis is partly due to activation of NHE1, a cell-membrane Na(+)/H(+) exchanger. In animal studies, selective NHE1 inhibitors improve cardiovascular function, ameliorate lactic acidosis, and reduce mortality, supporting future research into their possible use in humans. Two main mechanisms contribute to lactic acid accumulation in sepsis and low-flow states: tissue hypoxia and epinephrine-induced stimulation of aerobic glycolysis. Targeting these mechanisms could allow for more specific therapy. This Acid-Base and Electrolyte Teaching Case presents a patient with acute lactic acidosis and describes current and future approaches to treatment.

### Treatment options for lactic acidosis and metabolic crisis in children with mitochondrial disease [^cf080b45]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2015). Low credibility.

The mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation route is a tightly regulated process, which is essential for aerobic cellular energy production. Disruption of this pathway may lead to severe neurometabolic disorders with onset in early childhood. A frequent finding in these patients is acute and chronic lactic acidemia, which is caused by increased conversion of pyruvate via the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. Under stable clinical conditions, this process may remain well compensated and does not require specific therapy. However, especially in situations with altered energy demands, such as febrile infections or longer periods of fasting, children with mitochondrial disorders have a high risk of metabolic decompensation with exacerbation of hyperlactatemia and severe metabolic acidosis. Unfortunately, no controlled studies regarding therapy of this critical condition are available and clinical outcome is often unfavorable. Therefore, the aim of this review was to formulate expert-based suggestions for treatment of these patients, including dietary recommendations, buffering strategies and specific drug therapy. However, it is important to keep in mind that a specific therapy for the underlying metabolic cause in children with mitochondrial diseases is usually not available and symptomatic therapy especially of severe lactic acidosis has its ethical limitations.

### Metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA): moving towards a new paradigm [^9dc00c81]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Although metformin has been used for over 60years, the balance between the drug's beneficial and adverse effects is still subject to debate. Following an analysis of how cases of so-called "metformin-associated lactic acidosis" (MALA) are reported in the literature, the present article reviews the pitfalls to be avoided when assessing the purported association between metformin and lactic acidosis. By starting from pathophysiological considerations, we propose a new paradigm for lactic acidosis in metformin-treated patients. Metformin therapy does not necessarily induce metformin accumulation, just as metformin accumulation does not necessarily induce hyperlactatemia, and hyperlactatemia does not necessarily induce lactic acidosis. In contrast to the conventional view, MALA probably accounts for a smaller proportion of cases than either metformin-unrelated lactic acidosis or metformin-induced lactic acidosis. Lastly, this review highlights the need for substantial improvements in the reporting of cases of lactic acidosis in metformin-treated patients. Accordingly, we propose a check-list as a guide to clinical practice.

### Risk of fatal and nonfatal lactic acidosis with metformin use in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^f0ddbf59]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Metformin is an oral anti-hyperglycemic agent used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The results of the UK Prospective Diabetes Study indicate that metformin treatment is associated with a reduction in total mortality compared to other anti-hyperglycemic treatments. Metformin, however, is thought to increase the risk of lactic acidosis, and is considered to be contraindicated in many chronic hypoxemic conditions that may be associated with lactic acidosis, such as cardiovascular, renal, hepatic and pulmonary disease, and advancing age.

Objectives

To assess the incidence of fatal and nonfatal lactic acidosis with metformin use compared to placebo and other glucose-lowering treatments in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A secondary objective was to evaluate the blood lactate levels for those on metformin treatment compared to placebo or non-metformin therapies.

Search Strategy

A search was performed of The Cochrane Library (up to 8/2005), MEDLINE (up to 8/2005), EMBASE (up to 11/2000), OLD MEDLINE, and REACTIONS (up to 8/2005), in order to identify all studies of metformin treatment from 1966 to August 2005. The Cumulated Index Medicus was used to search relevant articles from 1959 to 1965. The search was augmented by scanning references of identified articles, and by contacting principal investigators. Date of latest search: August 2005.

Selection Criteria

Prospective trials in patients with type 2 diabetes that lasted longer than one month were included if they evaluated metformin, alone or in combination with other treatments, compared to placebo or any other glucose-lowering therapy. Observational cohort studies of metformin treatment lasting greater than one month were also included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently selected trials to be included, assessed study quality and extracted data. The incidence of fatal and nonfatal lactic acidosis was recorded as cases per patient-years, for metformin treatment and for placebo or other treatments. The upper limit for the true incidence of cases in the metformin and non-metformin groups were calculated using Poisson statistics. In a second analysis lactate levels were measured as a net change from baseline or as mean treatment values (basal and stimulated by food or exercise) for treatment and comparison groups. The pooled results were recorded as a weighted mean difference (WMD) in mmol/L, using the fixed effect model for continuous data.

Main Results

Pooled data from 206 comparative trials and cohort studies revealed no cases of fatal or nonfatal lactic acidosis in 47,846 patient-years of metformin use or in 38,221 patients-years in the non-metformin group. Using Poisson statistics with 95% confidence intervals the upper limit for the true incidence of metformin-associated lactic acidosis was 6.3 cases per 100,000 patient-years, and the upper limit for the true incidence of lactic acidosis in the non-metformin group was 7.8 cases per 100,000 patient-years. There was no difference in lactate levels, either as mean treatment levels or as a net change from baseline, for metformin compared to placebo or other non-biguanide therapies. The mean lactate levels were slightly lower for metformin treatment compared to phenformin (WMD -0.75 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.86 to -0.15).

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence from prospective comparative trials or from observational cohort studies that metformin is associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis, or with increased levels of lactate, compared to other anti-hyperglycemic treatments if prescribed under the study conditions.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^8c45afb2]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background:

The use of sodium bicarbonate to treat metabolic acidosis is intuitive, yet data suggest that not all patients benefit from this therapy.

Objective:

In this narrative review, we describe the physiology behind commonly encountered nontoxicologic causes of metabolic acidosis, highlight potential harm from the indiscriminate administration of sodium bicarbonate in certain scenarios, and provide evidence-based recommendations to assist emergency physicians in rationale use of sodium bicarbonate.

Discussion:

Sodium bicarbonate can be administered as a hypertonic push, as a resuscitation fluid, or as an infusion. Lactic acidosis and cardiac arrest are two common scenarios where there is limited benefit to routine use of sodium bicarbonate, although certain circumstances, such as patients with concomitant acute kidney injury and lactic acidosis may benefit from sodium bicarbonate. Patients with cardiac arrest secondary to sodium channel blockade or hyperkalemia also benefit from sodium bicarbonate therapy. Recent data suggest that the use of sodium bicarbonate in diabetic ketoacidosis does not confer improved patient outcomes and may cause harm in pediatric patients. Available evidence suggests that alkalinization of urine in rhabdomyolysis does not improve patient-centered outcomes. Finally, patients with a nongap acidosis benefit from sodium bicarbonate supplementation.

Conclusions:

Empiric use of sodium bicarbonate in patients with nontoxicologic causes of metabolic acidosis is not warranted and likely does not improve patient-centered outcomes, except in select scenarios. Emergency physicians should reserve use of this medication to conditions with clear benefit to patients.

### Blood lactate monitoring in critically ill patients: a systematic health technology assessment [^345b44f1]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To decide whether the use of blood lactate monitoring in critical care practice is appropriate. We performed a systematic health technology assessment as blood lactate monitoring has been implemented widely but its clinical value in critically ill patients has never been evaluated properly.

Data Source

PubMed, other databases, and citation review.

Study Selection

We searched for lactate combined with critically ill patients as the target patient population. Two reviewers independently selected studies based on relevance for the following questions: Does lactate measurement: 1) perform well in a laboratory setting? 2) provide information in a number of clinical situations? 3) relate to metabolic acidosis? 4) increase workers' confidence? 5) alter therapeutic decisions? 6) result in benefit to patients? 7) result in similar benefits in your own setting? 8) result in benefits which are worth the extra costs?

Data Extraction and Synthesis

We concluded that blood lactate measurement in critically ill patients: 1) is accurate in terms of measurement technique but adequate understanding of the (an)aerobic etiology is required for its correct interpretation; 2) provides not only diagnostic but also important prognostic information; 3) should be measured directly instead of estimated from other acid-base variables; 4) has an unknown effect on healthcare workers' confidence; 5) can alter therapeutic decisions; 6) could potentially improve patient outcome when combined with a treatment algorithm to optimize oxygen delivery, but this has only been shown indirectly; 7) is likely to have similar benefits in critical care settings worldwide; and 8) has an unknown cost-effectiveness.

Conclusions

The use of blood lactate monitoring has a place in risk-stratification in critically ill patients, but it is unknown whether the routine use of lactate as a resuscitation end point improves outcome. This warrants randomized controlled studies on the efficacy of lactate-directed therapy.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^07012828]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The use of sodium bicarbonate to treat metabolic acidosis is intuitive, yet data suggest that not all patients benefit from this therapy.

Objective

In this narrative review, we describe the physiology behind commonly encountered nontoxicologic causes of metabolic acidosis, highlight potential harm from the indiscriminate administration of sodium bicarbonate in certain scenarios, and provide evidence-based recommendations to assist emergency physicians in the rational use of sodium bicarbonate.

Discussion

Sodium bicarbonate can be administered as a hypertonic push, as a resuscitation fluid, or as an infusion. Lactic acidosis and cardiac arrest are two common scenarios where there is limited benefit to routine use of sodium bicarbonate, although certain circumstances, such as patients with concomitant acute kidney injury and lactic acidosis may benefit from sodium bicarbonate. Patients with cardiac arrest secondary to sodium channel blockade or hyperkalemia also benefit from sodium bicarbonate therapy. Recent data suggest that the use of sodium bicarbonate in diabetic ketoacidosis does not confer improved patient outcomes and may cause harm in pediatric patients. Available evidence suggests that alkalinization of urine in rhabdomyolysis does not improve patient-centered outcomes. Finally, patients with a nongap acidosis benefit from sodium bicarbonate supplementation.

Conclusions

Empiric use of sodium bicarbonate in patients with nontoxicologic causes of metabolic acidosis is not warranted and likely does not improve patient-centered outcomes, except in select scenarios. Emergency physicians should reserve use of this medication to conditions with clear benefit to patients.

### Lactic acidosis during entecavir (ETV) treatment… [^7d087e2a]. ClinicalTrials (2011). Low credibility.

Lactic Acidosis During EntecavirTreatment ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Chronic hepatitis B virus infection is the major cause of hepatic failure worldwide. Although the clinical course of HBV infection varies widely, the prognosis of decompensated liver cirrhosis is quite poor and the 5-year survival rate has been estimated to be only 14–35% without treatment. While the ultimate treatment of decompensated cirrhosis is orthotopic liver transplantation, several studies have suggested that anti-viral therapy can also improve the clinical outcomes in this group of patients. Entecavir is a potent cyclopentyl guanosine nucleoside inhibitor of the HBV polymerase. It has a higher anti-viral potency and a lower resistance rate compared to lamivudine, telbivudine or adefovir, when used for nucleoside/nucleotide-naïve patients.

ETV has been shown to be effective in patients with both hepatitis B envelope antigen -positive and HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B, and compensated liver disease. As for patients with decompensated cirrhosis, the investigators recently reported that ETV can not only induce virological response but also improve underlying hepatic function, and thereby can reduce the need for OLT. The cumulative OLT-free survival at 1 year and 2 years was 87. 1% and 83%, respectively with ETV treatment. Recently, Wong et al. reported the safety and efficacy of ETV in patients with severe acute exacerbation compared to LAM. In this study, ETV treatment was associated with increased short-term mortality in patients with severe acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B but achieved better virological response in the long run. Wong et al. assumed that the cause of increased short-term mortality in ETV-treated patients is due to not only the strong immune response but also lactic acidosis.

As such, they suggested that LAM may be initiated first and routine switching to ETV after liver function has improved or the adoption of the roadmap concept are reasonable treatment strategies. However, drug resistance can be a problem in the long term because of the increase of resistance mutation for lamivudine or entecavir later in patients who have the history of exposure to lamivudine before entecavir treatment in the past or have been treated with lamivudine.

### Unlocking the metabolic and anti-inflammatory therapeutic potential of lactate in critically ill patients [^0d6c3e4d]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Current evidence calls for a reappraisal of lactates role in critical care — not merely as a biomarker, but as a potential therapeutic agent. Its metabolic, anti-inflammatory, and signaling properties offer promising avenues for organ support in critically ill patients. Importantly, clinical studies using hypertonic sodium lactate have consistently reported good safety profiles, despite transient elevations in pH, plasma osmolality, or serum sodium levels. This supports the tolerability of lactate-based therapies in diverse patient populations. A paradigm shift is therefore warranted: future research should move beyond lactate clearance to explore its targeted administration as an adjunct or alternative treatment strategy. Priority must be given to large-scale randomized trials and mechanistic studies to determine optimal dosing, timing, and patient selection. Harnessing lactate's full therapeutic potential may significantly broaden the current armamentarium in intensive care medicine.

### Risk of fatal and nonfatal lactic acidosis with metformin use in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^390015c1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Metformin is an oral anti-hyperglycemic agent that has been shown to reduce total mortality compared to other anti-hyperglycemic agents, in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Metformin, however, is thought to increase the risk of lactic acidosis, and has been considered to be contraindicated in many chronic hypoxemic conditions that may be associated with lactic acidosis, such as cardiovascular, renal, hepatic and pulmonary disease, and advancing age.

Objectives

To assess the incidence of fatal and nonfatal lactic acidosis, and to evaluate blood lactate levels, for those on metformin treatment compared to placebo or non-metformin therapies.

Search Strategy

A comprehensive search was performed of electronic databases to identify studies of metformin treatment. The search was augmented by scanning references of identified articles, and by contacting principal investigators.

Selection Criteria

Prospective trials and observational cohort studies in patients with type 2 diabetes of least one month duration were included if they evaluated metformin, alone or in combination with other treatments, compared to placebo or any other glucose-lowering therapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

The incidence of fatal and nonfatal lactic acidosis was recorded as cases per patient-years, for metformin treatment and for non-metformin treatments. The upper limit for the true incidence of cases was calculated using Poisson statistics. In a second analysis lactate levels were measured as a net change from baseline or as mean treatment values (basal and stimulated by food or exercise) for treatment and comparison groups. The pooled results were recorded as a weighted mean difference (WMD) in mmol/L, using the fixed-effect model for continuous data.

Main Results

Pooled data from 347 comparative trials and cohort studies revealed no cases of fatal or nonfatal lactic acidosis in 70,490 patient-years of metformin use or in 55,451 patients-years in the non-metformin group. Using Poisson statistics the upper limit for the true incidence of lactic acidosis per 100,000 patient-years was 4.3 cases in the metformin group and 5.4 cases in the non-metformin group. There was no difference in lactate levels, either as mean treatment levels or as a net change from baseline, for metformin compared to non-metformin therapies.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence from prospective comparative trials or from observational cohort studies that metformin is associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis, or with increased levels of lactate, compared to other anti-hyperglycemic treatments.

### Metabolic acidosis in the critically ill: part 2. causes and treatment [^9136152d]. Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

The correct identification of the cause, and ideally the individual acid, responsible for metabolic acidosis in the critically ill ensures rational management. In Part 2 of this review, we examine the elevated (corrected) anion gap acidoses (lactic, ketones, uraemic and toxin ingestion) and contrast them with nonelevated conditions (bicarbonate wasting, renal tubular acidoses and iatrogenic hyperchloraemia) using readily available base excess and anion gap techniques. The potentially erroneous interpretation of elevated lactate signifying cell ischaemia is highlighted. We provide diagnostic and therapeutic guidance when faced with a high anion gap acidosis, for example pyroglutamate, in the common clinical scenario 'I can't identify the acid — but I know it's there'. The evidence that metabolic acidosis affects outcomes and thus warrants correction is considered and we provide management guidance including extracorporeal removal and fomepizole therapy.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^fb83e823]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In summary, there is no mortality benefit or demonstrated improvement in hemodynamics with use of sodium bicarbonate in lactic acidosis, although emerging data suggest patients with persistent metabolic acidosis and acute kidney injury may benefit from an infusion of bicarbonate after initial resuscitation. Emphasis should be placed on treatment of the underlying cause of the acidosis.

Recommendation

The routine use of bicarbonate supplementation for lactic acidosis and shock states is not recommended. There may be a role for an infusion of sodium bicarbonate after initial resuscitation in patients with acute kidney injury and pH < 7.2, although data are limited, and ongoing trials are evaluating benefit (Level of evidence: B).

Cardiac Arrest

The benefit of rapid pushes of ampules of sodium bicarbonate therapy in cardiac arrest is controversial. Decreased perfusion leads to hypoxia, anaerobic glycolysis, and generation of lactate. In addition, cessation of spontaneous ventilation causes buildup of carbon dioxide, decreases coronary perfusion pressure, and contributes to a mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis. Acidemia has detrimental effects on hemodynamics, increases myocardial irritability, and lowers the threshold for dysrhythmias. Indeed, the use of sodium bicarbonate was initially part of Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) guidelines dating back to 1976. However, over the years, data emerged that did not show improvement in resuscitation outcomes with bicarbonate supplementation, thus calling into question the routine use of sodium bicarbonate during resuscitation. Subsequently, incorporation of sodium bicarbonate during cardiac arrest began to fall out of favor, instead emphasis has shifted to early defibrillation and high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation to augment coronary perfusion with improved patient centered outcomes.

### Hemodynamic consequences of severe lactic acidosis in shock states: from bench to bedside [^b70e9966]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Shock was recently redefined as a clinical state of acute circulatory failure with inadequate oxygen utilization and/or delivery by the cells resulting in cellular dysoxia/hypoxia. In this setting, shock-associated lactic acidosis is the principal but not exclusive cause of metabolic acidosis in the shock state. Current clinical practice considers a pH ≤ 7.35 and lactatemia > 2.0 mmol.l −1 with a PaCO₂ ≤ 42 mmHg as defining lactic acidosis. In contrast, the definition of severe lactic acidosis is unclear. Critical care physicians usually consider that metabolic acidosis with a pH < 7.2 has deleterious hemodynamic effects and requires symptomatic treatment. Nevertheless, despite optimal management with adequate supportive and etiological therapy, shock and severe lactic acidosis (that is, with pH < 7.2) remain associated with an observed high mortality rate of about 50%, while no survival has been reported for severe lactic acidosis with shock under pH 7.0.

Numerous studies have assessed the cardiovascular consequences of severe metabolic acidosis, including lactic acidosis. These experimental studies demonstrated that severe metabolic acidosis worsens cardiovascular function by exacerbating myocardial dysfunction and hyporesponsiveness to vasopressors. Nevertheless, such findings have yet to be formally observed in human studies.

Etiological treatment is essential while symptomatic lactic acidosis correction remains a contentious issue. It is unknown whether alkalinization is beneficial in severe lactic acidosis. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends against symptomatic treatment in lactic acidotic patients with a pH > 7.15 for the purpose of improving hemodynamic status. Alternatively, the effect of alkalinization on hemodynamics and vasopressor requirements at pH ≤ 7.15 is currently unknown. Nevertheless, despite the lack of relevant results on its efficacy, alkalinization is still largely prescribed in instances of severe acidosis with pH ≤ 7.15.

### Lactic acidosis update for critical care clinicians [^6bc12f6b]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis is a broad-anion gap metabolic acidosis caused by lactic acid overproduction or underutilization. The quantitative dimensions of these two mechanisms commonly differ by 1 order of magnitude. Overproduction of lactic acid, also termed type A lactic acidosis, occurs when the body must regenerate ATP without oxygen (tissue hypoxia). Circulatory, pulmonary, or hemoglobin transfer disorders are commonly responsible. Overproduction of lactate also occurs with cyanide poisoning or certain malignancies. Underutilization involves removal of lactic acid by oxidation or conversion to glucose. Liver disease, inhibition of gluconeogenesis, pyruvate dehydrogenase (thiamine) deficiency, and uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation are the most common causes. The kidneys also contribute to lactate removal. Concerns have been raised regarding the role of metformin in the production of lactic acidosis, on the basis of individual case reports. The risk appears to be considerably less than with phenformin and involves patients with underlying severe renal and cardiac dysfunction. Drugs used to treat lactic acidosis can aggravate the condition. NaHCO(3) increases lactate production. Treatment of type A lactic acidosis is particularly unsatisfactory. NaHCO(3) is of little value. Carbicarb is a mixture of Na(2)CO(3) and NaHCO(3) that buffers similarly to NaHCO(3) but without net generation of CO(2). The results from animal studies are promising; however, clinical trials are sparse. Dichloroacetate stimulates pyruvate dehydrogenase and improves laboratory values, but unfortunately not survival rates, among patients with lactic acidosis. Hemofiltration has been advocated for the treatment of lactic acidosis, on the basis of anecdotal experiences. However, kinetic studies of lactate removal do not suggest that removal can counteract lactate production in any meaningful way. The ideal treatment is to stop acid production by treating the underlying disorder.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^532ec9c0]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

The authors conducted a narrative review of the available literature of bicarbonate therapy in selected topics. The literature search was completed using Google Scholar and PubMed databases for articles written in English published between November 1990 and November 2022. Search terms included: "bicarbonate", "cardiac arrest", "lactate", "lactic acidosis", "diabetic ketoacidosis", "rhabdomyolysis", "acidosis", and "acidemia". Abstracts were reviewed by two authors (S.H. G.W.) for appropriateness and discrepancies were adjudicated by a third author (C.T.). Preference was given to recent randomized trials and meta-analyses. Additional articles were identified if judged relevant in references of selected articles. We reviewed a total of 143 abstracts, of which 27 original research studies and 4 meta-analyses were included.

Levels of Evidence and Strength of Recommendations

The definitions used for grading the level of evidence and the strength of recommendations were adapted from the method used for the American College of Emergency Physicians Clinical Policies and are summarized in Table 1.

### Potential role of NHE1 (sodium-hydrogen exchanger 1) in the cellular dysfunction of lactic acidosis: implications for treatment [^6f96adf4]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

The development of lactic acidosis in seriously ill patients often is accompanied by impairment in organ function and increased morbidity and mortality. Although hypoxia per se is a crucial factor, detrimental effects also have been attributed to the metabolic acidosis that accompanies lactic acidosis. As a result, ancillary treatment of lactic acidosis has included base administration to improve the metabolic acidosis. However, treatment with base does not necessarily result in improved cellular function or clinical outcome. Recent research suggests that lactic acidosis can be associated with activation of the sodium-hydrogen exchanger 1 (NHE1), potentially giving rise to deleterious increases in cellular sodium and calcium ion concentrations, which can cause cardiac stunning and arrhythmias, extend cerebral damage, and worsen kidney function. Also, experimental studies in animals suggest that selective inhibition of this transporter might decrease the severity of cellular injury in the heart, brain, and kidney. These findings suggest that administration of selective inhibitors of NHE1 to patients with severe lactic acidosis might be beneficial. This article reviews experimental evidence of the role of NHE1 in the pathogenesis of cellular dysfunction with lactic acidosis and potential benefits of treatment with selective inhibitors of this transporter.

### Recommendations for the management of strokelike episodes in patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes [^691845ff]. JAMA Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Strokelike episodes are a cardinal feature of several mitochondrial syndromes, including mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS). Recent advances in the understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of strokelike episodes in MELAS have led to improved treatment options.

Observations

Current understanding of the cause of strokelike episodes in MELAS and present recommendations to assist in the identification and treatment of patients with MELAS who present with stroke are presented. Mounting evidence points toward a benefit of the nitric oxide precursors, arginine, to both prevent and reduce the severity of strokes in patients with MELAS.

Conclusions and Relevance

Although much information is still needed regarding the appropriate dosing and timing of arginine therapy in patients with MELAS, urgent administration of nitric oxide precursors in patients with MELAS ameliorates the clinical symptoms associated with strokelike episodes.

### Metformin-associated lactic acidosis: moving towards a new paradigm? [^b274d270]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

The history of metformin‐associated lactic acidosis (MALA) is rooted in the earlier experience with phenformin, another biguanide treatment for type 2 diabetes that was removed from the market owing to a clear causal association with cases of lactic acidosis (LA). Although metformin is less problematic in this regard, metformin can and does induce LA, and under the right circumstances it continues to present a potential risk to patients. Recent liberalization of the prescribing guidelines in the USA and European Union specifically regarding use in more advanced stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) have led to renewed interest in the topic of MALA, and this issue of Diabetes Obesity Metabolism presents two timely articles on the topic, by Lalau et al. 1 and Connelly et al. 2

Lalau et al. 1 outline a new way of thinking regarding the extremely rare, but often serious and potentially fatal, condition of MALA. They present a thoughtful analysis of existing MALA data and propose a more precise framework and nomenclature for categorizing LA with regard to whether metformin is clearly implicated causally, or is more of an "innocent bystander". Specifically, the authors propose a framework, primarily based on the presence of any other underlying condition that can cause LA, as well as a metformin measurement, within the proposed "umbrella" category of "lactic acidosis in metformin therapy" (LAMT) as follows. (1) Metformin‐induced LA (MILA): cases where (i) no known additional conditions that could lead to LA are present and (ii) a high plasma metformin concentration value is available or there is evidence suggestive of metformin accumulation based on the patient's metformin dose, renal function, and time since last dose. (2) Metformin‐unrelated LA (MULA): cases with good evidence of an intercurrent acute illness or condition that can lead to LA, together with low actual or assumed metformin concentration(s). (3) MALA: cases with insufficient information to rule out metformin involvement.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^554dc8d3]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Acidemia has been implicated in contributing to cardiovascular instability and decreased responsiveness to catecholamines and severe lactic acidosis is associated with increased mortality. This has led to the general belief and clinical practice that severe acidemia (usu- ally defined as a pH ≤ 7.10 to 7.20), should be corrected in the setting of lactic acidosis while awaiting definitive treatment of or response to treatment for the underlying cause. When surveyed, 86% of nephrologists and 67% of intensivists would initiate buffer treatment for patients with lactic acidosis, and 87% of nephrologists and 75% of intensivists would target a pH ≥ 7.2.

Despite widespread use, it is unknown whether treating extracellular acidosis with sodium bicarbonate affects clinical outcomes. Prior data have indicated that sodium bicarbonate administration does not improve hemodynamics in critically ill patients with lactic acidosis. Interestingly, there is no effect seen even in patients with severe acidemia (pH 6.90–7.20) and concurrent vasopressor use. Various studies, including the recent analysis of the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database, have found that sodium bicarbonate does not improve mortality in critically ill patients with severe acidemia (pH < 7.20) or in septic patients with metabolic acidosis, except in patients with concomitant acute kidney injury. Importantly, most publications evaluating the effect of supplemental bicarbonate therapy in patients with lactic acidosis have been observational or retrospective. The BICAR-ICU (Sodium Bicarbonate Therapy for Patients with Severe Metabolic Acidaemia in the Intensive Care Unit) trial is the only randomized trial published that randomized 394 adult patients with pH < 7.2, bicarbonate < 21 mmol/L, and arterial serum lactate 2 > mmol/L to receive supplemental bicarbonate therapy. The trial used a 4.2% sodium bicarbonate infusion to target a pH > 7.3 in critically ill patients admitted to the ICU — and did not include patients in the emergency department or those who had received a bicarbonate infusion in the 24 h prior to enrollment. The authors found no difference in 28-day mortality or presence of single-organ failure at day 7 (primary composite outcome) in patients randomized to receive bicarbonate infusion vs. the control group. However, the authors completed a prespecified subgroup analysis in which they found that patients with acute kidney injury and pH < 7.2 did have a decrease in mortality at 28 days (63% vs. 46%; p = 0.017). The au- thors also found that renal replacement therapy need was decreased in those randomized to receive the bicarbon- ate infusion. Notable adverse events in the bicarbonate group included higher rates of hypernatremia, hypocalcemia, and metabolic alkalosis.

### Sodium bicarbonate in treating lactic and non-lactic metabolic acidosis at different chloride levels: a retrospective study [^65038273]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, this study observed that sodium bicarbonate treatment did not improve the survival of pediatric patients with lactic or non-lactic metabolic acidosis. However, regardless of lactate levels, it reduced the odds of mortality in patients with hyperchloremia, while increased the odds of mortality in non-hyperchloremic patients. Prospective studies are needed to confirm the causal benefit of bicarbonate in hyperchloremic acidosis.

### Critical care nephrology: management of acid-base disorders with CRRT [^a9da95d3]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

Normal acid-base homeostasis is severely challenged in the intensive care setting. In this review, we address acid-base disturbances, with a special focus on the use of continuous (rather than intermittent) extracorporeal technologies in critical ill patients with acute kidney injury. We consider hypercapnic acidosis and lactic acidosis as examples in which continuous modalities may have different roles and indications than the traditional intermittent approaches to renal replacement therapy. Hypercapnic acidosis develops as a consequence of alveolar hypoventilation. In this condition, correction of pH above 7.2 is not currently recommended, and may even abrogate the beneficial effects of hypercapnic acidosis on overall outcomes. Extracorporeal technologies support lung protection while maintaining overall patient homeostasis. Similarly, in lactic acidosis, current evidence does not support bicarbonate infusions to correct acidosis. The management of lactic acidosis should correct the underlying causative disturbances. Most often, lactic acidosis is a biomarker denoting unfavorable outcomes, rather than an intrinsic pathogenetic mechanism. Extracorporeal procedures may assist in the removal of pathogenic drugs or toxins, as well as partially correcting acidemia. Whether or not these approaches will permit normalization of systemic pH, and the impact of these approaches on patient outcomes, needs to be addressed with prospective controlled trials.

### Association between the acidemia, lactic acidosis, and shock severity with outcomes in patients with cardiogenic shock [^400c1838]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

The strengths of the analysis are its inclusion of 2 independent, large, unselected cohorts of patients with CS. Independent validation in prospective cohorts is warranted. The thresholds for categorized analysis were taken from clinical experience rather than calculating optimal cutoff values. The fact that lactate level and blood pH were predictors of mortality when considered as continuous parameters validates their relevance. While it is tempting to speculate on the mechanisms leading to early death, the study merely describes associations. It remains entirely unclear whether interventions targeting blood pH or lactate levels can improve outcomes in CS. Ideal interventions would target upstream drivers of hemodynamic and metabolic compromise (ie, hypoperfusion) rather than their consequences, such as lactic acidosis and systemic acidemia. While the analysis of 2 large cohorts validates our findings, performing separate analyses within each cohort has some shortcomings, such as decreased statistical power compared with combining the cohorts. We did not have data on treatments for acidosis, nor did we have comprehensive data regarding all measurements reflecting acid‐base balance or serial measures of acidosis; we combined both arterial and venous lactate and pH measurements, leading to some variability.

In conclusion, severe lactic acidosis and systemic acidemia are important predictors of short‐term mortality in patients with CS independent of the severity of shock using the SCAI shock stages. Patients with CS and higher lactate level or lower blood pH are more likely to die across the spectrum of shock severity. As measured by the lactate level, the severity of hypoperfusion appears more important for predicting mortality than the extent of intrinsic compensation, as measured by the blood pH. Arterial pH and lactate levels should be routinely measured in patients with CS and reported in clinical studies. The presence of severe lactic acidosis or severe systemic acidemia should be considered risk modifiers that can identify high‐risk patients when added to the SCAI shock classification.

### Metformin-associated lactic acidosis: moving towards a new paradigm? [^205e46ce]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Recent publications 7, 8 have advocated broadening the use of metformin in patients with more advanced CKD, including patients on dialysis and/or awaiting renal transplant. Treatment options for these patients are limited, and metformin has generally not been widely used for the reasons stated earlier. Although these publications acknowledge the need for controlled clinical trial data, which is currently lacking, they propose that patients with advanced renal disease could be treated with lower doses of metformin to improve glycaemic control without excessive plasma accumulation. Dose reduction in renally impaired patients is a common strategy for renally cleared drugs that act systemically, and while such a strategy would probably result in acceptable exposure in the context of safety, the relationship between metformin plasma exposure and efficacy is not that simple. There is increasing evidence that a substantial contribution to the glycaemic effect of metformin is mediated through the intestine rather than primarily through systemic exposure. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 Given that the bioavailability of metformin increases with decreasing dose, 14 it is unlikely that the low doses of metformin required to maintain acceptable plasma concentrations would deliver sufficient metformin to the intestine to leverage the gut‐based mechanisms of action. 15

In summary, classification of LA in metformin‐treated patients should acknowledge the complexity of the contributing factors and weigh the potential roles of both metformin accumulation and underlying hypoxic diseases/conditions based on all the information available. This is particularly important in patients at inherently higher risk of MALA, such as the elderly and those with advanced CKD.

### L-lactic acidosis: pathophysiology, classification, and causes; emphasis on biochemical and metabolic basis [^e13d663d]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

L-lactic acidosis (L-LA) is the most common cause of metabolic acidosis in the critical care setting, which has been associated with a large increase in mortality. The purpose of this article is to provide clinicians with an overview of the biochemical and metabolic background required to understand the different pathophysiological mechanisms that may lead to the development of L-LA. We propose a classification based on whether the pathophysiology of L-LA is due predominantly to increased production or decreased removal of L-lactic acid. In this article, we provide an overview of the biochemical and metabolic aspects of glucose oxidation, the production and removal of L-lactic acid, and a discussion of the pathophysiology of the various causes of L-LA.

### Hemodynamic consequences of severe lactic acidosis in shock states: from bench to bedside [^7ccc50d6]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Epidemiology and outcome of severe lactic acidosis

Lactic acidosis is one of the most common biological concerns for intensivists. Nevertheless, clinical studies assessing the incidence and outcome of lactic acidosis are sparse and are mostly retrospective or prospective in nature with small sample sizes.

For this review, the most convincing prospective multi-center study, conducted in 2011 by Jung and colleagues, noted severe lactic acidosis in 6% of the studied population (200/2,550 patients); that is, with pH 7.09 ± 0.11 with high lactatemia values. Eighty-three percent of these patients were treated with vasopressors with a mortality rate of 57%. In this study, lactatemia and the swiftness of lactic acidosis correction were linked with survival. Interestingly, only 18% exhibited a slight coexistent respiratory acidosis at admission.

Clearly, a causal relationship between lactic acidosis and mortality has yet to be established. For example, in metformin-associated lactic acidosis, even with pH values most often around 7.0, the observed mortality rate was 25%. However, for the same pH values during shock, regardless of origin, no survival was reported. Consequently, severe lactic acidosis is much more of a precipitator than a direct causal factor of mortality. Lactic acidosis probably contributes to the decompensation of underlying comorbidities and, hence, to the mortality rate.

The use of alkaline agents to correct acidosis in pediatric patients is common in clinical practice, with sodium bicarbonate being a widely used alkaline drug. However, it is concerning that the results of multi-center randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews suggest that sodium bicarbonate treatment does not improve overall patient survival. Treating metabolic acidosis with sodium bicarbonate in the absence of severe metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.15) not only lacks benefits but may also be harmful.

Chloride plays a crucial role in acid–base balance and metabolism. Plasma pH results from kidney bicarbonate synthesis and excretion of chloride, maintaining the homeostatic balance of the blood CO2/bicarbonate buffer. Bicarbonate deficiency and chloride excess are essentially two sides of the same coin. Theoretically, it is reasonable to assume that sodium bicarbonate treatment could benefit patients with hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Promisingly, recent findings of Liu et al. have supported this hypothesis regarding pediatric patients' survival for the first time. They identified that sodium bicarbonate treatment significantly improves the survival rate of metabolic acidosis patients with hyperchloremia (chloride ≥ 113 mmol/L). Still, it increases the risk of death in non-hyperchloremic (chloride < 107 mmol/L) metabolic acidosis patients.

Lactic acidosis is a common form of metabolic acidosis, representing half of all cases. Elevated lactate levels strongly correlate with mortality. Research indicates that mortality rates are twice as high in lactic acidosis cases compared to those without, which has attracted considerable attention from researchers. Therefore, building on the work conducted by Liu et al. this study aimed to analyze the prognosis of pediatric patients treated with sodium bicarbonate and its interaction with chloride levels by classifying them into two subgroups: lactic acidosis and non-lactic acidosis.

Type B lactic acidosis is a rare metabolic complication of malignancy, more commonly in haematological malignancies. Due to the lack of formal prospective trials, treatment of lactic acidosis associated with malignancy is based on case reports. Given the poor prognosis, early recognition of type B lactic acidosis and prompt treatment are crucial. We report the first case of type B lactic acidosis in metastatic melanoma, followed by a brief literature review on the proposed pathophysiology and treatment.

### Study details | Lactic acidosis during entecavir (ETV) treatment… [^d12a33de]. ClinicalTrials (2011). Low credibility.

Lactic Acidosis During EntecavirTreatment ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Chronic hepatitis B virus infection is the major cause of hepatic failure worldwide. Although the clinical course of HBV infection varies widely, the prognosis of decompensated liver cirrhosis is quite poor and the 5-year survival rate has been estimated to be only 14–35% without treatment. While the ultimate treatment of decompensated cirrhosis is orthotopic liver transplantation, several studies have suggested that anti-viral therapy can also improve the clinical outcomes in this group of patients. Entecavir is a potent cyclopentyl guanosine nucleoside inhibitor of the HBV polymerase. It has a higher anti-viral potency and a lower resistance rate compared to lamivudine, telbivudine or adefovir, when used for nucleoside/nucleotide-naïve patients.

ETV has been shown to be effective in patients with both hepatitis B envelope antigen -positive and HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B, and compensated liver disease. As for patients with decompensated cirrhosis, the investigators recently reported that ETV can not only induce virological response but also improve underlying hepatic function, and thereby can reduce the need for OLT. The cumulative OLT-free survival at 1 year and 2 years was 87. 1% and 83%, respectively with ETV treatment. Recently, Wong et al. reported the safety and efficacy of ETV in patients with severe acute exacerbation compared to LAM. In this study, ETV treatment was associated with increased short-term mortality in patients with severe acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B but achieved better virological response in the long run. Wong et al. assumed that the cause of increased short-term mortality in ETV-treated patients is due to not only the strong immune response but also lactic acidosis.

As such, they suggested that LAM may be initiated first and routine switching to ETV after liver function has improved or the adoption of the roadmap concept are reasonable treatment strategies. However, drug resistance can be a problem in the long term because of the increase of resistance mutation for lamivudine or entecavir later in patients who have the history of exposure to lamivudine before entecavir treatment in the past or have been treated with lamivudine.

5.2 Lactic Acidosis

Metformin hydrochloride

Lactic Acidosis

Lactic acidosis is a serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride and it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 mcg/mL are generally found.

The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years. In more than 20,000 patient-years, exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal impairment, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride treatment should not be initiated in any patient unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic impairment. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake when taking metformin, because alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure necessitating restricted intake of food or fluids [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.10, 5.11, 5.12, 5.13)]. Use of topiramate, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, in epilepsy and migraine prophylaxis may frequently cause dose-dependent metabolic acidosis and may exacerbate the risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].

### Sodium bicarbonate in treating lactic and non-lactic metabolic acidosis at different chloride levels: a retrospective study [^f7c5b2ea]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sodium bicarbonate is commonly used to correct metabolic acidosis in pediatric patients, yet its efficacy remains controversial. This study aims to assess its effectiveness in treating non-lactic and lactic metabolic acidosis and its impact at various chloride levels.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted by screening pediatric patients diagnosed with metabolic acidosis from a paediatric intensive care database. Patients were categorized into two groups: lactate patients (lactate > 2.0 mmol/L) and non-lactate patients (lactate ≤ 2.0 mmol/L). The risk of death in patients who received sodium bicarbonate was assessed.

Results

Sodium bicarbonate treatment did not significantly affect in-hospital mortality in either overall lactate patients or non-lactate patients, with adjusted OR of 1.044 (95% CI: 0.829–1.315, p = 0.714) and 0.838 (95% CI: 0.548–1.281, p = 0.414), respectively. In lactate patients, those receiving sodium bicarbonate had a higher risk of in-hospital death when chloride was < 107 mmol/L (adjusted OR = 2.195, 95% CI: 1.536–3.135, p < 0.001), whereas the risk of in-hospital death decreased when chloride was ≥ 113 mmol/L (adjusted OR = 0.365, 95% CI: 0.217–0.614, p < 0.001). Similar findings were observed in non-lactate patients.

Conclusions

Sodium bicarbonate treatment does not improve the survival of pediatric patients with lactate or non-lactate metabolic acidosis. However, it can reduce the odds of mortality in pediatric patients with hyperchloremia, regardless of their lactate levels. Prospective studies are needed to further confirm these findings.

### Risk of fatal and nonfatal lactic acidosis with metformin use in type 2 diabetes mellitus… [^d7eddef8]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

There is no evidence to date that metformin therapy is associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis or with increased levels of lactate compared with other antihyperglycemic treatments if the drugs are prescribed under study conditions, taking into account contraindications. Interventions studied included metformin, alone or in combination with other treatments, vs placebo or another antihyperglycemic intervention, such as diet, insulin, or sulfonylureas. Data on participants treated with phenformin were not included in the analysis for lactic acidosis but were included in measurements of lactate levels. The treatment effect for fatal and nonfatal lactic acidosis was expressed as a risk difference by taking the incidence of events during metformin, alone or in combination with other treatments, and then subtracting the incidence of events during placebo or alternative treatments.

As no cases of lactic acidosis were found, the probable upper limits for the true incidence of lactic acidosis in the metformin and nonmetformin groups were calculated separately using Poisson statistics. Information was obtained on how many patients were older than 65 years or were thought to have concomitant hypoxemic conditions. Metformin was given in daily doses of 1 to 3 g, with the dosage titrated clinically. Comparison treatments included placebo, diet, insulin, glyburide, gliclazide, glipizide, glibenclamide, glimepiride, chlorpropamide, tolbutamide, acarbose, nateglinide, repaglinide, miglitol, troglitazone, rosiglitazone maleate, and guar gum. Of the trials that measured blood lactate levels, there was no significant difference for metformin treatment compared with placebo or nonbiguanide treatments, and levels were lower for metformin treatment than for phenformin treatment.

Metformin treatment in overweight patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus has been shown to reduce cardiovascular and total mortality rates compared with insulin use, sulfonylurea use, or diet alone. 6 Concern about the risk of lactic acidosis has led to recommendations that metformin therapy be withheld in persons with chronic conditions that in themselves can cause lactic acidosis.

### Metabolic acidosis: pathophysiology, diagnosis and management [^049b8541]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2010). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a primary reduction in serum bicarbonate (HCO(3)(-)) concentration, a secondary decrease in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO(2)) of approximately 1 mmHg for every 1 mmol/l fall in serum HCO(3)(-) concentration, and a reduction in blood pH. Acute forms (lasting minutes to several days) and chronic forms (lasting weeks to years) of the disorder can occur, for which the underlying cause/s and resulting adverse effects may differ. Acute forms of metabolic acidosis most frequently result from the overproduction of organic acids such as ketoacids or lactic acid; by contrast, chronic metabolic acidosis often reflects bicarbonate wasting and/or impaired renal acidification. The calculation of the serum anion gap, calculated as [Na⁺] − ([HCO₃⁻] + [Cl⁻]), aids diagnosis by classifying the disorders into categories of normal (hyperchloremic) anion gap or elevated anion gap. These categories can overlap, however. Adverse effects of acute metabolic acidosis primarily include decreased cardiac output, arterial dilatation with hypotension, altered oxygen delivery, decreased ATP production, predisposition to arrhythmias, and impairment of the immune response. The main adverse effects of chronic metabolic acidosis are increased muscle degradation and abnormal bone metabolism. Using base to treat acute metabolic acidosis is controversial because of a lack of definitive benefit and because of potential complications. By contrast, the administration of base for the treatment of chronic metabolic acidosis is associated with improved cellular function and few complications.

### Acute kidney injury, plasma lactate concentrations and lactic acidosis in metformin users: a goDarts study [^adc36786]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Metformin is the first‐line treatment of Type 2 diabetes recommended in both national and international guidelines. Metformin has an extremely favourable clinical profile: it is weight neutral, does not cause hypoglycaemia, and is superior to equivalent sulphonylurea or insulin therapy in the reduction of cardiovascular and all‐cause mortality. 1 However, adverse reactions to this drug are common, with as many as 30% of metformin users developing gastrointestinal side‐effects. 2

One risk associated with metformin use is the development of lactic acidosis, a potentially fatal condition. Lactic acidosis is defined as an elevated blood lactate concentration (> 5 mmol/L) along with a decreased blood pH (< 7.35) and an increased anion gap. 3 The exact mechanism responsible for this condition is not fully understood; however, it is likely a consequence of metformin inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, thereby promoting anaerobic metabolism and lactate accumulation. 4 This condition has a mortality of up to 50% per episode, 5 and is believed to occur at a rate of about 1 per 23 000 to 30 000 person‐years of metformin use. 6

### Sodium bicarbonate in treating lactic and non-lactic metabolic acidosis at different chloride levels: a retrospective study [^f022dd9b]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, subgroup analysis of patients with metabolic acidosis revealed that sodium bicarbonate treatment does not improve the survival outcomes for pediatric patients, regardless of whether they have lactic acidosis or non-lactic acidosis. However, it was observed that sodium bicarbonate treatment effectively reduces the mortality risk of patients with hyperchloremia (chloride ≥ 113 mmol/L) in both types of patients, while it increases the mortality risk of patients without hyperchloremia (chloride < 107 mmol/L). This indicates that the level of lactate does not influence the impact of chloride levels on sodium bicarbonate treatment.

Among non-LA patients with a chloride level of ≥ 113 mmol/L, there was no statistically significant difference in the in-hospital mortality risk between patients who received sodium bicarbonate treatment after matching and those who did not. This is because the mortality rate of non-LA patients themselves is relatively low, and the reduction in sample size after matching leads to a decrease in statistical power. Nevertheless, the mortality rate of patients who received sodium bicarbonate treatment was still lower. Findings of this study suggest that in pediatric metabolic acidosis, if chloride is markedly elevated, sodium bicarbonate therapy might be considered even if lactate is high. Whereas if chloride is normal, clinicians should be more cautious and ensure other treatments are prioritized.

The categorization of metabolic acidosis patients based on the presence of lactic acidosis divides them into two groups with potentially distinct acidosis mechanisms. There is a considerable difference in the acidic components contributing to pH reduction in these two group patients. In vitro cytological studies have demonstrated that the body's response to acidosis induced by lactate or hydrochloric acid involves different cytokine reactions, suggesting that the response to and harm caused by various acid components may vary. Research on prognostic indicators for patients has shown that the severity of acidosis, as measured by pH or standard base excess, is not independently linked to hospital mortality when controlling for the causal anion (lactate, chloride, or others). The anion causing the metabolic acidosis may play a more significant role in determining outcomes than the pH itself. Different levels or categories of causal anions can result in significantly diverse prognoses, although the importance of the acidosis cause has been emphasized in previous research. Nevertheless, this study found that sodium bicarbonate can decrease the mortality risk in patients with both lactic and non-lactic acidosis with hyperchloremia. This suggests that the mechanism of action of sodium bicarbonate may not be dependent on the components causing the acidosis and is effective in correcting acidosis resulting from multiple pathological mechanisms in hyperchloremia.

### Metformin: safety in cardiac patients [^f8e83b8f]. Heart (2010). Low credibility.

Metformin is a biguanide, insulin sensitiser that reduces blood sugar levels. There are concerns about the risk of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin who have procedures requiring iodinated contrast, and in those with renal impairment or heart failure. The data on which these concerns are based are reviewed, with the conclusion that metformin treatment is rarely to blame for lactic acidosis. A generic policy of stopping metformin 48 h before and 48 h after the procedure in all patients is counterintuitive, lacks any evidence base and does not conform to the principles of best practice. In patients with heart failure, although the underlying condition can predispose to lactic acidosis, existing evidence suggests that metformin use is associated with improved outcome rather than increased risk.

In non-LA patients, it was also observed that sodium bicarbonate treatment increased the risk of death when chloride levels were < 107 mmol/L, and decreased the risk of death when chloride levels were ≥ 113 mmol/L (Fig. 4). The impact of sodium bicarbonate treatment on in-hospital mortality also interacted with the chloride level (p < 0.001, Additional file 1, Table S1). After matching the baseline characteristics among patients with a chloride level of ≥ 113 mmol/L, although patients treated with sodium bicarbonate had a lower in-hospital mortality rate, the difference was not statistically significant (Additional file 1, Table S2 and Table S4).

In LA patients, when chloride levels were < 107 mmol/L, those who received sodium bicarbonate experienced higher in-hospital mortality and 28-day mortality, with adjusted OR values of 2.195 (95% CI: 1.536 — 3.135, p < 0.001) and 2.07 (95% CI: 1.434 — 2.989, p < 0.001), respectively. Conversely, when chloride levels were ≥ 113 mmol/L, patients who received sodium bicarbonate had lower in-hospital mortality and 28-day mortality, with adjusted OR values of 0.365 (95% CI: 0.217 — 0.614, p < 0.001) and 0.396 (95% CI: 0.232 — 0.675, p = 0.001), respectively. Among the patients with a chloride level of ≥ 113 mmol/L, after matching the baseline characteristics of the two groups of patients who received sodium bicarbonate treatment and those who did not, those treated with sodium bicarbonate had a lower risk of death (Additional file 1, Table S2 and Table S3). In cases where the chloride level fell between the two thresholds, sodium bicarbonate treatment did not affect in-hospital mortality or 28-day mortality (Fig. 3). The impact of sodium bicarbonate treatment on in-hospital mortality had an interaction effect with the chloride level (p < 0.001, Additional file 1, Table S1).

### Metformin hydrochloride (Riomet) [^b7c305df]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

5.1 Lactic Acidosis

There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin‑associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.
If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of RIOMET. In RIOMET treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.
Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue RIOMET and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.
For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:
Before initiating RIOMET, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
RIOMET is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2[see Contraindications (4)].
Initiation of RIOMET is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.
Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking RIOMET. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.
In patients taking RIOMET whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.
Renal impairment — The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.
The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:
Before initiating RIOMET, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
RIOMET is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2[see Contraindications (4)].
Initiation of RIOMET is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.
Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking RIOMET. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.
In patients taking RIOMET whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.
Drug interactions — The concomitant use of RIOMET with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients [see Drug Interactions (7)].
Age 65 or greater — The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.
Radiologic studies with contrast — Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop RIOMET at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart RIOMET if renal function is stable.
Surgery and other procedures — Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. RIOMET should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.
Hypoxic states — Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue RIOMET.
Excessive alcohol intake — Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving RIOMET.
Hepatic impairment — Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of RIOMET in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.

### Severe metabolic or mixed acidemia on intensive care unit admission: incidence, prognosis and administration of buffer therapy. A prospective, multiple-center study [^82bc1ed7]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

"Acidemia" can be defined as the accumulation of protons in the plasma which results in a lower blood pH if secondary responses are overwhelmed. In critically ill patients, acidosis is often the result of a combination of single disorders occurring simultaneously that are commonly known collectively as "mixed acid-base disorders".

Although "severe acidemia" is not a universally accepted term, it usually indicates that plasma pH is lower than 7.20. Severe acidemia can be critical, especially when an extremely low pH develops quickly. Clinical manifestations of severe acidemia include cerebral edema, seizures, diaphragm dysfunction, decreased myocardial contractility, pulmonary vasoconstriction and systemic vasodilatation. Acidemia is a potentially life-threatening condition, and previous studies have described the incidence and mechanisms of acidosis occurring in the ICU. Surprisingly, however, these studies failed to focus specifically on severe acidemia. Furthermore, despite the fact that severe acidemia reflects a serious underlying disease that should be treated as soon as possible, the treatment of acidemia by itself with the administration of intravenous buffers remains controversial. Indeed, notwithstanding experts' opinions arguing against treatment with intravenous buffers except in dedicated situations (for example, massive digestive fluid loss during diarrhea or tubular acidosis), 86% of polled US nephrologists indicated that they would prescribe buffers to treat lactic acidosis in patients with a targeted pH above 7.20. Moreover, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign suggests not treating lactic acidosis when the plasma pH level is above 7.15, but does not give any recommendations for cases where the plasma pH level is below this threshold. To date there have been only two small, prospective, randomized crossover studies assessing the impact of sodium bicarbonate treatment for lactic acidosis on hemodynamic, acid-base and electrolyte changes. Both studies included 24 patients and could not address any difference in terms of morbidity and mortality with regard to whether the patients had first been treated with sodium bicarbonate.

Therefore, we had two aims in our study. First, we sought to describe the incidence of severely metabolic or mixed acidemia patients admitted to the ICU. Second, we wanted to describe the outcomes of patients who had been treated at the onset of acidemia (within the first 24 hours of ICU admission) with intravenous sodium bicarbonate compared with those who had not. We hypothesized that severe acidosis within the 24 first hours after ICU admission is an infrequent phenomenon but that its correction rather than its initial severity is associated with prognosis.

It can be appropriately produced under stress conditions and rapidly eliminated through cellular metabolism. The increase in lactate accumulation serves more as an indicator of the body's response to stress feedback. The emphasis on lactic acid itself contributing to the harm of acidosis may have been unnecessarily emphasized. Furthermore, the idea that anaerobic transport, tissue hypoxia, and resulting anaerobic glycolysis are key driving factors for lactic acidosis in sepsis has also been questioned. In this case, it can be reasonably explained to some extent why lactate levels do not affect the efficacy of sodium bicarbonate treatment.

In addition to using alkaline agents to correct pH values, continuous renal replacement has been advocated to remove lactate. Unfortunately, in the presence of shock, lactate generation excesses its clearance by continuous renal replacement. While no other types of alkalis have been proven to be effective and available, sodium bicarbonate remains the preferred alkalis for clinicians. Administration of sodium bicarbonate can have several side effects, including hypernatremia, hypocalcemia, elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO₂), it may even lead to increased lactate production. Therefore, some scholars do not advocate the use of sodium bicarbonate in patients with non-toxic causes of metabolic acidosis. Some studies have observed that the staged use of sodium bicarbonate in the treatment of hypoperfusion lactic acidosis caused by septic shock can reduce the incidence of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, mechanical ventilation time, ICU and hospitalization time, and mortality rate. Other studies have also found that sodium bicarbonate is not an appropriate treatment for acute pancreatitis patients with hyperparathyroidism (lactate > 2.0 mmol/L), and does not improve hemodynamics in critically III patients who have lactic acidosis. The findings of this study do not contradict conclusions of these studies but refine them. Neither of these studies disclosed nor paid attention to the baseline chloride levels of patients.

### Early lactate-guided therapy in intensive care unit patients: a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial [^e33886b3]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Rationale

It is unknown whether lactate monitoring aimed to decrease levels during initial treatment in critically ill patients improves outcome.

Objectives

To assess the effect of lactate monitoring and resuscitation directed at decreasing lactate levels in intensive care unit (ICU) patients admitted with a lactate level of greater than or equal to 3.0 mEq/L.

Methods

Patients were randomly allocated to two groups. In the lactate group, treatment was guided by lactate levels with the objective to decrease lactate by 20% or more per 2 hours for the initial 8 hours of ICU stay. In the control group, the treatment team had no knowledge of lactate levels (except for the admission value) during this period. The primary outcome measure was hospital mortality.

Measurements and Main Results

The lactate group received more fluids and vasodilators. However, there were no significant differences in lactate levels between the groups. In the intention-to-treat population (348 patients), hospital mortality in the control group was 43.5% (77/177) compared with 33.9% (58/171) in the lactate group (P = 0.067). When adjusted for predefined risk factors, hospital mortality was lower in the lactate group (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.43–0.87; P = 0.006). In the lactate group, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were lower between 9 and 72 hours, inotropes could be stopped earlier, and patients could be weaned from mechanical ventilation and discharged from the ICU earlier.

Conclusions

In patients with hyperlactatemia on ICU admission, lactate-guided therapy significantly reduced hospital mortality when adjusting for predefined risk factors. As this was consistent with important secondary endpoints, this study suggests that initial lactate monitoring has clinical benefit. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00270673).

### Metformin-associated lactic acidosis [^52d87ff0]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

In 1995, the oral antihyperglycemic agent, metformin, was introduced in the United States for treating diabetes mellitus. Rare cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis caused by the accumulation of the drug in patients with renal dysfunction have been described, although a detailed time course of the resulting metabolic derangements has not been reported. A case of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is presented along with key serial laboratory abnormalities observed during the treatment phase. The patient made a complete recovery following therapy with hemodialysis and supportive care.

Antiretroviral therapy–associated lactic acidosis — clinical features, risk factors, monitoring, and management are outlined as follows: Dyspnea and peripheral neuropathy are listed manifestations, and patients may present with acute multiorgan failure (e.g., fulminant hepatic failure, pancreatic failure, respiratory failure). Risk factors include Preterm Infants or Any Neonates Who Have Not Attained a Postmenstrual Age of 42 Weeks and a Postnatal Age of ≥ 14 Days and exposure to propylene glycol used as a diluent in LPV/r oral solution. For Patients With Clinical Signs or Symptoms Consistent With Lactic Acidosis, obtain blood lactate level and additional diagnostic evaluations should include serum bicarbonate, anion gap, and/or arterial blood gas; amylase and lipase; serum albumin; and hepatic transaminases; blood for lactate determination should be collected and processed within 4 hours of collection. Management includes Anecdotal (Unproven) Supportive Therapies — administer bicarbonate infusions, THAM (tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane), high doses of thiamine and riboflavin, and oral antioxidants (e.g. L-carnitine, co-enzyme Q10, vitamin C). Following resolution of abnormalities, resume therapy either with an NRTI-sparing regimen or a revised NRTI-containing regimen, and institute a revised NRTI-containing regimen with caution using NRTIs that are less likely to induce mitochondrial dysfunction (i.e. ABC, TAF, TDF, FTC, or 3TC); lactate should be monitored monthly for ≥ 3 months. Management can be initiated before receiving the results of the confirmatory test.

### Sodium bicarbonate therapy for patients with severe metabolic acidaemia in the intensive care unit (BICAR-ICU): a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled, phase 3 trial [^0958b73f]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Acute acidaemia is frequently observed during critical illness. Sodium bicarbonate infusion for the treatment of severe metabolic acidaemia is a possible treatment option but remains controversial, as no studies to date have examined its effect on clinical outcomes. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate whether sodium bicarbonate infusion would improve these outcomes in critically ill patients.

Methods

We did a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled, phase 3 trial. Local investigators screened eligible patients from 26 intensive care units (ICUs) in France. We included adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) who were admitted within 48 h to the ICU with severe acidaemia (pH ≤ 7.20, PaCO₂ ≤ 45 mm Hg, and sodium bicarbonate concentration ≤ 20 mmol/L) and with a total Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score of 4 or more or an arterial lactate concentration of 2 mmol/L or more. We randomly assigned patients (1:1), by stratified randomisation with minimisation via a restricted web platform, to receive either no sodium bicarbonate (control group) or 4.2% of intravenous sodium bicarbonate infusion (bicarbonate group) to maintain the arterial pH above 7.30. Our protocol recommended that the volume of each infusion should be within the range of 125–250 mL in 30 min, with a maximum of 1000 mL within 24 h after inclusion. Randomisation criteria were stratified among three prespecified strata: age, sepsis status, and the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) score. The primary outcome was a composite of death from any cause by day 28 and the presence of at least one organ failure at day 7. All analyses were done on data from the intention-to-treat population, which included all patients who underwent randomisation. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02476253.

Findings

Between May 5, 2015, and May 7, 2017, we enrolled 389 patients into the intention-to-treat analysis in the overall population (194 in the control group and 195 in the bicarbonate group). The primary outcome occurred in 138 (71%) of 194 patients in the control group and 128 (66%) of 195 in the bicarbonate group (absolute difference estimate -5.5%, 95% CI -15.2 to 4.2; p = 0.24). The Kaplan-Meier method estimate of the probability of survival at day 28 between the control group and bicarbonate group was not significant (46% [95% CI 40–54] vs 55% [49–63]; p = 0.09. In the prespecified AKIN stratum of patients with a score of 2 or 3, the Kaplan-Meier method estimate of survival by day 28 between the control group and bicarbonate group was significant (37% [95% CI 28–48] vs 54% [45–65]; p = 0.0283). Metabolic alkalosis, hypernatraemia, and hypocalcaemia were observed more frequently in the bicarbonate group than in the control group, with no life-threatening complications reported.

Interpretation

In patients with severe metabolic acidaemia, sodium bicarbonate had no effect on the primary composite outcome. However, sodium bicarbonate decreased the primary composite outcome and day 28 mortality in the a-priori defined stratum of patients with acute kidney injury.

### Metformin, sulfonylureas, or other antidiabetes drugs and the risk of lactic acidosis or hypoglycemia: a nested case-control analysis [^ef20a3a2]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Metformin plays a pivotal role in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. Metformin decreases basal glucose output by suppressing gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in liver and increasing glucose disposal in muscle tissue. As the most worrisome complication, lactic acidosis (pH < 7.37 and/or plasma lactate levels > 4 mmol/l) continues to be discussed in the literature even though the absolute risk appears to be low, with incidence rates of lactic acidosis associated with metformin use ranging from 1 to 16.7 cases per 100,000 patient-years. Salpeter et al. identified all trials and cohort studies conducted between 1959 and 2002 and did not find a single case of lactic acidosis in 36,893 person-years of metformin exposure. Lalau and Race analyzed 49 cases of lactic acidosis associated with metformin use; overall mortality was not correlated with plasma lactate concentrations. Interestingly, plasma metformin concentrations were, on average, three times higher in patients who survived. All case subjects with lactic acidosis had, in addition to metformin use, acute or chronic comorbidities predisposing to lactic acidosis. These data suggest that lactic acidosis may be coincidental rather than causally associated with metformin use.

### Metformin hydrochloride er (metformin hydrochloride) [^aea56e77]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

WARNINGS

Lactic Acidosis:

Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 μg/mL are generally found.

The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP treatment should not be initiated in patients ≥ 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS).

### L-arginine in mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes: a systematic review [^0b8e195c]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Stroke management in the context of primary mitochondrial disease is clinically challenging, and the best treatment options for patients with stroke-like episodes remain uncertain. We sought to perform a systematic review of the safety and efficacy of l-arginine use in the acute and prophylactic management of stroke-like episodes in patients with mitochondrial disease.

Methods

The systematic review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020181230). We searched 6 databases from inception to January 15, 2021: MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Original articles and registered trials available, in English, reporting l-arginine use in the acute or prophylactic management of stroke-like episodes in patients with genetically confirmed mitochondrial disease were eligible for inclusion. Data on safety and treatment response were extracted and summarized by multiple observers. Risk of bias was assessed by the methodologic quality of case reports, case series, and a risk-of-bias checklist for nonrandomized studies. Quality of evidence was synthesized with the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence and Grade of Recommendations. The predetermined main outcome measures were clinical response to l-arginine treatment, adverse events, withdrawals, and deaths (on treatment and/or during follow-up), as defined by the author.

Results

Thirty-seven articles met inclusion criteria (0 randomized controlled trials; 3 open-label; 1 retrospective cohort; 33 case reports/case series) (N = 91 patients; 86% m.3243A > G). In the case reports, 54% of patients reported a positive clinical response to acute l-arginine, of which 40% were concomitantly treated with antiepileptic drugs. Improved headache at 24 hours was the greatest reported benefit in response to IV l-arginine in the open-label trials (31 of 39, 79%). In 15 of 48 patients (31%) who positively responded to prophylactic l-arginine, antiepileptic drugs were either used (7 of 15) or unreported (8 of 15). Moderate adverse events were reported in the follow-up of both IV and oral l-arginine treatment, and 11 patients (12%) died during follow-up or while on prophylactic treatment.

Discussion

The available evidence is of poor methodologic quality and classified as Level 5. IV and oral l-arginine confers no demonstrable clinical benefit in either the acute or prophylactic treatment of mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes, with more robust controlled trials required to assess its efficacy and safety profile.

### Metformin overdose: time to move on… [^26fa1f1c]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Does metformin-associated lactic acidosis really exist? Despite an old controversy, there is no doubt about it. But do we understand what is going on? Laboratory findings raised several hypotheses explaining the pathophysiology of this disease. The main cause could be an inhibition of either gluconeogenesis or mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I. From bench to bedside, one hypothesis is now confirmed in humans. Metformin poisoning involves, at least partially, a mitochondrial dysfunction.

Metformin — usage, gastrointestinal effects, and lactic acidosis risk in type 2 diabetes are described: It is prescribed to 84% of people with type 2 diabetes in the United Kingdom, may cause diarrhea, and 25% experience some form of digestive tract disturbance upon starting the medication. There is a known risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis at a rate of 2 to 5 per 100,000, with elevated serum creatinine the greatest predisposing risk factor. Concurrent use with diuretics including acetazolamide has not been directly assessed but is a concern for precipitating lactic acidosis, and exercise while using metformin alone is known to be safe with no dose adjustments recommended.

### Sodium bicarbonate in treating lactic and non-lactic metabolic acidosis at different chloride levels: a retrospective study [^fc20e780]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The acid secretion is completed by the kidneys in the intercalated cells of the late distal tubule and collecting duct, where hydrogen ions are produced by catalyzing the dissolution of carbon dioxide through carbonic anhydrase. Hydrogen ions and potassium ions are exchanged into the tubular lumen. Most of the excreted uric acid is neutralized by ammonium ions, forming ammonium chloride secretion, while releasing bicarbonate into the plasma, effectively exchanging chloride for bicarbonate. If hyperchloremia or bicarbonate loss occurs, the kidneys need time to recover from this deficiency through renal tubular acid excretion. When hyperchloremia and bicarbonate loss occur simultaneously (which happens to be the case with hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis), there is not enough bicarbonate exchange chloride, leading to further accumulation of chloride ions in the blood and increasing the risk of death. Supplementing exogenous bicarbonate enables the smooth exchange and elimination of chloride compounds, restoring the balance of hydrogen-potassium ion exchange, and thus correcting acidosis. This may be one of the mechanisms by which sodium bicarbonate is effective in treating hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Recently, it has also found that hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis potentially benefit from sodium bicarbonate therapy in adult patients. It is crucial to note the limitations of this study when interpreting the results. Firstly, this is a single-center retrospective analysis with all patients being children. secondly, the treatment measures for other abnormal acid–base balance parameters were not disclosed. Several other potential confounding factors, such as organ function, have not been comprehensively accounted for. Again, lactic acidosis is divided into type A, which occurs when there is reduced oxygen delivery to tissues from severe hypoxemia or reduced perfusion, and type B, which is due to impaired mitochondrial function, which this study was unable to differentiate.

### Sodium bicarbonate injection, (Sodium bicarbonate) [^ae70a91b]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP is indicated in the treatment of metabolic acidosis which may occur in severe renal disease, uncontrolled diabetes, circulatory insufficiency due to shock or severe dehydration, extracorporeal circulation of blood, cardiac arrest and severe primary lactic acidosis. Sodium bicarbonate is further indicated in the treatment of certain drug intoxications, including barbiturates (where dissociation of the barbiturate-protein complex is desired), in poisoning by salicylates or methyl alcohol and in hemolytic reactions requiring alkalinization of the urine to diminish nephrotoxicity of hemoglobin and its breakdown products. Sodium bicarbonate also is indicated in severe diarrhea which is often accompanied by a significant loss of bicarbonate. Treatment of metabolic acidosis should, if possible, be superimposed on measures designed to control the basic cause of the acidosis - e.g., insulin in uncomplicated diabetes, blood volume restoration in shock. But since an appreciable time interval may elapse before all of the ancillary effects are brought about, bicarbonate therapy is indicated to minimize risks inherent to the acidosis itself.

Vigorous bicarbonate therapy is required in any form of metabolic acidosis where a rapid increase in plasma total C02 content is crucial - e.g., cardiac arrest, circulatory insufficiency due to shock or severe dehydration, and in severe primary lactic acidosis or severe diabetic acidosis.

### Does metformin increase the risk of fatal or nonfatal lactic acidosis?… [^788df8fd]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Does metformin increase the risk of fatal or nonfatal lactic acidosis. Evidence-Based Answer In patients without standard contraindications to metformin therapy, metformin does not increase the risk of lactic acidosis.

1. Practice Pointers The first-line treatments recommended for type 2 diabetes are lifestyle changes and metformin, which is a biguanide antihyperglycemic agent. 2 Demonstrated benefits of metformin include lower cardiovascular mortality than other oral diabetes medications 3 and a reduced risk of death or myocardial infarction in overweight patients with type 2 diabetes. 4 However, because an earlier biguanide, phenformin, was removed from the market after being linked to several cases of lactic acidosis, there have been concerns that metformin may predispose patients to lactic acidosis as well.

Nevertheless, the review authors suggest that concerns for lactic acidosis with metformin use may be overstated for the following three reasons. First, despite chemical similarities, phenformin and metformin have different mechanisms of action. Whereas phenformin can impair hepatic oxidative phosphorylation and increase anaerobic lactate production, metformin inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis without affecting lactate turnover. 1 The reality of current clinical practice is that 54 to 73 percent of patients taking metformin have at least one standard contraindication to its use, and the review authors note that strict adherence to recommended contraindication guidelines would reduce the number of patients with diabetes being treated with metformin by about one half. 1 Because metformin has clear patient-oriented benefits and no demonstrable risk of lactic acidosis in low-risk patients, it should remain a first-line treatment option for patients with type 2 diabetes.

Patients with contraindications to metformin may also be those who potentially stand to benefit the most from metformin therapy. Although this Cochrane review does not specifically address the safety of metformin in the presence of contraindications, it suggests that even in the presence of one contraindication, the benefits of metformin use may outweigh the risks. There was no difference in lactate levels, either as mean treatment levels or as a net change from baseline, for metformin compared with non-metformin therapies. Authors' Conclusions: There is no evidence from prospective comparative trials or from observational cohort studies that metformin is associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis or with increased levels of lactate compared with other antihyperglycemic treatments.

Vigorous bicarbonate therapy is required in any form of metabolic acidosis where a rapid increase in plasma total CO2content is crucial - e.g., cardiac arrest, circulatory insufficiency due to shock or severe dehydration, and in severe primary lactic acidosis or severe diabetic acidosis.

### L-arginine in mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes: a systematic review [^55008950]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Data Extraction

Data extraction from included articles was performed independently by 2 authors (R.J.S. and Y.S.N.) The data extracted included article study design, patient demographics, genetic diagnosis, clinical presentation of stroke-like episodes, sample size, additional treatments, interventional details (dose, route, time of administration from symptom onset, treatment duration, length of follow-up), clinical outcome response (concomitant antiepileptic drug [AED] treatment), adverse events (AEs), trial withdrawals, and deaths on treatment and during follow-up.

Risk of Bias

Risk of bias was assessed by 2 authors independently (R.J.S. and Y.S.N.). We used a recently developed tool for evaluating the methodologic quality of individual case reports and case series. e1 The overall quality appraisal for each case report or case series was classified according to the number of questions satisfied across any domains of ascertainment, causality, and reporting; ≥ 3 questions = good quality, 2 questions = poor quality, 1 or 0 questions = very poor quality. Risk of bias for all other articles was assessed with a checklist for nonrandomized studies. e2 Articles were deemed to have an overall high risk of bias if their analyses did not adjust for (or report) the influence of confounders as deemed by the investigators (i.e. use of AEDs) and if participant withdrawals were likely to introduce bias. The quality of evidence for individual studies was rated and synthesized with the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine's (OCEBM's) Levels of Evidence (March 2009) and Grades of Recommendation. e3 In relation to therapy, evidence can range from Level 1 (systematic review [with homogeneity] of randomized controlled trials) to Level 5 (expert opinion without explicit critical appraisal or based on physiology). In between (in descending strength of evidence), major levels include Level 2(a), a systematic review of cohort studies; Level 2(b), individual cohort studies (or lower-quality randomized controlled trials); Level 3(a), systematic reviews (with homogeneity) of case-control studies; Level 3(b), individual case-control studies; and Level 4, case-series (and poor-quality cohort and case-control studies). A Grade of Recommendation will thereafter be adapted, ranging from A (consistent Level 1 studies) to D (Level 5 evidence).

### Recognising and managing albuterol-induced lactic acidosis [^cee02940]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Patient's perspective

When I first started experiencing shortness of breath, I assumed it was just my COPD acting up. I had been using my albuterol inhaler more frequently, thinking it would help, but things only got worse. I ended up in the emergency room, and that's when they noticed my elevated lactate levels. At first, I was really scared, I didn't know what was causing it, and I feared the worst, like sepsis. The doctors ran so many tests, and I'm grateful they finally figured out that it was the albuterol causing the problem. Once they adjusted my treatment, I started feeling better almost immediately. Looking back, I wish I had known that using my inhaler too much could cause something like this. It's been a relief to recover, and now I'm much more careful with my medication. I'm thankful for the care I received and the thoroughness of the doctors in figuring this out.

Learning points

Recognise albuterol as a potential cause of lactic acidosis, especially in patients with elevated lactate levels without signs of tissue hypoxia or infection; it should be considered in the differential diagnosis.
Adjusting the frequency of albuterol administration may effectively resolve the acidosis, preventing unnecessary diagnostic investigations and avoiding the need to discontinue bronchodilator therapy.
Early identification of albuterol-induced lactic acidosis can streamline patient care by avoiding extensive workups and treatments aimed at sepsis or other causes, ensuring more efficient and targeted management.

### Drug treatment of inborn errors of metabolism: a systematic review [^41a03b4f]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2013). Low credibility.

Despite the various challenges that face the development of evidence-based practice in patients with IEM, therapeutic trials are still being conducted and may pave the way for more evidence-based therapeutic interventions for these disorders. Substrate reduction therapies and molecular chaperone therapies are examples of two therapeutic modalities with active ongoing clinical trials in some IEM (http://www.clinicaltrial.gov).

This review has several limitations and gaps and caution should be used when accessing the information in the online. These limitations include the fact that knowledge of IEM is continuously and dynamically changing and it may not be long before the information in this review is outdated. Secondly, the existing tools frequently used for EBM such as the OCEBM grading system, were mainly designed for common disorders rather than rare diseases. This renders critical appraisal of the evidence very difficult and may be inaccurate or misleading. For example, although many studies reach level 1 evidence, all were measuring surrogate markers as the primary end point, which may not necessarily correlate with significant clinical outcomes. For example, dichloroacetate has been used for the treatment of congenital lactic acidosis in case series. When examined in an RCT, it was shown to reduce lactate, a surrogate marker, but was not associated with improved neurological or clinical outcome. Third, some medications have reached level 1 evidence when used for disorders other than IEM, but the evidence supporting their use in metabolic disorders is derived only from case reports. For example, the use of baclofen to treat spasticity in patients with glutaric aciduria type 1 12 is based on its use for treating spasticity in children with cerebral palsy. 15

In summary, clinicians face several challenges and obstacles as they try to select the appropriate dosages of medications to treat their patients with IEM. Using the currently available evidence for these decisions may help resolve some of these difficulties until standard guidelines and recommendations are published.

### L-arginine in mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes: a systematic review [^cf2e38ff]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

The presence or absence of AEs was not consistently reported, and when serious AEs were documented, their causal relationship with-arginine was invariably disputed. Clinicians and patients with MELAS syndrome should be made aware of the potential serious complications associated with high doses, long-term use, and limited monitoring of-arginine, which include hyperkalemia, profound metabolic acidosis requiring dialysis, and, in some instances, sudden death. e4-e6 This is particularly pertinent in those individuals with significant cardiac or renal impairment or persistent lactic acidemia.

The limitations of this systematic review are related to the small body of literature available and the potential impact of the genetic and clinical heterogeneity in mitochondrial disease contributing to the-arginine treatment response. Additional methodologic limitations relate to the inclusion of nonrandomized studies, predominantly lacking a comparison group, and the lack of standardized outcome measures across studies used to assess treatment response. Most studies available were case reports with a high risk of bias, including insufficient reporting and ascertainment. Studies included were difficult to compare due to differences in interventional parameters (dose, regimen, length of treatment, time of administration, simultaneous treatment with AEDs) and assessment of response to treatment (i.e. outcome measures used, methodology, timing of response). In this respect, a lack of heterogeneity across studies precluded a meta-analysis.

Despite its limitations, this systematic review had several strengths such as a prespecified protocol, a comprehensive search strategy, an absence of article eligibility restrictions to allow greater inclusion, and standardized assessment of risk of bias, culminating in a comprehensive and objective summary of the evidence that could be useful in guiding clinical practice and future research.

Our findings demonstrate that-arginine has a very limited efficacy in the acute and prophylactic treatment of stroke-like-episodes (Level V evidence). The risk of AEs could not be determined with certainty from the current published data. These findings highlight that methodologically robust clinical trials are imperative to address the remaining uncertainty relating to the treatment of-arginine in patients with MELAS syndrome. Because stoke-like episodes are increasingly recognized as evolving brain syndromes driven by seizure activity, seizure treatments, including infusions of AEDs or use of anesthesia agents, should be prioritized in these patients. While there are potential cultural differences in shared decision-making for medical practice in rare diseases globally, we would encourage mitochondrial experts to share this information about-arginine with patients and colleagues to allow them to make an informed decision.

### Recognising and managing albuterol-induced lactic acidosis [^f75f1f75]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

In cases of suspected albuterol-induced lactic acidosis, the primary management involves reducing the frequency of beta-adrenergic agonist administration. In most cases, lactate levels normalise within 24 to 72 hours after adjusting the albuterol dose or frequency. Supportive care, including intravenous fluids and monitoring of metabolic parameters, is typically sufficient to manage these patients. Discontinuation of beta-adrenergic agonists is rarely necessary, as reducing the frequency of administration is usually effective in resolving acidosis.

We considered metformin-associated lactic acidosis as a differential diagnosis in our case. However, since our patient was not on metformin or any biguanide medications, this aetiology was effectively ruled out. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is an extremely rare event, with an estimated incidence of 0.03 to 0.06 per 1000 patient-years. Evidence suggests that metformin alone rarely causes lactic acidosis and, when it does, it is typically in the presence of underlying risk factors such as renal impairment, sepsis or tissue hypoxia. A systematic review from the Cochrane Library, analysing 347 comparative trials and cohort studies, found no cases of fatal or non-fatal lactic acidosis and no significant difference in plasma lactate levels between metformin-treated and non-metformin-treated groups.

The case presented here illustrates the importance of recognising albuterol as a potential cause of lactic acidosis. The patient, who was treated with frequent albuterol nebulisations for a COPD exacerbation, developed significant lactic acidosis in the absence of tissue hypoxia. After ruling out sepsis and other causes of lactic acidosis, we reduced the frequency of albuterol treatments, leading to the normalisation of the patient's lactate levels. Clinicians should be aware of this potential side effect of beta-adrenergic agonists, particularly in patients who develop hyperlactataemia without signs of tissue hypoxia or infection.

In clinical practice, elevated lactate levels often trigger concerns for sepsis, prompting extensive investigations. This case emphasises the need for clinicians to consider albuterol-induced lactic acidosis as a differential diagnosis in patients receiving high doses of beta-adrenergic agonists, especially when other causes of lactic acidosis have been ruled out. Recognising this condition can prevent unnecessary investigations for sepsis and treatments, such as empirical antibiotics or aggressive fluid resuscitation, which may not be warranted.

### Fulminant lactic acidosis in two patients with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin [^998a4648]. Diabetic Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis is a known adverse risk of metformin treatment. We report two cases in whom fulminant lactic acidosis developed during treatment. There were no contraindications to metformin treatment and both were admitted with abdominal discomfort for some days, causing dehydration. Both patients had renal failure on admission, developed multiple organ failure and both suffered a massive stroke. One patient died and the other survived but is severely disabled. We suggest, in both cases, that acute renal failure developed as a result of dehydration, causing metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis. We recommend that all patients on metformin should consider discontinuation of metformin treatment in the event of a severe medical condition causing dehydration.

### Hemodynamic consequences of severe lactic acidosis in shock states: from bench to bedside [^ceed8519]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Is lactic acidosis harmful for cardiovascular function?

Regulation of the intracellular and extracellular pH of cardiac or vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is essential for the maintenance of a stable hemodynamic status. As alluded to above, regardless of the mechanism involved, lactate generation in shock states leads to a drop in intracellular and extracellular pH and most often to hemodynamic failure. Whether this severe lactic acidosis is a causal contributor to multiple organ failure or simply a biomarker of the patient's critical state remains an ongoing debate. In this situation, severe lactic acidosis in experimental studies always causes negative effects on cardiovascular function while its correction negates its protective effects. Again, no human study has so far clearly replicated these same experimental findings.

In the following sections, the hemodynamic consequences of lactic acidosis at both the cellular and functional level are described. However, a cautious interpretation must be made of the available data. In fact, a large portion of the published experimental data used non-organic acid to induce metabolic acidosis. Therefore, the number of relevant and published studies centered on the effects of acidosis induced by an accumulation of extracellular lactate reducing SID and lowering extracellular pH by proton generation is somewhat limited. By hypothetical reasoning, it is usually accepted that the effects of lactic acidosis may overlap with those of metabolic acidosis. Nevertheless, in the following sections, the manner in which acidosis is induced will be specified for each included reference; that is, the hypoxic lactic acidosis model (LAM) or non-organic acidosis model (NOAM). It is likely that some of the hemodynamic effects reported in hypoxic LAMs are also induced in part by hypoxia. However, the latter remains the most widely used model to induce an endogenous and homogenous shock-associated lactic acidosis. In addition, when acidosis is induced via NOAM, the cited text will systematically carry the mention that the study involved metabolic acidosis including lactic acidosis.

### Glyburide and metformin hydrochloride (Glucovance) [^bfcfee77]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis:

Lactic
acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due
to metformin accumulation during treatment with GLUCOVANCE (Glyburide and
Metformin HCl) Tablets; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of
cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic
conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant
tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated
blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances
with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When
metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma
levels > 5 µg/mL are generally found.

The
reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride
is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately
0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure
to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis.
Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant
renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion,
often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and
multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring
pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive
heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased
risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree
of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may,
therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function
in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin.
In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring
of renal function. GLUCOVANCE treatment should not be initiated in patients
 ≥ 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that
renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing
lactic acidosis. In addition, GLUCOVANCE should be promptly withheld in the
presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis.
Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear
lactate, GLUCOVANCE should generally be avoided in patients with clinical
or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against
excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking GLUCOVANCE,
since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate
metabolism. In addition, GLUCOVANCE should be temporarily discontinued prior
to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see
also PRECAUTIONS).

### Serum lactate level and mortality in metformin-associated lactic acidosis requiring renal replacement therapy: a systematic review of case reports and case series [^2a506e03]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Our study suggests that predialysis level of serum lactate level is an important marker of mortality in MALA patients requiring RRT with a linear dose-response relationship. There is no differential survival advantage among RRT modalities and significant knowledge gaps remain regarding the optimal timing, mode, and dose of RRT. Standardization of MALA case report form would be the fundamental step toward guideline development.

### Autosomal dominant transmission of transient neonatal lactic acidosis: a case report [^4c8c37b2]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Lactic acid is an anaerobic metabolite that tends to accumulate whenever cellular respiration is inadequate to meet cellular energy requirements. Commonly, lactic acidosis reflects acquired mitochondrial dysfunction due to impaired tissue oxygenation ('shock'). In neonates, hyperlactatemia is commonly observed in sepsis, hypoxic-ischemic injury, and congenital heart disease. When secondary, blood lactate levels mirror the patient's clinical state, resolving with correction of the underlying disease process. Primary lactic acidosis that is inappropriate to the clinical context suggests an inborn error of cellular energy metabolism. Collectively, these primary lactic acidoses are numerous. They are genetically heterogeneous with disorders of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation or pyruvate metabolism accounting for most cases. Because the mitochondrion is complex, comprising the products of > 1000 distinct nuclear genes, genetic diagnosis of primary mitochondrial disorders is rarely found, occurring only in ~ 25–50% of cases. With few exceptions (e.g. holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency, which is treatable with biotin, and pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, which is somewhat treatable with the ketogenic diet), specific treatments are lacking, and many patients die in infancy or childhood. Here we detail the case of a father and daughter with dominantly-inherited, resolving (i.e. transient) neonatal hyperlactatemia due to transient complex IV deficiency. No previous description of such an autosomal dominant form of benign, transient complex IV appears to exist in the literature; this reiterates the increasing differential diagnosis for lactic acidosis in a neonate.

5.1 Lactic Acidosis

Metformin

Lactic acidosis is a serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with JENTADUETO and is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels of > 5 µg/mL are generally found.

The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin is approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, (with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal impairment, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia due to unstable or acute failure, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin treatment should not be initiated in any patient unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic impairment. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake when taking metformin, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure necessitating restricted intake of food or fluids. Use of topiramate, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, in epilepsy and migraine prophylaxis may cause dose-dependent metabolic acidosis and may exacerbate the risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
