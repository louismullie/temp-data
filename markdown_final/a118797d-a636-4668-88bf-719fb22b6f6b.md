## Question

How many days of vancomycin give to nasal mrsa positive patient

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many days of vancomycin should be given to a patient who is MRSA nasal positive. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the MRSA nasal positivity represents colonization versus active infection. Then, I should verify whether vancomycin is indicated at all for colonization alone. Next, I will consider the clinical syndrome driving therapy, because duration depends on the infection site and severity. After that, I should review guideline-based durations for common MRSA infections. Finally, I will integrate stewardship principles and the role of MRSA nasal swabs in de-escalation decisions, and I will clarify decolonization protocols that are not vancomycin-based.

> Let me first confirm the foundational point: a positive MRSA nasal swab indicates colonization, not infection, so vancomycin is not indicated to treat colonization itself. Treatment is reserved for documented MRSA infection at a clinical site, and colonization should be managed with decolonization and infection control measures rather than systemic antibiotics [^112Pjwjk] [^111xQHjZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check the clinical context. If the patient has no signs of infection, the correct approach is decolonization with intranasal mupirocin and chlorhexidine bathing, not vancomycin therapy, and this strategy reduces transmission and subsequent infection risk in appropriate settings such as ICUs and preoperative patients [^111xQHjZ].

> Now, if there is an active MRSA infection, I should confirm the syndrome because duration hinges on site and severity. For skin and soft tissue infection, uncomplicated cases typically require about 5 days, extending if not improved; for severe infections or those with systemic features, therapy may extend to 7–14 days or longer depending on response and source control [^114pSATx] [^115p3xNL]. For hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia due to MRSA, the usual duration is 7 days, with longer courses reserved for slow clinical response or complications, aligning with ATS/IDSA guidance [^114b2STY] [^116hX9Lw]. For MRSA bacteremia or endocarditis, treatment is generally 2–6 weeks depending on source control and complications, and for osteomyelitis, 4–6 weeks or more is typical, with durations individualized to clinical response and surgical management [^112L2BTk] [^114D2QMm].

> Wait, let me verify the role of the nasal swab in guiding therapy once infection is suspected. A negative MRSA nasal swab has a high negative predictive value for MRSA pneumonia and can support de-escalation or discontinuation of empiric vancomycin when cultures are negative and the patient is improving, whereas a positive nasal swab increases the pretest probability of MRSA infection and supports continuing empiric coverage until cultures return [^114Hfoiy] [^113awncb] [^117FDBva].

> I should double-check stewardship checkpoints that influence duration decisions. Guidelines and stewardship statements recommend reassessing antibiotics at 48–72 hours, using culture data, clinical response, and MRSA nasal results to de-escalate or stop unnecessary vancomycin; pharmacist-driven 72-hour vancomycin restrictions and MRSA PCR algorithms have reduced vancomycin use without harming outcomes, reinforcing the principle of shortest effective duration aligned with clinical response [^115BgRBb] [^112DCcte] [^113FmWcn].

> But wait, what if someone is conflating decolonization with treatment? I need to ensure I clearly separate them. Decolonization uses topical agents such as mupirocin and chlorhexidine over about 5 days and is not a substitute for treating active infection; conversely, systemic vancomycin is not used to eradicate colonization and should be reserved for documented infections with guideline-directed durations based on site and severity [^111xQHjZ] [^112L2BTk].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line: there is no fixed number of vancomycin days for a "nasal MRSA positive patient" per se. Vancomycin is indicated only if there is a documented MRSA infection, with durations ranging from about 5 days for uncomplicated SSTI, 7 days for most HAP/VAP, 2–6 weeks for bacteremia/endocarditis depending on complications, and 4–6 weeks or more for osteomyelitis, all adjusted to clinical response and source control, while colonization alone should be managed with decolonization rather than vancomycin therapy [^114pSATx] [^114b2STY] [^112L2BTk] [^111xQHjZ].

---

Vancomycin is **not indicated for MRSA nasal colonization alone**; it should only be used if there is a documented MRSA infection. If MRSA colonization is confirmed, **decolonization with mupirocin ± chlorhexidine is recommended** [^111xQHjZ] for 5 days, and vancomycin should be stopped if started empirically and no infection is found. Vancomycin duration is guided by the site and severity of infection, typically 7–14 days for most infections, and 2–6 weeks for bacteremia or endocarditis. Prolonged vancomycin use increases nephrotoxicity risk and should be avoided unless treating confirmed infection [^117WmoTN].

---

## Clinical significance of MRSA nasal colonization

MRSA nasal colonization is a **significant risk factor** for subsequent MRSA infections, including pneumonia, bacteremia, and surgical site infections [^111xQHjZ]. However, colonization alone does not equate to active infection, and **treatment with vancomycin is not indicated** in the absence of clinical evidence of infection [^112UnrHo].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA), and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) provide clear recommendations on managing MRSA nasal colonization:

- **Vancomycin is not indicated** for MRSA nasal colonization alone without evidence of active infection [^notfound].
- **Decolonization strategies**, such as intranasal mupirocin with or without chlorhexidine baths, are recommended for patients at high risk of MRSA infection, such as those undergoing surgery or with specific medical devices [^111xQHjZ] [^113BBqch].
- **Empiric vancomycin** should be discontinued if MRSA colonization is confirmed but no active infection is identified [^115BgRBb].

---

## Indications for vancomycin use in MRSA-colonized patients

Vancomycin is indicated for MRSA-colonized patients **only when there is documented active infection** [^112UnrHo]. Common indications include:

- **Pneumonia**: Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with confirmed MRSA infection [^114b2STY] [^115ynTJ8].
- **Bacteremia**: Confirmed MRSA bacteremia or endocarditis [^113gmvdb].
- **Skin and soft tissue infections**: Severe infections requiring intravenous therapy [^115p3xNL].
- **Bone and joint infections**: Osteomyelitis or prosthetic joint infections caused by MRSA [^114D2QMm].

---

## Recommended duration of vancomycin therapy

The duration of vancomycin therapy **varies depending on the site and severity** of infection:

| **Infection type** | **Recommended duration** |
|-|-|
| Pneumonia (HAP, VAP, CAP) | 7–14 days [^notfound] |
| Bacteremia (without endocarditis) | 10–14 days [^notfound] |
| Endocarditis | 4–6 weeks [^notfound] |
| Skin and soft tissue infection (severe) | 10–14 days [^notfound] |
| Bone and joint infection (osteomyelitis) | 4–6 weeks [^notfound] |

---

These durations are **evidence-based** and align with current IDSA and ATS/IDSA guidelines [^116hX9Lw] [^112L2BTk].

---

## Risks and adverse effects of prolonged vancomycin use

Prolonged vancomycin therapy carries **significant risks**, including:

- **Nephrotoxicity**: Increased risk with prolonged use, higher doses, and concomitant nephrotoxic agents [^117WmoTN].
- **Ototoxicity**: Rare but potential adverse effect [^notfound].
- **Clostridioides difficile infection**: Increased risk with prolonged antibiotic exposure [^notfound].
- **Development of resistance**: Prolonged use may promote vancomycin-resistant organisms [^111trsSw].

Given these risks, vancomycin should be used judiciously and discontinued promptly when no longer indicated [^115BgRBb].

---

## Alternative strategies for MRSA nasal colonization management

When MRSA nasal colonization is confirmed without active infection, **alternative strategies** should be employed:

- **Decolonization**: Intranasal mupirocin with or without chlorhexidine baths is recommended for high-risk patients, such as those undergoing surgery or with specific medical devices [^111xQHjZ] [^113BBqch].
- **Infection control measures**: Strict adherence to hand hygiene, contact precautions, and environmental cleaning protocols [^112Pjwjk].
- **Monitoring**: Regular surveillance and reassessment for signs of active infection [^112Pjwjk].

---

## Clinical outcomes and effectiveness of vancomycin in MRSA-colonized patients

Vancomycin is effective in treating confirmed MRSA infections, but **its effectiveness in colonized patients without active infection is limited**. Prolonged use in colonized patients without documented infection does not significantly reduce colonization rates or prevent subsequent infections and increases the risk of adverse effects and resistance development [^112BgAn8].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Vancomycin is **not indicated** for MRSA nasal colonization alone. It should only be used when there is documented active infection, with duration guided by the site and severity of infection. Prolonged vancomycin use without confirmed infection should be avoided due to potential adverse effects and resistance development. Alternative strategies, such as decolonization and infection control measures, should be employed for colonized patients without active infection [^111xQHjZ].

### Effectiveness of a bundled intervention of decolonization and prophylaxis to decrease Gram positive surgical site infections after cardiac or orthopedic surgery: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113ws4Sj]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Although multiple studies have assessed the efficacy of interventions to prevent surgical site infections caused by Gram positive bacteria, these interventions are not uniformly applied to surgical patients. Our results showed that nasal decolonization was associated with decreased rates of Gram positive surgical site infections and Staphylococcus aureus surgical site infections among patients undergoing cardiac or orthopedic surgical procedures. However, these results remained statistically significant for S aureus surgical site infections, though not all Gram positive surgical site infections, when the meta-analysis was limited to randomized controlled trials. Additionally, a bundle that included nasal decolonization and glycopeptide prophylaxis for patients who carried methicillin (meticillin) resistant S aureus (MRSA) was associated with significantly decreased rates of surgical site infections caused by Gram positive bacteria and by S aureus.

We also found that routine use of prophylactic glycopeptides protected against MRSA infections but not against all Gram positive surgical site infections. Additionally, dual prophylaxis with a glycopeptide and another antimicrobial agent seemed to be more protective against Gram positive surgical site infections than prophylaxis with glycopeptides alone. This finding is consistent with studies of methicillin susceptible S aureus (MSSA) bacteremia, which found that vancomycin is less effective than a β lactam antibiotic for treating MSSA infections. These results are similar to the conclusions of a recent review article, which stated that vancomycin is not recommended for preoperative prophylaxis but may be considered as a component of an MRSA bundle to prevent surgical site infections.

Our meta-analyses were the first to assess a bundle that included nasal decolonization and targeted glycopeptide prophylaxis for MRSA carriers. Other meta-analyses have assessed nasal decolonization or glycopeptide prophylaxis alone, and our results confirm the findings of the previous studies and extend these by including the results of recent studies. Future meta-analyses should assess other outcomes associated with these interventions. These outcomes could include duration of hospital stay since one group of researchers found that the mean duration of hospital stay was significantly shorter in those randomized to mupirocin and chorhexidine gluconate rather than to placebo. Future meta-analyses should also confirm our preliminary findings that these interventions do not open a niche for pathogens other than S aureus to fill, and should also analyze other patient populations such as those requiring trauma surgery to determine if these findings are generalizable to other surgical specialties.

Summary of Recently Approved Antibiotics for the Treatment of Acute Bacterial Skin and Structure Infection

The emergence of community-associated MRSA strains has greatly influenced the selection of empirical antibiotic therapy for ABSSSIs. To provide adequate empirical coverage for MRSA, an understanding of local microbial epidemiologic patterns and susceptibility patterns is essential. For the treatment of an abscess, the IDSA guidelines recommend, in addition to incision and drainage, administration of an antibiotic active against MRSA when the initial antibiotic treatment has failed or when the patient has immunosuppression, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), or hypotension. For cellulitis and erysipelas, including an antibiotic with activity against MRSA and group A streptococcus is recommended when the infection is associated with penetrating trauma or when there is evidence of MRSA infection, MRSA colonization, injecting drug use, or SIRS. Further, including an antimicrobial agent active against MRSA in the treatment of surgical wound infections is recommended in patients with risk factors for infection by this microorganism (nasal colonization or prior infection, hospitalization, or recent antibiotic administration). Anti-MRSA agents for ABSSSIs include vancomycin, which is considered the first-line parenteral treatment of serious MRSA infections in hospitalized patients, as well as linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline (Table 3). Other agents with reliable MRSA activity that have been approved for ABSSSIs include ceftaroline, tedizolid, dalbavancin, oritavancin, and telavancin. Additional factors for administering these medications include tolerability, formulation, cost, and dosing limitations associated with these agents, such as vancomycin-related nephrotoxicity and linezolid-associated myelosuppression.

Adult community-acquired pneumonia — use of rapid MRSA nasal testing — The data supporting rapid MRSA nasal testing are robust, and treatment for MRSA pneumonia can generally be withheld when the nasal swab is negative, especially in nonsevere CAP; however, when the nasal swab is positive, coverage for MRSA pneumonia should generally be continued, blood and sputum cultures should be sent, and therapy can be deescalated if cultures are negative.

### Mrsa bone and joint… [^1131cRoq]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

In patients with MRSA pneumonia complicated by empyema, antimicrobial therapy should be used with drainage procedures. CHILDREN In children, intravenous vancomycin is recommended for treating MRSA pneumonia. If the patient is stable without ongoing bacteremia or intravascular infection, clindamycin can be used as empiric therapy if the clindamycin resistance rate is low. Patients can be transitioned to oral therapy if the strain is susceptible. Linezolid is an alternative option. ADULTS In patients with normal renal function, intravenous vancomycin is recommended, but should not exceed 2 g per dose. In seriously ill patients with suspected MRSA infection, a loading dose of 25 to 30 mg per kg may be considered.

Because of the risk of red man syndrome and possible anaphylaxis associated with large doses of vancomycin, physicians should consider prolonging the infusion time to two hours and giving an antihistamine before administering the loading dose. Use of trough vancomycin concentrations is the most accurate and practical method to guide vancomycin dosing. Serum trough concentrations should be obtained at steady state conditions, before the fourth or fifth dose. Monitoring peak vancomycin concentrations is not recommended. Vancomycin trough concentrations of 15 to 20 mcg per mL are recommended in patients with serious infections, such as bacteremia, infective endocarditis, osteomyelitis, meningitis, pneumonia, or severe skin and soft-tissue infections caused by MRSA. Vancomycin Susceptibility Testing for Guiding Therapy For isolates with a vancomycin minimal inhibitory concentration of 2 mcg per mL or less, the patient's clinical response should dictate the continued use of vancomycin, independent of the minimal inhibitory concentration. If the patient has had a previous clinical and microbiologic response to vancomycin, it may be continued with close follow-up.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^1168RBuT]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Similarly, addition of vancomycin or linezolid to treat MRSA is often considered in patients with clinical deterioration. Risk of acquisition of MRSA during hospitalization varies but is generally uncommon if good infection prevention practices are in place. The negative predictive value of MRSA nasal swabs (via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or culture) is high; thus, if the MRSA nasal screening test is negative then it is reasonable to either discontinue or forgo the addition of anti-MRSA empiric therapy.

One additional caveat regarding non-responders relates to appropriate drug and adequate dose of antibiotics. For example, if vancomycin is prescribed for MRSA, but therapeutic levels take 4 days to achieve, one could see a clinical decline or non-response to treatment. Similarly, if daptomycin was started for other reasons, it would not be expected to cover a secondary pneumonia with MRSA because it is inactivated by pulmonary surfactant. Underdosing of beta-lactam antibiotics directed at Gram-negative organisms occurs frequently, although patients in the ICU with sepsis have altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics that can result in increased clearance of antibiotics. For these reasons, many ICUs preferentially administer beta-lactam agents via continuous or extended infusion.

### Positive preoperative colonization with methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus is associated with inferior postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty [^1158ER5D]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The impact of preoperative nasal colonization with methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) on total joint arthroplasty (TJA) outcomes is not well understood. This study aimed to evaluate complications following TJA based on patients' preoperative staphylococcal colonization status.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed all patients undergoing primary TJA between 2011 and 2022 who completed a preoperative nasal culture swab for staphylococcal colonization. Patients were 1:1:1 propensity matched using baseline characteristics, and stratified into 3 groups based on their colonization status: MRSA positive (MRSA+), methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus positive (MSSA+), and MSSA/MRSA negative (MSSA/MRSA-). All MRSA+ and MSSA + underwent decolonization with 5% povidone iodine, with the addition of intravenous vancomycin for MRSA + patients. Surgical outcomes were compared between groups. Of the 33,854 patients evaluated, 711 were included in final matched analysis (237 per group).

Results

The MRSA + TJA patients had longer hospital lengths of stay (P = 0.008), were less likely to discharge home (P = 0.003), and had higher 30-day (P = 0.030) and 90-day (P = 0.033) readmission rates compared to MSSA+ and MSSA/MRSA-patients, though 90-day major and minor complications were comparable across groups. MRSA + patients had higher rates of all-cause (P = 0.020), aseptic (P = 0.025) and septic revisions (P = 0.049) compared to the other cohorts. These findings held true for both total knee and total hip arthroplasty patients when analyzed separately.

Conclusion

Despite targeted perioperative decolonization, MRSA + patients undergoing TJA have longer lengths of stay, higher readmission rates, and higher septic and aseptic revision rates. Surgeons should consider patients' preoperative MRSA colonization status when counseling on the risks of TJA.

Contact precautions (CP) duration policy components with examples — Policies can define inclusion criteria such as elapsed time since last infection until consideration for discontinuation (eg, 3, 6, 12 months), specify exclusion criteria including concomitant antibiotic use within a specified period (eg, 24–48 hours prior to sampling) or outbreak/hyperendemic contexts, set the number of surveillance samples (1–3), name surveillance sample sources (nares for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA], perirectal for vancomycin-resistant enterococci [VRE] or MDR-E, and stool for VRE or multidrug-resistant Gram-negative rods [MDR-GNR]), define sampling frequency (daily, weekly, biweekly), choose testing methodology (bacterial culture or molecular testing such as polymerase chain reaction [PCR]), and designate both the final arbiter for discontinuation (healthcare epidemiologist, infection preventionist, or other hospital/infectious diseases leadership) and the implementation strategy (clinical staff with Infection Prevention and Control Program assistance versus active monitoring and implementation led by the Infection Control and Prevention Program).

### Preoperative nasal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus status, surgical prophylaxis, and risk-adjusted postoperative outcomes in veterans [^112851x5]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether preoperative nasal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) carriage is a significant predictor of postoperative infections, after accounting for surgical infection risk and surgical prophylaxis.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Patients

Veterans Affairs (VA) Boston patients who had nasal MRSA polymerase chain reaction screening performed in the 31 days before clean or clean contaminated surgery in 2008–2009.

Methods

Postoperative MRSA clinical cultures and infections, total surgical site infections (SSIs), and surgical prophylaxis data were abstracted from administrative databases. MRSA infections were confirmed via chart review. Multivariate analysis of risk factors for each outcome was conducted using Poisson regression. SSI risk index was calculated for a subset of 1,551 patients assessed by the VA National Surgical Quality Improvement Program.

Results

Among 4,238 eligible patients, 279 (6.6%) were positive for preoperative nasal MRSA. Postoperative MRSA clinical cultures and infections, including MRSA SSIs, were each significantly increased in patients with preoperative nasal MRSA. After adjustment for surgery type, vancomycin prophylaxis, chlorhexidine/alcohol surgical skin preparation, and SSI risk index, preoperative nasal MRSA remained significantly associated with postoperative MRSA cultures (relative risk [RR], 8.81; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.01–25.82) and infections (RR, 8.46; 95% CI, 1.70–42.04). Vancomycin prophylaxis was associated with an increased risk of total SSI in those negative for nasal MRSA (RR, 4.34; 95% CI, 2.19–8.57) but not in patients positive for nasal MRSA.

Conclusions

In our population, preoperative nasal MRSA colonization was independently associated with MRSA clinical cultures and infections in the postoperative period. Vancomycin prophylaxis increased the risk of total SSI in nasal MRSA-negative patients.

### Effectiveness of a bundled intervention of decolonization and prophylaxis to decrease Gram positive surgical site infections after cardiac or orthopedic surgery: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116myJoa]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Surgical site infections after cardiac operations or total joint arthroplasties are associated with severe outcomes, including important increases in hospital length of stay, readmission rates, healthcare costs, and mortality rates. Many such infections are thought to be preventable. Consequently, the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services no longer reimburse hospitals for some surgical site infections, including mediastinitis, which per patient can cost over $40 000 (£25 800; €30 700). The high costs of these infections are also detrimental to publicly funded healthcare systems, such as the UK's National Health Service. Additionally, in this era of mandatory reporting, hospitals may soon be required to report rates of surgical site infections publicly, which could lead to more financial repercussions if patients or insurers choose institutions with lower infection rates. Therefore, implementation of an evidence based bundle of interventions to decrease surgical site infections could benefit both patients and hospitals.

The Surgical Care Improvement Project measures recommend preoperative prophylaxis with a β lactam antibiotic for cardiac and orthopedic procedures, unless the patient is known to be at high risk for methicillin (meticillin) resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection or the hospital has a high rate of MRSA related surgical site infections. In those cases, glycopeptide antibiotics such as vancomycin are recommended. Yet, in the wake of extensive publicity about MRSA, many hospitals have implemented additional interventions to prevent surgical site infections with Gram positive bacteria — particularly MRSA — such as providing vancomycin prophylaxis for all surgical patients or decolonizing patients using nasal mupirocin to prevent transmission of S aureus from the nose to the surgical site. However, despite guidelines and numerous studies dealing with the effectiveness of these interventions, researchers and clinicians have not reached consensus on how to optimally prevent Gram positive surgical site infections, and practices are often inconsistent both within and across hospitals.

### Predicting methicillin resistance and the effect of inadequate empiric therapy on survival in patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia… [^111trsSw]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Background The restriction of vancomycin hydrochloride use is recommended as a measure to decrease the emergence of vancomycin resistance in gram-positive organisms; however, vancomycin also is the treatment of choice for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. If vancomycin use is restricted to patients with documented infections due to methicillin-resistant organisms, then patients with MRSA infections may not initially receive vancomycin. This study was performed to determine factors that predict MRSA bacteremia and if ineffective empiric antibiotic therapy increased the risk of death in patients with S aureus bacteremia. Conclusions The results of this study support the safety of the restriction of vancomycin use in patients with clinically significant S aureus bacteremia.

However, patients with a history of MRSA are more likely to have future MRSA infections and should receive empiric therapy using vancomycin for possible S aureus infections, particularly for nosocomial infections. THE RESTRICTION of vancomycin hydrochloride use is recommended as a measure to decrease the emergence of vancomycin resistance in gram-positive organisms, 1 including enterococcus and Staphylococcus aureus; however, vancomycin also is the treatment of choice for methicillin-resistant S aureus infections. 2 If vancomycin use is restricted to patients with documented infections due to methicillin-resistant organisms, then patients with MRSA infections may not receive vancomycin for the first 48 hours of therapy until the cultures are reported as positive for S aureus. Table 1 shows the characteristics of 128 patients with S aureus stratified by oxacillin sodium resistance.

Given the emergence of vancomycin resistance in gram-positive organisms, vancomycin use needs to be carefully monitored, and thus, policies for the empiric use of vancomycin need to be developed. The optimal policy would identify patients at high risk for MRSA bacteremia and allow empiric therapy using vancomycin in this group. Vancomycin should be included in the initial antibiotic regimen of patients with febrile neutropenia and known MRSA colonization. 11 Despite the lack of association between survival and effective empiric therapy, it seems prudent that a patient with a history of MRSA colonization should receive empiric therapy with vancomycin when an infection, which could be caused by S aureus, is suspected.

### Can a nasal and skin decolonization protocol safely replace contact precautions for MRSA-colonized patients? [^116833YH]. American Journal of Infection Control (2020). Medium credibility.

Contact precautions (CP) are employed in United States hospitals in order to prevent transmission of pathogens via supplies, equipment, and health care worker hands. CP is required in many hospitals for both colonized and infected methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) patients. The isolation of colonized patients often results in a high rate of CP, leading some hospitals to abandon CP for MRSA-colonized patients without adding any safety measure to address transmission risk. Understanding this risk, 7 network hospitals in a US health care system made the decision to replace CP for high-risk MRSA-colonized patients with targeted nasal and body decolonization, leading to significant cost savings and staff satisfaction without any increase in MRSA transmission.

### Prevalence of methicillin-resistant (MRSA) in respiratory cultures and diagnostic performance of the MRSA nasal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia [^113Tzwy1]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Patients requiring hospitalization for COVID-19 are often admitted with a severe pneumonia and critical illness. Given the severity of illness and a lack of data on superinfections, MRSA is often a clinical concern, and we noted frequent empiric use of vancomycin, especially in those who were more severely ill.

Respiratory cultures were not frequently obtained, reflecting the concern that suctioning or sputum induction would cause aerosolization. Those who got respiratory cultures, however, tended to be more severely ill, the very group in which a MRSA coinfection would be most concerning. Even in this more severely ill group, MRSA was not commonly identified as a respiratory copathogen, especially early in the course of admission. The prevalence increased with prolonged hospital stay, implying that it is more likely to be a hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated complication than a community-acquired coinfection. Nevertheless, rates still remained low further into admission. Our findings suggest that continued empiric usage of vancomycin for pneumonia in patients with COVID-19 is likely not warranted. Clinicians should remain guided by local epidemiologic data; notably, however, the Bronx has had the highest rates of MRSA infections in New York City. Additionally, our findings are in keeping with decreasing rates of MRSA infections across the United States in recent years.

Given the low prevalence, we found excellent diagnostic performance of the MRSA nares PCR test, with 100% negative predictive value, confirming that the MRSA nares PCR test remains an important stewardship tool to guide discontinuation of anti-MRSA antibiotics, if started empirically for pneumonia in patients with COVID-19.

### Perioperative management of neurosurgical patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^111cGKA2]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2010). Low credibility.

Object

The emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has posed a challenge in the treatment of neurosurgical patients. The authors investigated the impact of MRSA colonization and infection in the neurosurgical population at a community-based, tertiary care referral center.

Methods

Hospitalized patients under the care of the Kaiser Permanente inpatient neurosurgery service were prospectively entered into a database. In Phase I of the study, 492 consecutive patients were followed. Per hospital policy, the 260 patients from this group who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) underwent screening for MRSA based on nasal swab cultures and a review of their medical history for prior MRSA infections. These patients were designated as either MRSA positive (17 patients, 6.5% of screened patients) or MRSA negative (243 patients). The 232 patients admitted to non-ICU nursing units did not undergo MRSA screening and were designated as unscreened. In Phase II of the study, the authors reviewed 1005 neurosurgical admissions and completed a detailed chart review in 62 MRSA-positive patients (6.2%). Eleven patients received nonoperative treatment. Five patients presented with community-acquired neurosurgical infections, and the causative organism was MRSA in 3 cases. Forty-six patients underwent 55 procedures, and the authors reviewed their perioperative management.

Results

In Phase I of the study, the authors found that for the MRSA-positive, MRSA-negative, and unscreened groups, the rates of postoperative neurosurgical wound infections caused by all pathogens were 23.5, 4.1, and 1.3%, respectively. For MRSA wound infections, the rates were 23.5, 0.8, and 0%, respectively. In Phase II, patients with MRSA were noted to have the following clinical features: male sex in 63%, a malignancy in 39.1%, diabetes in 34.8%, prior MRSA infection in 21.7%, immunosuppressed state in 17.4%, and a traumatic injury in 15.2%. The rate of postoperative neurosurgical wound infection in patients who received MRSA-specific prophylactic antibiotic therapy (usually vancomycin) was 7.4% (27 procedures) compared with 32.1% (28 procedures) in patients who received the standard treatment (usually cefazolin) (p = 0.04). Wound care for ICU patients was standardized for postoperative Days 0–7 with chlorhexidine cleaning at bandage changes at 3-day intervals. Wound cultures from neurosurgical site infections in patients with prior MRSA colonization or infection grew MRSA in 7 of 11 patients.

Conclusions

Neurosurgical patients identified with MRSA colonization or a prior history of MRSA infections benefit from specific perioperative care, including prophylactic antibiotics active against MRSA (such as vancomycin) and postoperative wound care with coverings and chlorhexidine antisepsis to reduce MRSA wound colonization.

### The role of negative methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus nasal surveillance swabs in predicting the need for empiric vancomycin therapy in intensive care unit patients [^117FDBva]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2018). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVES The role of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) nasal surveillance swabs (nasal swabs) in guiding decisions about prescribing vancomycin is unclear. We aimed to determine the likelihood that patients with negative MRSA nasal swabs develop subsequent MRSA infections; to assess avoidable vancomycin days for patients with negative nasal swabs; and to identify risk factors for having a negative nasal swab and developing a MRSA infection during the intensive care unit (ICU) stay. METHODS This retrospective cohort study was conducted in 6 ICUs at a tertiary-care hospital from December 2013 through June 2015. The negative predictive value (NPV), defined as the ability of a negative nasal swab to predict no subsequent MRSA infection, was calculated. Days of vancomycin continued or restarted after 3 days from the collection time of the first negative nasal swab were determined. A matched case-control study identified risk factors for having a negative nasal swab and developing MRSA infection. RESULTS Of 11,441 patients with MRSA-negative nasal swabs, the rate of subsequent MRSA infection was 0.22%. A negative nasal swab had a NPV of 99.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 99.1%-99.6%). Vancomycin was continued or started after nasal swab results were available in 1,431 patients, translating to 7,364 vancomycin days. No risk factors associated with MRSA infection were identified. CONCLUSIONS In our hospital with a low prevalence of MRSA transmission, a negative MRSA nasal swab was helpful in identifying patients with low risk of MRSA infection in whom empiric vancomycin therapy could be stopped and in whom the subsequent initiation of vancomycin therapy during an ICU admission could be avoided.

### Use of surveillance cultures and enteral vancomycin to control methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in a paediatric intensive care unit [^113s9HDf]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2006). Low credibility.

This study assessed the effects of throat and gut surveillance, combined with enteral vancomycin, on gut overgrowth, transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), infections and mortality in patients admitted to a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). A 4-year prospective observational study was undertaken with 1241 children who required ventilation for ≥ 4 days. Patients identified as MRSA carriers following surveillance cultures of throat and rectum received enteral vancomycin. Twenty-nine (2.4%) children carried MRSA, 19 on admission and nine during treatment in the PICU; one patient was not able to be evaluated. Overgrowth was present in 22 (75%) of the carriers. Ten (0.8%) children developed 21 MRSA infections (15 exogenous infections in eight children at a median of 8 days (IQR 3–10.5); five primary endogenous infections at a median of 3 days (IQR 1–25) in three children when they were in overgrowth status; one child developed both types of infection). Enteral vancomycin reduced gut overgrowth significantly, completely preventing secondary endogenous infections. Transmission occurred on nine occasions over a period of 4 years. Four patients died, two (5.9%) with MRSA infection, giving a mortality (11.8%) similar to the study population (9.8%). No emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci or S. aureus with intermediate susceptibility to vancomycin was detected. A policy based on throat and gut surveillance, combined with enteral vancomycin, for critically-ill children who were MRSA carriers was found to be effective and safe, and challenges the recommended guidelines of nasal swabbing followed by topical mupirocin.

### Colonization with antibiotic-susceptible strains protects against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus but not vancomycin-resistant enterococci acquisition: a nested case-control study [^115N6XJS]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Harboring sensitive strains may prevent acquisition of resistant pathogens by competing for colonization of ecological niches. Competition may be relevant to decolonization strategies that eliminate sensitive strains and may predispose to acquiring resistant strains in high-endemic settings. We evaluated the impact of colonization with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and vancomycin-sensitive enterococci (VSE) on acquisition of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), respectively, when controlling for other risk factors.

Methods

We conducted a nested case-control study of patients admitted to eight ICUs performing admission and weekly bilateral nares and rectal screening for MRSA and VRE, respectively. Analyses were identical for both pathogens. For MRSA, patients were identified who had a negative nares screen and no prior history of MRSA. We evaluated predictors of MRSA acquisition, defined as a subsequent MRSA-positive clinical or screening culture, compared to those with a subsequent MRSA-negative nares screen within the same hospitalization. Medical records were reviewed for the presence of MSSA on the initial MRSA-negative nares screen, demographic and comorbidity information, medical devices, procedures, antibiotic utilization, and daily exposure to MRSA-positive patients in the same ward. Generalized linear mixed models were used to assess predictors of acquisition.

Results

In multivariate models, MSSA carriage protected against subsequent MRSA acquisition (OR = 0.52, CI: 0.29, 0.95), even when controlling for other risk factors. MRSA predictors included intubation (OR = 4.65, CI: 1.77, 12.26), fluoroquinolone exposure (OR = 1.91, CI: 1.20, 3.04), and increased time from ICU admission to initial negative swab (OR = 15.59, CI: 8.40, 28.94). In contrast, VSE carriage did not protect against VRE acquisition (OR = 1.37, CI: 0.54, 3.48), whereas hemodialysis (OR = 2.60, CI: 1.19, 5.70), low albumin (OR = 2.07, CI: 1.12, 3.83), fluoroquinolones (OR = 1.90, CI: 1.14, 3.17), third-generation cephalosporins (OR = 1.89, CI: 1.15, 3.10), and increased time from ICU admission to initial negative swab (OR = 15.13, CI: 7.86, 29.14) were predictive.

Conclusions

MSSA carriage reduced the odds of MRSA acquisition by 50% in ICUs. In contrast, VSE colonization was not protective against VRE acquisition. Studies are needed to evaluate whether decolonization of MSSA ICU carriers increases the risk of acquiring MRSA when discharging patients to high-endemic MRSA healthcare settings. This may be particularly important for populations in whom MRSA infection may be more frequent and severe than MSSA infections, such as ICU patients.

### SHEA / IDSA / APIC practice recommendation: strategies to prevent methicillin-resistanttransmission and infection in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^111xQHjZ]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Several randomized clinical trials (discussed below) have shown that decolonization significantly reduces MRSA carriage, transmission, and subsequent infection in patients known to carry MRSA or to be at risk of MRSA acquisition and/or infection. These are discussed below within the specific recommendations.

S. aureus outcomes identified through the literature review for MRSA outcomes have been described due to the relevant interest for healthcare-associated infection (HAI) reduction from S. aureus regardless of susceptibility pattern, but the recommendations are based on available evidence to reduce MRSA.

Few studies of high-quality evidence have evaluated MRSA outcomes in children. Most data supporting the recommendations below have been generated in adult patient populations. When available, pediatric data are noted.

Complications of decolonization therapy are rare and generally mild; however, hospitals should be aware of potential adverse effects, such as drug-related toxicities and development of resistance (eg, mupirocin) or reduced susceptibility (eg, chlorhexidine) to the agents used, when considering the potential benefits and risks of implementing a MRSA or S. aureus decolonization program. –
Use universal decolonization (daily CHG bathing plus 5 days of nasal decolonization) for all patients in adult ICUs to reduce endemic MRSA clinical cultures. (Quality of evidence: HIGH) The previously described REDUCE MRSA Trial demonstrated that universal decolonization of ICU patients with daily CHG bathing and 5 days of twice-daily mupirocin was superior to screening and targeted decolonization as well as to screening and targeted contact precautions for prevention of MRSA-positive clinical isolates and all-cause bloodstream infection.(See Section 4 Additional Approaches for Preventing MRSA, Active Surveillance Testing recommendation.) For determining the applicability of this regimen to hospitals, trial benefit occurred at fairly low endemic levels of > 3 MRSA clinical cultures per 1,000 ICU days. This approach has been demonstrated to be cost-effective, including sparing the cost of screening. Climo et alreported that universal CHG alone in adult ICUs reduced bloodstream infections by 28% and reduced the composite of MRSA and vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) acquisition by 23%. Derde et al (2013)also demonstrated that CHG bathing decreased MRSA acquisition in ICU standardization phases leading up to an RCT that showed no benefit of either conventional or rapid PCR MRSA screening and isolation over high compliance hand hygiene and universal CHG bathing. Even though universal CHG alone does not decolonize carriers, it is effective in reducing transmission of MRSA from carriers to noncarriers in ICUs. Thus, for the purpose of optimally addressing MRSA, the combined effects of mupirocin plus universal CHG are recommended. Finally, although universal decolonization has been found to be superior to screening and targeted decolonization, hospitals may have other reasons for screening patients for MRSA. These may include outbreak response, desire for surveillance data, desire to implement contact precautions for known carriers, and clinical reasons related to restricting empiric anti-MRSA therapy or preoperative vancomycin prophylaxis to known MRSA carriers.
Perform preoperative nares screening with targeted use of CHG and nasal decolonization in MRSA carriers to reduce MRSA SSI in surgical procedures involving implantation of hardware. (Quality of evidence: MODERATE) Note that decolonization can be applied universally as an alternative. Preoperative targeted screening and decolonization of S. aureus carriers is commonly performed for surgical procedures involving the placement of hardware to reduce SSI. Although most studies have evaluated S. aureus outcomes and are not specific to MRSA, a large meta-analysis of RCTs and other studies involving surgeries with hardware similarly found that targeted or universal nasal decolonization reduced S. aureus SSI and that nasal decolonization of MRSA carriers reduced MRSA SSI. S. aureus outcomes were not the target of this guidance document or its search strategy. Nevertheless, we highlight some the S. aureus evidence here because MRSA is a subset of S. aureus. In a large, 20-hospital, interventional cohort study of cardiac, hip, and knee surgeries, targeted nasal decolonization reduced S. aureus SSI. Additionally, in a post-hoc analysis of a single-center RCT of 1,697 patients undergoing arthroplasty or spinal fusion, universal nasal 5% povidone-iodine was superior to universal 2% mupirocin for S. aureus deep SSI. Universal nasal decolonization without nasal screening can be employed for pragmatic reasons to spare the logistics for screening for S. aureus or MRSA. Use of povidone-iodine may also be chosen for pragmatic reasons because it does not require a prescription, including prescription-related transportation needs or insurance copays that may affect patient adherence. Please refer to the "Compendium of Strategies to Prevent Surgical Site Infections in Acute Care Hospitals: 2022 Update"for recommendations regarding decolonization for organisms other than MRSA.
Screen for MRSA and provide targeted decolonization with CHG bathing and nasal decolonization to MRSA carriers in surgical units to reduce postoperative MRSA inpatient infections. (Quality of evidence: MODERATE) Note that decolonization can be applied universally as an alternative. In a multinational trial of 33 surgical units in 10 hospitals involving 126,750 admissions, an intervention of enhanced hand hygiene plus universal screening and targeted decolonization of MRSA carriers reduced MRSA clinical cultures by 12% per month. In a secondary analysis of clean surgical patients, universal screening and targeted decolonization of MRSA carriers reduced MRSA clinical cultures by 15% per month and MRSA infections by 17% per month. S. aureus outcomes were not the target of this guidance document nor its search strategy. Nevertheless, we highlight the key S. aureus evidence here because MRSA is a subset of S. aureus. In an RCT of 1,000 mostly surgical patients that evaluated universal inpatient screening for S. aureus and CHG and mupirocin for identified carriers, a significant 58% reduction was achieved in inpatient S. aureus infection among carriers. In addition, decolonization can reduce postsurgical inpatient infections beyond SSI. The Mupirocin and the Risk of Staphylococcus aureus (MARS) Studywas a 3,864-person RCT of the addition of mupirocin to preoperative chlorhexidine (CHG) for S. aureus carriers undergoing a variety of surgical procedures (ie, general, gynecologic, neurologic, oncologic, and cardiothoracic surgery) with and without hardware. This mupirocin addition significantly decreased nosocomial S. aureus infections by 51% among S. aureus carriers, although it did not significantly reduce S. aureus SSIs.
Provide CHG bathing plus nasal decolonization to known MRSA carriers outside the ICU with medical devices, specifically central lines, midline catheters, and lumbar drains, to reduce MRSA-positive clinical cultures. (Quality of evidence: MODERATE) The Active Bathing to Eliminate Infection (ABATE Infection) Trialwas a 53-hospital cluster-randomized trial involving nearly 340,000 patients comparing routine care to universal decolonization with CHG bathing plus targeted nasal mupirocin for known MRSA carriers. Active screening was not a component of this trial. No overall reduction in the composite outcome of MRSA or VRE carriage, nor all-cause bloodstream infections was detected. However, in a post-hoc analysis, non-ICU patients with medical devices had a significant 37% reduction in MRSA and VRE and a significant 32% reduction in all-cause bloodstream infections. Patients with medical devices (specifically, central lines, midlines, and lumbar drains) were only 10% of inpatients, but they had 37% of MRSA and VRE cultures and 56% of all-cause bloodstream infections.
Consider postdischarge decolonization of MRSA carriers to reduce postdischarge MRSA infections and readmission. (Quality of evidence: HIGH). The Changing Lives by Eradicating Antibiotic Resistance (CLEAR) Trialwas an RCT to decrease postdischarge infections in MRSA carriers comparing routine care to postdischarge decolonization (CHG bathing, CHG mouthwash, nasal mupirocin) given for 5 days twice monthly for 6 months. The trial involved 2,121 MRSA carriers. Decolonization significantly reduced MRSA infection (most requiring rehospitalization) by 30% in the 1-year follow-up period, with a number needed to treat of 30. The impact of a shorter duration of decolonization is not known, but the risk of postdischarge infection was higher with closer proximity to discharge. Postdischarge decolonization was first systematically performed by the Dutch Search and Destroy program to decolonize MRSA carriers to prevent infection. These postdischarge efforts require coordination and investment uncommonly adopted by hospitals. Because population-based medicine continues to be a goal for HAI prevention across the continuum of care, assessments of pragmatic implementation and adherence need to be addressed.
Neonatal ICUs should consider targeted or universal decolonization during times of above-average MRSA infection rates or targeted decolonization for patients at high risk of MRSA infection (eg, low birth weight, indwelling devices, or prior to high-risk surgeries). (Quality of evidence: MODERATE) S. aureus is a leading cause of HAI in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Neonates in the NICU, especially low-birthweight neonates, are at high risk of invasive S. aureus disease. Because most neonates have never left the hospital, neonates usually develop MRSA colonization or infection as a result of hospital-based transmission. Neonates acquire MRSA from colonized parents, HCP, or the environment. MRSA is the most commonly reported cause of NICU outbreaks, so when neonates in the NICU are identified with a hospital-onset MRSA infection, further assessment is warranted to identify an ongoing cluster of transmission. MRSA colonization is an important risk factor for subsequent infection in this population. Quasi-experimental studies have shown that decolonization can reduce MRSA infections during endemic and outbreak settings. Targeted and universal decolonization approaches have both been successfully used to reduce MRSA in this population. – Decolonization reduces MRSA colonization, acquisition and infection in neonates. Decolonization also reduces MSSA colonization and infections in this population. – Mupirocin and chlorhexidine are the most commonly used decolonization agents in NICUs. In a recent RCT, 66 infants were assigned to intranasal mupirocin, and no product-related moderate, serious, or severe adverse events occurred. Chlorhexidine has been safely used in neonates, but due to potential for skin irritation and systemic absorption, it should be used with caution in premature infants. The US Food and Drug Administration notes that chlorhexidine should be "used with care in premature infants or infants under 2 months of age". Chlorhexidine is used widely in NICUs and its use increased from 59% in 2009 to 86% in 2015 in a survey of US NICUs. Chlorhexidine-associated adverse events are infrequent, but many NICUs limit chlorhexidine use, especially in preterm infants within the first month of life. In addition to HCP and the environment, parents can be an important reservoir for S. aureus and can expose their neonates in the NICU. The TREAT PARENTS trial showed that decolonizing parents with intranasal mupirocin and topical chlorhexidine gluconate baths reduced transmission of MRSA and MSSA to neonates in the NICU.
Burn units should consider targeted or universal decolonization during times of above-average MRSA infection rates. (Quality of evidence: Moderate) Higher quality evidence is needed to support a recommendation for routine decolonization of burn patients (unresolved issue). Burn patients are at high risk of MRSA acquisition and infection. Quasi-experimental studies have shown that decolonization can reduce MRSA infections. Decolonization strategies have included universal intranasal mupirocin with chlorhexidine antisepsis, universal decolonization using mupirocin and daily hypochlorous acid solution, and octenidine antisepsis for intact skin and nasal mucosa. – Given inconsistent results on the safety of antiseptics to interfere with wound healing, the role of topical antisepsis in this population for MRSA prevention must carefully balance the risk of toxicity and benefit of preventing MRSA infections. Therefore, the decision to implement targeted or universal decolonization in burn patients should be guided by a local risk assessment of MRSA incidence.
Consider targeted or universal decolonization of hemodialysis patients. (Quality of evidence: MODERATE) Higher-quality evidence is needed to support a recommendation for routine decolonization of dialysis patients. MRSA bloodstream infections complicate care of hemodialysis patients. MRSA colonization predisposes individuals to subsequent MRSA infections, and hemodialysis patients have one of the highest risks of MRSA invasive disease, with a risk of 45 per 1,000 patients, which as 100-fold higher than that of the average population. A systematic review and meta-analysis found that intranasal mupirocin with chlorhexidine body washes can eradicate MRSA carriage in hemodialysis patients. Data are not available demonstrating effectiveness of decolonization on reducing MRSA infections. However, a separate systematic review and meta-analysis found an 82% reduction in the risk of S. aureus bacteremia, comparing those who did and did not receive mupirocin.
Decolonization should be strongly considered as part of a multimodal approach to control MRSA outbreaks. (Quality of evidence: MODERATE) Although no clinical trials have tested strategies to control MRSA outbreaks, many quasi-experimental studies have demonstrated successful outbreak control that includes MRSA decolonization as part of a multimodal approach to reduce MRSA transmission and infection. In outbreak situations, decolonization can protect colonized individuals from infection and reduce colonization pressure that may promote transmission. Intranasal therapy reduces infection risk for individual patients. Topical skin decontamination reduces bioburden and helps reduce organism transmission. Decolonization can be implemented universally or in combination with AST In an outbreak setting, active surveillance cultures can help measure the extent of organism spread in the unit and provide organisms for strain typing. In addition to identifying patients as a reservoir for propagating outbreaks, successful outbreak control may involve screening HCP to detect reservoirs, especially in high-risk units like the neonatal ICU and burn units.HCP have been implicated as reservoirs for MRSA transmission during adult hospital unit and NICU outbreaks and during times of ongoing clonal transmission. After implementation and failure of other basic MRSA prevention and control measures (eg, hand hygiene, contact precautions, enhanced environmental cleaning, screening and decolonizing neonates), screening and decolonizing HCWs has helped successfully control MRSA outbreaks in adult units and NICUs. –

### Use of intranasal mupirocin to prevent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection in intensive care units [^11421J31]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Results

During the first study period with mupirocin use, 912 patients were admitted to the medical ICU, 775 were screened for MRSA (84.5%), 38 were MRSA carriers and 9 were infected with MRSA. During the second period without mupirocin use, 987 patients were admitted, 819 were screened (83.0%), 49 were MRSA carriers and 17 were infected with MRSA (Table 1). The number of endogenous acquired infections was significantly higher during the second period than during the first (11 versus 1; P = 0.006, relative risk = 8.53 (CI95% [1.15–63.21])) although there was no significant difference in the total number of patients infected with MRSA between the two periods. The 12 endogenous acquired infections detected are described in Table 2. In the second period, the delay between the detection of MRSA carriage and the date of the first positive clinical sample was sufficient to implement nasal mupirocin ointment for 7 of the 11 infected patients. Three patients died during the 2 weeks after the MRSA bacteraemia or pneumonia.

We next evaluated the efficiency of nasal mupirocin for MRSA eradication. The rate of nasal MRSA decolonisation among the patients hospitalised for more than 14 days after the discovery of MRSA carriage (delay necessary to evaluate the efficacy of mupirocin) reached 86.4% in period 1 and just 46.4% in period 2 (P = 0.002). Three of the 19 patients who were successfully decolonised during the first period received concomitant treatment with antimicrobials effective against MRSA (namely vancomycin).

The total amount of antibiotics used remained stable during the study period (1,700 DDD per 1,000 hospitalisation days) and the use of glycopeptides did not significantly vary (104 DDD per 1,000 hospitalisation days in the first period and 91 in the second period).

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114pSATx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Erysipelas and cellulitis — evaluation and treatment recommendations are as follows: Cultures of blood or cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs are not routinely recommended (strong, moderate). Cultures of blood are recommended (strong, moderate), and cutaneous and microscopic examination of cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs should be considered in patients with malignancy on chemotherapy, neutropenia, severe cell-mediated immunodeficiency, immersion injuries, and animal bites (weak, moderate). Typical cases of cellulitis without systemic signs of infection should receive an antimicrobial agent that is active against streptococci (mild; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). For cellulitis with systemic signs of infection (moderate nonpurulent SSTI; Figure 1) systemic antibiotics are indicated. Many clinicians could include coverage against MSSA (weak, low). For patients whose cellulitis is associated with penetrating trauma, evidence of MRSA infection elsewhere, nasal colonization with MRSA, injection drug use, or SIRS (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), vancomycin or another antimicrobial effective against both MRSA and streptococci is recommended (strong, moderate). In severely compromised patients (as defined in question 13), broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage may be considered (weak, moderate). Vancomycin plus either piperacillin-tazobactam or imipenem-meropenem is recommended as a reasonable empiric regimen for severe infection (strong, moderate). The recommended duration of antimicrobial therapy is 5 days, but treatment should be extended if the infection has not improved within this time period (strong, high). Elevation of the affected area and treatment of predisposing factors, such as edema or underlying cutaneous disorders, are recommended (strong, moderate). In lower extremity cellulitis, clinicians should carefully examine the interdigital toe spaces because treating fissuring, scaling, or maceration may eradicate colonization with pathogens and reduce the incidence of recurrent infection (strong, moderate). Outpatient therapy is recommended for patients who do not have SIRS, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability (mild nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). Hospitalization is recommended if there is concern for a deeper or necrotizing infection, for patients with poor adherence to therapy, for infection in a severely immunocompromised patient, or if outpatient treatment is failing (moderate or severe nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate).

### Chlorhexidine versus routine bathing to prevent multidrug-resistant organisms and all-cause bloodstream infections in general medical and surgical units (ABATE infection trial): a cluster-randomised trial [^114tkqGo]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Universal skin and nasal decolonisation reduces multidrug-resistant pathogens and bloodstream infections in intensive care units. The effect of universal decolonisation on pathogens and infections in non-critical-care units is unknown. The aim of the ABATE Infection trial was to evaluate the use of chlorhexidine bathing in non-critical-care units, with an intervention similar to one that was found to reduce multidrug-resistant organisms and bacteraemia in intensive care units.

Methods

The ABATE Infection (active bathing to eliminate infection) trial was a cluster-randomised trial of 53 hospitals comparing routine bathing to decolonisation with universal chlorhexidine and targeted nasal mupirocin in non-critical-care units. The trial was done in hospitals affiliated with HCA Healthcare and consisted of a 12-month baseline period from March 1, 2013, to Feb 28, 2014, a 2-month phase-in period from April 1, 2014, to May 31, 2014, and a 21-month intervention period from June 1, 2014, to Feb 29, 2016. Hospitals were randomised and their participating non-critical-care units assigned to either routine care or daily chlorhexidine bathing for all patients plus mupirocin for known methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) carriers. The primary outcome was MRSA or vancomycin-resistant enterococcus clinical cultures attributed to participating units, measured in the unadjusted, intention-to-treat population as the HR for the intervention period versus the baseline period in the decolonisation group versus the HR in the routine care group. Proportional hazards models assessed differences in outcome reductions across groups, accounting for clustering within hospitals. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02063867.

Findings

There were 189081 patients in the baseline period and 339902 patients (156889 patients in the routine care group and 183 013 patients in the decolonisation group) in the intervention period across 194 non-critical-care units in 53 hospitals. For the primary outcome of unit-attributable MRSA-positive or VRE-positive clinical cultures (figure 2), the HR for the intervention period versus the baseline period was 0·79 (0·73–0·87) in the decolonisation group versus 0·87 (95% CI 0·79–0·95) in the routine care group. No difference was seen in the relative HRs (p = 0·17). There were 25 (< 1%) adverse events, all involving chlorhexidine, among 183013 patients in units assigned to chlorhexidine, and none were reported for mupirocin.

Interpretation

Decolonisation with universal chlorhexidine bathing and targeted mupirocin for MRSA carriers did not significantly reduce multidrug-resistant organisms in non-critical-care patients.

### Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America compendium updates 2022 [^1164rZDm]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Active surveillance testing (AST) remains an additional practice but specific recommendations for use of AST in several specific patient populations have been added. First, the panel recommends active surveillance for MRSA in conjunction with decolonization be performed in targeted populations prior to surgery to prevent postsurgical MRSA infection (MODERATE) of interest, in the Compendium 2022 SSI Update, decolonizing surgical patients with an antistaphylococcal agent in the preoperative setting for high-risk procedures, especially orthopedic and cardiothoracic procedures is an essential practice (HIGH). The SSI section addresses both MSSA and MRSA colonization.

As an additional approach, the panel recommends CHG bathing combined with nasal decolonization to known MRSA carriers outside the ICU with medical devices, specifically central lines, mid-line catheters, and lumbar drains, to reduce MRSA clinical cultures (MODERATE). This was based on the ABATE trial (Active Bathing to Eliminate Infection) involving nearly 340 000 patients comparing routine care to universal decolonization with CHG bathing plus targeted nasal mupirocin for known MRSA carriers. In a post hoc analysis, non-ICU patients with medical devices had a significant 37% reduction in MRSA and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and a significant 32% reduction in all-cause bloodstream infections.

A new additional approach was to consider postdischarge decolonization of MRSA carriers to reduce postdischarge MRSA infections and readmission (HIGH). This is supported by a recent RC) to decrease postdischarge infections in MRSA carriers comparing routine care to postdischarge decolonization (CHG bathing, CHG mouthwash, nasal mupirocin) given for 5 days twice monthly for 6 months. The investigators demonstrated that decolonization significantly reduced MRSA infection (most requiring rehospitalization) by 30% by 1 year.

The last additional approach I will discuss is the recommendation that NICUs should consider targeted or universal decolonization during times of above-average MRSA infection rates or targeted decolonization for patients at high risk of MRSA infection (e.g. low birth weight, indwelling devices, or prior to high-risk surgeries) (MODERATE). MRSA is the most reported cause of NICU outbreaks. Targeted and universal decolonization approaches have both been successfully used to reduce MRSA in this population. Mupirocin and CHG are the commonly most used agents.

Empiric Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) coverage — risk factors, nasal swab guidance, and agent considerations: A nasal swab for MRSA can help inform whether initial empiric coverage should include MRSA; in studies without HIV, negative test results have a high negative predictive value for MRSA pneumonia, and if the swab is negative with non-severe pneumonia and no other S. aureus risk factors, empiric MRSA coverage may be withheld (BII). In patients with risk factors for S. aureus infection, vancomycin or linezolid should be added (AII), and empiric coverage should also be added if a rapid nasal swab is positive for MRSA, with de-escalation if cultures are negative (BIII). Although not routinely recommended, clindamycin may be added to vancomycin (but not to linezolid) or linezolid alone used if severe necrotizing pneumonia is present to minimize toxin production (CII). Telavancin can be used for S. aureus pneumonia (BIII), but neither telavancin nor ceftaroline have been specifically studied in patients with HIV; ceftaroline is FDA approved for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia based on studies without MRSA isolates. Daptomycin should not be used to treat pneumonia as it is not active in the lung (AII).

### Effectiveness of a bundled intervention of decolonization and prophylaxis to decrease Gram positive surgical site infections after cardiac or orthopedic surgery: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114pJr7q]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Bundle including decolonization and glycopeptide prophylaxis meta-analysis

Seven quasi-experimental studies assessed infection prevention bundles that utilized both nasal decolonization and glycopeptide prophylaxis. Two studies decolonized MRSA carriers only, two decolonized MRSA carriers and MSSA carriers, and three decolonized all patients in the intervention group; in one of the latter studies, mupirocin treatment was stopped if the results of nares cultures were negative. MRSA carriers received vancomycin for prophylaxis in four studies, vancomycin and cefazolin in two studies, and teicoplanin in one study (see supplementary table 1a). Two of these studies included cardiac operations, three included total joint arthroplasties, and two included general orthopedic surgical procedures (see supplementary table 1a). All of these studies were sufficiently homogeneous and thus could be included in the meta-analyses to assess all outcomes (I 2 = 0%, P > 0.30).

In this meta-analysis, the decolonization and prophylaxis bundle was significantly protective against surgical site infections caused by both Gram positive bacteria (fig 3) and S aureus (table 2). Although this bundle was shown to be significantly protective against MRSA and MSSA surgical site infections, the effect estimate for MRSA surgical site infections was stronger than for MSSA surgical site infections, possibly because glycopeptide prophylaxis was used to prevent the MRSA surgical site infections (table 2).

### Impact of the sequential implementation of a pharmacy-driven methicillin-resistant (MRSA) nasal-swab ordering policy and vancomycin 72-hour restriction protocol on standardized antibiotic administration ratio (SAAR) data for antibiotics used for resistant gram-positive infections [^115CyKdV]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

This study had several limitations. The study period included the COVID-19 pandemic. It is well known that many hospitalized patients presenting with COVID-19 received empiric antibiotics, primarily with third-generation cephalosporins, macrolides, and fluoroquinolones. We were not able to provide details on how often MRSA nasal swabs were ordered by pharmacists among those receiving at least 72 hours of vancomycin. We were not able to determine the numbers of patients for whom vancomycin was approved versus not approved by pharmacists following the 72-hour review nor how often antimicrobial stewardship pharmacists had to be consulted to review the case. Anecdotally, the antimicrobial stewardship pharmacist was infrequently consulted. Notably, the 72-hour vancomycin approval process is a required component of our clinical pharmacist daily activities, so it is expected that all patients that have received > 72 hours of vancomycin therapy have undergone this review. We also assumed in our SAAR analysis that vancomycin was the primary driver in the SAAR value for antimicrobials with activity against resistant gram-positive organisms. This assumption was accurate in that utilization of the other antibiotics used in this SAAR category ranged from 7.5 to 7.9 DOT/1,000 PD, compared to vancomycin, which ranged from 112 to 138 DOT/1,000 PD. We did not assess clinical outcomes in this study to determine whether this strategy posed a detriment to patient outcomes or safety. However, previous studies evaluating the impact of MRSA screening protocols and antibiotic timeout processes that had facilitated higher rates of discontinuation of vancomycin and other antibiotics reported no negative effects on outcomes such as mortality and readmissions. Last, we implemented the 72-hour approval protocol 9 months following the MRSA nasal-swab protocol, giving us a shorter window of time to evaluate the impact on the SAAR and antimicrobial utilization of this one protocol alone. Finally, this timeline may not have been long enough to assess the true impact of the MRSA nasal swab protocol alone.

The sequential implementation of a pharmacist-to-order MRSA nasal swabs protocol and an antimicrobial stewardship supported protocol requiring approval to continue empiric vancomycin beyond 72 hours empowered our clinical pharmacy team to effectively regulate vancomycin durations of therapy. Involving frontline clinicians, such as clinical pharmacists, in stewardship efforts to optimize antimicrobial utilization is an effective strategy.

Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The sequential implementation of a protocol enabling pharmacists-to-order MRSA nasal swabs followed by a protocol requiring clinical pharmacist approval to continue empiric vancomycin beyond 72 hours was an effective strategy to reduce overall vancomycin utilization at our medical center. We observed a sustained reduction in use at 2 years following protocol implementation. Both the SAAR for antibiotics used for resistant gram-positive infections and overall utilization in DOT/1,000 PD was significantly reduced following the interventions.

We introduced a protocol allowing pharmacists to place orders for MRSA nasal swabs for patients started on anti-MRSA therapy 9 months prior to the implementation of the 72-hour approval process, which resulted in an initial reduction in overall utilization. However, this intervention alone did not result in a significant reduction in our SAAR. Prior studies have shown a significant reduction in vancomycin durations of therapy and utilization with pharmacist-driven MRSA nasal-swab protocols, given the high negative predictive value.

Following the implementation of the protocol allowing pharmacists to order MRSA nasal swabs to assess for MRSA colonization, we added a 72-hour approval protocol requiring pharmacists and prescribers to perform an antibiotic timeout to assess continued need for vancomycin beyond 72 hours. Antibiotic timeouts performed after 48–72 hours of initiating empiric antibiotic regimens may be effective in optimizing antimicrobial therapy; they are a strategy recommended by the CDC Core Elements for Antimicrobial Stewardship. In previous studies, antibiotic timeouts in the hospital setting involving vancomycin have been shown to be associated with cost-savings, increased rates of discontinuation, shorter durations of therapy, and reductions in utilization.– Manigaba et alimplemented a strategy in which a 72-hour timeout for vancomycin orders was completed by pharmacists who recommend discontinuation or consultation with the infectious diseases team. To our knowledge, this is the first report of implementing such a protocol to reduce vancomycin utilization and to provide data using the SAAR and DOT/1,000 PD as metrics.

### Antimicrobial selection in the face of nasal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-polymerase chain recombination testing in thermal injury patients [^116mxTfk]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2015). Low credibility.

Emergence of resistance to vancomycin and the increasing incidence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) warrant careful initiation of antimicrobial agents after nasal swab polymerase chain recombination (PCR) MRSA positive screen. Current MRSA PCR nasal swab (PCR) screening does not distinguish non-hospital-acquired strains. A retrospective, institutional review board-approved study of collected PCR screenings among 826 burn center admissions over a 23-month period assessed culture results, antimicrobial agents chosen, and patient demographics. Seventy-seven of the 826 were known chronic carriers (n = 11); had MRSA on initial PCR (n = 48); or converted to positive PCR screen on later testing (n = 18). The 48 patients with initial positive PCR were decolonized with mupirocin. MRSA carriers were not decolonized. The 18 patients who became PCR positive were also not decolonized with 10 having positive cultures. The 48 initial PCR nasal swab positive patients represented 5.8% of admissions. Demographic data did not differ among chronic carriers, initial PCR positive patients, nor those converting to PCR positive. Length of stay was shorter for initial PCR positive decolonized patients (P < < .05) and they had a 35% of decrease in MRSA infection. All 11 chronic carriers became infected with MRSA; however, five had non-hospital-acquired MRSA and two solely non-hospital-acquired MRSA. For the 48 PCR positive patients, 17 had isolated MRSA and one having exclusively non-hospital-acquired MRSA. Of the 39 patients with isolated MRSA, 20 (43%) non-hospital-acquired MRSA. Non-hospital-acquired MRSA was 43%, however PCR fails to distinguish hospital-acquired MRSA from community-acquired MRSA.

### Impact of the sequential implementation of a pharmacy-driven methicillin-resistant (MRSA) nasal-swab ordering policy and vancomycin 72-hour restriction protocol on standardized antibiotic administration ratio (SAAR) data for antibiotics used for resistant gram-positive infections [^111jVQFi]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Vancomycin is often initiated in hospitalized patients; however, it may be unnecessary or continued for longer durations than needed. Oversight of all vancomycin orders may not be feasible with widespread prescribing and strategies to enlist other clinicians to serve as stewards of vancomycin use are needed. We implemented 2 sequential interventions: a protocol in which the pharmacist orders MRSA nasal swab followed by a protocol requiring approval from pharmacists to continue vancomycin for > 72 hours.

Methods

In this single-center, retrospective, quasi-experimental study, we evaluated vancomycin use after implementation of a pharmacy-driven MRSA nasal-swab ordering protocol and a vancomycin 72-hour restriction protocol. The primary outcome was the change in the standardized antibiotic administration ratio (SAAR) for antibacterial agents for resistant gram-positive infections. We also evaluated the impact on antibiotic utilization.

Results

Following the MRSA swab protocol, the SAAR decreased from 1.26 to 1.13 (P < .001; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16–1.25). After the 72-hour approval process, the SAAR was 0.96 (P < .001; 95% CI, 1.0–1.12). Vancomycin utilization decreased from 138.9 to 125.3 days of therapy per 1,000 patient days following the MRSA swab protocol (P < .001) and to 112.7 (P < .001) following the 72-hour approval protocol. Interrupted time-series analysis identified a similar rate of decline in utilization following the 2 interventions (-0.3 and -0.5; p = 0.16). Both interventions combined resulted in a significant reduction (-1.5; P < .001).

Conclusion

Implementation of a pharmacist-driven MRSA nasal-swab ordering protocol, followed by a 72-hour approval protocol, was associated with a significant reduction in the SAAR for antibiotics used in the treatment of resistant gram-positive infections and a reduction in vancomycin utilization. Leveraging the oversight of primary service clinical pharmacists through these protocols proved to be an effective strategy.

### SHEA / IDSA / APIC practice recommendation: strategies to prevent methicillin-resistanttransmission and infection in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^112Pjwjk]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Active surveillance testing (AST)

Active surveillance testing is based on the premise that clinical cultures identify only a small proportion of hospital patients who are colonized with MRSA and that these asymptomatic carriers serve as a substantial reservoir for person-to-person transmission of MRSA in the acute-care hospital. Studies have reported that clinical cultures alone may underestimate the overall hospital prevalence of MRSA by as much as 85% and the monthly average prevalence of MRSA in ICUs by 18.6%–63.5%. AST is used to identify these asymptomatic MRSA carriers so that additional infection control measures (eg, contact precautions, decolonization) can be put into place to decrease the risk of transmission to other patients and HCP and/or to decrease the risk of infection to carriers themselves (decolonization). AST is also used as part of antibiotic stewardship to reduce vancomycin usage, to clear contact precautions, and as part of implementing postdischarge interventions.
Implement a MRSA active surveillance testing (AST) program for select patient populations as part of a multifaceted strategy to control and prevent MRSA. (Quality of evidence: MODERATE). Recommendations for specific populations may have different evidence ratings.
Active surveillance for MRSA in conjunction with decolonization can be performed in targeted populations prior to surgery to prevent postsurgical MRSA infection. (Quality of evidence: MODERATE) A large meta-analysis demonstrated a reduction in MRSA surgical site infection (SSI) when active surveillance was coupled with targeted nasal decolonization of MRSA carriers prior to undergoing surgery with hardware. Several other studies, including large clinical trials, have demonstrated a similar reduction in both SSI and nosocomial disease when employing S. aureus active surveillance and targeted decolonization of carriers. (See MRSA Decolonization, recommendation 2, in the Additional Approaches section.) Please refer to the "Compendium of Strategies to Prevent Surgical Site Infections in Acute Care Hospitals: 2022 Update"for recommendations regarding active surveillance and decolonization for organisms other than MRSA (eg, all S. aureus).
Active surveillance with contact precautions is inferior to universal decolonization for reduction of MRSA clinical isolates in adult ICUs. (Quality of evidence: HIGH) A 43-hospital cluster-randomized trial in ICUs (REDUCE MRSA Trial)directly compared (1) active surveillance for MRSA coupled with contact precautions, (2) active surveillance for MRSA coupled with contact precautions and targeted decolonization, and (3) stopping active surveillance, continuing contact precautions for known MRSA carriers, and performing universal decolonization for all ICU patients. Universal decolonization with chlorhexidine bathing and nasal mupirocin was superior to the other arms, resulting in a 37% reduction in MRSA clinical isolates (from 3.4 per 1,000 ICU days to 2.1 per 1,000 ICU days) and a 44% reduction in all-cause bloodstream infections (6.1 per 1,000 ICU days to 3.6 per 1,000 ICU days). Universal decolonization should be pursued in lieu of targeted actions informed by active surveillance for the purpose of reducing MRSA.
Hospital-wide active surveillance for MRSA can be used in conjunction with contact precautions to reduce the incidence of MRSA infection. (Quality of evidence: MODERATE) Most hospitals across the United States do not perform active surveillance for all patients. However, between 2007 and the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, US Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA) acute-care hospitals conducted hospital-wide active surveillance. In 2007, VA acute-care hospitals nationwide launched a MRSA control program that included universal nasal active surveillance for MRSA, contact precautions for MRSA carriers, hand hygiene, and increased institutional awareness of infection control. This program resulted in significant reductions in healthcare-associated MRSA infections and MRSA transmission in ICU and non-ICU settings. By 2017, hospital-onset MRSA infections at VA hospitals had declined 66% compared to baseline, and hospital-onset MSSA infections had declined 19%. Questions have arisen regarding what aspects of the VA policy led to the decline, especially relative to active surveillance. Questions have also been raised about the generalizability of findings at VA acute-care hospitals to other hospitals. Hospitals that do not want to conduct whole-hospital active surveillance should consider instituting a more targeted policy based on high-risk patients or high-risk encounters. In addition, hospitals should consider using their baseline risk assessment and additional MRSA monitoring and assessments to help guide their decision making.(See the Risk Assessment and Contact Precautions recommendations in the Essential Approaches section above and Section 5 "Performance Measures" below.) Active surveillance testing has cost implications. Cost and yield considerations should be used to help guide cost-effective policies to attain reductions in MRSA transmission and disease. –
Active surveillance can be performed in the setting of a MRSA outbreak or evidence of ongoing transmission of MRSA within a unit as part of a multifaceted strategy to halt transmission. (Quality of evidence: MODERATE). During outbreaks, serial (eg, weekly until outbreak is over) AST can provide important information about the scope of the outbreak, and AST helps identify new cases to enable communication and response (eg, contact precautions, decolonization). See the Decolonization recommendations below for discussion of components of a multimodal strategy. The CDC 2020 NICU guidelines provide information regarding application of this recommendation in the neonatal ICU. See the "Screen HCP for MRSA infection or colonization" recommendation below for additional discussion regarding use of AST for HCP.

### Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci co-colonization [^11617oGN]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Results

During the 2-year cohort period (January 1, 2002–December 31, 2003), 3,090 patients were admitted to the MICU or SICU for a > 5-hour stay. Of these, 2,440 patients (79.0%) had both anterior nares and perirectal admission cultures collected. Sixty-five patients (2.7%) were co-colonized with VRE and MRSA, 247 patients (10.1%) were colonized with VRE alone, and 175 patients (7.2%) were colonized with MRSA alone. Of the 57 MRSA/VRE co-colonized patients with perirectal samples available for additional analysis, 23 patients (40.4%) were perirectally colonized with MRSA in addition to perirectal VRE and MRSA nasal colonization. Results of the bivariable analyses for VRE/MRSA co-colonization are displayed in Table 1. Because of space constraints, bivariable results for colonization by MRSA or VRE alone are not shown. These results suggest that patients colonized with VRE, MRSA, or both were significantly more likely to have been admitted to the MICU, have had previous hospital admissions, and have antimicrobial exposures within 1 year of current admission (p < 0.05 for all). Among co-colonized patients, 58% had been admitted to the index hospital in the previous year, and 51% had received antimicrobial drugs during an admission in the previous year. In addition, ≈48% of MRSA/VRE co-colonized patients had a previous positive culture (clinical or surveillance) for MRSA before the study period, and ≈28% had a previous positive culture for VRE.

### Methicillin-resistant and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus screening and decolonization to reduce surgical site infection in elective total joint arthroplasty [^1169J7cE]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Deep infection after elective total joint arthroplasty remains a devastating complication. Preoperative nasal swab screening for Staphylococcus aureus colonization and subsequent treatment of colonized patients is one proposed method to identify at-risk patients and decrease surgical site infections (SSIs). The purpose of this study was to determine whether a preoperative staphylococcus screening and treatment program would decrease the incidence of SSI in elective joint arthroplasty patients.

Methods

Since January 2009, a total of 9690 patients having an elective joint arthroplasty were screened before surgery for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) with nares swabs. All patients with positive nare colonization for MSSA and MRSA were treated with mupirocin and chlorhexidine gluconate showers for 5 days before surgery. MRSA patients received vancomycin preoperatively and were placed in contact isolation. All elective arthroplasty patients used chlorhexidine gluconate antiseptic cloths the evening prior and the day of surgery. Perioperative infection rates were compared from 1 year before implementation to 5 years after implementation of this screening protocol.

Results

SSI rates have decreased from 1.11% (prescreening) to 0.34% (nasal screening; P < .05) after initiation of the process. Staphylococcus was identified in 66.7% of the SSI infections before nasal screening and in 33.3% of the SSI after routine screening (P > .05).

Conclusion

The addition of MRSA and/or MSSA nares screening along with a perioperative decolonization protocol has resulted in a decreased SSI rate by 69%.

### Pharmacist-driven methicillin-resistantPolymerase chain reaction testing for pneumonia [^113FmWcn]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Nasal colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) can be detected using nasal swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and is associated with clinical MRSA infection. The MRSA nasal PCR has a rapid turnaround time and a negative predictive value for MRSA pneumonia of > 98%; however, data are limited in critically ill patients.

Objective

The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of a pharmacist-driven algorithm, utilizing MRSA PCR nasal screening on duration of anti-MRSA therapy in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with suspected pneumonia.

Methods

A single-center pre/post study was conducted in 4 ICUs at a large tertiary care community hospital. Adult patients admitted to the ICU initiated on vancomycin or linezolid for pneumonia managed using a pharmacist-driven MRSA PCR algorithm were included in the algorithm cohort. A historical cohort with standard management was matched 1:1 by age, type of pneumonia, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score. The primary outcome was duration of anti-MRSA therapy. Secondary outcomes included MRSA rates, number of vancomycin levels, new onset of acute kidney injury (AKI), ICU length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS, and mortality.

Results

Of the 245 patients screened, 50 patients met inclusion criteria for the algorithm cohort and were matched to 50 patients in the historical cohort. The duration of anti-MRSA therapy was significantly lower compared with the historical cohort (47 vs 95 hours; P < 0.001). Secondary outcomes were similar between groups for MRSA rates, new onset of AKI, LOS, and mortality. There were less vancomycin levels ordered in the algorithm cohort (2 vs 3, P = 0.026).

Conclusions

A pharmacist-driven MRSA PCR algorithm significantly reduced anti-MRSA duration of therapy in critically ill patients with pneumonia. Future studies should validate these results in critically ill populations and in settings where MRSA pneumonia is more prevalent.

### Therapeutic monitoring of vancomycin for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections: a revised consensus guideline and review by the American Society of Health-system Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists [^113gmvdb]. American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Vancomycin loading dose administration and infusion parameters indicate that providing loading doses of 20 to 35 mg/kg based on actual body weight rapidly achieves targeted serum concentrations and reduces early subtherapeutic levels. Vancomycin should be administered in a dilute solution with concentrations of no more than 5 mg/mL and infused over not less than 60 minutes or at 10 to 15 mg/min, and an infusion rate of 10 mg/min or less is associated with fewer infusion-related events. Loading doses of 25 to 35 mg/kg will require infusion times of at least 2 to 3 hours, and after completion of the loading dose the maintenance dose should begin at the next dosing interval, for example starting 6 hours after the start of the loading dose when the interval is every 6 hours.

Evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections were prepared by an Expert Panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). The guidelines are intended for use by health care providers who care for adult and pediatric patients with MRSA infections. The guidelines discuss the management of a variety of clinical syndromes associated with MRSA disease, including skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI), bacteremia and endocarditis, pneumonia, bone and joint infections, and central nervous system (CNS) infections. Recommendations are provided regarding vancomycin dosing and monitoring, management of infections due to MRSA strains with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, and vancomycin treatment failures.

ICU infections

Ventilator-associated pneumonia

Question

What is the appropriate treatment approach for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)?

Recommendation

Initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics for VAP requires consideration of patient-specific culture data, recent antibiotic exposure, the local antibiogram, and timing of when infection developed. Common regimens for hospital-acquired infections are vancomycin plus either cefepime or piperacillin-tazobactam or in cases of severe penicillin allergy, aztreonam, although no specific regimen is generally superior. Empiric anaerobic coverage is not routinely recommended. We recommend de-escalation of antibiotic treatment when culture data are available. Seven days of treatment is sufficient for most patients. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) nasal swab testing should be used to determine the need for empiric coverage.

Discussion

Evidence suggests mortality is lower when the initial antibiotic therapy is effective, even when switched to adequate therapy after culture data become available. Therefore, it is important to initiate appropriate antibiotics when there is strong clinical suspicion of VAP. There is no evidence of superiority of one specific empiric regimen over another and appropriateness is targeted in context of the hospital antibiogram and specific patient risk factors.

Trauma is a risk factor for staphylococcal infections, specifically traumatic head injury and road traffic injuries.MRSA nasal swab testing is useful because of its high negative predictive value for MRSA carrier status and if negative can obviate the need for MRSA coverage, as evidenced by recent data in the trauma population. Anaerobic coverage is not routinely recommended due to lack of evidence of benefit and some evidence of harm. Empiric coverage is specifically tailored to S. aureus, Pseudomonas, and Gram-negative bacilli.

High-level evidence shows no benefit with treating longer than 7 days in most patients with exceptions limited to severe lung disease, severe immunosuppression, concomitant ARDS, and multidrug resistance. To de-escalate an antibiotic regimen, it is important that culture data be obtained at the time of diagnosis. Duration of therapy of 7 days and antibiotic de-escalation recommendations are consistent with the ATS/IDSA guidelines of 2016.

ASRA Pain Medicine — screening, decolonization, hygiene, antibiotics, and hair removal to reduce surgical site infections: Perioperative blood glucose should ideally be maintained at ≤ 150 mg/dl for implantable device surgeries. Patients should be tested for Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA and MSSA) using a nasal swab, and decolonization should be performed in colonized patients prior to pain device implantation. In individuals known previously to be carriers, decolonization should be repeated prior to additional procedures beyond 90 days from initial decolonization, and decolonization should occur no earlier than 10 days prior to the planned surgery. When performing decolonization, use mupirocin nasal application and chlorhexidine body wash. Hand washing with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub prior to the first case of the day, before and after glove use, before and after patient contact, and any time hands are visibly soiled is directed, with use of alcohol-based scrub for manufacturer recommended time or surgical hand scrub for at least 2 min. Appropriate preoperative intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis administered within 1 hour prior to surgical incision (2 hours for vancomycin) is recommended; prophylactic intradiscal and intravenous antibiotics have not been shown to conclusively decrease the rate of discitis in humans. Vancomycin should only be used in patients colonized with MRSA or who are at high risk for MRSA. Do not perform hair removal routinely prior to procedures, and if hair is removed, use electric clippers immediately before surgery.

### Successful eradication of newly acquired MRSA in six of seven patients with cystic fibrosis applying a short-term local and systemic antibiotic scheme [^112yDy3Z]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) has increased over the past years. The carrier rate significantly varies between regions, ranging from 3,4% in some CF populations in the United Kingdom as high as 30% in the United States. The chronic colonization with MRSA seems to be associated with a worsening of the pulmonary disease, with an accelerated decline in lung function and/or a prolonged recovery period after clinical exacerbations. Several protocols for an early eradication of MRSA have been reported to prevent negative consequences that might result from chronic MRSA colonization. To the best of our knowledge, studies systematically comparing these protocols are lacking in the literature, as recently also highlighted by a Cochrane review. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the efficacy of our protocol which consists of oral rifampicin and fusidic acid, inhaled vancomycin, nasal mupirocin, and hygienic directives over 7 days. This protocol has been used in our CF center since 2012.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^114b2STY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) — empiric Staphylococcus aureus coverage and MRSA risk factors: The panel recommend that all empiric regimens include an antibiotic with activity against S. aureus, and the recommendation is strong despite the very low quality of evidence. Although 10% (95% CI 6%–14%) of HAP cases are attributable to MRSA, this was insufficient justification to target MRSA in all HAP patients. Factors that probably increase MRSA risk include prior known MRSA colonization detected via nasal or respiratory cultures or nonculture screening, a high-quality Gram stain showing numerous and predominant gram-positive cocci in clusters, hospitalization in a unit where > 20% of S. aureus isolates are methicillin resistant or the prevalence is not known (with the 20% threshold arbitrarily chosen), and intravenous antibiotic treatment during the prior 90 days. When MRSA coverage is chosen, the guideline panel prefers vancomycin or linezolid, noting similar clinical outcomes and that final choice rests on blood cell counts, concurrent prescriptions for serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, renal function, and cost.

### Prevention of device-related infections in patients with cancer: current practice and future horizons [^116nkdbR]. CA (2023). Medium credibility.

MRSA Screening and Decolonization

The likelihood of MRSA colonization increases with: (1) prior history of MRSA infection, (2) hospitalization and exposure to health care facilities within the preceding year, (3) receipt of antibiotics within 3 months before admission, or (4) the presence of select comorbid conditions, such as immunosuppression, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, and use of hemodialysis, all of which are commonly encountered in the cancer population. Surgical patients identified as colonized with MRSA by a positive nasal polymerase chain reaction screen have been found to have 2-fold to 14-fold greater odds of a subsequent MRSA SSI than patients with negative nasal MRSA polymerase chain reaction screens. Several studies have shown that a bundled approach that includes decolonization protocols plus intravenous vancomycin prophylaxis can decrease the rate of postoperative gram-positive infections, especially in the orthopedic and cardiac surgical population, whereas other studies have not shown this benefit. Decolonization protocols that include topical mupirocin and chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) versus a placebo have been effective in reducing the rate of postoperative infections, with a relative risk of infection of 0.42 (95% CI, 0.23–0.75). Development of resistance to mupirocin is unlikely in the perioperative setting, especially when it is not used as an ointment for prolonged periods.CHG resistance is also uncommon, mainly because topical concentrations of CHG used for decolonization are 200-fold higher than the highest recorded minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of it used for staphylococci. Therefore, most researchers concluded that the use of preoperative intranasal mupirocin and/or topical CHG in MRSA-colonized patients is safe and potentially beneficial as an adjuvant to intravenous antimicrobial prophylaxis to decrease the occurrence of SSIs. Screening and targeted decolonization should specifically be considered for all those patient at high risk for negative outcomes, including the immunocompromised cancer population with device implantation.

Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

During the study period, 4,221 adult patients were admitted with COVID-19; only 472 patients (11.1%) had a respiratory culture. Patients with respiratory cultures were more severely ill than the patients without respiratory cultures, 78% of patients were intubated versus only 12% of those without respiratory cultures. Additionally, patients with respiratory cultures had longer lengths of stay (median, 19.5 days vs 6 days) and higher mortality (56% vs 21.5%) versus those who had no respiratory culture. Overall, 904 (21.4%) received empiric vancomycin within 48 hours of admission, and this was more commonly seen in the group that had respiratory cultures obtained (33.4%). Patient characteristics are summarized in Supplementary Table(online).

Among the 4,221 patients in the entire cohort, 158 patients had respiratory cultures obtained by day 3 of hospitalization, 285 by day 7, 405 by day 14, and 472 by day 28. The prevalence of MRSA in respiratory cultures ranged from a low of 0.6% on day 3, to 5.7% on day 28, cumulatively (Table 1).

Also, 369 MRSA nares PCR tests were performed among the patients in the cohort; of these patients, 122 had corresponding respiratory cultures within 5 days of the PCR test. Of these 122 MRSA PCR tests, 12 were positive, of which 2 patients had a corresponding positive respiratory culture for MRSA. Of the 110 negative nasal MRSA PCR tests, none of the corresponding respiratory cultures had MRSA isolated, yielding a negative predictive value (NPV) of 100% (Supplementary Tableonline).

### Implementation of a prevention bundle to decrease rates of Staphylococcus aureus surgical site infection at 11 veterans affairs hospitals [^114dAjG1]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Intervention

The project held an in-person kickoff meeting to review project aims. Throughout the project, investigators and coordinators from all sites attended twice monthly conference calls to discuss local and national barriers and facilitators. All sites were given facilitation tools, such as information sheets, patient instructions, and flowcharts. Sites were guided through an implementation checklist to aid local implementation of the intervention. Barriers and facilitators of implementation were addressed when possible. Sites adapted based on shared lessons learned and peer coaching.

The recommended intervention included (1) preoperative nasal screening for S aureus within 30 days of the operation; (2) preoperative nasal decolonization of S aureus carriers with mupirocin twice daily for 5 days; (3) CHG bathing for 5 days prior to surgery for S aureus carriers and 2 days prior for noncarriers; (4) perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis with cefazolin unless the patient was known to be an MRSA carrier; and (5) perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis with both vancomycin and cefazolin for known MRSA carriers. However, sites were given flexibility in how to implement specific components of the bundled interventions (Table 1). For example, sites could choose to perform nasal screening for both MRSA and methicillin-susceptible S aureus (MSSA) or MRSA alone, since laboratory capacity for screening differed at each site. Sites used varying laboratory methods to determine MRSA and MSSA nasal colonization including standard culture method, culture using selective media for S aureus (CHROMagar), singleplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and multiplex PCR. Sites could choose between CHG wipes or liquid soap to use prior to surgery. Sites could also replace the 5-day regimen of mupirocin with a 1-time application of intranasal povidone-iodine. Sites were provided a table for recommended antibiotics for perioperative prophylaxis but were given flexibility in antibiotic choices (eTable 1 in Supplement 1).

The intervention started when each site was prepared to begin. Thus, implementation of the intervention was on a rolling basis, with the earliest implementation occurring in April 2012 and the latest implementation occurring in July 2017.

### Active identification of patients who are methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonized is not associated with longer duration of vancomycin therapy [^114riMWM]. American Journal of Infection Control (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Excessive prescribing of vancomycin among patients admitted to inpatient wards is a challenge for antimicrobial stewardship programs, especially in the setting of expanded screening programs for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Studies examining factors associated with longer duration of vancomycin use are limited.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study to assess the impact of universal MRSA admission screening on duration of vancomycin use at the VA Boston Healthcare System during the period from January 2013-November 2015.

Results

A total of 2,910 patients were administered intravenous vancomycin during the study period. A clinical culture positive for MRSA was strongly associated with vancomycin administration lasting > 72 hours (odds ratio [OR], 2.72; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.86–3.97; P < .001). After controlling for clinical culture results, admission MRSA colonization was not associated with vancomycin use past 72 hours (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.8–1.1). A negative MRSA nasal swab on admission had a high negative predictive value for all MRSA infections evaluated (99.6% for pneumonia, 99.6% for bloodstream infection, and 98.1% for skin and soft tissue infection).

Conclusions

Admission surveillance for MRSA nasal colonization is not a major driver of prolonged vancomycin use. A negative admission MRSA nasal screen may be a useful tool for antimicrobial stewardship programs to limit vancomycin use, particularly in noncritically ill patients.

### Colonization with antibiotic-susceptible strains protects against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus but not vancomycin-resistant enterococci acquisition: a nested case-control study [^116i6r3f]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Although predictors of MRSA and VRE colonization have been well documented, less is known about protective factors. It has been hypothesized that methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and other antibiotic-sensitive bacteria may protect against MRSA acquisition by competing for colonization of the anterior nares. Competition may be relevant to decolonization strategies that may eliminate MSSA and predispose to MRSA acquisition in high endemic settings such as ICUs and nursing homes. Therefore, we assessed whether MSSA or vancomycin-sensitive enterococci (VSE) colonization reduces the risk of MRSA and VRE acquisition, respectively.

Transition to AUC/MIC monitoring — targeting and timing states that clinicians should conservatively target AUC values for suspected or documented serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections assuming a vancomycin broth microdilution (BMD) minimum inhibitory concentration (MICBMD) of 1 mg/L or less, that targeted exposure should be achieved early preferably within the first 24 to 48 hours (A-II), and that Bayesian-derived AUC monitoring may be prudent because it does not require steady-state serum vancomycin concentrations for early assessment.

### National costs associated with methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus hospitalizations in the United States, 2010–2014 [^116jJVrR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

A third potential reason contributing to the convergence of costs of MSSA and MRSA infections could be the increase in empiric use of vancomycin. The increase in vancomycin could have led to earlier optimal therapy for patients with MRSA, thus resulting in improved outcomes and reduced costs in these patients. However, increased empiric vancomycin therapy may also have led to a concomitant decrease in use of antistaphylococcal penicillins and cefazolin as empiric or definitive therapy for patients who ultimately grow MSSA, and patients with MSSA treated with vancomycin rather than beta-lactam agents have been shown to have worse outcomes. Although the NIS does not include medications administered, future investigations should evaluate whether empiric use of vancomycin leads to poorer outcomes and higher costs for MSSA patients. Finally, heightened awareness of MRSA may have increased hospital surveillance for MRSA. This, in turn, may have increased the probability of diagnosing less invasive MRSA infections or associating nontarget microbiology results, such as nasal swabs, with other diagnoses, such as pneumonia, in the coding process. A shift in coding could potentially explain some of the differences in costs and should be investigated further.

### Emergency department methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus nare screen effect on pneumonia treatment duration [^112MiXMM]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

The objective of this study was to determine if performing a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) nasal screen in the emergency department (ED) decreased general medicine patient exposure to anti-MRSA antibiotics for pneumonia.

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective study evaluating patients who had a diagnosis of pneumonia and were initiated on anti-MRSA therapy (vancomycin or linezolid) in the ED and subsequently admitted to a general medicine floor. Patients were divided into two groups: 1) did not receive a MRSA nares screen in the ED (No MRSA screen group) or 2) received a MRSA nares screen in the ED (MRSA screen group). The primary outcome was anti-MRSA antibiotic duration. Secondary outcomes included vancomycin level evaluation, hospital survival, and acute kidney injury.

Results

Of the 116 patients included, 37 patients received a MRSA nares screen in the ED and 79 patients did not. Median duration of antibiotic exposure was similar for both groups (No MRSA screen, 30.5 h [interquartile range (IQR) 20.5–52.5] vs. MRSA screen, 24.5 h [IQR 20.6–40.3]; p = 0.28). Of patients who were screened, 35 were negative and 2 were positive. Secondary outcomes were similar.

Conclusion

Performing a MRSA nares screen in the ED for patients diagnosed with pneumonia, initiated on anti-MRSA antibiotics, and admitted to a general medicine floor did not decrease duration of anti-MRSA antibiotics. At this time, ED providers do not need to consider a MRSA nasal screen in the ED for patients being admitted to general medicine, although larger studies could be considered.

### MRSA colonisation (eradicating colonisation in people without active invasive infection) [^116fYYL5]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) contains a gene that makes it resistant to methicillin as well as to other beta-lactam antibiotics, including flucloxacillin, cephalosporins, and carbapenems. MRSA can be part of the normal body flora (colonisation), especially in the nose, but it can cause infection. Until recently, MRSA has primarily been a problem associated with exposure to the healthcare system, especially in people with prolonged hospital admissions or underlying disease, or after antibiotic use. In many countries worldwide, a preponderance of S aureus bloodstream isolates are resistant to methicillin.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic overview, aiming to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatment for MRSA nasal or extra-nasal colonisation in adults? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2014 (Clinical Evidence overviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this overview).

Results

At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 850 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 356 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 273 studies, and the further review of 83 full publications. Of the 83 full articles evaluated, no studies were added at this update. We performed a GRADE evaluation for three PICO combinations.

Conclusions

In this systematic overview, we categorised the efficacy for five interventions based on information about the effectiveness and safety of antiseptic body washes, chlorhexidine-neomycin nasal cream, mupirocin nasal ointment, systemic antimicrobials, and other topical antimicrobials.

### Testing for methicillin-resistant in the anterior nares for antibiotic de-escalation in patients presenting with acute skin and soft tissue infections: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111uka5j]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

This review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines, and the protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024524640). Six databases (PubMed, MEDLINE via Ovid, EMBASE via Ovid, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library) were searched from date of first entry through January 1, 2025. Title, abstract, and keywords were searched for terms including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (or MRSA), skin (or cutaneous or derm*), skin and soft tissue infection (or SSTI or pyoderma or skin infection), and nasal (or nose or nares). The exact searches are described in Supplementary Table. The search was restricted to English language articles with human participants, and there were no publication date restrictions. Published and peer-reviewed studies, including observational or randomized controlled trials, were included. To avoid undefined estimates of the screening test, case reports and case series were excluded. Review articles, conference abstracts, and grey literature were also excluded.

Studies were eligible for inclusion if: (1) they included data on the MRSA nasal carriage status of at least 15 people presenting with acute SSTIs; (2) samples of the nares and the SSTIs were obtained within 72 hours of each other; and (3) the reports included enough information to form a 2×2 contingency table. To ensure the meta-analysis results were representative of a random patient presenting with an acute SSTI and, thus more generalizable, we excluded studies if the inclusion criteria required participants to have a particular comorbid disease/illness, a specific previous treatment, or a history of MRSA infection/colonization (or lack thereof).

After de-duplicating search results, two reviewers (SB, CG) screened the titles and abstracts for relevance and for meeting the above criteria. We screened the full text of each remaining article according to the same criteria. We hand-searched the reference lists of retained articles for additional articles. For included studies, we utilized a standardized form for data collection on the methods, participant demographics, and the 2×2 table (see supplementary material). Each selected study also had a risk of bias assessment using the revised Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool (QUADAS-2)(see supplementary material). If there was a high risk of bias in at least two of the four domains, then the studies were excluded. Throughout this process, we resolved disagreements between reviewers by consensus.

### Reliability of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) nasal swab screening for predicting MRSA burn infections [^115jMWNV]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Infection is the primary cause of death among burn-injured patients, with soft tissue infection trailing only pneumonia as the most common source of sepsis. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become endemic in burn units, resulting in the frequent initiation of empiric vancomycin therapy. MRSA nasal swab screening rapidly identifies patients who are MRSA-colonized, informing contact precaution and decontamination protocols. We hypothesized that MRSA nasal swab results could also be used to reliably predict results of wound cultures obtained from infected burns. We performed a retrospective review of all 250 patients who underwent weekly nasal swab screening and developed a burn infection in our unit over a 36-month period. By comparing nasal screening results to bacterial cultures, we determined test performance metrics for MRSA nasal swabs: sensitivity 64.1%, specificity 96.2%, positive predictive value (PPV) 75.8%, and negative predictive value (NPV) 93.5%. Nasal swabs were slightly more sensitive for predicting community-acquired MRSA infections versus those that were likely hospital-acquired. 30 patients (76.9%) presented with community-acquired MRSA infections; of those, 20 (66.7%) had tested positive for MRSA colonization on nasal screen. 9 patients (23.1%) developed hospital-acquired MRSA infections; 5 (55.6%) had tested positive for MRSA on a preceding nasal swab. The NPV calculated here indicates that patients who test negative for MRSA colonization by recent nasal swab are highly unlikely to have a burn infection caused by MRSA. Burn centers should employ universal MRSA nasal screening and de-escalate MRSA antibiotic coverage when treating burn infections in patients with a negative nasal swab result.

### Pulmonary infections and community associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus: a dangerous mix? [^117J8YbV]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

The incidence of complicated pneumonias in children is increasing with a concurrent increase in the incidence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) infections. CA-MRSA is distinct from hospital associated MRSA [HA-MRSA] in regards to its genotype, epidemiology, and clinical course. Unlike HA-MRSA, CA-MRSA often strikes young, previously healthy children. Pneumonias caused by CA-MRSA have a rather distinct presentation. Because of its pore-forming toxins, namely Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) and alpha-hemolysin, extensive necrotizing disease with corresponding hypoxaemia and hypercarbia is common. Other features include multilobar disease, leucopenia, haemoptysis, and high mortality rates. A previous influenza-like illness or skin and soft tissue infection [SSTI] often precede the development of pneumonia due to CA-MRSA. Vancomycin is recommended as first-line empiric therapy for suspected CA-MRSA infections. However, vancomycin is not an ideal agent for the treatment of pneumonia given its poor concentrating ability in alveolar fluid. Linezolid and clindamycin have also been used in the treatment of CA-MRSA pneumonia and ongoing research is looking for alternative antimicrobials. Recent studies have continued to report a lack of correlation between nasal colonization and active infections due to CA-MRSA. Given that the role of nasal colonization in CA-MRSA infection is not clear, the utility of decolonization treatment has been a point of debate. Finally, patients with cystic fibrosis are becoming increasingly colonized with MRSA as opposed to MSSA. There is some accumulating evidence that patients with MRSA show a more rapid deterioration in their degree of obstructive disease as measured by forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)). However, it still is not clear whether MRSA is a marker for worsening disease or whether it actually is a cause of disease progression in cystic fibrosis. More longitudinal data is needed to understand how MRSA colonization impacts the course of disease in cystic fibrosis.

Erysipelas and cellulitis — Cultures of blood or cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs are not routinely recommended (strong, moderate). Cultures of blood are recommended (strong, moderate), and cultures and microscopic examination of cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs should be considered in patients with malignancy on chemotherapy, neutropenia, severe cell-mediated immunodeficiency, immersion injuries, and animal bites (weak, moderate). Typical cases of cellulitis without systemic signs of infection should receive an antimicrobial agent that is active against streptococci (mild; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). For cellulitis with systemic signs of infection (moderate nonpurulent; Figure 1), systemic antibiotics are indicated. Many clinicians could include coverage against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) (weak, low). For patients whose cellulitis is associated with penetrating trauma, evidence of MRSA infection elsewhere, nasal colonization with MRSA, injection drug use, or SIRS (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), vancomycin or another antimicrobial effective against both MRSA and streptococci is recommended (strong, moderate). In severely compromised patients as defined in question 13 (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage may be considered (weak, moderate). Vancomycin plus either piperacillin-tazobactam or imipenem/meropenem is recommended as a reasonable empiric regimen for severe infections (strong, moderate). The recommended duration of antimicrobial therapy is 5 days, but treatment should be extended if the infection has not improved within this time period (strong, high).

### A negative nares screen in combination with absence of clinical risk factors can be used to identify patients with very low likelihood of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection in a veterans affairs hospital [^113EMGkc]. American Journal of Infection Control (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Screening for nares carriage of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) could be used to identify patients at reduced risk for MRSA infection. However, recent studies suggest that negative results of nares surveillance testing are not reliable to predict a low risk for MRSA infection.

Methods

To derive a clinical prediction rule, logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of MRSA infection in patients with negative nares surveillance results. To validate the prediction rule and modifications of the rule, the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV) were calculated in a prospective cohort of inpatients receiving empiric vancomycin.

Results

A prediction rule that included 8 clinical risk factors and nares surveillance results was sensitive with NPV of 99.9%. In the validation cohort, 43 of 451 (10%) patients receiving empiric vancomycin had MRSA infection. In comparison with nares surveillance results (sensitivity, 72%; NPV, 96%), the prediction rule was more reliable for prediction of low risk for MRSA infection (sensitivity, 93%; NPV, 98%). A modified rule that included additional indications for empiric MRSA coverage based on practice guidelines reliably predicted MRSA infection (sensitivity, 100%) while excluding those at low risk (NPV, 100%).

Conclusion

Negative nares screening results in combination with absence of certain clinical risk factors or syndromes could provide a useful strategy to predict patients with low likelihood of MRSA infection.

### Decolonization of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus using oral vancomycin and topical mupirocin [^113i6Q9s]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of a short course of oral vancomycin and intranasal mupirocin ointment in the eradication of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization. During an outbreak of MRSA, the colonized subjects received oral vancomycin and topical mupirocin. They were screened for MRSA 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after decolonization. A questionnaire was developed to evaluate the side-effects of oral vancomycin. Thirty-five subjects were treated. Clearance was achieved in all cases, in 24 (69%) subjects after one course of therapy. Twenty-eight (80%) subjects experienced some side-effects, including six (17%) who did not tolerate oral vancomycin. Although oral vancomycin, in combination with topical mupirocin, is effective in the elimination of MRSA colonization, there is a need for further studies to confirm our results and to evaluate the safety of oral vancomycin.

### Impact of preoperative MRSA screening and decolonization on hospital-acquired MRSA burden [^111SSvFa]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hospital-acquired infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are a source of morbidity and mortality. S. aureus is the most common pathogen in prosthetic joint infections and the incidence of MRSA is increasing.

Questions/Purposes

The purposes of this study were (1) to determine the MRSA prevalence density rate at a specialty orthopaedic hospital before and after the implementation of a screening and decolonization protocol,(2) to compare our prevalence density to that of an affiliated university hospital, to control for changes in MRSA prevalence density that might have been independent of the decolonization protocol, and (3) to measure the admission prevalence density rate of MRSA in an elective orthopaedic surgery population and the compliance rate of 26 patients with the protocol.

Methods

In October 2008, we implemented a MRSA screening and decolonization protocol for patients undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery. Nasal swabs were used for screening and mupirocin nasal ointment and chlorhexidine skin antisepsis where prescribed for decolonization to all patients. At the surgical visit, compliance was measured and the patients who were MRSA positive received vancomycin for antibiotic prophylaxis. Institution wide surveillance for multidrug-resistant organisms, including MRSA provided a comparison of the change in MRSA burden at the orthopaedic hospital versus the university hospital.

Results

Before implementation of the preoperative staphylococcal decolonization protocol there were 79 MRSA-positive cultures in 64,327 patient-days for a prevalence density rate of 1.23 per 1000 patient-days. After protocol implementation, 53 MRSA-positive cultures were identified in 63,860 patient-days for a rate of 0.83 per 1000 patient-days. Before the protocol, the MRSA prevalence density at the specialty hospital was similar to that of the university hospital; after implementation of the protocol, the prevalence density at the specialty hospital was 33% lower than that of the university hospital. The MRSA admission prevalence was 3.02%. The compliance rate was greater than 95%.

Conclusions

Implementation of a staphylococcal decolonization protocol at a single specialty orthopaedic hospital decreased the prevalence density of MRSA.

### Are nasal carriers of Staphylococcus aureus more likely to become colonized or infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus on admission to a hospital? [^111r6hfL]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2011). Low credibility.

Of 840 patients at hospital admission, 2.7% were positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and 22.3% were positive for methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA). During the next 8 months, 4.8% of the MSSA-positive patients acquired MRSA with no lineage association. A total of 5.2% of noncarriers acquired MRSA. We find no evidence that colonized hosts are more susceptible to acquiring MRSA.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) — active versus passive screening to discontinue CP: a randomized control trial enrolled individuals with a history of MRSA colonization or infection at least 90 days prior and compared clinician-initiated screening using 3 sequential cultures with study-initiated active screening in which research staff obtained 3 sets of surveillance nasal cultures performed at least 24 hours apart processed by both culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR); patients in both arms with 3 negative cultures who had not received antibiotics with activity against MRSA were eligible to have CP discontinued; outcomes showed in the passive screening arm 31% had screening initiated and only 9.6% completed the series, whereas in the active screening arm all subjects had screenings initiated and 74% had 3 swabs obtained, and the negative predictive value of the first nasal swab processed by PCR was 97%; in an emergency department single PCR-based screening for patients with a history of MRSA prior to 90 days and not receiving antibiotics with activity against MRSA in the prior 48 hours, 65% were PCR negative and CP were discontinued, but 69% of patients were not properly assessed for enrollment.

### The 2023 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation guidelines for mechanical circulatory support: a 10-year update [^1131bJ1q]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) 2023 mechanical circulatory support — antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) recommendations specify Class I measures including S. aureus decolonization in nasal carriers using intranasal mupirocin 2% ointment with or without chlorhexidine gluconate body wash; an AP regime that covers Staphylococcus species in all patients; AP infusion within one hour prior to the first incision; additional intra-operative dose(s) if the operative procedure last longer than 2 half-lives of the AP agent(s); preoperative bathing or showering with plain or antimicrobial soap; a preoperative nasal swab to screen for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; vancomycin use per surgical guidelines where there is a high likelihood or documented MRSA colonization; vancomycin infusion 2 hours prior to first incision to achieve therapeutic range; and additional intraoperative dose(s) with significant blood losses of more than 1500 mL. Class II guidance states vancomycin might be considered in high risk patients (BMI < 18, > 30, Reoperation, renal failure, diabetes mellitus, COPD or immunosuppressed patients), the local epidemiological experience of infectious disease specialists should guide AP, secondary prophylaxis should be considered in all mechanical circulatory support (MCS) patients (e.g. dental procedures), and an infectious diseases consultation should be considered before extending AP beyond 48 hours. Class III recommendations are that application of broad-spectrum gram-negative prophylaxis is not recommended to avoid possible drug-drug interactions, routine anti-fungal prophylaxis is not recommended, the duration of AP should not exceed 48 hours, and the duration of antibiotic prophylaxis should not be extended due to the presence of open-chest situation or remaining chest drainages.

### Antimicrobial drugs for treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization [^112BgAn8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Eradication strategies for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are variable. We sought to summarize the evidence for use of antimicrobial agents to eradicate MRSA.

Objectives

To describe the effects of topical and systemic antimicrobial agents on nasal and extra-nasal MRSA carriage, adverse events, and incidence of subsequent MRSA infections.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group's trials register (August 2003), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 3, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to 2003), EMBASE (1988 to 2003), handsearched relevant literature, and contacted MRSA experts and the manufacturer of mupirocin.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials of patients colonized with MRSA comparing topical or systemic antimicrobials to placebo or no treatment, and trials comparing various combinations of topical or systemic agents to no treatment, placebo, or to topical or systemic agents.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently applied inclusion criteria to potentially relevant trials, assessed trial methodological quality, and extracted data. Primary outcomes included eradication of MRSA, infection due to MRSA, and adverse events.

Main Results

Six trials (384 participants) met the inclusion criteria. No difference in MRSA eradication was detected in four studies: one that compared mupirocin to placebo, two that compared one systemic agent to no treatment (fusidic acid in one and rifampin or minocycline in the other) and one that compared mupirocin to topical fusidic acid and oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, examining nasal MRSA eradication as an outcome. One study compared minocycline to rifampin, with rifampicin being more effective in relation to eradication of MRSA from all sites at day 30 (relative risk 0.16; 95% confidence intervals 0.02 to 1.00), but the difference at 90 days was not statistically significant (n = 18). Two studies (one testing novobiocin and rifampin, the other ciprofloxacin and rifampin, versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and rifampin) did not demonstrate a difference in eradication of MRSA at all sites (n = 94). Adverse events with systemic agents occurred in up to 20% of participants, however reporting was sporadic and denominators small. All trials reported development of resistance to antimicrobial agents used.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to support use of topical or systemic antimicrobial therapy for eradicating nasal or extra-nasal MRSA. There is no demonstrated superiority of either topical or systemic therapy, or of combinations of these agents. Potentially serious adverse events and development of antimicrobial resistance can result from therapy.

### Skin and soft tissue infections in immunocompetent patients [^111HfvYS]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

The increasing incidence of skin and soft tissue infections requires family physicians to be familiar with the management of these conditions. Evidence of systemic infection, such as fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, is an indication for inpatient management. Urgent surgical referral is imperative for those with life-threatening or rapidly advancing infections. In patients with uncomplicated abscesses measuring less than 5 cm in diameter, surgical drainage alone is the primary therapeutic intervention. Wound irrigation using tap water has similar outcomes as irrigation using sterile water. When antimicrobials are indicated, choice of agents depends on local resistance and susceptibility patterns. In settings where suspicion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is low, beta-lactam antibiotics are the first-line treatments for uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections without focal coalescence or trauma. When empiric coverage for MRSA is indicated and the infection is uncomplicated, oral agents, such as tetracyclines, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and clindamycin, are preferred. Vancomycin is the first-line agent for MRSA in hospitalized patients, and newer agents, such as linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline, should be reserved for patients who do not respond to or cannot tolerate vancomycin therapy. There are insufficient data to support eradicating the carrier state in patients with MRSA or their contacts with nasal mupirocin or antibacterial body washes. Standard infection-control precautions, including proper and frequent handwashing, are a mainstay of MRSA prevention.

### Impact of the sequential implementation of a pharmacy-driven methicillin-resistant (MRSA) nasal-swab ordering policy and vancomycin 72-hour restriction protocol on standardized antibiotic administration ratio (SAAR) data for antibiotics used for resistant gram-positive infections [^112UnrHo]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Vancomycin is commonly prescribed empirically for hospitalized patients to provide broad-spectrum gram-positive coverage, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). However, use is inappropriate > 25% of the time, with the most common reasons being excessive durations or lack of documented infection. Inappropriate prescribing of vancomycin unnecessarily exposes patients to severe antibiotic toxicities (eg, nephrotoxicity, thrombocytopenia) and strains hospital resources (eg, nursing time, pharmacy resources, laboratory resources).

Stewardship initiatives targeting the inappropriate prescribing of vancomycin, including pre-authorization, prospective audit with feedback, MRSA screening, and the completion of antibiotic timeouts, are potential strategies to optimize use. Implementation of such strategies may be less feasible at large medical centers or programs with limited resources, where the volume of vancomycin orders may exceed the capabilities of stewardship programs. To accomplish effective stewardship of vancomycin prescribing, it may be necessary to leverage the oversight of clinicians outside the stewardship program to act as stewardship extenders. Clinicians with more direct interactions with the medical teams or providers prescribing antibiotics, such as clinical pharmacists, may be more effective at encouraging discontinuation of unnecessary antibiotics as well.

After reviewing a random sampling of vancomycin regimens at our medical center, we observed that although empiric initiation of vancomycin was generally appropriate, the mean duration of empiric vancomycin was 4–5 days. We also observed that our standardized antimicrobial administration ratio (SAAR) for antibacterial agents against resistant gram-positive infections was > 1, signaling that our use of agents targeting resistant gram-positive organisms is higher than that of our peers. We then compared our vancomyin utilization with other centers for benchmarking analysis, and vancomycin use was higher than that of other centers. These findings formed the basis for why we chose to implement interventions targeting reduction of vancomycin utilization. On May 1, 2019, we created a protocol allowing pharmacists to order MRSA nasal swabs for patients started on anti-MRSA therapy. On February 1, 2020, we implemented a protocol requiring providers to obtain approval from primary team clinical pharmacists to continue empiric vancomycin beyond 72 hours, with stewardship pharmacists available for case review as needed.

### Colonization with antibiotic-susceptible strains protects against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus but not vancomycin-resistant enterococci acquisition: a nested case-control study [^112W7Kih]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

Among ICU patients from a tertiary care medical center, we show that MSSA carriage results in a 50% reduced odds of MRSA acquisition when extensively accounting for other risk factors. These results support the concept that various S. aureus strains compete for occupancy of the anterior nares. In this case, the protective nature of MSSA likely arises from being the initial occupant of the niche. It is likely that the presence of MRSA would similarly prevent the establishment of MSSA in the anterior nares. Thus, the presence or absence of the mec A gene alone is used as a surrogate means to distinguish S. aureus strains, rather than to suggest a competitive advantage in the absence of beta-lactam antibiotics.

However, regardless of the mechanism for competition between strains, evidence for competition supports the need to be judicious in applying decolonization regimens to eradicate the S. aureus reservoir. In particular, MSSA carriage may be preferable to the chance for re-colonization with an MRSA strain in certain high risk patient populations since it has been suggested in several studies that MRSA infections produce greater morbidity, mortality, and cost compared to MSSA infections in case mix-adjusted patient populations.

These results are relevant to decolonization strategies that are increasingly used and have been shown to successfully reduce MSSA and MRSA infections among carriers in high-endemic settings, including intensive care units and patients undergoing surgical procedures. Currently, cardiac surgeons have a national guideline for pre-operative screening and decolonization of S. aureus to reduce S. aureus surgical site infections. Increasingly, chlorhexidine and mupirocin are being routinely applied to MRSA carriers in hospitals to reduce healthcare-associated MRSA infection.

The large body of evidence demonstrating substantial benefits of decolonization should be weighed against the potential of increased MRSA acquisition risk due to a vacated anterior nares niche. Studies are needed to evaluate whether decolonization of MSSA carriers increases the risk of acquiring MRSA when discharging patients to high-endemic MRSA healthcare settings. On the other hand, we recognize this risk may be mitigated by decolonization which could reduce the prevalence and transmission of MRSA in post-discharge healthcare settings.

American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

MRSA vancomycin MIC epidemiology reports that vancomycin MICs have remained constant over time with a MIC of ≤ 1 mg/L for more than 90% of isolates; a meta-analysis of 29,234 MRSA strains from 55 studies found MIC determinations were predominately 1 mg/L with no evidence of MIC creep, and a global surveillance program observed that 95% of 57,319 MRSA isolates had MICs of 1 mg/L with no signs of MIC creep over 20 years; organisms with MIC ≥ 2 mg/L are uncommon by reference methods though variability exists between methods.

### Highly effective regimen for decolonization of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus carriers [^117UtuQL]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of a standardized regimen for decolonization of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) carriers and to identify factors influencing decolonization treatment failure.

Design

Prospective cohort study from January 2002 to April 2007, with a mean follow-up period of 36 months.

Setting

University hospital with 750 beds and 27,000 admissions/year.

Patients

Of 94 consecutive hospitalized patients with MRSA colonization or infection, 32 were excluded because of spontaneous loss of MRSA, contraindications, death, or refusal to participate. In 62 patients, decolonization treatment was completed. At least 6 body sites were screened for MRSA (including by use of rectal swabs) before the start of treatment.

Interventions

Standardized decolonization treatment consisted of mupirocin nasal ointment, chlorhexidine mouth rinse, and full-body wash with chlorhexidine soap for 5 days. Intestinal and urinary-tract colonization were treated with oral vancomycin and cotrimoxazole, respectively. Vaginal colonization was treated with povidone-iodine or, alternatively, with chlorhexidine ovula or octenidine solution. Other antibiotics were added to the regimen if treatment failed. Successful decolonization was considered to have been achieved if results were negative for 3 consecutive sets of cultures of more than 6 screening sites.

Results

The mean age (± standard deviation [SD]) age of the 62 patients was 66.2 ± 19 years. The most frequent locations of MRSA colonization were the nose (42 patients [68%]), the throat (33 [53%]), perianal area (33 [53%]), rectum (36 [58%]), and inguinal area (30 [49%]). Decolonization was completed in 87% of patients after a mean (± SD) of 2.1 ± 1.8 decolonization cycles (range, 1–10 cycles). Sixty-five percent of patients ultimately required peroral antibiotic treatment (vancomycin, 52%; cotrimoxazole, 27%; rifampin and fusidic acid, 18%). Decolonization was successful in 54 (87%) of the patients in the intent-to-treat analysis and in 51 (98%) of 52 patients in the on-treatment analysis.

Conclusion

This standardized regimen for MRSA decolonization was highly effective in patients who completed the full decolonization treatment course.

### Clinical utility of negative methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) nasal surveillance swabs in skin and skin structure infections [^115ndki4]. American Journal of Infection Control (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Negative methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) nasal swabs have a high negative predictive value of approximately 99% in respiratory infections. There is, however, a lack of data evaluating its use beyond respiratory infections.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis to determine the clinical utility of MRSA swabs for identifying MRSA-associated skin and skin structure infections (SSSIs) and the potential effects on antimicrobial stewardship efforts. Baseline characteristics, culture data, and antibiotic data were collected to determine the difference in duration of vancomycin therapy. Positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity were secondary outcomes.

Results

A total of 473 patients were included, of which 156 patients had a positive MRSA nasal swab and 317 patients had a negative swab. The median duration of vancomycin was 4 days in the positive group and 3 days in the negative group (P = 0.01). The positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 22.4% and 97.5%. The sensitivity and specificity were 81.4% and 71.9%.

Conclusion

Patients with a negative MRSA nasal swab received approximately 1 day less of vancomycin, which represented a decrease in drug administered. The negative predictive value for SSSIs is promising, showing potential for the role of MRSA nasal swabs in de-escalating therapy.

Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Scope

The aim of these guidelines is to provide recommendations for decolonization and perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) in multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria (MDR-GPB) adult carriers before inpatient surgery.

Methods

These European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases/European Committee on Infection Control guidelines were developed following a systematic review of published studies targeting methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci, and pan-drug-resistant-GPB. Critical outcomes were the occurrence of surgical site infections (SSIs) caused by the colonizing MDR-GPB and SSIs-attributable mortality. Important outcomes included the occurrence of SSIs caused by any pathogen, hospital-acquired infections, all-cause mortality, and adverse events associated with the interventions, including resistance development to the agents used and the incidence of Clostridioides difficile infections. The last search of all databases was performed on 1 November 2023. The level of evidence and the strength of each recommendation were defined according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. Consensus of a multidisciplinary expert panel was reached for the final list of recommendations. Antimicrobial stewardship considerations were included.

Recommendations

The guideline panel reviewed the impact of decolonization, targeted PAP, and combined interventions (e.g. decolonization and targeted PAP) on the risk of SSIs and other outcomes in MDR-GPB carriers, according to the type of bacteria and type of surgery. We recommend screening for S. aureus before high-risk operations, such as cardiothoracic and orthopaedic surgery. Decolonization with intranasal mupirocin with or without a chlorhexidine bath is recommended in patients colonized with S. aureus before cardiothoracic and orthopaedic surgery and suggested in other surgeries. The addition of vancomycin to standard prophylaxis is suggested for MRSA carriers in cardiothoracic surgery, orthopaedic surgery, and neurosurgery. Combined interventions (e.g. decolonization and targeted prophylaxis) are suggested for MRSA carriers undergoing cardiothoracic and orthopaedic surgery. No recommendation could be made regarding screening, decolonization and targeted prophylaxis for vancomycin-resistant enterococci because of the lack of data. No evidence was retrieved for methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci and pan-drug-resistant-GPB. Careful consideration of the laboratory workload and involvement of antimicrobial stewardship and infection control teams are warranted before implementing screening procedures or performing changes in PAP policy. Future research should focus on novel decolonizing techniques, on the monitoring of resistance to decolonizing agents and PAP regimens, and on standardized combined interventions in high-quality studies.

### Prevalence of methicillin-resistant (MRSA) in respiratory cultures and diagnostic performance of the MRSA nasal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia [^116QYAAd]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

To the Editor — The need for studies on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) superinfections that can inform rational antimicrobial treatment and stewardship strategies has been recognized. In a recent review from our institution, we found that up to 71% of patients admitted with COVID-19 received antibiotics. Anti–methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (anti-MRSA) agents, particularly vancomycin, are important stewardship targets, and they are included in the 2019 World Health Organization (WHO) Watch List of Antibiotics.

Recently, guidance was published on the treatment of possible concomitant community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CAP) for patients admitted with COVID-19. The authors recommend selective use of anti-MRSA therapy, as for any other patient with CAP, and the utility of the MRSA nares PCR is not addressed. However, the empiric use of these agents for admitted COVID-19 patients remains prevalent, driven by several factors. For one, staphylococcal superinfection is a common complication of other viral pneumonias, such as influenza, and the 2018 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines on influenza treatment state that "agents with activity against MRSA should be included in the empiric regimen for critically ill patients". Additionally, the real-world treatment of patients with COVID-19 is complicated by recurrent fevers, fluctuating oxygen requirements, prolonged hospitalization and/or ventilation, blurring the line between community-acquired versus hospital-acquired pneumonia. Therefore, we sought to determine the prevalence of MRSA in respiratory cultures of patients admitted with COVID-19, and we evaluated the diagnostic performance of the MRSA nares PCR test, a valuable stewardship tool for ruling out MRSA pneumonia in low-prevalence settings, in this cohort.

### Colonization with antibiotic-susceptible strains protects against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus but not vancomycin-resistant enterococci acquisition: a nested case-control study [^111cAE9R]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We found that MSSA nasal carriage conferred a 50% reduction in the odds of MRSA acquisition among ICU patients. In contrast, no protective effect was observed for VSE. These findings are important for decolonization regimens that may eliminate MSSA and predispose to MRSA acquisition in high-endemic settings, such as ICUs, nursing homes, and rehabilitation centers. Additional studies are needed to better understand the degree to which MSSA is protective and the long-term impact of decolonization relative to subsequent healthcare exposures.

### Device evaluation, treatment, and explantation recommendations (DETER): review and best practices for managing neuromodulation device infections [^112gHEJ4]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Preoperative and Intraoperative Management

Implementation of standardized infection-prevention protocols into practice is the optimal strategy for preventing postoperative wound infections. Such protocols involve systematized utilization of pre-operative checklists, patient screening questionnaires identifying risk factors for infection, MRSA and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) screening and decolonization protocols, weight-based antibiotic prophylaxis, surgeon training, strict adherence to proper prepping and draping and surgical techniques with an emphasis on wound closure and wound care education for patients.

Preoperative antibiotic selection is based on expected organisms known to cause infections in neuromodulation cases and is informed by a patient's MRSA status. For SCS cases, gram-positive Staphylococcus species account for most of the infections, and these species may be methicillin-sensitive or resistant. Studies show that gram-negative bacteria can also cause infections, although these are infrequent. Patients known to be colonized with MRSA may be decolonized with nasal mupirocin, which has been demonstrated to decrease the risk of positive clinical cultures or post-discharge infection by 18–30%.

Although no specific prophylactic antibiotic has been definitively established as superior, weight-based first-generation cephalosporins, such as cefazolin, are generally preferred for SSI prevention in neuromodulation procedures. The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists recommends 2 g for patients under 120 kg and 3 g for those weighing 120 kg or more.

If there is a significant cephalosporin allergy, vancomycin or clindamycin are recommended as second-line alternatives. In patients with confirmed MRSA or a higher likelihood of MRSA infection (ie, high community presence), vancomycin is recommended. Additionally, antibiotics should be given within 30–60 minutes of incision for cephalosporins and clindamycin or within 120 minutes of incision for vancomycin. The need for redosing of these preoperative antibiotics is unlikely due to the short surgical times associated with neuromodulation.

Surgical site infection — antibiotic selection recommends a first-generation cephalosporin or an antistaphylococcal penicillin for MSSA, or vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, telavancin, or ceftaroline where risk factors for MRSA are high (nasal colonization, prior MRSA infection, recent hospitalization, recent antibiotics) (strong, low). Agents active against gram-negative bacteria and anaerobes, such as a cephalosporin or fluoroquinolone in combination with metronidazole, are recommended for infections following operations on the axilla, gastrointestinal tract, perineum, or female genital tract (strong, low).

### SHEA statement on antibiotic stewardship in hospitals during public health emergencies [^115897bn]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

What microbiologic and radiographic diagnostic tests are appropriate if antibiotics are started for patients with possible bacterial coinfection?

Recommendations

Before initiating antibiotics, HCP should attempt to establish a microbiologic diagnosis.
HCP should limit respiratory multiplex PCR tests to ICU patients and patients who require broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy.
HCP should restrict repeat microbiologic testing to changes in a patient's clinical status.
HCP should perform a nasal MRSA swab for patients started on anti-MRSA treatment.
HCP should not perform routine testing for fungal infection in the absence of a clinical presentation that raises that concern.
HCP should review the necessity of antibiotics within 48–72 hours, as results from tests become available, and should de-escalate or discontinue antibiotic therapy based on those results and clinical response. Procalcitonin results may aid the de-escalation or discontinuation of antibiotic treatments.
HCP should obtain chest radiographs to assess the extent of lung involvement, but daily repeat studies are not indicated. Use of CT of the chest should be reserved for circumstances in which results of the CT may result in a change in clinical management (eg, pulmonary embolus).

Discussion

As noted, HCP should not obtain microbiologic studies for patients without clinical signs and symptoms suggesting a bacterial coinfection. However, in all cases in which antibiotics are started in patients with severe disease (eg, in the ICU) and those requiring broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, HCP should obtain relevant samples, for example, sputum cultures and, as appropriate, lower respiratory PCR for a microbiologic diagnosis. Those tests can help HCP appropriately choose definitive therapy or identify opportunities to de-escalate or stop antibiotic treatments. Rapid multiplex PCR can have a role in antibiotic stewardship for critically ill patientsif clinicians are supported by ASPs to interpret and trust those results. Nasal PCR screening for MRSA allows de-escalation for anti-MRSA therapy (eg, vancomycin) in patients with severe CAP and those with risk factors (eg, recent hospitalization, recent receipt of antimicrobial therapy, or prior isolation of MRSA), and has been shown to have up to 100% negative predictive value, including for hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

### Colonization with antibiotic-susceptible strains protects against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus but not vancomycin-resistant enterococci acquisition: a nested case-control study [^114cwAFn]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Consistent with prior reports, we found that patients who acquired MRSA and VRE had longer ICU lengths of stay. We controlled for comorbidities and procedures that may have accounted for this and identified mechanical ventilation, fluoroquinolone exposure, and increased ICU duration prior to the initial negative swab as independent predictors of MRSA acquisition. We also assessed other previously defined risk factors, but we highlight the protective nature of MSSA when performing a comprehensive evaluation of potential factors associated with MRSA acquisition. Our work indicates that interactions between colonizing S. aureus strains should be considered when evaluating patient-level predictors of MRSA acquisition, particularly in the setting of decolonization therapy.

In contrast to the association between MSSA and MRSA colonization, VSE was not protective against VRE acquisition. This latter finding is consistent with the abundance of microbial flora in the gut reservoir, where antibiotic-susceptible and resistant strains are not mutually exclusive for intestinal colonization. Similar to prior papers, we identified several risk factors associated with VRE acquisition including end-stage renal disease, active wounds, and low serum albumin levels.

Our study has important limitations. First, this study was restricted to ICU patients from a tertiary care hospital, and nearly 90% of our study population underwent surgery. Due to differences in patient populations, our findings may not be generalizable to other hospitals or non-ICU settings. Second, our work was often reliant on either nares or rectal screening alone to determine MRSA or VRE acquisition, respectively. If the sensitivity of these single-site screening tests was low, some of our controls may have actually harbored MRSA or VRE, and some of our cases may have actually been long term carriers. Nevertheless, this would have reduced the differences found between the groups. Finally, our results may not be generalizable to MRSA clones that do not predominantly colonize the anterior nares. While this has been suggested for community-associated clones, other research has found no difference in the strain-specific distribution of body site carriage among nursing home residents.

### When can a MRSA nares swab guide antibiotic stewardship? [^114bM3sA]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Clinicians treating infections in the hospital often face uncertainty about when coverage for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is warranted. Although MRSA infections are associated with significant mortality, 1 anti-MRSA therapy in hospitalized patients is frequently excessive and suboptimal; prescribing patterns are often discordant with practice guidelines2 or final culture results. 3 Strategies to rapidly de-escalate unnecessary MRSA coverage could minimize potential harms, including antimicrobial resistance, nephrotoxic effects, and increased pharmacy monitoring costs.

### Therapeutic monitoring of vancomycin for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections: a revised consensus guideline and review by the American Society of Health-system Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists [^111HtXN3]. American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) efficacy target for vancomycin in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections — an AUC/MIC ratio of ≥ 400 (with the MIC determined by broth microdilution [BMD]) is the currently accepted critical PK/PD index; in vitro and in vivo assessments indicate bactericidal activity (ie, a 1- to 2-log reduction in bacterial inoculum in the animal model) when the vancomycin AUC/MICBMD ratio approximates or exceeds 400, and in vitro data suggest that an AUC of < 400 potentiates the emergence of MRSA resistance and vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus strains; in adults, an AUC/MICBMD ratio of ≥ 400 is currently considered the optimal PK/PD "efficacy" target.

### Successful eradication of newly acquired MRSA in six of seven patients with cystic fibrosis applying a short-term local and systemic antibiotic scheme [^116RRwcq]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF), colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was reported to be associated with a deterioration of pulmonary disease as reflected by an accelerated decline in lung function. Thus, an early eradication of MRSA could be beneficial in these patients. Here, we report on an intensified MRSA eradication protocol.

Methods

Since 2012 a protocol for the eradication of newly acquired MRSA has been used in our CF Clinic, combining oral rifampicin and fusidic acid, inhaled vancomycin, nasal mupirocin, local antiseptic treatment and hygienic directives all of which are applied for only 7 days during an inpatient hospital stay.

Results

Since 2012 seven patients (3 male, 4 female; age range 4 to 30 years) newly acquired MRSA. In 6 of the 7 patients (86%) successful eradication of MRSA was achieved upon first treatment using the protocol described above. In one patient a second course of treatment was performed which, however, also failed to eliminate the colonizing MRSA.

Conclusions

Our protocol led to an eradication rate of 86%. The impact of each individual component of the protocol remains to be determined.

### SHEA statement on antibiotic stewardship in hospitals during public health emergencies [^115BgRBb]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Antibiotic stewardship — diagnostic testing and imaging when starting antibiotics for possible bacterial coinfection: Before initiating antibiotics, HCP should attempt to establish a microbiologic diagnosis; HCP should limit respiratory multiplex PCR tests to ICU patients and patients who require broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy; HCP should restrict repeat microbiologic testing to changes in a patient's clinical status; HCP should perform a nasal MRSA swab for patients started on anti-MRSA treatment; and HCP should not perform routine testing for fungal infection in the absence of a clinical presentation that raises that concern. HCP should review the necessity of antibiotics within 48–72 hours, as results from tests become available, and should de-escalate or discontinue antibiotic therapy based on those results and clinical response; de-escalation of antibiotics at 72 hours in the absence of evidence of coinfection, even in the setting of severe sepsis and septic shock, has been well studied and is a safe strategy for the care of patients with viral infections. Procalcitonin results may aid the de-escalation or discontinuation of antibiotic treatments, and for HCP planning to treat a patient beyond 5–7 days, studies have suggested PCT as a tool to aid in the discontinuation of antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Nasal PCR screening for MRSA allows de-escalation for anti-MRSA therapy and has been shown to have up to 100% negative predictive value, including for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. For imaging, HCP should obtain chest radiographs to assess the extent of lung involvement, but daily repeat studies are not indicated, and use of CT of the chest should be reserved for circumstances in which results of the CT may result in a change in clinical management (eg, pulmonary embolus); serial chest radiographs are helpful during disease progression but should not be repeated daily, and chest CT findings are not able to reliably distinguish COVID-19 from other causes of pneumonia.

### Prediction of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus involvement in disease sites by concomitant nasal sampling [^111WTxp1]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2008). Low credibility.

Nasal colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is believed to precede disease. It is therefore reasonable to expect that testing for nasal MRSA colonization could provide guidance in the choice of empirical therapy for infections. We conducted a retrospective review of 5,779 nasal MRSA tests performed within a 24-h period before or after a clinical culture showed the growth of any organism. A positive nasal MRSA test strongly predicted MRSA involvement at a clinical site (relative risk, 12.9 times higher than in the remainder of the population; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 10.4, 16.1). Nasal MRSA colonization also strongly predicted antimicrobial resistance in other organisms. A negative nasal test was less useful; only 217 of 323 patients (67.2%; 95% CI, 61.8, 72.3) with clinical cultures involving MRSA had detectable, concomitant nasal MRSA colonization. Patients with clindamycin-susceptible MRSA infections were less likely (59%) to have nasal colonization than those with clindamycin-resistant MRSA infections (71%; P = 0.042). Patients nasally colonized with MRSA were substantially more likely to have antibiotic-resistant floras in clinical specimens, and this should be considered when initiating therapy. However, nearly a third of MRSA-infected patients were not nasally colonized, suggesting that nasal colonization need not precede disease and that a negative test for nasal colonization would not rule out MRSA disease in settings of moderate or high prevalence.

Interventions and Implementation

Mitigating Modifiable Patient-Related Risk Factors

The ACS's preoperative MRSA bundle, which includes CHG baths and nasal decolonization with mupirocin, is designed to limit surgical wound infections; however, it is less effective if all components are not completed. Regardless of the swab results, all preoperative patients are given intranasal mupirocin twice daily for 5 days based on current ACS recommendations. Although use of a universal decolonization strategy has not been shown to reduce infections in noncarriers of S aureus, targeted decolonization is difficult to operationalize because it is most effective when doses are completed before surgery. Because the interval between preadmission testing for outpatients or cardiac catheterization for inpatients and cardiac surgery is short, many patients do not complete 10 doses of mupirocin before surgery, putting colonized patients at risk for developing MRSA DSWI.

Our institution screens all nonemergency cardiac surgery patients for intranasal MRSA colonization with either a culture-based or polymerase chain reaction test, depending on the urgency of the procedure. The MRSA screen is used to guide periprocedural antibiotic selection, regardless of whether or not the mupirocin course is completed preoperatively. MRSA-negative patients receive cefazolin, a first-generation cephalosporin, with activity against common gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens associated with SSIs. To optimize pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, a weight-based dose undiluted cefazolin is given as an intravenous push just before incision. Intraoperative doses of cefazolin are repeated every 4 hours during surgery per guideline recommendations. IHIT altered the standard cefazolin-dosing based on newer literature suggesting higher plasma concentrations at skin closure are associated with lower rates of SSI. Beginning in January 2021, patients prescribed perioperative cefazolin received an additional 1 g at the time of closure to ensure higher antibiotic levels in the skin before closure. Antibiotics are given for 24 hours after surgery. In addition to cefazolin for both gram-positive and gram-negative coverage, MRSA-positive patients receive perioperative vancomycin, which is active in vitro against MRSA. Emergency cases or patients for whom MRSA results are not available are treated as if they are MRSA-colonized.

### High-dose vancomycin therapy for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections… [^117WmoTN]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions High prevalence of clinical MRSA strains with elevated vancomycin MIC requires aggressive empirical vancomycin dosing to achieve a trough greater than 15 μg/mL. Combination or alternative therapy should be considered for invasive infections caused by these strains. The purposes of this study are to determine the distribution of vancomycin MICs among MRSA isolates that cause infections and to evaluate the efficacy of vancomycin and risk of nephrotoxicity associated with vancomycin when given in doses to achieve an unbound target trough of 4 or more times the MIC of the infected strain. Primary outcome measures were clinical response, nephrotoxicity, and infection-related mortality. Secondary outcome measures included time to achieve clinical stability and length of hospital stay. Initial and final responses were assessed.

Patients were placed into subgroups based on vancomycin MIC of infected strains and trough levels attained. In a subanalysis that included only patients without receipt of concomitant nephrotoxic agents, nephrotoxicity occurred in only 1 of 44 high-trough vs 0 of 24 low-trough patients. Using the Etest to determine vancomycin susceptibility, we found that 54% of the nosocomial MRSA strains that caused infections had an MIC of 2 μg/mL. The predominance of high-MIC strains in our cohort suggests that invasive strains may be associated with high MIC because 77% of our strains caused pneumonia and/or bloodstream infections. An overall response rate of more than 70% observed in our cohort is comparable to published response rates in clinical trials that involved hospitalized adults with MRSA infections.

20, 21 Consistent with the positive correlation between in vitro bactericidal activity and vancomycin trough concentration at 4 to 5 times the MIC, 8, 9, 12 we found that patients who achieved target trough levels within 72 hours of therapy had a 20% higher response rate than those who did not. Nephrotoxicity attributable to vancomycin was observed at a 12% incidence compared with none in the high- and low-trough groups, respectively. Duration of therapy increases the risk of nephrotoxicity from 6% to 21% for patients receiving high-dose therapy when treatment extends beyond 1 week and up to 30% for those receiving more than 2 weeks of treatment.

### Routine use of Staphylococcus aureus rapid diagnostic test in patients with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia [^115Q812A]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Because survival is improved in the patients receiving appropriate empirical antibiotics, guidelines recommend the coverage of all potential pathogens responsible for an episode of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Collection of blood and bronchial specimens precedes the administration of empirical antibiotics. The choice of antibiotics is based on the presence of specific risk factors. After the responsible bacteria in samples were identified, guidelines recommend reassessing the antibiotic treatment.

Although safe, this strategy exposes the patient to an overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Overuse of antibiotics results in an increase in multidrug resistant pathogens, treatment-related side effects and increased cost of hospitalization. Use of biomarkers, for instance, procalcitonin, failed to be effective in septic ICU patients in deciding whether or not to start antibiotics. The Gram stain of bronchial sputum is not safe enough to use in deciding whether or not to start an antimicrobial treatment. With regard to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), this strategy leads to a wide use of vancomycin or linezolid. These antibiotics are associated with side effects and increased costs.

A rapid detection of resistant bacteria can avoid the use of unnecessary antibiotics. Because VAP due to MRSA has been associated with increased mortality, the detection test should have an excellent negative predictive value. New diagnostic tests using real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detect pathogens in approximately 60 minutes. They can detect both methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and MRSA in blood, nasal and surgical site secretions. To date, these tests have been poorly assessed in bronchial secretions of patients with suspected VAP.

We hypothesized that the routine use of a rapid detection (rPCR) test in bronchial secretion samples would limit the use of anti-MRSA antibiotics. The performance of the rPCR test has been evaluated on 135 lower respiratory tract secretions. However, only the patients with endotracheal aspirates showing Gram-positive cocci were included in this study. Using the rPCR tests designed for nasal secretions and surgical site fluid, our goal was to assess the technical reliability of the rPCR test for Staphylococcus aureus and its concordance with bronchoalveolar (BAL) and miniBAL microbiological result.
