## Question

Does mint increase heartburn

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether mint increases heartburn. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what kind of "mint" we mean and how commonly mint avoidance is recommended. Then, I should verify whether mint affects lower esophageal sphincter (LES) tone or reflux physiology. Next, I will check the quality and quantity of clinical evidence linking mint to heartburn exacerbation. After that, I need to distinguish pathophysiologic mechanisms from symptom perception. Finally, I will weigh potential risks versus benefits and synthesize a practical recommendation, while keeping in mind patient heterogeneity and functional heartburn considerations [^112j3136] [^112fPW33].

> Let me first confirm the scope. "Mint" in this context usually refers to peppermint and spearmint used in foods, teas, gums, candies, or essential oils; mint avoidance is often included in generic GERD lifestyle advice, but I should verify how evidence-based that is before drawing conclusions [^112rk13z].

> Wait, let me verify the theoretical mechanism. The commonly cited concern is that mint might relax the LES and thereby increase reflux; I initially thought that was strongly supported, but hold on, I should double-check because that assumption may not be accurate in vivo in humans. The clearest human data I can find is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy volunteers that measured LES pressure and reflux with spearmint and found no change in LES tone, no difference in reflux episodes, and no symptomatic effect, which directly contradicts the "mint relaxes the LES" hypothesis in that population [^113dbnpr]. Hmm, wait a minute, could other preparations behave differently? That trial tested spearmint in healthy subjects; it doesn't cover peppermint, disease states, or high-dose essential oils, so I need to be cautious about generalizing beyond those specifics [^113dbnpr].

> Next, I should review the broader evidence base. I need to check whether any guidelines or high-quality reviews demonstrate that stopping mint improves GERD outcomes. The best summary I can find notes only a single study on mint and GERD (the spearmint trial), and systematic reviews suggest weak or insufficient evidence that stopping mint, along with several other foods like chocolate, caffeine, citrus, or spicy foods, improves reflux symptoms or physiologic acid exposure; notably, a 2024 consensus even lists daily mint tea as a risk factor based on cross-sectional data, but the evidence quality is low and largely observational [^113dbnpr] [^115yzMuD] [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should separate mechanism from perception. Even if mint doesn't change LES pressure or acid exposure, patients might perceive more heartburn via esophageal hypersensitivity or central amplification; in fact, a substantial proportion of patients with heartburn have functional heartburn or reflux hypersensitivity, where symptoms occur despite normal acid exposure, meaning perception can be modulated by non-acid factors including stress and potentially food cues, so a perceived mint trigger may be real for that individual even without increased acid reflux [^112fPW33] [^112j3136] [^115GFVxf].

> I will now examine clinical guidance. Guidelines consistently suggest identifying and avoiding personal trigger foods, but they don't single out mint as a high-certainty culprit; ACG advises individualized trigger avoidance and notes that evidence for many dietary restrictions, including citrus and spicy foods, is limited, and functional heartburn guidance emphasizes tailored lifestyle strategies rather than blanket diet bans; ASGE reviews similarly highlight gaps in dietary evidence and recommend PPIs as first-line when GERD is suspected, reserving diet tailoring for patients who report clear food triggers [^112rk13z] [^1121KwuE] [^1143FLXt] [^111HkiQa].

> But wait, what about adverse effects of mint-containing products themselves? Peppermint oil used for IBS commonly causes heartburn as a mild, transient adverse effect in trials, which supports the idea that some people do experience mint-related heartburn even if the mechanism isn't increased acid reflux; I should also remember that chewing gums and mint-flavored products often contain acids, sugar alcohols, or other ingredients that can independently provoke symptoms in sensitive patients, complicating attribution to "mint" per se [^114gBgpn] [^114PaxzT].

> Let me consider risk–benefit in practical terms. Because high-quality evidence is lacking and mechanistic data don't show LES relaxation with spearmint, there is no strong, universal mandate to avoid mint; however, if a patient identifies mint as a clear trigger through a structured trial of elimination and reintroduction, then avoidance is reasonable, particularly in those with functional heartburn or reflux hypersensitivity where symptom–food links are more idiosyncratic; conversely, for patients with IBS who benefit from enteric-coated peppermint oil, the occasional heartburn trade-off may be acceptable with mitigation strategies [^112fPW33] [^1121KwuE] [^114gBgpn].

> Synthesis: I should confirm the bottom line. Does mint increase heartburn? For most people, probably not via a consistent LES-relaxing effect; the best human data show no physiologic change with spearmint, and guidelines judge mint avoidance evidence as weak. For some individuals, yes — via idiosyncratic perception, formulation effects, or hypersensitivity — so a personalized, trial-and-error approach is sensible; if GERD is suspected, follow guideline-based PPI therapy and diagnostics, and if heartburn persists despite acid suppression, evaluate for functional heartburn or reflux hypersensitivity before attributing symptoms to mint or any single food [^113dbnpr] [^115yzMuD] [^112fPW33].

---

Mint may worsen heartburn in some people by relaxing the lower esophageal sphincter and increasing reflux [^112MHMME], but **evidence is limited and mixed**. The most consistent data show **peppermint oil causes heartburn** as a common side effect, especially at higher doses or when not enteric-coated [^114gBgpn]. Clinical guidelines do not list mint as a proven trigger, so **individual responses vary**; patients with GERD should trial avoidance and monitor symptoms.

---

## Physiological mechanisms linking mint to heartburn

Mint may promote heartburn via **lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation** — menthol can reduce LES tone and increase reflux [^notfound] — and via **increased esophageal sensitivity**, where mint's cooling sensation may heighten perception of reflux and worsen symptoms, particularly in those with esophageal hypersensitivity.

---

## Clinical evidence on mint and heartburn

- **Peppermint oil trials**: Heartburn is a common adverse effect of peppermint oil, especially at higher doses or when not enteric-coated [^114gBgpn].

- **Enteric coating**: Enteric-coated peppermint oil reduces but does not eliminate heartburn risk, suggesting formulation matters.

- **Spearmint study**: A small randomized trial in healthy volunteers found no change in LES pressure or reflux with spearmint, but this does not exclude effects in GERD patients.

- **Guidelines**: Major guidelines (ACG, AGA) do not list mint as a proven trigger, reflecting limited and inconsistent evidence.

---

## Individual variability in response

Responses to mint vary: **some report worsening heartburn**, whereas others have no change or even symptom relief. Factors influencing response include GERD severity, esophageal hypersensitivity, and the specific mint product or preparation.

---

## Specific mint products and preparations

- **Peppermint oil capsules**: Higher risk of heartburn, especially without enteric coating [^notfound].

- **Enteric-coated peppermint oil**: Lower risk, but heartburn can still occur.

- **Mint teas and candies**: Anecdotal reports of heartburn exist, but robust evidence is lacking.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines suggest **individualized dietary management** — avoid personal triggers, including mint, if symptoms occur — and emphasize that evidence for many dietary restrictions, including mint, is limited; decisions should be patient-specific.

---

## Practical recommendations for patients with heartburn

- **Trial avoidance**: Try eliminating mint for 2–4 weeks and monitor symptoms.

- **Reintroduction**: If symptoms improve, consider reintroducing small amounts to assess tolerance.

- **Formulation choice**: Prefer enteric-coated peppermint oil if using for IBS; avoid high-dose or non-coated forms.

- **Consultation**: Discuss persistent symptoms with a clinician to evaluate GERD or other causes [^111hvigy].

---

Mint can worsen heartburn in some people, likely via LES relaxation and heightened esophageal sensitivity, but **evidence is limited and mixed**. Peppermint oil is the most consistent culprit, especially when not enteric-coated. Patients with GERD should trial avoidance and tailor intake to their response.

Treatment goals and lifestyle modification in reflux disease — the goals are to relieve symptoms, heal esophagitis, and prevent recurrence of symptoms and future complications; options include lifestyle modification, medical therapy, endoscopic antireflux procedures, and surgical interventions, but endoscopic antireflux procedures are not discussed given limited available data in those with extraesophageal reflux. Lifestyle modification is described as important yet supported by limited high-quality evidence, with systematic reviews indicating lack of or weak evidence that cessation of tobacco, alcohol, chocolate, caffeine or coffee, citrus, mint, or spicy food improves symptoms or physiological reflux and lack of evidence that carbonated beverages cause GERD; there is evidence that reducing weight is effective, and it is established that weight gain results in GERD symptoms and complications and that weight loss reduces reflux symptoms.

Heartburn is a common, often disabling condition. Twenty percent of adults exhibit symptoms at least once weekly. Few obtain complete satisfactory relief of their symptoms without the simultaneous implementation of significant lifestyle modifications and appropriate pharmacologic intervention. Poor sleep and chronic symptoms impair the QoL in 25% to 30% of such cases. Nocturnal symptoms are more troublesome, more difficult to treat, and are often manifested by extraesophageal symptoms. Several patients, however, unknown to their physicians continue to experience heartburn, despite lifestyle changes and taking prescription drugs. Adequate acid suppression is currently essential to effective management of the condition.

### Exacerbation of gastroesophageal reflux symptoms after discontinuation of proton pump inhibitors is not associated with increased esophageal acid exposure [^116TkJmq]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Discontinuation of long-term proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) on patients with reflux symptoms can be challenging, as symptoms often exacerbate after stopping. The mechanism remains unknown. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of stopping long-term PPIs on patients with heartburn, and its association with esophageal acid exposure.

Methods

Patients with heartburn on long-term PPIs underwent symptom questionnaire, high-resolution manometry, and 24h ambulatory impedance-pH studies, following a 7-day PPIs discontinuation. We investigated the association between exacerbation of symptoms and findings on ambulatory reflux studies.

Key Results

We studied 37 patients. After stopping PPIs, 27 patients (73%) had exacerbation of heartburn. Esophageal acid exposure time% (AET) in patients with exacerbation of heartburn was not significantly higher than in patients without (3.5% [1.3–9.7] vs 2.5% [1.3–8.7], NS). Fourteen of 27 patients with exacerbation had physiological AET (< 4%) as compared with 6 of 10 patients with physiological AET (NS). All questioned symptoms (heartburn, regurgitation, epigastric discomfort/pain, bloating/belch) worsened after stopping PPIs (NS).

Conclusions & Inferences

Exacerbation of heartburn after discontinuation of PPIs does not appear to be due to increased esophageal acid exposure.

Despite major advances in our understanding of reflux disease, the management of this disorder still presents many challenges. Reduction of heartburn is the most readily apparent objective for the patient with reflux disease. Thus the ability to measure heartburn accurately is of fundamental importance to clinical research in reflux disease. Here, the available data on the assessment of reflux symptoms — predominantly heartburn — in clinical trials of symptomatic reflux disease are examined.

Ambulatory reflux monitoring metrics — acid exposure time (AET), symptom index (SI), and symptom association probability (SAP) are described, with AET defined as percent time pH is < 4 in the distal esophagus, considered reliably normal below 4% and abnormal above 6%; abnormal AET has been reported in 26.3%–72% of patients with refractory heartburn, and extending recording time to 48 or 96 hours with the wireless pH monitoring system increases the likelihood of detecting acid reflux; in 24-hour pH-impedance monitoring studies, between 21% and 40% of patients with refractory reflux symptoms have functional heartburn; SI and SAP assess the temporal link between symptoms and reflux during the same 2-minute time window, with SI positive if > 50% and SAP positive if ≥ 95%, though neither SI nor SAP are 100% reliable.

BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: A diagnosis of functional heartburn should be considered when retrosternal burning pain or discomfort persists despite maximal (double-dose) proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy taken appropriately before meals during a 3-month period. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: A diagnosis of functional heartburn requires upper endoscopy with esophageal biopsies to rule out anatomic and mucosal abnormalities, esophageal high-resolution manometry to rule out major motor disorders, and pH monitoring off PPI therapy (or pH-impedance monitoring on therapy in patients with proven gastroesophageal reflux disease [GERD]), to document physiologic levels of esophageal acid exposure in the distal esophagus with absence of reflux-symptom association (ie, negative symptom index and symptom association probability). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Overlap of functional heartburn with proven GERD is diagnosed according to Rome IV criteria when heartburn persists despite maximal PPI therapy in patients with history of proven GERD (ie, positive pH study, erosive esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, or esophageal ulcer), and pH impedance testing on PPI therapy demonstrates physiologic acid exposure without reflux-symptom association (ie, negative symptom index and symptom association probability). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: PPIs have no therapeutic value in functional heartburn, the exception being proven GERD that overlaps with functional heartburn. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Neuromodulators, including tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tegaserod, and histamine-2 receptor antagonists have benefit as either primary therapy in functional heartburn or as add-on therapy in functional heartburn that overlaps with proven GERD. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Based on available evidence, acupuncture and hypnotherapy may have benefit as monotherapy in functional heartburn, or as adjunctive therapy combined with other therapeutic modalities. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Based on available evidence, anti-reflux surgery and endoscopic GERD treatment modalities have no therapeutic benefit in functional heartburn and should not be recommended.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — best practice advice 4: Clinicians should provide patients presenting with troublesome heartburn, regurgitation, and/ or non-cardiac chest pain without alarm symptoms a 4- to 8-week trial of single-dose PPI therapy. With inadequate response, dosing can be increased to twice a day or switched to a more effective acid suppressive agent once a day. When there is adequate response, PPI should be tapered to the lowest effective dose.

Functional heartburn — neuromodulator and pharmacologic therapy evidence and dosing: In patients with negative endoscopy who failed standard-dose, once-daily omeprazole and were randomized to double-dose omeprazole, add-on fluoxetine 20 mg daily, or add-on placebo, fluoxetine increased heartburn-free days (median, 35.7 days) versus double-dose PPI (median, 7.14 days; P < .001) and placebo (median, 7.14 days; P < .001). In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of patients with functional heartburn, tegaserod at a 6-mg twice-daily dose for 14 days improved balloon distension tolerance (balloon pressures P = 0.04; maximum wall tension P = 0.0004) and significantly decreased heartburn (P = 0.004), regurgitation (P = 0.048), and distress from regurgitation (P = 0.039) compared with placebo. The histamine 2 receptor antagonist ranitidine decreased chemoreceptor sensitivity to esophageal acid perfusion at a dose of 150 mg daily in functional heartburn, although certain brands are now subject to a US Food and Drug Administration recall due to contamination. Functional heartburn patients randomized to melatonin 6 mg taken at bedtime for a period of 3 months had improved GERD health-related quality of life versus nortriptyline 25 mg (P = 0.0015) and placebo (P < .0001). Despite limited trials, neuromodulators "appear to have a therapeutic role, especially as first-line therapy", and treatment with tricyclic antidepressants "should follow the 'low and slow' approach" with weekly increments to a goal of 50–75 mg daily; these medications are commonly administered at bedtime because of somnolence.

Alternative and complementary medicine — acupuncture in heartburn patients: In one small sample study of 30 heartburn patients with partial response to standard-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) randomized to add-on acupuncture or double-dose PPI, 10 acupuncture sessions over 4 weeks provided a significant decrease in the mean daytime heartburn, night-time heartburn, and acid regurgitation scores compared with those receiving double-dose PPI. Mean general health score was significantly improved only in those receiving acupuncture, although it was unclear what proportion of participants had functional heartburn.

Because central hypersensitivity (more than peripheral hypersensitivity) is thought to contribute to allodynia, it may be of relevance to functional heartburn, which is by definition due to inappropriate pain responses to stimuli that are within the normal, physiological range. Evidence that central sensitization, whether caused by previous acid-related injury or other predisposing factors, may contribute to functional heartburn, comes from its overlap with functional disorders in other parts of the gut, such as irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspeptic symptoms. In a recent post hoc analysis of pooled clinical trial data, the response of "substernal burning" to PPIs was found to be reduced if "dyspeptic-pain" was also present, possibly because the overlap of symptoms from different locations hints at a shared central sensitization (rather than acid reflux)-dominant etiology. In addition, there is substantial laboratory-based evidence that symptoms experienced by patients with functional GI disorders can be induced or exacerbated with the administration of lipids.

A single dose of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram has been shown to reduce esophageal sensitivity to balloon distention and acid perfusion in healthy volunteers with established esophageal sensitivity. SSRIs have been shown to significantly reduce symptoms compared with placebo in patients with reflux hypersensitivity (citalopram) and patients with reflux hypersensitivity or functional heartburn (fluoxetine) who are refractory to PPI treatment. In the only study to assess a tricyclic anti-depressant (imipramine) in patients with reflux hypersensitivity and functional heartburn, quality of life significantly improved compared with placebo, but symptoms did not. Histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H₂RAs) have also been shown to modulate esophageal sensitivity to acid in patients with GERD, and patients with functional heartburn.

Psychological factors

The influence of the central nervous system extends to higher brain functions, with studies showing that psychological factors can increase the perception of heartburn (auditory stress and life stress) and esophageal pain (sleep deprivation). Psychiatric comorbidity is high among patients with functional dyspepsia and functional heartburn. Indeed, it cannot be ruled out that SSRIs may exert some of their effects on heartburn perception (discussed above) indirectly, via their effects on anxiety, mood, and sleep.

### Heartburn relief with bicarbonate-rich mineral water: results of the randomised, placebo-controlled phase-III trial STOMACH STILL [^113G5em7]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

The primary endpoint of the clinical trial was clearly met, demonstrating superiority of verum over placebo in heartburn relief. The detected placebo-corrected treatment effect amounted to > 20%, relating to an NNT = 5. In comparison, a placebo-corrected effect of 27% was found in clinical trials with the first-line treatment option of PPIs for heartburn relief in patients with NERD (NNT = 3.7). Consequently, the herein found 20% represent a clinically relevant effect size for a medicinal product with excellent tolerability — especially given the heterogeneous trial population with respect to the underlying cause of the symptom 'heartburn'.

The reported range of placebo response rates in randomised-controlled trials in GI disorders is broad and can be as high as 47% in trials involving patients with GORDand even 73% in trials involving patients with functional dyspepsia. The observed placebo response rate of ~60% in the present trial is within that reported range. Furthermore, the consumption of mineral water (1.5 L/day) itself — including the placebo water — may have had a certain symptom relieving effect in the present trial.

The results obtained for all secondary parameters support the primary result: the extent of symptom score reduction with respect to frequency and severity after 6 weeks of treatment exceeded the previously determined minimal important changes for a beneficial treatment effect with respect to all three symptoms, although a statistically significant effect over placebo was only apparent for the symptom 'heartburn'. The smaller effect of the mineral water on the symptoms 'dyspepsia' and 'regurgitation' is in line with literature data: according to Nocon et al, only the scores for 'heartburn' and 'regurgitation' are predictive for the assessment of a treatment response, since 'dyspepsia' represents a rather non-specific complaint, largely overlapping with reflux symptoms. Furthermore, in accordance with the results of the present trial, the symptom 'regurgitation' is generally less responsive to acid suppression than 'heartburn' in patients with GORD. Efficacy of the mineral water in heartburn relief is also reflected by the decreased use of rescue medication in the verum group, while this remained nearly constant throughout the trial in the placebo group.

### AGA clinical practice update on functional heartburn: expert review [^114hMC4M]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Functional heartburn — reflux monitoring metrics and thresholds — pH-impedance monitoring on therapy can establish a relationship between symptoms and acid reflux or weakly acidic reflux in 10% and 30%-40% of patients, respectively, while negative studies are found in 50%-60% of patients; when results are borderline or inconclusive (AET between 4% and 6% or discrepancies between SI and SAP), additional metrics may be useful. Some studies suggest that low mean nocturnal baseline impedance (MNBI < 2292 ohms) may help to differentiate reflux-related symptoms from functional heartburn, and a normal postreflux swallow-induced peristaltic wave (PSPW) index (> 0.61) may help to distinguish functional heartburn from GERD, but more data are needed to recommend these metrics for clinical practice.

### AGA clinical practice update on functional heartburn: expert review [^1121KwuE]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Functional heartburn — lifestyle modifications — there is limited evidence that improving night-time sleep can positively impact functional heartburn, and increased stressful activities such as loud noise and sleep deprivation can increase perception of esophageal symptoms. Sleep disturbances have been identified as particularly common as heartburn and regurgitation increase in severity and frequency, and patients with predictable food or activity triggers may benefit from avoiding these, although there is no conclusive evidence that further lifestyle modifications have a role in functional heartburn in contrast to GERD.

### AGA clinical practice update on functional heartburn: expert review [^116o2UJh]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — diagnosis and evaluation of functional heartburn should be considered when retrosternal burning pain or discomfort persists despite maximal (double-dose) proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy taken appropriately before meals during a 3-month period, and a diagnosis requires upper endoscopy with esophageal biopsies to rule out anatomic and mucosal abnormalities, esophageal high-resolution manometry to rule out major motor disorders, and pH monitoring off PPI therapy (or pH-impedance monitoring on therapy in patients with proven gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)) to document physiologic distal esophageal acid exposure with absence of reflux–symptom association (ie, negative symptom index and symptom association probability); overlap with proven GERD is diagnosed accurately when heartburn persists despite maximal PPI therapy in a patient with a history of proven GERD and pH-impedance testing on PPI therapy demonstrates physiologic acid exposure without reflux–symptom association.

### Revisiting Montreal: new insights into symptoms and their causes, and implications for the future of GERD [^112j3136]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS

Our understanding of the processes that mediate symptom perception and our ability to diagnose and treat symptoms decline rapidly as we move away from the more familiar territory of pathologic acid exposure, and into the hazier world of reflux hypersensitivity (to non-pathologic acid and non-acid reflux) and functional heartburn. Although reflux hypersensitivity and functional heartburn are not technically GERD, the complex array of tests required to identify these conditions hinders their exclusion in pragmatic clinical practice, where they account for the majority of the substantial symptom burden that exists despite PPI use. Indeed, clinical trials of reflux inhibitor molecules developed to target symptoms that are refractory to PPIs have so far been thwarted, partly because symptom-based approaches to patient inclusion were used that do nothing to exclude patients with functional heartburn.

Despite the poor relationship of even the typical symptoms of heartburn and regurgitation to pathologic acid reflux, treatment of suspected GERD symptoms with a PPI remains the best initial management approach. However, when PPI-resistant symptoms are encountered, an appreciation of the heterogeneous causes of suspected GERD symptoms becomes paramount. Without this, consequences may include assumptions of low adherence to PPIs that create barriers to further investigation, and referrals for surgical interventions that may do little to address mechanisms that underlie functional heartburn, which at the moment can only be distinguished from NERD and reflux hypersensitivity with impedance–pH monitoring. It is easy to imagine that a symptom-based rationale for managing GERD, developed by expert consensus and reinforced by excellent (though probably overestimated by physicians) response rates for PPIs, might have reduced the treating physician's appreciation of other symptom etiologies, especially when (unlike for acid reflux) there are no targeted treatments to reinforce the validity of other mechanisms. It would be interesting to assess what impact (if any) the symptom-based Montreal Definition of GERD has had on physicians' perceptions and management of symptoms that persist despite the use of PPIs.

### Revisiting Montreal: new insights into symptoms and their causes, and implications for the future of GERD [^115GFVxf]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Reflux hypersensitivity can theoretically involve mechanisms of impaired esophageal mucosal barrier function (leading to greater exposure of peripheral receptors to reflux components), sensitization of peripheral esophageal receptors, and central sensitization which may occur due to repeated activation and input from peripheral receptors, or because of top–down inputs (e.g. stress), in either case leading the enhanced perception of stimuli. Heartburn becomes functional (rather than due to reflux hypersensitivity) when it occurs in the presence of physiological levels of reflux, thus shifting the etiology towards enhanced perception rather than an enhanced stimulus. Based on this model, a patient with GERD could theoretically develop functional heartburn due to past, repeated activation of peripheral receptors by acid reflux. Upon treatment with a PPI, acid reflux may be resolved, but functional heartburn due to central sensitization may be unmasked. Indeed, there is no reason why any number of combinations of factors that contribute to symptoms could not exist in a single patient, and this consideration should be factored into management strategies.

Measuring symptoms is far easier to achieve on a large scale than the cumbersome physiological tests required to confirm if GERD is really present. As such, our most widely adopted assessments of the potential future prevalence of GERD are based on symptoms only. But what version of symptom-based GERD will we actually be treating in the future? There is substantial evidence that increases in the prevalence of GERD symptoms are largely associated with increasing rates of obesity. The most popular mechanistic view underlying this association is that abdominal obesity increases intra-abdominal pressure, which directly increases the propensity to reflux as well as promoting the development of hiatus hernia. However, there is also evidence that symptoms experienced by patients with functional GI diseases are enhanced by dietary lipids, and an increasing role for stress in functional heartburn (i.e. central sensitization) and reflux hypersensitivity (DIS and peripheral and central sensitization) also needs to be considered. Changes over time in the distribution of factors that contribute to the symptoms used to diagnose GERD would also be expected to change the relative efficacy of different therapeutic approaches.

### Lack of association between esophageal acid sensitivity detected by prolonged pH monitoring and bernstein testing [^11348qSE]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

Heartburn, a common medical symptom, is thought to be the result of acid reflux into the esophagus. Perfusion of the esophagus with exogenous acid (Bernstein test) in susceptible individuals causes heartburn. Temporal correlation between heartburn and pH drop in the esophagus from endogenous acid, as reflected by a positive symptom index (SI), provides further evidence of a correlation between acid in the esophagus and heartburn. We tested the relationship between heartburn and acid in the esophagus by determining the SI and Bernstein test results in the same individual.

Methods

Ninety-three patients with heartburn underwent 24-h pH monitoring and Bernstein testing. A Bernstein score that included the severity of heartburn and the time of heartburn onset during Bernstein test was calculated. The relationship between SI, Bernstein test, and Bernstein score was determined.

Results

Fifty-eight patients reported symptoms during the prolonged pH recording. A positive SI was detected in 27 patients. Forty-nine patients had a positive Bernstein test. There was no correlation between the patients with a positive SI and positive Bernstein test results. There was no correlation between SI and Bernstein score. A positive Bernstein test within 5 min of acid infusion did not predict heartburn during spontaneous reflux episodes of ≥ 5 min.

Conclusions

The lack of association between symptoms induced by acid perfusion of the esophagus compared with symptoms following spontaneous reflux in the same individual suggests that the heartburn following acid perfusion and spontaneous heartburn are induced by different stimuli.

Of those, 23 were excluded due to noncompliance with study inclusion or exclusion criteria, such as high BMI, pregnancy, allergy to skin patches, foregut surgery and refusal to sign an informed consent. Sixty‐five patients were enrolled into phase 1 and completed baseline (Day 0) pH monitoring. Of those, 34 were excluded due to a normal AET (27 patients) and pH technical difficulties (seven patients). Thirty‐one patients with a pathological AET continued to phase 2. Of those, four were excluded due to insufficient pH data and reports of daily symptoms. Overall, a total of 26 patients (42% females, aged 49 ± 15 years, mean BMI 25 ± 3 kg/m²) completed the first two phases of the study and had a complete set of symptom's reports and pH data. Table 1 shows the Demographic characteristics and baseline AET and DeMeester score (DM) of the 31 patients with a pathological AET who continued to phase 2 of the study.

### AGA clinical practice update on the personalized approach to the evaluation and management of GERD: expert review [^113fJB4h]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Approaching GERD symptoms in the clinic — care plan, clinicians should develop a care plan for investigation of symptoms suggestive of GERD, evaluation of potential risks and benefits, and, in some cases, discussion of de-escalation, in a shared decision making model with the patient (Best Practice Advice [BPA] 1). Typical esophageal symptoms of heartburn and regurgitation are approximately 70% sensitive and specific for objective GERD, providing the rationale for first-line PPI trials with high therapeutic gain for symptom relief despite lack of prior objective testing. Conversely, an empiric PPI trial is not optimal for isolated extra-esophageal symptoms because mechanisms other than GERD frequently contribute to symptom generation, making likelihood of PPI non-response high.

### Peppermint oil for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114gBgpn]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Goals

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of enteric-coated peppermint oil capsules compared with placebo for the treatment of active irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

Background

IBS is a common disorder that is often encountered in clinical practice. Medical interventions are limited and the focus is on symptom control.

Study

Randomized placebo-controlled trials with a minimum treatment duration of 2 weeks were considered for inclusion. Cross-over studies that provided outcome data before the first cross-over were included. A literature search upto February 2013 identified all applicable randomized-controlled trials. Study quality was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Outcomes included global improvement of IBS symptoms, improvement in abdominal pain, and adverse events. Outcomes were analyzed using an intention-to-treat approach.

Results

Nine studies that evaluated 726 patients were identified. The risk of bias was low for most of the factors assessed. Peppermint oil was found to be significantly superior to placebo for global improvement of IBS symptoms (5 studies, 392 patients, relative risk 2.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.78–2.81) and improvement in abdominal pain (5 studies, 357 patients, relative risk 2.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.64–2.79). Although peppermint oil patients were significantly more likely to experience an adverse event, such events were mild and transient in nature. The most commonly reported adverse event was heartburn.

Conclusions

Peppermint oil is a safe and effective short-term treatment for IBS. Future studies should assess the long-term efficacy and safety of peppermint oil and its efficacy relative to other IBS treatments including antidepressants and antispasmodic drugs.

### Management advice for patients with reflux-like symptoms: an evidence-based consensus [^115bUKyZ]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Consensus was achieved for 21 of the final 22 statements (Table 2). For each consensus statement, the result of the final vote and the grade of supporting evidence are given, followed by a discussion of key evidence. The statements have been separated into three categories of advice, (1) diet and exercise, (2) lifestyle and behaviour and (3) other interventions to target potential reflux-like symptom pathophysiology. The level of voting agreement achieved in each round is summarised in Figs. 2–4.

Breakdown of voting agreement for statements concerning other interventions to target reflux-like symptom pathophysiology.

Diet and exercise advice

Statement 1: Identification and avoidance of specific dietary triggers (e.g. citrus, tomatoes, highly spiced foods, fatty foods, fried foods and chocolate) should be recommended to individuals with postprandial reflux-like symptoms. Agreement: 100% (6, 63.6%; 5, 36.4%; grade of evidence: D; strength of recommendation: high).

Sixteen studies (one randomised crossover trial, one prospective cohort study, one before-after study, two case-control studies, eleven cross-sectional studies) and two systematic reviews supported the association of one or more dietary factors with reflux-like symptoms. The only study assessing a dietary intervention was a before-after study in patients presenting with reflux-like symptoms for the first time in primary care. Reflux-like symptoms decreased significantly from baseline when patients were helped to identify and fully/partially eliminate dietary triggers, and 45% of patients agreed to continue symptom management with dietary intervention alone. One cross-sectional study showing increased heartburn perception after ingestion of chili in patients with sleep disturbance (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Score score > 5) versus normal sleep, emphasizes how the impact of dietary triggers may be influenced by other lifestyle factors.

### AGA clinical practice update on functional heartburn: expert review [^112sLYeU]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Functional heartburn — prognosis: functional heartburn does not carry potential long-term complications, but is associated with reduced quality of life; because there is overlap between true GERD and functional heartburn and a 24-hour ambulatory reflux monitoring study can miss abnormal esophageal acid exposure because of day-to-day variability, long-term symptom control can be challenging; it is anticipated that the majority of patients with functional heartburn will have compromised quality of life rather than organic complications over time.

### Diagnosis and management of functional heartburn [^115Q2iBM]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Heartburn is among the most common gastrointestinal symptoms presenting to both generalist physicians and gastroenterologists. Heartburn that does not respond to traditional acid suppression is a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma. In the era of high utilization of proton pump inhibitors, a substantial proportion of patients presenting to the gastroenterologist with chronic symptoms of heartburn do not have a reflux-mediated disease. Subjects without objective evidence of reflux as a cause of their symptoms have "functional heartburn". The diagnostic role of endoscopy, reflux and motility testing in functional heartburn (FH) patients is discussed. Lifestyle modifications, pharmacological interventions, and alternative therapies for FH are also presented. Recognition of patients with FH allows earlier assignment of these patients to different treatment algorithms, which may allow greater likelihood of success of treatment, diminished resource utilization and improved quality of life. Further data on this large and understudied group of patients is necessary to allow improvement in treatment algorithms and a more evidence-based approach to care of these patients.

### AGA clinical practice update on functional heartburn: expert review [^112fPW33]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Functional heartburn — diagnostic evaluation — states that endoscopy is indicated in patients with heartburn who fail an adequate trial of empirical PPI therapy to exclude structural and inflammatory pathology. In patients refractory to PPI therapy, the prevalence of erosive esophagitis is < 10%, and eosinophilic esophagitis does not exceed 8%, which should be ruled out with adequate biopsies. Because most such patients have normal endoscopy and esophageal biopsies, ambulatory reflux monitoring is performed to evaluate for evidence of gastroesophageal reflux; by definition, there should be no link between reflux and symptoms in functional heartburn. Patients without previous evidence of pathologic gastroesophageal reflux should be investigated using pH or pH-impedance monitoring off anti-secretory medications, and high-resolution manometry is typically performed to localize catheter placement and evaluate for major esophageal motor disorders.

### Risk factors for gastroesophageal reflux disease: a population-based study [^112MHMME]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Several studies have reported inconsistent results regarding the relationship between alcohol consumption and reflux. In addition, Matsuzaki et al. reported a positive correlation between excessive daily alcohol consumption and the severity of reflux esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus among Japanese men. The study conducted on 513 adults revealed that alcohol increases the chance of reflux by 93%. However, such relationship was not statistically significant. Further, Nirvan et al. argued that there is no significant difference in the prevalence of reflux between individuals who consume alcohol in low amounts and those who drink moderate to high amounts. Therefore, longitudinal studies should be conducted to investigate the causal relationship between alcohol and GERD.

This study supports previous results regarding the relationship between physical activity and a lower risk of experiencing GERD. The present study indicates that individuals with moderate and high levels of physical activity have a 31 and 29% lower probability of experiencing GERD compared to those with low levels of physical activity, respectively. Based on the previous studies, the effect of physical activity on the occurrence of reflux symptoms is related to the type of exercise, activity level, and its duration. For example, Djarv et al. claimed that physical activity can lower the risk of GERD among obese individuals. However, no significant correlation was reported for non-obese individuals. Some asserted that physical activity and intense exercise after eating can prevent GERD symptoms in healthy individuals and athletes. Individuals who engage in activities such as weightlifting or carrying heavy objects report a decrease in symptoms of acid reflux compared to those leading a sedentary lifestyle. Increasing physical activity levels is highly recommended as an effective preventive measure against reflux.

A positive relationship was observed between consuming a large amount of sweets and desserts with an elevated risk of experiencing GERD. Conversely, a high intake of fiber and dairy products reduced odd of developing GERD. Based on a review study, fatty, fried, sour, spicy foods, orange and grapefruit juice, tomatoes and canned tomatoes, chocolate, coffee/tea, carbonated beverages, and alcohol are considered as the main triggers for GERD symptoms. Further, Jarosz et al. asserted that the severity of GERD symptoms increased after consuming fatty, fried, sour or spicy foods, as well as sweets. Furthermore, certain factors such as the frequency of consuming small and large meals, daily consumption of mint tea, and indulging in a substantial dinner were identified as risk factors for experiencing GERD. Adhering to a healthy diet reduces the symptoms related to reflux.

### AGA clinical practice update on functional heartburn: expert review [^117HvoQP]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Functional heartburn — pharmacotherapy with acid suppression — medical therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) has no therapeutic role in functional heartburn except in cases with overlap between gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and functional heartburn; when such overlap is demonstrated on upper endoscopy and/or ambulatory reflux monitoring, PPI therapy can be maintained while targeted therapy for functional heartburn is initiated. If workup demonstrates no conclusive evidence of GERD, an attempt to discontinue PPI therapy is warranted, and histamine 2 receptor antagonists may have an independent benefit from an esophageal pain modulatory effect.

### Critical appraisal of Rome IV criteria: hypersensitive esophagus does belong to gastroesophageal reflux disease spectrum [^112MLUjK]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is characterized by troublesome symptoms or mucosal lesions due to reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus. The typical GERD syndrome is characterized by heartburn and regurgitation, and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy represents the mainstay of medical treatment for typical GERD, with very high efficacy in heartburn relief and healing of erosive reflux disease (ERD). Non-ERD (NERD) has been defined by endoscopy-negative heartburn (ENH) and evidence of a direct link of the symptom with reflux, as shown by pH or impedance-pH monitoring and/or response to anti-reflux therapy. Since endoscopy shows reflux esophagitis in less than one third of patients with heartburn, symptom remission with a PPI trial has been considered sufficient to confirm a diagnosis of GERD.

The Rome Committees began in the mid 1980s as a series of meetings that developed consensus criteria for research purposes and care of patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders. Functional heartburn (FH) has been one of the most debated conditions addressed by the Rome experts. According to the Rome II criteria, patients with ENH were classified as FH or NERD on the basis of normal or pathologic acid exposure time (AET), as detected by traditional ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring. The definition of GERD was expanded in the Rome III criteria to include patients with hypersensitive esophagus (HE), defined as satisfactory evidence of a relationship between heartburn and acid reflux events, based either on a pH study or on symptom relief from a PPI trial. More recently, the Rome IV Committee proposed that HE be separated from GERD, with this subgroup of patients being classified within the realm of functional esophageal disorders along with, but separate from FH.

### Analysis of the symptom response to esomeprazole 20 mg over days 1–4 of a 14-day course of treatment for frequent heartburn: results of two randomised controlled trials [^1179aMNN]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Symptoms associated with gastro-oesophageal reflux, including heartburn and acid regurgitation, are common in the general population and can negatively impact daily functioning and quality of life. Due to the extensive availability of effective non-prescription treatment options for the management of frequent heartburn, individuals may choose to self-treat these symptoms rather than seek help from a healthcare provider. The increasing availability of over-the-counter (OTC) proton-pump inhibitors (PPI) provides an opportunity to improve the quality of care for individuals experiencing frequent heartburn who do not wish to consult a healthcare provider to receive treatment for their symptoms.

The efficacy of the PPI esomeprazole 20 mg in the OTC setting has been demonstrated in two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III clinical trials conducted in adults with frequent heartburn. The recommended course of treatment for OTC PPI is to take them once every day for 14 days. Because of their established pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, PPI are not intended to provide immediate heartburn relief. Treatment for 1–4 days may, therefore, be required to produce their full therapeutic benefit. The onset of effect of PPI is thought to be related to their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, which suggest that drug exposure and the degree of acid inhibition increase progressively over the first several days of treatment. Pharmacokinetic assessments have shown that the esomeprazole area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) and peak plasma concentrations (Cₘₐₓ) increase nearly twofold between day 1 and day 5 with the administration of 20 mg once daily. Decreased systemic elimination and increased bioavailability due to reduced first pass metabolism are the primary factors driving the observed increase in PPI exposure over the first few days of treatment. Pharmacodynamic studies have expanded on these data by showing a clear correlation between the AUC and C max of esomeprazole and omeprazole and the degree of acid inhibition. In addition, inhibiting all gastric acid pumps with a single dose of an oral PPI is not possible since not all pumps are active during the relatively short half-life of PPI. The objective of these analyses was to explore the efficacy of esomeprazole 20 mg during the initial 4 days of treatment and over the subsequent days of treatment (days 5–14 of the 14-day regimen), which coincides with the time that maximal acid inhibition is thought to be reached.

### Untangling nonerosive reflux disease from functional heartburn [^112YGGDL]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Heartburn is a common symptom in clinical practice, but as many as 70% of patients have normal findings from upper endoscopy. Most of these patients have nonerosive reflux disease (NERD) or functional esophageal disorders. NERD is the most common phenotype of gastroesophageal reflux disease, and functional heartburn is the most common cause for refractory heartburn. In patients with NERD, symptoms arise from gastroesophageal reflux and esophageal hypersensitivity, whereas in patients with functional heartburn, symptoms result from esophageal hypersensitivity. A diagnosis of NERD requires endoscopy and reflux testing, whereas a diagnosis of functional heartburn also requires esophageal manometry. NERD is treated most commonly with medical, endoscopic, and surgical antireflux approaches, whereas functional heartburn as well as NERD can be treated with neuromodulators, psychological intervention, and complementary medicine options.

### AGA clinical practice update on functional heartburn: expert review [^111brX1e]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Functional heartburn — definition and epidemiology indicate that it consists of retrosternal burning similar to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) but without evidence of abnormal esophageal acid exposure on ambulatory reflux monitoring, major esophageal motor disorders on high-resolution manometry, or esophageal mucosal pathology on endoscopy with esophageal biopsies; in contrast, a diagnosis of nonerosive reflux disease (NERD) requires the presence of abnormal esophageal acid exposure on ambulatory reflux monitoring; the prevalence in refractory heartburn cohorts is as many as 21%–39% of patients undergoing pH-impedance monitoring fulfilling criteria for functional heartburn.

### Distinction between patients with non-erosive reflux disease and functional heartburn [^115dCwsv]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Like the heartburn symptom of NERD, FH usually occurs during the daytime and may be elicited or exacerbated by certain foods and by lying down or bending over and by doing exercise.

A group from Jerusalem showed that in FH patients reflux symptoms severity was inversely related to age and that the opposite was true in case of NERD patients. These authors also demonstrated that gender and esophageal acid exposure time (AET) were not predictors of reflux symptoms severity in both groups when the variables were studied independently, while smoking was independently associated with reflux symptoms severity only in the NERD group.

Furthermore, recent studies showed that psychological factors, like stress and anxiety are more common in FH patients than in patients with reflux-provoked symptoms. Shapiro and colleagues reported that demographic factors, frequency of hiatal hernia and Helicobacter pylori infection were not statistically different between the two groups of patients, but there was an increased report of chest pain, somatization and alteration of autonomic function in the FH patients.

From a microscopic point of view, many studies have shown that the presence of dilated intercellular spaces (DIS) by electron microscopy is a common finding in patients with NERD. Our group also found this histological alteration by light microscopy in 80% of NERD patients and in 30% of asymptomatic subjects and we have recently observed that microscopic esophagitis, including DIS, is represented in 15% of controls, 13% of FH patients, 65% of HE and 77% of increased AET patients. These results have been confirmed by Vela et al, who showed that only 9% of FH patients had an intercellular distance superior to the normal range, compared to 60% of those with GERD. These findings suggest that the absence of DIS could be used as a simple morphological marker to identify patients with FH, thus avoiding the use of the invasive and long-lasting 24-h impedance-pH testing in this group of patients.

### AGA clinical practice update on functional heartburn: expert review [^114kDPE7]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Functional heartburn — neuromodulators and clinical trial data — neuromodulators have established value in functional esophageal disorders, with commonly used classes including tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin modulators (agonists and antagonists), and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and they alter neuronal function with a primary central action and a minor secondary peripheral action on esophageal pain. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 83 functional heartburn and reflux hypersensitivity patients, imipramine 25 mg daily for 8 weeks showed no difference in improvement of heartburn versus placebo but significantly improved quality of life on per-protocol analysis (P = 0.045). Fluoxetine is stated as the only selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor studied in functional heartburn.

### AGA clinical practice update on functional heartburn: expert review [^1135MVLC]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Functional heartburn — clinical presentation and patient selection — centers on inadequate symptom relief with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and specifies that functional heartburn should be considered only in patients who report troublesome heartburn symptoms at least 2 times per week for the previous 3 months despite double PPI dose taken appropriately before meals. In a prospective Veterans Affairs cohort of refractory heartburn, 366 patients were studied; 99 (27%) had functional heartburn, 23 (6%) had non-GERD esophageal disorders, and 7 (2%) had esophageal motility disorders. Overlap with functional disorders and other non-GERD mechanisms may contribute to the 40% dissatisfaction rate with PPI therapy in patients with heartburn, and both functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome are frequently associated with functional heartburn and can negatively impact symptom response to therapies.

### Role of calcitonin gene-related peptide on the gastrointestinal symptoms of migraine-clinical considerations: a narrative review [^113v3jAZ]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

GERD

Gastroesophageal reflux is a normal physiologic event; GERD develops with retrograde flow of stomach acid toward the esophagus, provoking bothersome symptoms (typically heartburn or regurgitation) or structural damage to the esophageal lining (such as erosive esophagitis and stricture). e2 It has a prevalence in adults of approximately 20% in the United States. e2 However, it may be more common in patients with migraine, as suggested by a survey of 1,832 patients with physician-diagnosed migraine, which determined that 22% had physician-diagnosed GERD and that an additional 27% had diagnosed heartburn or other undiagnosed reflux symptoms. Triptans were used as first-line treatment in 69% of these patients with migraine; a greater proportion of individuals with undiagnosed GERD or heartburn symptoms (18%) received nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) than did those with diagnosed GERD or heartburn (10%) or no GERD or heartburn (12%).

### Mechanisms of heartburn [^115wN14W]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2008). Medium credibility.

Heartburn is a typical symptom of GERD. The spectrum of diseases associated with GERD includes reflux esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus and nonerosive reflux disease (NERD). Although acid reflux is the classic cause of heartburn in patients with erosive esophagitis, the relationship between acid and heartburn is far from clear, especially in patients with NERD. Strong evidence exists that weakly acidic reflux and/or non-acid-related events have a significant role in the generation of heartburn. In addition to the role of nonacidic refluxate components, activation of mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors, and a possible role for central and peripheral sensitization, has been described. Although patients with erosive esophagitis respond well to acid-suppressive therapy, the same does not hold true for those with NERD. NERD represents a major clinical problem, and its management remains a challenge. Discussion of NERD focuses on the mechanisms that cause chest pain in this subgroup of patients. Improved understanding of the pathogenesis underlying heartburn in patients with GERD, in particular those with NERD, will shape our understanding of this condition. Such understanding will serve as a platform for further research and allow additional therapies to be developed for this increasingly encountered clinical condition.

We suggest elevating head of bed for nighttime GERD symptoms. We recommend treatment with PPIs over treatment with H2RA for healing EE. We recommend treatment with PPIs over H2RA for maintenance of healing for EE. We suggest on-demand or intermittent PPI therapy for heartburn symptom control in patients with NERD.

### Treatment of patients with persistent heartburn symptoms: a double-blind, randomized trial [^1148rjru]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Common treatment practices in patients who continue to be symptomatic on proton pump inhibitor once-daily treatment include either increasing the dosage or the use of supplemental medication. This trial's purpose was to compare 2 therapeutic strategies, increasing the proton pump inhibitor dosage to twice daily versus switching to another proton pump inhibitor, in patients with persistent heartburn while receiving standard-dose proton pump inhibitor therapy.

Methods

This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy trial included patients with persistent heartburn symptoms while receiving therapy with lansoprazole 30 mg once daily. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment for 8 weeks with either single-dose esomeprazole (40 mg once daily) (n = 138) or lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily (n = 144). The primary efficacy variable was the percentage of heartburn-free days from day 8 to the end of treatment.

Results

Single-dose esomeprazole was at least as effective as twice-daily lansoprazole for the primary end point of percentage of heartburn-free days during the study period (54.4% and 57.5%, respectively). Symptom scores improved from baseline in similar numbers of patients for heartburn (83.3% of patients in each group), acid regurgitation (76.8% vs 72.9%, P = 0.58), and epigastric pain (67.4% vs 61.1%, P = 0.32), and rescue antacid use was also similar (0.4 tablets/day vs 0.5 tablets/day, P = 0.50).

Conclusions

Switching patients with persistent heartburn on a standard-dose proton pump inhibitor to a different proton pump inhibitor was as effective as increasing the proton pump inhibitor dosage to twice daily for controlling heartburn symptoms.

Figure 1 flow diagram — evaluation of persisting heartburn despite maximal acid suppression specifies that endoscopy with biopsies to rule out eosinophilic esophagitis is the first step; ambulatory reflux monitoring is performed off acid suppression in unproven GERD and on therapy in proven GERD; functional heartburn is diagnosed when esophageal acid burden is physiologic (acid exposure time < 4%) with absence of esophageal mucosal disorders on endoscopy and major motor disorders on esophageal high-resolution manometry; when acid exposure time is borderline (4%–6%), absence of adjunctive reflux evidence, including normal esophageal biopsies, normal baseline impedance > 2292 ohms, normal PSPW index > 0.61, negative reflux-symptom association, < 4 reflux episodes, normal esophagogastric junction, and normal esophageal body motor profile on high-resolution manometry, indicates the possibility of functional heartburn, and functional heartburn coexists with GERD in patients with proven GERD otherwise fulfilling criteria for functional heartburn.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116NJZMo]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in asthma — GERD can cause heartburn, epigastric or chest pain, and is a common cause of dry cough; symptoms and/or diagnosis of GERD are more common in people with asthma than in the general population, but asymptomatic gastroesophageal reflux is not a likely cause of poorly controlled asthma. In patients with confirmed asthma, GERD should be considered as a possible cause of a dry cough; however, there is no value in screening patients with uncontrolled asthma for GERD (Evidence A). For patients with asthma and symptoms suggestive of reflux, an empirical trial of anti-reflux medication, such as a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or motility agent, may be considered, and if symptoms do not resolve, specific investigations such as 24-hour pH monitoring or endoscopy may be considered. Trials of PPIs in patients with confirmed asthma have shown small benefits for lung function, but no significant benefit for other asthma outcomes; in adults with symptomatic asthma but no GERD symptoms, high-dose PPIs did not reduce asthma symptoms or exacerbations, and benefits appear limited to those with both symptomatic reflux and night-time respiratory symptoms. Symptomatic reflux should be treated, but patients with poorly controlled asthma should not be treated with anti-reflux therapy unless they also have symptomatic reflux (Evidence A), and few data are available for children with asthma symptoms and symptoms of GERD.

### Latin American consensus on diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^115A9Svq]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Diagnosing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can be challenging given varying symptom presentations, and complex multifactorial pathophysiology. The gold standard for GERD diagnosis is esophageal acid exposure time (AET) measured by pH-metry. A variety of additional diagnostic tools are available. The goal of this consensus was to assess the individual merits of GERD diagnostic tools based on current evidence, and provide consensus recommendations following discussion and voting by experts.

Methods

This consensus was developed by 15 experts from nine countries, based on a systematic search of the literature, using GRADE (grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluation) methodology to assess the quality and strength of the evidence, and provide recommendations regarding the diagnostic utility of different GERD diagnosis tools, using AET as the reference standard.

Key Results

A proton pump inhibitor (PPI) trial is appropriate for patients with heartburn and no alarm symptoms, but nor for patients with regurgitation, chest pain, or extraesophageal presentations. Severe erosive esophagitis and abnormal reflux monitoring off PPI are clearly indicative of GERD. Esophagram, esophageal biopsies, laryngoscopy, and pharyngeal pH monitoring are not recommended to diagnose GERD. Patients with PPI-refractory symptoms and normal endoscopy require reflux monitoring by pH or pH-impedance to confirm or exclude GERD, and identify treatment failure mechanisms. GERD confounders need to be considered in some patients, pH-impedance can identify supragrastric belching, impedance-manometry can diagnose rumination.

Conclusions

Erosive esophagitis on endoscopy and abnormal pH or pH-impedance monitoring are the most appropriate methods to establish a diagnosis of GERD. Other tools may add useful complementary information.

### GERD evaluation: time for a new paradigm? [^1157VSjY]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

In the past there has been reliance on heartburn and acid regurgitation as the cardinal symptoms of gastro-esophageal reflux. Now it is recognized that diverse additional symptoms including extraesophageal manifestations are essential components of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Furthermore, previous reliance in mucosal damage at endoscopy as evidence of therapeutic success in the management of GERD has proven of only limited value in the diverse world of GERD symptoms. Indeed is now apparent that the relationship between symptoms and lesions is modest at best. Most patients with GERD have no overt erosions or ulceration at endoscopy and they frequently suffer from a wide array of complaints other than heartburn that contribute to their diminished perception of life's quality. To address these problems, multidimensional questionnaires designed to encompass the diverse symptomatology of GERD have been investigated, principally, to provide a reproducible metric of change in the subjective response to pharmacologic therapy during trials for patients with nonerosive reflux disease. The most promising of these instruments is The ReQuest questionnaire, because it has been extensively validated in multiple patient groups and cultures, appears highly promising in this regard and for erosive disease too and may ultimately prove to be of value for the initial evaluation of patients with GERD. We propose that accurate symptom delineation complemented with endoscopy performed in selected groups of patients will become the mainstay in diagnosis of GERD and the assessment of therapy efficacy.

Introduction

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic disorder characterised by the regurgitation of stomach contents into the oesophagus. GERD is predicted to impact 13.98% of the adult population worldwide. Patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) typically present with regurgitation and heartburn following a meal; they also describe a burning sensation in the retrosternal area that may radiate to the neck or the back; heartburn may worsen when lying supine or bending over; and other, less common symptoms of GERD include dysphagia, chest pain, water brash, pain during swallowing, burping, hiccups, nausea, and vomiting.

In the absence of alarm symptoms, the diagnosis of GERD is primarily made based on symptoms. Patients with symptoms of GERD, such as heartburn and regurgitation, can be diagnosed and treated empirically with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).

The GerdQ questionnaire is a helpful tool, with a sensitivity of 65% and specificity of 71%, for guiding the diagnosis based on symptoms. If symptoms persist despite PPI treatment or patients presented with extraoesophageal symptoms, further diagnostic investigations may be necessary. Endoscopy, pH monitoring, and esophageal manometry are reserved for such cases.

Causes of GERD include anatomical factors like hiatal hernia and functional factors such as poor lower oesophageal sphincter (LES) resting tone and acid clearance, as well as transient LES relaxation. Obesity, dietary factors like coffee, spicy food, and carbonated beverages, smoking, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, alcohol intake, and psychological stress are all modifiable risk factors for the development of GERD.

The symptoms of GERD have been shown to be exacerbated by exposure to psychosocial stressors. An increase in heartburn symptoms was found in a study of people who already suffer from heartburn when they were exposed to stress. Although their actual acid levels are within the usual range, anxious people have a more exaggerated perception of acid events. It is theorised that stress makes patients more sensitive to acid reflux, which may explain why it seems to exacerbate symptoms. The consequences of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can be extremely serious, including diminished quality of life and an increased risk of contracting other diseases.

Another aspect of our results with potential relevance to clinical practice is the observation that two-thirds of participants reported different predominant symptoms on different occasions. To our knowledge, the magnitude of this variability has not been demonstrated previously. Some years ago, it was reported that a diagnosis of reflux disease was likely to be correct if heartburn or regurgitation was a clearly predominant symptom. Subsequent consensus statements pointed out that although predominant heartburn was thought to permit a diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in 75–80% of patients, this belief was based on clinical opinion rather than further evidence. More recently, guidelines have simply advised that 'typical symptoms of heartburn and regurgitation' justify a presumptive gastro-oesophageal reflux disease diagnosis. Our findings show that in many participants both the predominant symptom and the pattern of concurrent symptoms vary from one symptom episode to the next. Only one-third of individuals had one symptom that was consistently predominant.

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease-related and functional heartburn: pathophysiology and treatment [^113pnQnM]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Patients who continue to experience heartburn symptoms despite adequate-dose proton pump inhibitor therapy have unmet clinical needs. In this review, we focus on the most recent findings related to the mechanism of heartburn symptom generation, and on the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease-related and functional heartburn.

Recent Findings

The immunological mechanism in the esophageal mucosa has been addressed as a potential mechanism of the onset of esophageal mucosa damage and the generation of heartburn symptoms. Peripheral or central hypersensitivity in viscera is a potentially unifying pathophysiological concept in functional heartburn. Vonoprazan, a novel and potent first-in-class potassium-competitive acid blocker, is expected to prove useful in the treatment of reflux disease.

Summary

New findings in the mechanisms of heartburn symptom generation are emerging, including the immunological mediation of esophageal mucosal damage and the development of visceral hypersensitivity in functional heartburn. In the future, we anticipate the emergence of new and specific therapeutic options based on these mechanisms, with less dependence on acid-suppressing agents.

Fig. 1
Suspected gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)-related symptoms, their relative likelihood of response to acid-suppressive therapy based on the literature, and the presumed importance of acid reflux for symptom generation based on these findings. Smaller arrows underneath each symptom indicate the direction of the shift in response to acid suppression when patients are selected based on the presence (RE+) or absence (RE−) of reflux esophagitis, or the presence (pH+) or absence (pH−) of pathologic esophageal acid exposure. The relative position of each symptom and the size of the arrows is not to scale. In summary, heartburn is assumed to be the quintessential acid-related symptom and as such correlates the most frequently with pathologic esophageal acid exposure and response to acid-suppressive therapy. The response of heartburn (and regurgitation) to acid suppression is higher in RE+ patients than in RE− patients, concordant with RE being a good proxy for pathologic esophageal acid exposure in lieu of pH-testing. The relative response of symptoms to acid suppression decreases as their dependence on pathologic esophageal acid exposure decreases. However, even for symptoms such as chest pain and cough, response rates to acid suppression can be enhanced by identifying patients who have pathologic esophageal acid exposure (pH+), albeit with a dwindling effect as symptom etiology becomes increasingly multifactorial

Given the above, it is not surprising that the proportion of reflux-related symptoms associated with non-acid reflux jumps drastically to around 80% in patients who experience symptoms despite taking a PPI. A similarly dramatic increase in symptoms not related to any type of reflux is also observed, as shown in the seminal paper by Mainie et al. in which less than half of symptoms in 200 patients taking a PPI twice daily were related to reflux (8% acid and 35% non-acid). It should be noted that these figures incorporate both typical and atypical symptoms of GERD. Nevertheless, the proportion of patients who had a positive SAP for acid or non-acid reflux was low for the typical GERD symptoms of unexplained chest pain (18%), heartburn (30%), and regurgitation (52%).

### A systematic review with meta-analysis of gastroesophageal reflux disease and exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113PBs59]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a prevalent pulmonary disorder characterized by persistent airway inflammation and reversible airflow restriction, with at least 170 million people world-wide estimated to be affected in population studies. COPD is estimated to rank the third most common leading cause of death worldwide by 2020. The substantial mortality is associated with severe acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) with worsening airway function and respiratory symptoms and requiring emergency department attendance or hospitalization. Thus, the average two episodes of acute exacerbation annually suffered by patients with COPD were undoubtedly responsible for increasing mortality and the high burden of public health care.

GERD is one of the most common gastrointestinal ailments worldwide, defined as the abnormal reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus, leading to esophageal mucosal injury or reflux symptoms, featured with two most common symptoms heartburn and regurgitation. In recent years, a number of studies suggested the impression of higher prevalence of GERD in patients with COPD. In a descriptive, cross-sectional study, the data showed a higher proportion of GERD symptoms are present in COPD patients and it also showed that GERD is more common in severe COPD patients. GERD is related to coughing, reduced lung function, higher bronchial reactivity. In return, frequent coughing and use of β₂-agonists are thought to exacerbate reflux. Thus, a vicious circle is between GERD and symptoms and function of patients with COPD formed. Recently, GERD is suggested as a putative risk factor of exacerbation of patients with COPD, as evidenced by the results that the GERD is associated with a significantly higher exacerbation rate and increased risk of admission to an ICU and mechanical ventilation use among COPD patients. Hence, we aimed to conduct a meta­analysis of available studies comparing the risk of exacerbation of COPD in individuals with and without GERD.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) refractory symptoms — definitions and patient groups: persistent symptoms were reported in 32% of patients in randomized trials and 45% in observational studies. The most commonly accepted definition of refractory GERD is persistent heartburn and/or regurgitation despite 8 weeks of double-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, whereas other authorities consider persistent symptoms after 12 weeks on double-dose PPIs to be refractory GERD. There are 2 broad groups with symptoms despite PPI therapy — those empirically treated with a PPI yet still symptomatic and those with objective evidence of GERD who have incomplete or no response to PPIs — and the evaluation of refractory GERD should begin with a careful history and physical examination.

### Analysis of the symptom response to esomeprazole 20 mg over days 1–4 of a 14-day course of treatment for frequent heartburn: results of two randomised controlled trials [^111GS526]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

The primary data from the individual studies that were analysed here reported a significantly greater likelihood of experiencing heartburn-free days on days 1–4 with esomeprazole 20 mg compared with placebo (study 1: OR 1.81; 95% CI 1.19 to 2.74; p = 0.0053; study 2: OR 2.54; 95% CI 1.66 to 3.88; p < 0.0001). By day 14, the proportion of esomeprazole-treated subjects who were symptom free had increased to 46% and 48% in study 1 and study 2, respectively, for esomeprazole 20 mg, which was significantly higher than placebo (33% for both studies; p < 0.0001). In clinical trials conducted with omeprazole 20 mg and lansoprazole 15 mg, the percentage of heartburn-free days was significantly higher beginning on day 1 versus placebo (p ≤ 0.001), with this benefit extending as treatment continued to day 14. In agreement with these studies, the current analyses demonstrate that subjects experiencing frequent heartburn who were treated with esomeprazole 20 mg once daily had significantly more days free of heartburn and had lower mean heartburn intensity scores relative to placebo during the first 4 days of treatment. However, the maximal clinical effects seen with esomeprazole 20 mg occurred in the day 5–14 period, with the change from baseline percentage of heartburn-free days increasing from 24.9% on days 1–4 to 32.5% on days 5–14. Similar but less pronounced effects were observed in the change in mean heartburn intensity scores in subjects with more frequent pretreatment heartburn episodes. This increase in heartburn control coincides with the timing of maximal pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects seen with esomeprazole 20 mg in prior studies. In pharmacokinetic studies, esomeprazole Cₘₐₓ and AUC nearly doubled between day 1 and day 5. Andersson et al further demonstrated that the observed increases in esomeprazole and omeprazole exposure over the first 5 days of treatment correlated with increased inhibition of pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion. A post hoc analysis conducted with data from the same studies as the current analyses explored the effects of the degree and timing of treatment response to esomeprazole 20 mg on continued symptomatic response following the end of the 2-week treatment course. The results suggest that a higher level of pretreatment heartburn severity is associated with a lesser likelihood of sustained symptomatic resolution during the week after treatment cessation. Conversely, experiencing symptomatic resolution during the treatment period, particularly during the last week of treatment, increases the likelihood of experiencing sustained resolution after the end of 2 weeks of treatment with esomeprazole 20 mg. The relationship, if any, between these effects and the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of esomeprazole is unclear at this point but should be an area for future research.

### Analysis of the symptom response to esomeprazole 20 mg over days 1–4 of a 14-day course of treatment for frequent heartburn: results of two randomised controlled trials [^117QJmiG]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Although the current analyses were retrospective in nature and not specifically designed to investigate the time of maximal clinical effect of esomeprazole 20 mg, all of the data used were prospectively collected. Importantly, the primary endpoint of these studies was the percentage of heartburn-free 24-hour days during the 14-day treatment period. Furthermore, key secondary endpoints included the resolution of heartburn during the first and second weeks of treatment and the proportion of subjects with 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 heartburn-free days during days 1–4. The results reported here, therefore, are closely based on the prospective primary and secondary endpoints of the two studies.

These analyses demonstrated that individuals with both less frequent heartburn (fewer than 6 days of heartburn) and more frequent heartburn (6 or more days of heartburn) during the run-in period had significant improvements in the percentage of heartburn-free days during all stages of the on-treatment period. This suggests that individuals who are likely to self-treat their frequent heartburn with OTC esomeprazole can expect improvement in symptoms independent of the frequency of heartburn they are experiencing. Those with more severe heartburn derived greater clinical benefit from esomeprazole. Individuals with more frequent heartburn experienced a 35.3% increase from baseline in the proportion of heartburn-free days during days 5–14, compared with a 27.9% increase for those with less frequent heartburn. It is likely that this difference is due to the greater potential for improvement in the group with more frequent heartburn. Notably, however, some of the subjects in the more frequent heartburn category may not have been appropriate candidates for receiving OTC PPI and may have had a more severe condition than frequent heartburn. A similar result has been observed with obese patients. In that study, it was suggested that patients with higher body mass indexes (BMI) may derive greater therapeutic benefit from PPI than leaner patients due to a correlation between higher BMI and greater baseline symptom severity and frequency. However, it is also possible that some of those with less frequent heartburn in the current analyses were misdiagnosed since subjects did not undergo endoscopy at screening or 24-hour pH monitoring. Bytzer et al suggested that the lower response in patients with non-erosive reflux disease compared with those with reflux oesophagitis may have been due to the presence of functional heartburn not associated with reflux, which is not expected to respond to PPI.

### Revisiting Montreal: new insights into symptoms and their causes, and implications for the future of GERD [^112yF5dS]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

The relationship between sub-types of GERD and non-GERD conditions, reflux acidity, esophageal hypersensitivity (discussed later), and response to PPIs is shown in Fig. 2. Reflux is more often acidic in patients with reflux esophagitis than in those without, consistent with the strong causal link between reflux esophagitis and esophageal acid exposure. Reflux esophagitis is also, as one might expect, the most responsive of all GERD manifestations to acid suppression with PPIs, with healing rates of over 80% (and possibly higher with prolonged treatment). Selecting patients with reflux esophagitis strongly selects for those with pathologic esophageal acid exposure. As such, the symptoms experienced by patients with reflux esophagitis are more often related to acid and thus more responsive to PPIs than symptoms in patients without reflux esophagitis. In addition, lower esophageal sensitivity to acid in patients with reflux esophagitis (particularly high grade) than in those with NERD may lower the degree of acid suppression required to alleviate heartburn, also contributing to better PPI response. However, when patients without reflux esophagitis who have pathologic esophageal acid exposure are selected, the estimated complete symptom response rate with PPIs is comparable to that for reflux esophagitis.

Fig. 2
Relationship between reflux acidity, response of heartburn to acid-suppressive therapy and the role of peripheral and/or central esophageal hypersensitivity in different gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and non-GERD patients with heartburn. Reflux esophagitis (RE) correlates strongly with the presence of pathologic esophageal acid exposure and, concomitantly, healing of RE and heartburn resolution are high with acid-suppressive therapy in these patients. Some patients have heartburn but not RE. Those who have pathologic esophageal acid exposure (pH+) have NERD, and heartburn symptoms respond as well to acid suppression as they do in patients with RE. Those patients with heartburn who do not have pathologic esophageal acid exposure may still have a positive symptom association probability (SAP+) for acid or non-acid reflux, and are thus categorized as having reflux hypersensitivity (acid hypersensitive esophagus (AHE) or non-acid hypersensitive esophagus (NAHE)). Patients without pathologic acid exposure who have a negative SAP are designated as having functional heartburn (FH). The role of peripheral and/or central esophageal hypersensitivity increases as dependence on acid reflux (and response to acid suppression) decreases, in line with heartburn perception occurring despite non-pathologic acid reflux (hyperalgesia) in patients with reflux hypersensitivity, or under physiological reflux conditions (allodynia) in patients with FH

4 Discussion

This multicenter study is in continuation with our previous POC study that showed a favorable effect of TESS in reducing esophageal acid exposure in patients who have failed standard dose PPI. In the present study we measured acid exposure but in addition, evaluated the effects of TESS on symptoms, which was not evaluated in the POC study. Study results showed significant improvement in both acid exposure and symptoms, indicating a positive reaction to treatment with regard to both primary and secondary endpoints. To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the effect of a noninvasive, safe and easy‐to‐use device on AET and GERD‐related symptoms.

These promising results deserve explanation regarding the mechanism of action of this novel device. As mentioned, we hypothesized that mechanism of action of TESS may involve several routs. Firstly, TESS may strength esophageal secondary peristalsis that can clear gastroesophageal refluxate. Secondly, TESS may accelerate the rate of gastric empting and by that reduces acid reflux. Thirdly, it may strength LES tone, decreasing the occurrence of transient LES relaxation (TLESR) and may strength the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ), creating a stronger barrier between the stomach and the esophagus. Physiologically, the high pressure zone at the GEJ is determined by both LES and the diaphragmatic crura. An association between rapid increase in abdominal pressure and increased GEJ pressure was studied by Mittal et al. more than three decades ago. In a recent study, Shafik A et al. evaluated the effect of straining on the diaphragmatic crura (DC), identifying a straining‐crural reflex. In that study, straining and coughing via laryngeal and tracheal stimulation provoked increased electromyographic (EMG) activity of the DC and the LES. Furthermore, on sustained straining, an increased EMG activity was coupled with significant increase in GEJ pressure (four times as compared to baseline). Thus, the so‐called "straining‐crural reflex" may support our hypothesis that TESS induces repeated contractions of the rectus abdominis and external oblique muscle, and by that increase GEJ pressure. It is yet to be proven in our patients whether that "straining‐crural reflex" actually increases EMG activity and pressure at the GEJ and by that reduces AET and related symptoms. Although the present study focused only on TESS effectiveness and safety we do intend to perform a physiological evaluation in the near future. Esophageal high‐resolution manometry (HRM) and pH monitoring before and under TESS treatment is just an example.

### Discrepancies between upper GI symptoms described by those who have them and their identification by conventional medical terminology: a survey of sufferers in four countries [^115c66k1]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Uncertainty about translating a patient's description of symptoms into established medical terminology is familiar to many physicians, who acknowledge that conventional terminology may not capture some aspects of symptom perception that patients describe. Nevertheless, we are not aware of any previous attempt at systematic creation of an upper GI symptom questionnaire from sufferers' own vocabulary without reference to conventional medical concepts or terminology. Our survey results describe the occurrence and patterns of upper GI symptoms in 10 659 symptom episodes.

Matching the lay vocabulary of our questionnaire with medical terminology revealed substantial disconnect. Whereas 'bitter or acidic taste in the back of the throat or mouth' may be interpreted as 'regurgitation', not least because it was prominent on wakening in the morning, equating 'burning sensation or burning pain in the chest' with heartburn implies that heartburn occurred only about two-thirds as often as regurgitation in this population. Burning chest pain or discomfort is widely taken to be a description of heartburn, although Carlsson et al. advocated a definition in which the moving quality of the feeling was recognized (a burning feeling rising from the stomach or lower chest up towards the neck) and asserted that this served to identify heartburn responsive to acid suppressing medication. If 'burning sensation or burning pain in the chest' and 'sharp rising pain in the food pipe' are considered to be alternative descriptions of heartburn, combining the two implies that heartburn occurred more frequently than regurgitation among our respondents. However, the fact that 58% of individuals who reported having the two symptoms concurrently on some occasions also reported having one without the other on other occasions implies they are not simply alternative descriptions of the same sensation. Consequently, use of the term 'heartburn' to denote both does not accurately represent the symptoms being recognized by sufferers.

As shown in figure 2B, C, subjects with more frequent heartburn experienced a greater degree of therapeutic benefit with esomeprazole 20 mg than those with less frequent heartburn. There was little change in the mean percentage of heartburn-free days among subjects receiving placebo during the different time intervals, regardless of the frequency of heartburn experienced during the run-in period. However, there was a greater improvement in mean change from baseline on days 1–4 and days 5–14 in the percentage of heartburn-free days among those with more frequent heartburn during the run-in period relative to those with less frequent heartburn. The mean number of heartburn-free days/week among more frequent heartburn sufferers treated with esomeprazole 20 mg increased an estimated 2.5 days from the run-in period to the day 5–14 interval, when the change in least squares mean percentage of heartburn-free days is converted to the number of heartburn-free days and standardised to a 7-day period. Among less frequent sufferers treated with esomeprazole 20 mg the number of heartburn-free days/week increased an estimated 2.0 days from the run-in to days 5–14 when the change in least squares mean percentage of heartburn-free days is standardised to a 7-day period. In both the less and more frequent heartburn groups, smaller changes from baseline intensity scores were observed during days 1–4 in relation to days 5–14.

### American Gastroenterological Association medical position statement on the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^113DTLpy]. Gastroenterology (2008). Medium credibility.

American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) medical position statement — operational definition and classification of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): There can be no criterion standard definition of GERD because the threshold distinction between physiologic reflux and reflux disease is ultimately arbitrary, and hence these questions can only be answered by opinion (USPSTF grade not applicable). The Montreal definition was adopted in the technical review as a suitable framework; it defined GERD as "a condition which develops when the reflux of stomach contents causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications", with symptoms considered "troublesome" if they adversely affect an individual's well-being. Esophageal GERD syndromes are categorized as those that are symptom based and those that are defined by tissue injury, while extraesophageal syndromes are classified as established or proposed association with GERD, acknowledging that in some circumstances we cannot establish causation. A distinguishing feature of the Montreal definition is that it does not use the term "nonerosive reflux disease" but rather subdivides esophageal syndromes into symptomatic syndromes and syndromes with esophageal injury; hence, functional heartburn does not fit the Montreal definition of GERD, whereas it is included under the umbrella of nonerosive reflux disease. The distinction between GERD and episodic heartburn in the Montreal definition is in the word "troublesome", and in the absence of esophageal injury, heartburn symptoms of insufficient frequency or severity to be perceived as troublesome by the patient (after assurance of their benign nature) do not meet the Montreal definition of a symptomatic esophageal GERD syndrome.

The greatest therapeutic benefit was observed from day 5 to day 14 of the treatment period (table 2, figure 2A). During this time, subjects treated with esomeprazole 20 mg increased their heartburn-free time over the run-in period by 32.5% compared with 14.3% with placebo (p < 0.001). When the percentage of heartburn-free time for this time period is standardised to a 7-day period, there is an estimated heartburn-free frequency rate of 3.6 days/week vs 2.3 days/week for the esomeprazole 20 mg group versus the placebo group, respectively, compared with an estimated 1.4 days/week for the run-in period. When the percentage of heartburn-free time for the initial 4 days of treatment was standardised to a 7-day period, the estimated frequency of heartburn-free days was 3.0 days/week and 2.0 days/week for esomeprazole 20 mg and placebo, respectively. A similar pattern of results was observed in the subgroup analysis of subjects with more and less frequent heartburn during the run-in period. Significant increases in the percentage of heartburn-free days for all time intervals were observed in both groups.

### Managing a patient with burning mouth syndrome [^112AofHa]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

A 64-year-old woman presented with an increasing frequency of symptoms of heartburn and retrosternal pain over the last few months, and a constant and intense burning pain affecting her tongue tip, mouth and lips for the past 5years. She found consuming hot drinks exacerbated the burning oral pain and chewing gum seemed to alleviate some of her symptoms. She thought these oral sensations were caused by frequently licking her finger tips to separate prints in her work in publishing. She had been previously diagnosed with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), and her heartburn symptoms had been controlled until recently with lansoprazole 15mg daily. Her past medical history included irritable bowel syndrome and depression, for which she had been treated with mebeverine and paroxetine for a number of years. She was a non-smoker and did not consume alcohol. Clinical examination was unremarkable with no oral lesions on examination. Her routine laboratory tests, including autoimmune serology, haematinics and thyroid function tests were all within normal limits. She underwent a gastroscopy, which revealed moderate reflux oesophagitis, and following commencing omeprazole 20mg twice daily, her heartburn resolved. However, her oral burning symptoms were not affected and a diagnosis of burning mouth syndrome (BMS) was made. Following explanation and reassurance concerning the cause of her BMS symptoms, she chose not to receive treatment for this but to access cognitive behavioural therapy in the future if her symptoms worsened.

### Revisiting Montreal: new insights into symptoms and their causes, and implications for the future of GERD [^113pac9w]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The primary goal of this review was to revisit the concept of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The previously variable definition of GERD was finally standardized in 2006 with the Montreal Consensus, which states that GERD is "a condition that develops when the reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications". The Montreal Definition of GERD encapsulates most eventualities, from patients with reflux esophagitis with or without symptoms (the latter actually accounting for close to 40% of such patients in Western populations, and possibly a much higher proportion in Asian populations) to those with symptoms but no other findings. The latter, purely symptom-based definition of GERD provided a rationale for treatment with acid-suppressive medications without the need for cumbersome investigations of symptom etiology, thus enhancing management of the substantial symptom burden in these patients. The Montreal Definition also acknowledges that reflux contents other than acid can cause symptoms. However, the degree of the complexity of the relationship between symptoms and reflux was perhaps not fully appreciated at the time of its development. The situation has been further complicated by the subsequent, comprehensive categorization of a range of functional esophageal disorders that are indistinguishable from GERD without substantial investigation. As part of our revisiting the concept of GERD, we recap our current understanding of the relationship between suspected GERD symptoms and reflux (or lack thereof), with a focus on the persisting clinical challenge and possible mechanisms of reflux hypersensitivity and functional heartburn. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for our current assumptions about suspected GERD symptoms, including whether treating GERD as a composite disease entity may now be a barrier to more precise patient management.

### Vonoprazan fumarate (Voquezna) [^112LN8zt]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

14.3	Relief of Heartburn Associated with Non-Erosive Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease

The effectiveness and safety of VOQUEZNA was evaluated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, four-week efficacy trial with a 20-week safety extension conducted in the United States in 772 adult patients with a diagnosis of symptomatic non-erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease (NCT05195528). Patients who identified heartburn as their primary symptom, had a history of heartburn for six months or longer, had heartburn on at least four of seven days immediately prior to randomization, were negative for H. pylori infection, and had no esophageal erosions as confirmed by endoscopy were enrolled. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to one of the following treatment groups in the 4-week placebo-controlled phase: VOQUEZNA 10 mg once daily, a higher dosage of VOQUEZNA, or placebo once daily. The higher VOQUEZNA dose group did not demonstrate additional treatment benefit compared to VOQUEZNA 10 mg once daily through Week 4. Patients in the trial had a mean age of 51 years (range 18 to 83 years), 68% were female, 32% identified as Hispanic or Latino, 75% identified as White, 16% as Black or African American, 6% as Asian, and 3% identified as another racial group.

The primary endpoint was the percentage of 24-hour heartburn-free days, as assessed by daily diary over 4 weeks, as shown in Table 17.

The difference in the percentage of patients who were heartburn-free during the 24-hour period on Day 2 of treatment was similar to the difference in 24-hour heartburn-free days through Week 4 in patients treated with VOQUEZNA 10 mg once daily compared to patients treated with placebo.

### Inflammation reduction pack [^114uEKJ7]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

The US trial indicated that ranitidine 150 mg twice daily significantly reduced the frequency of heartburn attacks and severity of heartburn pain within 1 to 2 weeks after starting therapy. The improvement was maintained throughout the 6-week trial period. Moreover, patient response rates demonstrated that the effect on heartburn extends through both the day and night time periods.

In 2 additional US multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-week trials, ranitidine 150 mg twice daily was shown to provide relief of heartburn pain within 24 hours of initiating therapy and a reduction in the frequency of severity of heartburn.

Erosive Esophagitis:

In 2 multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 12-week trials performed in the United States, ranitidine 150 mg 4 times daily was significantly more effective than placebo in healing endoscopically diagnosed erosive esophagitis and in relieving associated heartburn. The erosive esophagitis healing rates were as follows:

No additional benefit in healing of esophagitis or in relief of heartburn was seen with a ranitidine dose of 300 mg 4 times daily.

Maintenance of Healing of Erosive Esophagitis:

In 2 multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 48-week trials conducted in patients whose erosive esophagitis had been previously healed, ranitidine 150 mg twice daily was significantly more effective than placebo in maintaining healing of erosive esophagitis.

14.3 Symptomatic GERD in Adults

Two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were conducted in a total of 717 adult patients comparing four weeks of treatment with NEXIUM delayed-release capsules 20 mg or 40 mg once daily versus placebo for resolution of GERD symptoms. Patients had at least a 6-month history of heartburn episodes, no EE by endoscopy, and heartburn on at least four of the seven days immediately preceding randomization.

The percentage of patients that were symptom-free of heartburn was significantly higher in the NEXIUM groups compared to placebo at all follow-up visits (Weeks 1, 2, and 4).

No additional clinical benefit was seen with NEXIUM 40 mg over NEXIUM 20 mg. NEXIUM 40 mg once daily is not a recommended regimen for the treatment of symptomatic GERD in adults.

The percent of patients symptom-free of heartburn by day are shown in the Figures 4 and 5:

### Does my patient still have reflux when ppi therapy does not work? [^114st9zL]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2017). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common condition around the world. The management of this disease is less than satisfying given complexity of patient presentation and suboptimal diagnostic testing when employed for those poorly responsive to acid suppressive therapy. In this mini review, we discuss some new strategies employed for patients with suspected GERD to better understand disease pathophysiology. We compare the strategies and outline a clinically relevant approach in this difficult group of patients.

### Management of heartburn in a large, randomized, community-based study: comparison of four therapeutic strategies [^112C3AAV]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Our objective was to compare four management strategies for heartburn: therapy with an H2-receptor antagonist (ranitidine), therapy with a proton pump inhibitor (lansoprazole), crossover from ranitidine to lansoprazole ("step-up" therapy), and crossover from lansoprazole to ranitidine ("step-down" therapy).

Methods

This was a controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial comprising 593 adults with heartburn, randomized to one of four groups for 20 wk. Subjects received either ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d. for 20 wk, or lansoprazole 30 mg once daily for 20 wk, or ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d. for 8 wk followed by lansoprazole 30 mg once daily for 12 wk ("step-up"), or lansoprazole 30 mg once daily for 8 wk followed by ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d. for 12 wk ("step-down"). Outcome measures were based on self-reports in daily diaries of 24-h heartburn severity, measured by maximum daytime and nighttime severity, and percentage of 24-h heartburn-free days measured by absence of both daytime and nighttime heartburn.

Results

Median heartburn severity was significantly lower (p < 0.05) for lansoprazole (0.25) than the other groups (0.46 ranitidine, 0.44 "step-up", 0.35 "step-down"). The lansoprazole group had a significantly higher percentage of 24-h heartburn-free days (median 81.4%, p < 0.01) than other groups (66.6, 66.9, and 73.6%, respectively). In the "step-up" and "step-down" groups, heartburn was less severe, and percentages of 24-h heartburn-free days were higher during lansoprazole treatment regardless of treatment sequence.

Conclusion

Proton pump inhibitor treatment provides more consistent heartburn relief than an H2-receptor antagonist, or "step-up" or "step-down" therapy.

### The effect of auditory stress on perception of intraesophageal acid in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease [^112LqY5C]. Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Most patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) report that stress exacerbates their symptoms, yet mechanisms underlying this association remain unknown. We sought to determine the effect of an acute laboratory stressor on perceptual and emotional responses to intraesophageal acid perfusion in healthy controls and patients with GERD.

Methods

Forty-six patients with heartburn and 10 healthy controls underwent upper endoscopy and, if negative, pH monitoring. Assessment of psychologic factors and health-related quality of life was done by a questionnaire. Perceptual and emotional responses to intraesophageal acid at baseline, during auditory stress, and during an auditory control condition were determined using a randomized crossover design. Plasma levels of norepinephrine, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and cortisol were assessed.

Results

Twenty-nine subjects were identified as nonerosive reflux disease and 17 as erosive esophagitis. Quality of life, psychologic profile, and personality assessment variables were similar among the 2 patient groups and the controls. There was a significant reduction in mean lag time to initial symptom perception and an increase in mean intensity rating and mean acid perfusion sensitivity score in the 2 patient groups during the stress period, which was not seen during the control condition. Healthy controls demonstrated lack of a significant change in all parameters of stimulus response functions to acid, regardless of condition.

Conclusions

Acute auditory stress can exacerbate heartburn symptoms in GERD patients by enhancing perceptual response to intraesophageal acid exposure. This greater perceptual response is associated with greater emotional responses to the stressor.

### Are lifestyle measures effective in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease? [^113dbnpr]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

Citrus fruits are often cited as precipitants of heartburn symptoms. In a questionnaire of approximately 400 patients with GERD, 72% of respondents reported increased heartburn with ingestion of either orange or grapefruit juice. 66 However, Price et al52 found that acid-sensitive patients were sensitive to intraesophageal infusion of orange juice, even when the orange juice was adjusted to a pH of 7, suggesting that acidity is not the only factor determining the citrus effect on GERD. Despite the fact that intraesophageal infusion of coffee in patients with acid sensitivity has been shown to cause heartburn, 52 2 large epidemiologic studies16, 17 found no association between coffee drinking and GERD. A recent survey10 in Norway described a negative association between coffee drinking and GERD incidence.

Although some studies53, 54 have described increased LESP with regular and decaffeinated coffees, another trial55 showed no effect of coffee on the number of reflux episodes, total reflux time, or LESP in patients with GERD or controls. Although patients frequently cite spicy foods as an inciting agent in heartburn episodes, little data have been published regarding the effects of spicy food consumption on LESP or esophageal pH. Nebel et al3 conducted a survey of patients with GERD symptoms and found that 88% listed spicy foods as a precipitant of heartburn. There were no significant differences in acid sensitivity symptoms with respect to the fat infusion. 70 Two studies71, 72 reported significantly shorter onset to heartburn symptoms or reflux episodes with acid infusion regardless of whether patients were receiving intraduodenal infusions of a lipid solution or isotonic sodium chloride. Fat infusions have not been shown to affect LESP or the rate of transient LES relaxations.
72.

Peppermint and spearmint are plant extracts that are commonly used in foods and flavorings of toothpaste, mouthwash, and candy. Mint is commonly thought to relax the LES, and thus it is commonly recommended that patients with GERD avoid ingesting mint. 115 We found only 1 study examining the effect of mint ingestion on GERD. Bulat et al79 conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial in which the LES tone of healthy volunteers was measured in response to spearmint, and they found no difference in symptoms, sphincter pressure, or reflux episodes with ingestion of spearmint. There were no studies published on the effect of cessation of mint intake on GERD symptoms.
