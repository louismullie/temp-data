D. Telecommunication networks

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option best represents the referent object in contemporary cybersecurity. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "referent object" means in cybersecurity discourse. Then, I should verify which option aligns with authoritative frameworks and threat landscapes. Next, I will examine each choice against those frameworks and consider counterarguments. Finally, I will synthesize and select the best answer, making sure I anchor the reasoning in recognized sources.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't misinterpret the question. In cybersecurity, the "referent object" is the entity that security efforts are ultimately trying to protect; in modern policy and risk frameworks, that object is typically framed as critical infrastructure, specifically critical information infrastructures whose incapacity or destruction would have a debilitating impact on national security, economic security, public health, or safety, which is precisely how Executive Order 13636 and subsequent NIST guidance define critical infrastructure in the cyber context [^63bc36a3].

> Now, I should review the options against that definition. Option A, "digitalized sensitive information", is too narrow because while data confidentiality, integrity, and availability are core security goals, contemporary cybersecurity strategy and regulations prioritize protecting the systems and assets that process, store, and transmit that information, not just the data itself; the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and HHS guidance emphasize securing the infrastructure that enables critical services, not merely the data elements in isolation [^63bc36a3] [^9a725557].

> Option C, "government IT systems", is also too restrictive. Government systems are a subset of the broader critical infrastructure ecosystem, but the referent object in modern cybersecurity spans public and private sector systems that are vital to society, including energy, finance, transportation, healthcare, and communications, so limiting the referent to government IT would understate the scope of what must be protected [^63bc36a3] [^9a725557].

> Option D, "telecommunication networks", is closer but still incomplete. Telecommunications are indeed a critical infrastructure sector, yet they are a component of the larger critical information infrastructure rather than the overarching referent object itself; cybersecurity frameworks treat telecom as a key enabler within the broader critical infrastructure rather than the sole or primary object of protection, so choosing telecom alone would be too specific and would miss cross-sector dependencies [^63bc36a3].

> Option B, "Critical Information Infrastructures", matches the authoritative definition and scope. Hold on, I should verify the exact wording: Executive Order 13636 and subsequent implementation guidance define critical infrastructure as systems and assets, physical or virtual, so vital that their incapacity or destruction would have a debilitating impact, and they explicitly include information technology and communications sectors within that umbrella, which aligns with the concept of critical information infrastructures as the referent object in contemporary cybersecurity [^63bc36a3].

> But wait, what if someone argues that "digitalized sensitive information" is the ultimate asset and therefore the true referent? I need to ensure I address that. While data protection is fundamental, modern cybersecurity strategy and regulations have evolved to prioritize the resilience of the systems and networks that enable essential services, recognizing that protecting infrastructure is the most effective way to secure information at scale; this is reflected in the NIST Framework's focus on protecting critical infrastructure and in HHS sector-specific guidance for healthcare, which operationalizes protection around systems and assets rather than data alone [^63bc36a3] [^9a725557].

> Synthesis and conclusion: Contemporary cybersecurity treats the referent object as Critical Information Infrastructures, encompassing the interconnected IT and communications systems that underpin essential services across sectors, which is why Option B is the best answer here [^63bc36a3].

The referent object in contemporary cybersecurity is **Critical Information Infrastructures (CIIs)** — the systems and assets, physical or virtual, so vital to a nation that their incapacity or destruction would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination thereof [^63bc36a3]. CIIs include energy, finance, healthcare, transportation, and telecommunications networks, and are the **primary focus of modern cybersecurity strategies** because their compromise can cause cascading failures across society [^31c3f16b]. While digitalized sensitive information and government IT systems are important, they are subsets within the broader CII framework, and telecommunication networks are a key component of CIIs rather than the overarching referent object [^63bc36a3].

---

## Definition and scope of critical information infrastructures

CIIs are defined by their **essential nature and potential impact** on national security, economic stability, public health, and safety [^63bc36a3]. They encompass:

- **Energy**: Power grids, oil and gas pipelines, and renewable energy systems.
- **Finance**: Banking systems, stock exchanges, and payment processors.
- **Healthcare**: Hospitals, medical devices, and health information systems [^9a725557].
- **Transportation**: Airports, railways, ports, and traffic control systems.
- **Telecommunications**: Internet infrastructure, mobile networks, and satellite communications [^63bc36a3].

These infrastructures are **interconnected and interdependent**, meaning that a cyberattack on one sector can cascade into others, amplifying the overall impact [^31c3f16b].

---

## Why CIIs are the referent object in contemporary cybersecurity

CIIs are the **primary focus of contemporary cybersecurity** for several reasons:

- **High impact**: Attacks on CIIs can cause significant disruption, economic loss, and threaten public safety [^63bc36a3].
- **Interdependence**: The interconnected nature of CIIs means that a single attack can have widespread consequences [^31c3f16b].
- **National security**: Protecting CIIs is essential for maintaining national security and sovereignty [^63bc36a3].
- **Regulatory emphasis**: Governments and international organizations prioritize CIIs in their cybersecurity policies and frameworks [^63bc36a3].

## Comparison with other options

| **Option** | **Description** | **Relevance to contemporary cybersecurity** |
|-|-|-|
| A. Digitalized sensitive information | Refers to data such as personal, financial, or health information. | Important, but a subset within CIIs. Not the overarching referent object. |
| B. Critical Information Infrastructures | Systems and assets vital to national security, economic stability, and public health. | The primary referent object in contemporary cybersecurity. |
| C. Government IT systems | IT infrastructure used by government agencies. | Important, but a subset within CIIs. Not the overarching referent object. |
| D. Telecommunication networks | Infrastructure for communication and data transmission. | A key component of CIIs, but not the overarching referent object. |

---

## Conclusion

The referent object in contemporary cybersecurity is **Critical Information Infrastructures (CIIs)** [^63bc36a3]. These infrastructures are the primary focus of cybersecurity efforts due to their essential nature, interdependence, and the significant impact their compromise can have on national security, economic stability, and public safety [^31c3f16b]. While digitalized sensitive information, government IT systems, and telecommunication networks are important, they are subsets or components within the broader CII framework [^63bc36a3].

### Cluster synchronization and isolated desynchronization in complex networks with symmetries [^35ecb7b9]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Synchronization is of central importance in power distribution, telecommunication, neuronal and biological networks. Many networks are observed to produce patterns of synchronized clusters, but it has been difficult to predict these clusters or understand the conditions under which they form. Here we present a new framework and develop techniques for the analysis of network dynamics that shows the connection between network symmetries and cluster formation. The connection between symmetries and cluster synchronization is experimentally confirmed in the context of real networks with heterogeneities and noise using an electro-optic network. We experimentally observe and theoretically predict a surprising phenomenon in which some clusters lose synchrony without disturbing the others. Our analysis shows that such behaviour will occur in a wide variety of networks and node dynamics. The results could guide the design of new power grid systems or lead to new understanding of the dynamical behaviour of networks ranging from neural to social.

### Quantum key distribution implemented with D-level time-bin entangled photons [^63ff306f]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

High-dimensional photon states (qudits) are pivotal to enhance the information capacity, noise robustness, and data rates of quantum communications. Time-bin entangled qudits are promising candidates for implementing high-dimensional quantum communications over optical fiber networks with processing rates approaching those of classical telecommunications. However, their use is hindered by phase instability, timing inaccuracy, and low scalability of interferometric schemes needed for time-bin processing. As well, increasing the number of time bins per photon state typically requires decreasing the repetition rate of the system, affecting in turn the effective qudit rates. Here, we demonstrate a fiber-pigtailed, integrated photonic platform enabling the generation and processing of picosecond-spaced time-bin entangled qudits in the telecommunication C band via an on-chip interferometry system. We experimentally demonstrate the Bennett-Brassard-Mermin 1992 quantum key distribution protocol with time-bin entangled qudits and extend it over a 60km-long optical fiber link, by showing dimensionality scaling without sacrificing the repetition rate. Our approach enables the manipulation of time-bin entangled qudits at processing speeds typical of standard telecommunications (10s of GHz) with high quantum information capacity per single frequency channel, representing an important step towards an efficient implementation of high-data rate quantum communications in standard, multi-user optical fiber networks.

### Triadic embeddedness structure in family networks predicts mobile communication response to a sudden natural disaster [^4e58630a]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Here, we use telecommunications data to investigate families' social network activation and interactions, following the exogenous shock of a natural disaster, the 2013 Ya'an earthquake in China (M s 7.0), both in terms of intra-family and extra-family social dynamics. We utilize the telecommunications data at this time to reveal what networks structures exhibit more active social behavior, and also how well family networks are integrated with the wider society. We show that family communications dynamics in response to the earthquake, to a significant degree, depended on the structure of the family network's embeddedness, i.e. "embeddedness structure", an alternative conceptualization of embeddedness that we introduce and test.

"Structural embeddedness", the notion that people's relationships are embedded within wider structures of social relations, is a classic theoretical construct in social science that underpins cooperation, trust, altruism, and relationship closeness –. Greater structural embeddedness can encourage dyadic trade, promote stable collaboration, facilitate favor exchanges, and determine social influence. Structural embeddedness tends to be more stable than other properties of relationships, since it enmeshes multiple actors and is less under the control of a pair of individuals. For instance, in a seminal study of 20 families in London, Bottemphasized that the quality of relationships between spouses depended on their joint relationships with relatives, friends, and neighbors. The fundamental idea behind previous empirical findings is that the strength of dyadic relationships between two people also depends on others; in particular, shared mutual social ties. Previous research has typically conceptualized and operationalized structural embeddedness from a dyadic perspective using measures, such as "overlap parameter", the number of common friends shared by two people, or by considering contextually defined social factors, such as group affiliation or homophily.

### American Academy of Neurology telehealth position statement [^c33678aa]. Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Definition of telehealth — telehealth, also known as virtual care, uses digital information and telecommunication technologies to provide health care when participants are separated by distance or time. Participants include physicians, other qualified health care professionals, and additional members of the health care team connected virtually with patients, family members, and other care providers. Telehealth facilitates the exchange and interpretation of text, data, images, audio, or video, with synchronous or asynchronous communication. Examples include real-time 2-way interactive audio-video conferencing, mobile health applications, store-and-forward evaluation and management services, virtual check-ins, interclinician interprofessional consultations, telephone services, and remote patient monitoring. The choice of telehealth modality for a specific virtual encounter is determined by the needs of the patient, their ability to access and use the necessary technology, the legal and regulatory landscape, and the available supporting evidence.

### Inferring personal economic status from social network location [^d084ac1f]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

It is commonly believed that patterns of social ties affect individuals' economic status. Here we translate this concept into an operational definition at the network level, which allows us to infer the economic well-being of individuals through a measure of their location and influence in the social network. We analyse two large-scale sources: telecommunications and financial data of a whole country's population. Our results show that an individual's location, measured as the optimal collective influence to the structural integrity of the social network, is highly correlated with personal economic status. The observed social network patterns of influence mimic the patterns of economic inequality. For pragmatic use and validation, we carry out a marketing campaign that shows a threefold increase in response rate by targeting individuals identified by our social network metrics as compared to random targeting. Our strategy can also be useful in maximizing the effects of large-scale economic stimulus policies.

### Assessing the impact of the global subsea telecommunications network on sedimentary organic carbon stocks [^2cbb7ffc]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The sequestration of organic carbon in seafloor sediments plays a key role in regulating global climate; however, human activities can disturb previously-sequestered carbon stocks, potentially reducing the capacity of the ocean to store CO 2. Recent studies revealed profound seafloor impacts and sedimentary carbon loss due to fishing and shipping, yet most other human activities in the ocean have been overlooked. Here, we present an assessment of organic carbon disturbance related to the globally-extensive subsea telecommunications cable network. Up to 2.82–11.26 Mt of organic carbon worldwide has been disturbed as a result of cable burial, in water depths of up to 2000m. While orders of magnitude lower than that disturbed by bottom fishing, it is a non-trivial amount that is absent from global budgets. Future offshore developments that disturb the seafloor should consider the safeguarding of carbon stocks, across the full spectrum of Blue Economy industries.

### Teledermatology: from historical perspective to emerging techniques of the modern era: part II: emerging technologies in teledermatology, limitations and future directions [^0fe88d25]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Telemedicine is the use of telecommunications technology to support health care at a distance. Dermatology relies on visual cues that are easily captured by imaging technologies, making it ideally suited for this care model. Advances in telecommunications technology have made it possible to deliver high-quality skin care when patient and provider are separated by both time and space. Most recently, mobile devices that connect users through cellular data networks have enabled teledermatologists to instantly communicate with primary care providers throughout the world. The availability of teledermoscopy provides an additional layer of visual information to enhance the quality of teleconsultations. Teledermatopathology has become increasingly feasible because of advances in digitization of entire microscopic slides and robot-assisted microscopy. Barriers to additional expansion of these services include underdeveloped infrastructure in remote regions, fragmented electronic medical records, and varying degrees of reimbursement. Teleconsultants also confront special legal and ethical challenges as they work toward building a global network of practicing physicians.

### Experimental measurement-device-independent quantum digital signatures [^4f7aa313]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

The development of quantum networks will be paramount towards practical and secure telecommunications. These networks will need to sign and distribute information between many parties with information-theoretic security, requiring both quantum digital signatures (QDS) and quantum key distribution (QKD). Here, we introduce and experimentally realise a quantum network architecture, where the nodes are fully connected using a minimum amount of physical links. The central node of the network can act either as a totally untrusted relay, connecting the end users via the recently introduced measurement-device-independent (MDI)-QKD, or as a trusted recipient directly communicating with the end users via QKD. Using this network, we perform a proof-of-principle demonstration of QDS mediated by MDI-QKD. For that, we devised an efficient protocol to distil multiple signatures from the same block of data, thus reducing the statistical fluctuations in the sample and greatly enhancing the final QDS rate in the finite-size scenario.

### Guidelines for the practice of telepsychology [^6a22bf2c]. The American Psychologist (2013). Medium credibility.

Guideline 3 — data security, management, and transmission — psychologists who provide telepsychology services seek to take reasonable steps to ensure security measures are in place to protect patient/client/service recipient data from unintended access, disclosure, loss, or corruption, and psychologists are encouraged to be mindful of potential threats such as computer malware, hackers, device loss or theft, damaged drives, flawed software, unsecured files, outdated technology, third-party policies on data use, and data breaches of partner technology companies. Psychologists are encouraged to be mindful of these potential threats and aim to take reasonable steps to ensure that security measures are in place for protecting and controlling access to patient/client/service recipient data within an information system; this applies to data created, stored and/or transmitted by the psychologist, including data stored on third-party platforms, and psychologists are encouraged to be cognizant of relevant laws and regulations (e.g. HIPAA, Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act [HITECH], GDPR) and to develop appropriate policies and procedures to comply with such directives. In application, psychologists are encouraged to conduct a routine analysis of the potential security risks to their practice setting, telecommunication technologies (including devices), and staff access to ensure that data is accessible only to appropriate and authorized individuals, strive to obtain appropriate training or consultation from relevant experts when additional knowledge is needed, strive to maintain these guidelines when practicing in institutions with their own technology infrastructure, and also strive to comply with recordkeeping requirements for documenting authorized access requests and any unauthorized access or data breaches; when developing policies and procedures, psychologists may consider concerns posed by public and private devices and wireless networks, safeguards for different environments and staff roles, and various telecommunication technologies.

### Orchestrating performance of healthcare networks subjected to the compound events of natural disasters and pandemic [^0edf21e9]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The complex network interaction between hospitals, including patients, staff, supplies, and resource transfer, is considered in the utilized model. The patient transfer can redistribute demand for healthcare facilities, reduce patient waiting time in the ER, and provide alternatives for patients admitted to overwhelmed hospitals. The probability of patient transfer is subjected to patient constraints, receiver hospital constraints, the availability of transportation methods especially for patients with critical cases, and a functional telecommunication network to transfer the patient records (see Supplementary Fig. 3). The utilized model also considers staff and resources transfer (see Supplementary Note 3).

### Urban sensing using existing fiber-optic networks [^b7ee013a]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The accuracy and effectiveness of our seismic source mapping are verified through a series of validations. These tests compare the estimated source locations with known coordinates of various urban activities. The validation scenarios include tracking moving trains (e.g. Supplementary Fig. 8 and Fig. 2 a, d), locating trucks (e.g. Fig. 2 b, e), identifying a construction site (Fig. 2 c, f), and monitoring activities around a school district (Supplementary Fig. 9). We observe high SSP values aligning with the shape of the fiber array, primarily because the fiber routes follow major roads, such as arterial streets and highways, in each region. These roads experience higher traffic volumes, generating more traffic-induced seismic power compared to smaller roads or areas farther from the fiber array. Consequently, the observed high-power regions largely reflect the alignment of seismic source hotspots along these major roads. Furthermore, SSP maps are calculated for each 10-minute segment of the DAS data. These maps illustrate the daily rhythms and spatial variations of urban dynamics (Supplementary Movies 1 and 2).

There are several limitations and future directions of our methodology that should be noted. First, accurate seismic source localization using the DAS system requires coverage from telecommunication optical fibers across sufficient back azimuths for effective beamforming. A better result is achieved with telecommunication optical fibers encircling the studied regions, creating a geometric constraint essential for effective beamforming. For instance, it would be challenging to determine the source locations using only a straight fiber cable. Also, our analysis reveals that the sensing range of DAS data varies with the energy and frequency of different sources (Supplementary Fig. 5). It is difficult to accurately detect weak and high-frequency seismic sources distant from the optical fiber network. Nonetheless, the extensive urban telecommunication network offers the potential for multi-back azimuth coverage and dense sensing infrastructure. Future research could explore the optimal configuration of optical fibers to maximize the accuracy of seismic source mapping and quantify the sensing coverage for different sources.

### Principles of child health care financing [^0601aa15]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Principles of Child Health Care Financing — coverage of comprehensive pediatric services states that health insurance for all children, adolescents, and young adults should offer a comprehensive, age-appropriate benefit package spanning the full continuum of pediatric health care. A comprehensive health insurance benefits package should include coverage for the full range of fundamental pediatric services. Federal and state payers and regulators should exercise their full authority to ensure access to a uniform standard of comprehensive pediatric health care benefits across all geographic and insurance products, and if existing regulatory authority cannot achieve this goal, new legislative solutions should be sought. The model of Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment, with its coverage mandate for all medically necessary services, should be the standard for coverage for comprehensive pediatric health benefits in public and private insurance programs and included as part of any proposal for universal coverage, and without comprehensive private insurance, some children and youth with special health care needs will require Medicaid wrap-around coverage. Benefits for children, adolescents, and young adults should be consistent with current recommendations in Bright Futures, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the AAP. All health care services should be sufficient in the type, amount, frequency, duration, setting, and scope to enable care that achieves the best clinical outcome and health-related quality of life for the condition(s) under treatment, including amelioration or palliation of chronic conditions. Medical necessity determination should be specific to the needs of children with flexibility in consideration of the evolving status of the individual child and follow guidance of the AAP statement on contractual language for medical necessity in children. Mental health parity should be enforced and should include behavioral and developmental health care, embedded mental health services, integrated care models, and services delivered by primary care. Insurance should include at least 1 in-network provider of tertiary- and quaternary-level pediatric medical services. The COVID-19 pandemic reinforced the unique and important role for services via telecommunication (ie, telehealth), including audio-only visits, connected to the medical home and the need for payment parity with in-person visits, and remote and home-based telecommunication services should be covered with efforts to ensure equitable access and reduce the digital divide with expanded access to adequate and affordable broadband in all communities.

### Long-distance coherent quantum communications in deployed telecom networks [^bf56ed22]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Recent advances in quantum communications have underscored the crucial role of optical coherence in developing quantum networks. This resource, which is fundamental to the phase-based architecture of the quantum internet 1, has enabled the only successful demonstrations of multi-node quantum networks 2–4 and substantially extended the range of quantum key distribution (QKD) 5. However, the scalability of coherence-based quantum protocols remains uncertain owing to the specialized hardware required, such as ultra-stable optical cavities and cryogenic photon detectors. Here we implement the coherence-based twin-field QKD protocol over a 254-kilometre commercial telecom network spanning between Frankfurt and Kehl, Germany, achieving encryption key distribution at 110bits per second. Our results are enabled by a scalable approach to optical coherence distribution, supported by a practical system architecture and non-cryogenic single-photon detection aided by off-band phase stabilization. Our results demonstrate repeater-like quantum communication in an operational network setting, doubling the distance for practical real-world QKD implementations without cryogenic cooling. In addition, to our knowledge, we realized one of the largest QKD networks featuring measurement-device-independent properties 6. Our research aligns the requirements of coherence-based quantum communication with the capabilities of existing telecommunication infrastructure, which is likely to be useful to the future of high-performance quantum networks, including the implementation of advanced quantum communication protocols, quantum repeaters, quantum sensing networks and distributed quantum computing 7.

### Implementing telehealth in practice: ACOG committee opinion summary, number 798 [^973c6623]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Site resource assessment for telehealth — technology should be considered a bridge to connect with a patient, and site assessments are crucial to ensuring that such technology is adequate. Trained and knowledgeable information technology and network staff should be involved in conducting assessments to ensure equipment and network readiness and address security concerns, and conducting a mock visit to assess equipment readiness can help prepare telemedicine sites for the delivery and installation of new telemedicine equipment. For patients, telehealth generally relies on a strong internet connection, and adequate broadband access is needed for the transmission of high-quality audio, text, and imaging. If the patient (or physician providing telehealth) is experiencing a lack of connectivity, the care needed may not be provided, and patients may face difficulties setting up and effectively using telehealth tools, depending on the technology.

### A manufacturable platform for photonic quantum computing [^0b5f04f0]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Chip-to-chip qubit interconnect

Networking of quantum modules has seen growing interest as various technologies seek to scale beyond the boundary of a single chip, trap or reticle. Telecommunications-wavelength photonic qubits are naturally suited for transmission through optical fibre, without the need for quantum transduction. Furthermore, optical-fibre-based networking can enable further new functionality, such as interleavingand active-volume compilation, leading to large resource savings for fault-tolerant algorithms. To demonstrate the networking capability of our photonic qubits, we build a point-to-point qubit network (Fig. 3b) and assess the fidelity of qubits after propagating between modules. We prepare high-fidelity single-qubit states using the same qubit state preparation circuit as described above and convert to polarization encoding using a two-dimensional grating-coupler-based path-to-polarization converter. We transmit the qubit over 42 m of standard telecommunications-grade optical fibre, before converting to path encoding at the receiving module and performing on-chip qubit state measurement. The transmission and receiving modules both use on-chip superconducting detectors and operate at liquid helium temperature. We determined the Pauli transfer matrixfidelity between the physical channel and the identity operation, conditional on photon arrival, to be 99.72% ± 0.04% (Fig. 3g and Supplementary Information). The system exhibits high loss associated with fibre-to-chip coupling by grating couplers (about 3 dB loss), which will be overcome in future systems using edge-coupled devices (discussed below).

### A multiplexed light-matter interface for fibre-based quantum networks [^7b7c7a00]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Processing and distributing quantum information using photons through fibre-optic or free-space links are essential for building future quantum networks. The scalability needed for such networks can be achieved by employing photonic quantum states that are multiplexed into time and/or frequency, and light-matter interfaces that are able to store and process such states with large time-bandwidth product and multimode capacities. Despite important progress in developing such devices, the demonstration of these capabilities using non-classical light remains challenging. Here, employing the atomic frequency comb quantum memory protocol in a cryogenically cooled erbium-doped optical fibre, we report the quantum storage of heralded single photons at a telecom-wavelength (1.53μm) with a time-bandwidth product approaching 800. Furthermore, we demonstrate frequency-multimode storage and memory-based spectral-temporal photon manipulation. Notably, our demonstrations rely on fully integrated quantum technologies operating at telecommunication wavelengths. With improved storage efficiency, our light-matter interface may become a useful tool in future quantum networks.

### Entanglement of nanophotonic quantum memory nodes in a telecom network [^918f9174]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

A key challenge in realizing practical quantum networks for long-distance quantum communication involves robust entanglement between quantum memory nodes connected by fibre optical infrastructure –. Here we demonstrate a two-node quantum network composed of multi-qubit registers based on silicon-vacancy (SiV) centres in nanophotonic diamond cavities integrated with a telecommunication fibre network. Remote entanglement is generated by the cavity-enhanced interactions between the electron spin qubits of the SiVs and optical photons. Serial, heralded spin-photon entangling gate operations with time-bin qubits are used for robust entanglement of separated nodes. Long-lived nuclear spin qubits are used to provide second-long entanglement storage and integrated error detection. By integrating efficient bidirectional quantum frequency conversion of photonic communication qubits to telecommunication frequencies (1,350 nm), we demonstrate the entanglement of two nuclear spin memories through 40 km spools of low-loss fibre and a 35-km long fibre loop deployed in the Boston area urban environment, representing an enabling step towards practical quantum repeaters and large-scale quantum networks.

### Guidelines for the practice of telepsychology [^4a82b461]. The American Psychologist (2013). Medium credibility.

Telepsychology — data security policies, vendor controls, and breach reporting — psychologists are encouraged to clearly address which telecommunication technologies are used and the purpose of the communication, and are cognizant that preserving the actual communication may be preferable to summarizing it, depending on the type of technology used. As part of their data security policies and procedures, psychologists seek to use encryption technology and robust security or multi-factor authentication controls for devices and for access to software or relevant websites, and psychologists strive to ensure that they have signed business associate agreements (BAA) in place with any third-party vendors as appropriate, including technology vendors, documenting their compliance with and adherence to the regulations regarding data security; this is especially relevant for tools with automated and/or artificial intelligence (AI) facilitated features. Psychologists are encouraged to be aware of what data is stored on Internet-based tools (e.g., practice management, electronic health records), and to ensure that those tools are HIPAA compliant, and psychologists are encouraged to review the data management and retention policies of any third-party technology vendors or other business associates regarding patient data before beginning to use a product or service and also on a periodic basis, because over time vendors may change terms of service. If there is a breach of unsecured electronically communicated or maintained data, psychologists seek to notify their patients/clients/service recipients and other appropriate individuals/organizations consistent with federal, state, provincial, territorial, and other organizational reporting requirements, are encouraged to understand what types of reporting are made on behalf of the psychologist to individuals affected by a data breach as outlined in the BAA executed with the third-party organization, and are encouraged to undertake due diligence to ensure comprehensive reporting in line with ethical and legal guidelines, regardless of the terms and conditions of the BAA. In addition, they are encouraged to make their best efforts to keep secure back-up versions of electronic data, such as through encrypted cloud-based storage, network drives, external devices, etc., and an organization may appoint a data security officer to facilitate and control access, oversee required data security-related training of employees, and mitigate potential risks.

### Triadic embeddedness structure in family networks predicts mobile communication response to a sudden natural disaster [^5cfd297f]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Kinship networks are a fundamental social unit in human societies, and like social networks in general, provide social support in times of need. Here, we investigate the impact of sudden environmental shock, the M s 7.0 2013 Ya'an earthquake, on the mobile communications patterns of local families, which we operationalize using anonymized individual-level mobile telecommunications metadata from family plan subscribers of a major carrier (N = 35,565 people). We demonstrate that families' communications dynamics after the earthquake depended on their triadic embeddedness structure, a structural metric we propose that reflects the number of dyads in a family triad that share social ties. We find that individuals in more embedded family structures were more likely to first call other family plan members and slower in calling non-family ties immediately after the earthquake; these tendencies were stronger at higher earthquake intensity. In the weeks after the event, individuals in more embedded family structures had more reciprocal communications and contacted more social ties in their broader social network. Overall, families that are structurally more embedded displayed higher levels of intra-family coordination and mobilization of non-family social connections.

### Non-technological barriers: the last frontier towards AI-powered intelligent optical networks [^6b713fe0]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Prospective solutions for non-technological limiting factors

Below, we propose some potential strategies that can aid in resolving the pending non-technological challenges discussed above, thus clearing the path for vast utilization of ML-aided methods in upcoming commercial optical networks.

Addressing legacy issues

The cost-benefit comparisons of ML-based and legacy solutions can be used to entice the network operators that persisting with the legacy tools will in fact turn out to be more expensive in the long run since employing modern ML-aided methods can greatly enhance the network performance and hence offer better value. According to a 2022 analysis report by McKinsey & Company, the field operations of most telecommunication companies account for 60−70% of their operating budgets. In view of this, the optical network operators can be convinced that the automation of network processes through ML-powered intelligent solutions can help reduce humans' involvement, streamline network operations, and enable self-healing networks that are more resilient and reliable, thus bringing real and rapid cost benefits.

Furthermore, the network operators can be persuaded that in today's world of breakneck innovation race, it may be too risky for them to rely on outdated legacy tools since it can lead to competitive disadvantage and hamper their future growth. Proven examples of successful adoption of ML in network business use-cases, e.g. ML-assisted customers' behavior analysis, can particularly be evinced in this regard to affirm what ML is realistically able to accomplish.

### Digital tracking, provider decision support systems, and targeted client communication via mobile devices to improve primary health care [^014053ae]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Search methods for identification of studies

We restricted the search from 2000 to November 2022. This was based on the increased availability and penetration of mobile devices in low‐ and middle‐income countries starting in 2000 (International Telecommunications Union 2015).

Electronic searches

An independent Information Specialist (JE) developed search strategies in consultation with the review authors.

We searched the following databases for primary studies from 2000 to 9 November 2022:

Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Issue 10 of 12, October 2022, part of the Cochrane Library, Wiley
MEDLINE(R) ALL (Ovid) 1946 to November 08, 2022;
Embase < 1974 to 2022 Week 44 >, Ovid;
Global Index Medicus, WHO;
International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), WHO;
US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov;
POPLINE (searched 7 August 2019).

Appendix 4 lists the search strategies for each database. Search strategies comprise keywords and controlled vocabulary terms. We did not apply any language limits.

In February 2024, we conducted simple searches in PubMed to check for any new randomised trials that might have been published since the date of the last search in November 2022.

Searching other resources

We searched for ongoing trials in the following trial registries and contacted study authors to request further information and data, if available.

WHO ICTRP (World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform)
US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov.

We searched Epistemonikos for relevant systematic reviews and potentially eligible primary studies. Additionally, the WHO called for papers through popular digital health communities of practice, such as the Global Digital Health Network and grey literature, to identify additional primary studies.

Grey literature

In addition to the above databases, we searched mhealthevidence.org for grey literature. However, mHealthevidence.org lost funding support and was discontinued in 2021, so our successive searches did not include this database.

We reviewed reference lists of all included studies and relevant systematic reviews for additional potentially eligible primary studies. We contacted authors of included studies/reviews to clarify reported published information and to seek unpublished results/data.

### Optical observation of single spins in silicon [^3e77437e]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

The global quantum internet will require long-lived, telecommunications-band photon-matter interfaces manufactured at scale 1. Preliminary quantum networks based on photon-matter interfaces that meet a subset of these demands are encouraging efforts to identify new high-performance alternatives 2. Silicon is an ideal host for commercial-scale solid-state quantum technologies. It is already an advanced platform within the global integrated photonics and microelectronics industries, as well as host to record-setting long-lived spin qubits 3. Despite the overwhelming potential of the silicon quantum platform, the optical detection of individually addressable photon-spin interfaces in silicon has remained elusive. In this work, we integrate individually addressable 'T centre' photon-spin qubits in silicon photonic structures and characterize their spin-dependent telecommunications-band optical transitions. These results unlock immediate opportunities to construct silicon-integrated, telecommunications-band quantum information networks.

### Entanglement of nanophotonic quantum memory nodes in a telecom network [^4e30b453]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

A key challenge in realizing practical quantum networks for long-distance quantum communication involves robust entanglement between quantum memory nodes connected by fibre optical infrastructure 1–3. Here we demonstrate a two-node quantum network composed of multi-qubit registers based on silicon-vacancy (SiV) centres in nanophotonic diamond cavities integrated with a telecommunication fibre network. Remote entanglement is generated by the cavity-enhanced interactions between the electron spin qubits of the SiVs and optical photons. Serial, heralded spin-photon entangling gate operations with time-bin qubits are used for robust entanglement of separated nodes. Long-lived nuclear spin qubits are used to provide second-long entanglement storage and integrated error detection. By integrating efficient bidirectional quantum frequency conversion of photonic communication qubits to telecommunication frequencies (1,350nm), we demonstrate the entanglement of two nuclear spin memories through 40km spools of low-loss fibre and a 35-km long fibre loop deployed in the Boston area urban environment, representing an enabling step towards practical quantum repeaters and large-scale quantum networks.

### Feasibility and safety of remote robotic hepatectomy: a prospective single-arm study with MP1000 system in China [^f06f60b5]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of telesurgery

Except for Patient 6, whose surgery was temporarily interrupted for approximately 3 min due to a disconnection in the network cable, no other network-related incidents occurred, ensuring the smooth completion of all procedures. As shown in Fig. 2 A and B, the two hospitals involved in this study were located in Wuhan and Guiyang, with a one-way communication distance of 1200 km between them. Wuhan was equipped with a remote console, while Guiyang housed a complete surgical robotic system, including both the console and robotic arm. The telecommunication network for the robotic system utilized an AAA-grade optical transport network (OTN) dedicated line with a bandwidth of 100 Mbps, characterized by ultra-low latency, high reliability, and robust security. The telemedicine system employed 5G wireless connectivity to facilitate real-time communication between the primary surgeon and assistants, as well as live transmission of intraoperative imaging. Key intraoperative telecommunication metrics — including round-trip network latency, network jitter, video encoding/decoding latency, and frame loss — were meticulously recorded and are presented in Fig. 2 (C–F). After rigorous preoperative preparation, all surgeries were successfully completed without complications. The overall performance of the remote system met the requirements for telesurgery. Detailed assessments of surgeon workload, as well as evaluations of video quality, audio clarity, and instrument functionality for each case, are summarized in Fig. 3.

### Telemedicine: pediatric applications [^d9e63c15]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Telemedicine connectivity and bandwidth — most telemedicine interactions use Internet protocol via a high-speed Internet connection, and when high-speed Internet is unavailable, integrated services digital network connections may be used; for a live interactive telemedicine link, a commonly suggested minimum is a 384-kilobits-per-second bidirectional connection between sites, and links are able to provide point-to-point connectivity from within or outside the health care facility.

### A waveguide frequency converter connecting rubidium-based quantum memories to the telecom C-band [^fa4df4cf]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Coherently converting the frequency and temporal waveform of single and entangled photons will be crucial to interconnect the various elements of future quantum information networks. Of particular importance is the quantum frequency conversion of photons emitted by material systems able to store quantum information, so-called quantum memories. There have been significant efforts to implement quantum frequency conversion using nonlinear crystals, with non-classical light from broadband photon-pair sources and solid-state emitters. However, solid state quantum frequency conversion has not yet been achieved with long-lived optical quantum memories. Here we demonstrate an ultra-low-noise solid state photonic quantum interface suitable for connecting quantum memories based on atomic ensembles to the telecommunication fibre network. The interface is based on an integrated-waveguide nonlinear device. We convert heralded single photons at 780nm from a rubidium-based quantum memory to the telecommunication wavelength of 1,552nm, showing significant non-classical correlations between the converted photon and the heralding signal.

### Free-space optical delay line using space-time wave packets [^c7d920c4]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Such an optical delay line is a critical component of an optical buffer. Several crucial steps remain before achieving this goal, including extending this experimental realization to the telecommunications band at ~1.5 μm, making use of data streams to test the possibility of alleviating data packet contention at a switch, in addition to evaluating the required resources for our system (especially in terms of overall physical footprint) in comparison to alternative approaches. Furthermore, extending the transverse confinement of ST wave packets to both transverse directions (an optical needle,) rather than the single dimension (light sheet) demonstrated here will enable their coupling to optical waveguides, fibers, and other photonic devices.

It is useful to consider the potential for scaling our strategy to the requirements of a telecommunications network. The free-space configuration used in our experiments is not far removed from commercially available wavelength-selective switches and dynamical gain-equalizers. Such devices typically disperse the spectrum of the optical signal spatially followed by the use of a SLM to introduce functionalities such as channel blocking, dispersion compensation, and channel equalization. Indeed, these devices serve as the main components in reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexers and can provide spectral dispersers with < 10 GHz resolution in the telecommunication C band. Given that most wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) networks operate with signal channels on a 200 GHz grid, the 10 GHz resolution would enable 20 SLM pixels per wavelength band on a typical SLM, which may be sufficient to induce the desired delays using our ST wave packet approach. Therefore, our strategy is in principle compatible with current telecommunications systems.

The unique characteristics of ST wave packets demonstrated here pave the way to such exotic possibilities as colliding co-propagating or even counter-propagating optical pulses produced by the same source. Such scenarios could be useful in a variety of applications, including laser machining, laser fusion, and electron acceleration. Finally, we note that another promising approach for the spatio-temporal synthesis of optical wave packets of controllable group velocity has also been recently proposed and investigated –.

### The role of telemedicine in wound care: a review and analysis of a database of 5, 795 patients from a mobile wound-healing center in languedoc-roussillon, France [^2369e20d]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Telemedicine in wound care is an evolving method of information technology and telecommunication designed to provide health care at a distance. Given the visual nature of wound care, telemedicine has many potential applications within this field. The authors will review the current status of wound care and telemedicine.

Methods

A comprehensive literature review of articles published on telemedicine in wound care was performed. Articles were selected for their relevance to wound healing and then reviewed for their discussion on the potential applications, benefits, and limitations to telemedicine in wound care. The CICAT network data were reviewed including 5,794 patients between January 2005 and October 2015. Clinical efficacy and medicoeconomic results were analyzed.

Results

Current literature suggests a myriad of potential benefits of telemedicine in wound care, often citing increased access to professional expertise in remote and rural settings, as well as cost savings. The CICAT wound network in France analyzed wounds, which were principally pressure ulcers (44%), leg ulcers (24%), and diabetic foot ulcers (8%). Results demonstrated 75% of wounds improved or healed, a 72% reduction in the number of hospitalizations, and 56% reduction in ambulance transfers to wound healing centers.

Conclusions

There is an increasing demand for assistance from professionals not specialized in wound healing, facing complex wounds. The goal is to enable the spread of expertise beyond major medical centers. Several limitations and barriers to the application of telemedicine in all settings are evident, including over diagnosis, dependence on a functional telecommunication system, and various legal aspects. The CICAT network in France provides an example of a how telemedicine may be of benefit in wound care, although it is important to note that in other countries, such as the United States, legal constraints and credentialing concerns may make telemedicine extremely complicated.

### International perspectives on measuring national digital public health system maturity through a multidisciplinary Delphi study [^10ac4481]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The ongoing digital transformation is reshaping various aspects of society, including healthcare systems. Many countries have transitioned from paper-based to digitalized healthcare systems in recent years, bringing numerous benefits such as improved efficiency, cost reduction, real-time monitoring of health outcomes, and enhanced communication among stakeholders (e.g. physicians and patients) –. However, digitalization also raises data security and privacy concerns, necessitating robust protection measures and regulations. Countries must provide the required infrastructure and data security framework to enable digital technologies in healthcare while protecting their population's most sensitive data. Additionally, user adoption, sustainability, and ethical design are crucial considerations for successfully implementing digital interventions.

The digitalization of healthcare systems presents both opportunities and challenges, highlighting the complexity of this transformation. However, with limited resources, the degree of digitalization varies across national healthcare systems. Assessing the maturity of a country's digital healthcare system through objective measurements allows for benchmarking, policy learning, and informed decision-making. It enables policymakers to identify areas that require improvement, prioritize funding for interventions, education, and technical infrastructure, and track the progress of digitalization efforts over time.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) emphasize a comprehensive strategy for assessing electronic health (eHealth) systems, encompassing leadership, governance, implementation, and funding strategies, information-communication-technology (ICT) infrastructure, legal regulations, and digital literacy skills of the workforce and the general population. Assessing the maturity of a healthcare system as a result of this needs to be conducted holistically and include the above-given dimensions. This approach implies the use of various multidisciplinary indicators.

Over the years, numerous indices have been developed to assess different aspects of digital health systems. However, none of these indices have taken a comprehensive approach to measuring the maturity of digital public health (DiPH) systems as a whole. Instead, they have focused on specific areas such as national ICT infrastructure, legal regulations, political support, social acceptance, or implementing interventions within healthcare systems. Notably, there is a lack of indices that specifically address DiPH.

### TOPS-speed complex-valued convolutional accelerator for feature extraction and inference [^2df30e54]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) emulate the human brain's learning processes, comprising interconnected nodes that adapt based on data. With sufficient computing power and training data, ANNs excel at tasks such as pattern recognition, speech processing, and decision-making –. While generic ANNs are real-valued, exclusively handling amplitude information, wave-related scenarios that involve both amplitude and phase information highly desire neural networks tailored for waves (i.e. complex-valued neural networks). Applications where complex-valued neural networks are heavily needed include radar technologies, which rely on understanding phase information for target detection and localization, such as analyzing ice thickness or industrial activities at sea using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images captured by satellites; telecommunications, where the intricate interplay of amplitude and phase defines signal characteristics; and robotics, where precise wave-based sensing enhances spatial awareness –.

### All-optical spiking neurosynaptic networks with self-learning capabilities [^1cc67732]. Nature (2019). Excellent credibility.

Software implementations of brain-inspired computing underlie many important computational tasks, from image processing to speech recognition, artificial intelligence and deep learning applications. Yet, unlike real neural tissue, traditional computing architectures physically separate the core computing functions of memory and processing, making fast, efficient and low-energy computing difficult to achieve. To overcome such limitations, an attractive alternative is to design hardware that mimics neurons and synapses. Such hardware, when connected in networks or neuromorphic systems, processes information in a way more analogous to brains. Here we present an all-optical version of such a neurosynaptic system, capable of supervised and unsupervised learning. We exploit wavelength division multiplexing techniques to implement a scalable circuit architecture for photonic neural networks, successfully demonstrating pattern recognition directly in the optical domain. Such photonic neurosynaptic networks promise access to the high speed and high bandwidth inherent to optical systems, thus enabling the direct processing of optical telecommunication and visual data.

### Implementation of a referral and expert advice call center for maternal and newborn care in the resource constrained health system context of the greater accra region of Ghana [^35726126]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

The call center was subsequently set up in partnership with a local private telecommunication network (MTN). The selection of the MTN as the local private telecommunication network to work with was based on evaluation of responses to an open call for proposals and quotations for support to develop a call center to support peer and expert consultation and coordinate referrals and expert advice in the region. An ethnographic study of the organizational functioning of the call center has been published elsewhere and provides detail on how and why the center functioned including factors such as how staff were selected and remunerated, resources and working conditions etc. [1].

The objective of this complementary paper is to present the analysis of routine process indicators of how the call center facilitated (or not) referral for maternal and newborn emergencies and provision of expert advice to frontline health providers. In the process we also present some of the challenges of intervention development and implementation, innovation and research in a resource constrained context and the effects on the call centre intervention and its functioning. This paper focuses on a formative rather than a summative evaluation of the call Center intervention to generate information on "how" and "why" the intervention works (or not) that can help to interpret any outcomes in a summative evaluation.

### A quantum access network [^53c18616]. Nature (2013). Excellent credibility.

The theoretically proven security of quantum key distribution (QKD) could revolutionize the way in which information exchange is protected in the future. Several field tests of QKD have proven it to be a reliable technology for cryptographic key exchange and have demonstrated nodal networks of point-to-point links. However, until now no convincing answer has been given to the question of how to extend the scope of QKD beyond niche applications in dedicated high security networks. Here we introduce and experimentally demonstrate the concept of a 'quantum access network': based on simple and cost-effective telecommunication technologies, the scheme can greatly expand the number of users in quantum networks and therefore vastly broaden their appeal. We show that a high-speed single-photon detector positioned at a network node can be shared between up to 64 users for exchanging secret keys with the node, thereby significantly reducing the hardware requirements for each user added to the network. This point-to-multipoint architecture removes one of the main obstacles restricting the widespread application of QKD. It presents a viable method for realizing multi-user QKD networks with efficient use of resources, and brings QKD closer to becoming a widespread technology.

### Integrated photonic metasystem for image classifications at telecommunication wavelength [^ddf34898]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

As the depth of a machine learning system outweighs the number of elements per layer, here we demonstrate high accuracy image classifications at telecommunication wavelengths in the multi-layer one-dimensional metasurface systems. Arrays of rectangular slots are defined in the silicon layer. The slot lengths in those phase-only transmissive arrays are pre-trained by deep diffractive neuron networks. Beyond conventional classification functions, the metasystems also demonstrate unique functions of wavelength demultiplexing and multi-wavelength pattern classifications, with potential applications in spatial division multiplexing based optical interconnects and machine vision.

### Piloting a mHealth intervention to improve newborn care awareness among rural Cambodian mothers: a feasibility study [^8ef79f44]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Technological feasibility

While there are high phone ownership rates in Cambodia, there is also the issue of owning more than one SIM card. In fact, more often than not, ownership of up to four SIM cards, all on different networks has been reported. This is great challenge when the mHealth intervention is only registered on one SIM. There are four major telecommunication providers in Cambodia and SIM card switching is a frequent occurrence and a hindrance to interventions such as ours where only one number from one network is registered. While our feasibility study reports that telecommunication lines were clear with only some calls being missed, having more than one SIM is one of the biggest barriers to the end-user's ability to access all the messages in a timely manner. One of the limitations of our evaluation was that we did not ask whether or not the number used for registration was the 'primary' number being used and if indeed our target audience switched SIM cards.

### Telehealth interventions during COVID-19 pandemic: a scoping review of applications, challenges, privacy and security issues [^456c2db8]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2023). High credibility.

Background

The COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, proliferated worldwide, leading to a pandemic. Many governmental and non-governmental organisations and research institutes are contributing to the COVID-19 fight to control the pandemic.

Motivation

Numerous telehealth applications have been proposed and adopted during the pandemic to combat the spread of the disease. To this end, powerful tools such as artificial intelligence (AI)/robotic technologies, tracking, monitoring, consultation apps and other telehealth interventions have been extensively used. However, there are several issues and challenges that are currently facing this technology.

Objective

The purpose of this scoping review is to analyse the primary goal of these techniques; document their contribution to tackling COVID-19; identify and categorise their main challenges and future direction in fighting against the COVID-19 or future pandemic outbreaks.

Methods

Four digital libraries (ACM, IEEE, Scopus and Google Scholar) were searched to identify relevant sources. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) was used as a guideline procedure to develop a comprehensive scoping review. General telehealth features were extracted from the studies reviewed and analysed in the context of the intervention type, technology used, contributions, challenges, issues and limitations.

Results

A collection of 27 studies were analysed. The reported telehealth interventions were classified into two main categories: AI-based and non-AI-based interventions; their main contributions to tackling COVID-19 are in the aspects of disease detection and diagnosis, pathogenesis and virology, vaccine and drug development, transmission and epidemic predictions, online patient consultation, tracing, and observation; 28 telehealth intervention challenges/issues have been reported and categorised into technical (14), non-technical (10), and privacy, and policy issues (4). The most critical technical challenges are: network issues, system reliability issues, performance, accuracy and compatibility issues. Moreover, the most critical non-technical issues are: the skills required, hardware/software cost, inability to entirely replace physical treatment and people's uncertainty about using the technology. Stringent laws/regulations, ethical issues are some of the policy and privacy issues affecting the development of the telehealth interventions reported in the literature.

Conclusion

This study provides medical and scientific scholars with a comprehensive overview of telehealth technologies' current and future applications in the fight against COVID-19 to motivate researchers to continue to maximise the benefits of these techniques in the fight against pandemics. Lastly, we recommend that the identified challenges, privacy, and security issues and solutions be considered when designing and developing future telehealth applications.

### Primary health care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in 10 south-east Asian countries: a cross-case synthesis with lessons for future health systems strengthening [^01680646]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Digital technology

Synthesis findings also draw attention to the ongoing digital transformation in the Region, while demonstrating how the pandemic accelerated the adoption and adaptation of technology-enabled models of health care and health information systems. New technology-enabled models of care, including tele-consultations, use of mobile clinics for essential medications and facilitated patient transport, may improve future NCD management, particularly in geographically dispersed, remote contexts. Synthesis findings therefore underscore a critical opportunity to identify and scale up aspects of successful digital models used in the pandemic to meet future health challenges. Others have pointed to the immense opportunities to continue to invest in digital health ecosystems, including robust, continually updated health information systems, electronic health records and telemedicine to strengthen UHC in the Region. The potential of digitalisation to support health integration, address workforce and health care access challenges and enhance surveillance in primary care must be enabled by legal and ethical frameworks to ensure patient safety, data security, and privacy and intellectual property rights as technologies are rapidly developed.

Governance for multisectoral action

The regional experience of COVID-19 also drew increased attention, as it did globally, to how societal and economic factors interact with health, with the crisis exacerbating existing social and economic disadvantage through impacts on both health and economic activity. Despite new multiagency and multilevel collaborations prompted by COVID-19, there remains an urgent need to sustain and strengthen multisectoral policy and action and to move beyond existing vertical, programmatic approaches focused on disease control and maternal and child health. Such efforts should address the optimal role of the health sector as a partner in (and potential steward of) multisectoral partnerships, and strengthen governance enablers such as policies, legislation and resourcing that incentivise collaboration, linkage infrastructure (including physical structures, as well as virtual network platforms and frameworks), shared planning including at the subnational level, and strengthened relationships and trust. Synthesis findings suggest that supportive and enabling environments for PHC allow for both centrally coordinated actions of executive government along with mechanisms to support decentralised decision-making.

### Guidelines for the practice of telepsychology [^2aedc222]. The American Psychologist (2013). Medium credibility.

Telepsychology glossary — privacy, security, and technology terms define key constructs for practice: Protected health information (PHI) is information, including demographic information, which relates to an individual's health, the provision of health care, or payment for health care, and it includes many common identifiers when they can be associated with the health information; personally identifiable information (PII) is information that can be used to distinguish or trace the identity of an individual alone or when combined with other identifying information. Multi-factor authentication is authentication using two or more different factors to provide increased security during log-ins and factors may include something you know, something you have, or something you are. Telecommunications is the preparation, transmission, communication, or related processing of information by electrical, electromagnetic, electromechanical, electro-optical, or electronic means. Telepresence describes how participants experience the technology system, including how it makes them feel present and how it enables them to interact with and respond to others, and considerations often include virtual eye contact and other mechanisms through which patients interact with and respond to technology. Telesupervision is supervision of psychological services either through asynchronous methods or synchronous audio and video where the supervisor is not in the same physical facility as the trainee. Third-party monitoring/third-party observer refers to the influence of an observer's presence on human behaviors, specifically the potential negative effects a present third party may have on the process, results, and outcome of a neuropsychological assessment. mHealth is the use of mobile and wireless technologies to support the achievement of health objectives, and malware is a computer program covertly placed onto a computer or electronic device with the intent to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data, applications, or operating systems. GDPR is a data privacy law governing the processing, storing, and managing of the personal data of individuals in the European Union that extends to organizations anywhere if they collect data related to people in the EU, and HIPAA requires the Secretary of HHS to promulgate standards for the electronic exchange, privacy, and security of health information.

### Environmental effects of information and communications technologies [^e17c9911]. Nature (2011). Excellent credibility.

The digital revolution affects the environment on several levels. Most directly, information and communications technology (ICT) has environmental impacts through the manufacturing, operation and disposal of devices and network equipment, but it also provides ways to mitigate energy use, for example through smart buildings and teleworking. At a broader system level, ICTs influence economic growth and bring about technological and societal change. Managing the direct impacts of ICTs is more complex than just producing efficient devices, owing to the energetically expensive manufacturing process, and the increasing proliferation of devices needs to be taken into account.

### Dynamic clinical algorithms: digital technology can transform health care decision-making [^7730ad9f]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Most health care in low-income countries is delivered at a primary care level by health workers who lack quality training and supervision, often distant from more experienced support. Lack of knowledge and poor communication result in a poor quality of care and inefficient delivery of health services. Although bringing great benefits in sectors such as finance and telecommunication in recent years, the Digital Revolution has lightly and inconsistently affected the health sector. These advances offer an opportunity to dramatically transform health care by increasing the availability and timeliness of information to augment clinical decision-making, based on improved access to patient histories, current information on disease epidemiology, and improved incorporation of data from point-of-care and centralized diagnostic testing. A comprehensive approach is needed to more effectively incorporate current digital technologies into health systems, bringing external and patient-derived data into the clinical decision-making process in real time, irrespective of health worker training or location. Such dynamic clinical algorithms could provide a more effective framework within which to design and integrate new digital health technologies and deliver improved patient care by primary care health workers.

### Telemedicine and the internet. A collaboration and history of communication technologies [^098e176b]. Dermatologic Clinics (2001). Low credibility.

First, it is evident that no matter which type of applied technology is used, the most important aspect, aside from the criteria mentioned herein, is the overall ease of use of the client interaction software. Second, it is important to make technology easy so that its use is widespread and practical. It should not be forgotten that the principal goal of telemedicine is to improve patient care in areas in which that care cannot be provided or where the augmentation of current care can be reinforced through collaborative measures. The guiding principal of the Internet was to create a platform where mutual communication and information are made available to the masses in an effective, inexpensive, and intuitive manner. The goals are indeed obvious, and this fact alone makes the future of the two technologies assured.

### Telemedicine in critical care [^cf35067d]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Current practices of telemedicine in the ICU

Telemedicine in intensive care medicine describes the use of communication technology to provide intensive care unit (ICU) services over variable geographic distances. Audiovisual technology for the provision of tele-ICU services has first been successfully implemented in pilot programs in the 1970s. In the last 2 decades, however, we have seen a surge of tele-ICU in research and routine settings. As of 2018, 18% of ICU beds in the US were covered by telemedicine, which likely increased following the COVID-19 pandemic. The implementation of tele-ICU services is driven by the increased demand, represented by the rising numbers of patients admitted to an ICU, an increasing age and severity of illness among patients, a shortage of trained intensivists, and the need to transfer rapidly evolving medical knowledge to the bedside.

Different models of tele-ICU care exist, such as telemedicine programs in US vs. Europe or Latin America. These are driven by diverse geographical medical and health-systems' cultures, availability of intensivists, regulatory and ethical allowances, academic and commercial interests, and stakeholder's perception of telemedicine implementation. Commonly, it entails a tele-ICU or hub in a large medical center, which is connected to a network of ICUs, called spoke ICUs, using audiovisual technology. The network may be established within a hospital network or span across different stand-alone hospitals and providers. Different staffing models exist, from 24/7 staffing and around-the-clock telemedicine services to scheduled telemedicine rounds during weekdays (Fig. 1). The tele-ICU is usually staffed with experienced intensivists, ICU nurses, and administrative staff. The remote ICU can have board-certified and not certified critical care physicians, or even not have a physician at bedside, as some models in the US. The level of data integration within the telemedicine network varies. For some programs, there is only an audiovisual connection, whereas other programs have established note sharing, direct access to the patient's electronic medical record, real-time telemetry and visual clinical examination, and automated alert and decision support systems.

### Mobile technologies to support healthcare provider to healthcare provider communication and management of care [^69269eec]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Description of the intervention

Digital technologies are increasingly used to support health systems (WHO 2018) by providing flexible options for communication and the exchange of information. These technologies can be used for medical diagnostic, monitoring and therapeutic purposes, when participants are separated by distance or time or both, with the ultimate goal of improving the health of individuals and communities (Steinhubi 2013). Provision of health care at a distance is usually referred to as telemedicine (WHO 2018), and can be implemented through mobile or fixed devices.

The exchange of information can happen synchronously (when interactions happen in real time) or asynchronously (when there is a lag between the clinical information being transmitted and the response), and through different channels, including video‐conferencing, mobile applications, and secure messaging (Kruse 2017; WHO 2016). The use of mobile technologies can improve access to specialty care (Liddy 2019b), particularly for underserved communities (Källander 2013). Widespread mobile broadband connectivity means that even healthcare providers in remote areas can access and communicate with their peers, improving co‐operation (Aceto 2018). The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Observatory for eHealth conducted a survey of the WHO Member States on the use of eHealth (WHO 2016), and reported that of the 122 countries surveyed 70% reported on the use of mobile health devices for consultation between healthcare professionals. The most common areas were teleradiology, telepathology, and teledermatology (WHO 2016), with teleradiology programmes being widely used. Within this review our focus was on mobile technologies to support provider‐to‐provider communication and management of care.

In a bid to maximise the coverage of healthcare services and to decrease the cost of providing health care, governments and healthcare agencies in some countries have funded some type of telehealth programme for provision of care, including promoting communication and management of care between providers. Some examples include the Technology Enabled Care Services programme in England (NHS Commissioning Assembly 2015), the Scottish Centre for Telehealth and Telecare (SCTT 2017), the telehealth services provided within the Medicare programme in the USA (MedPAC 2016), the Asia eHealth Information Network (AeHIN 20017), the KwaZulu‐Natal Experience in South Africa (Mars 2012), and the Aga Khan Development Network Digital Health Programme, which covers remote communities in South‐Central Asia and East Africa (AKDN 2019).

### Quantum storage of photonic entanglement in a crystal [^62ca5f0d]. Nature (2011). Excellent credibility.

Entanglement is the fundamental characteristic of quantum physics-much experimental effort is devoted to harnessing it between various physical systems. In particular, entanglement between light and material systems is interesting owing to their anticipated respective roles as 'flying' and stationary qubits in quantum information technologies (such as quantum repeaters and quantum networks). Here we report the demonstration of entanglement between a photon at a telecommunication wavelength (1,338nm) and a single collective atomic excitation stored in a crystal. One photon from an energy-time entangled pair is mapped onto the crystal and then released into a well-defined spatial mode after a predetermined storage time. The other (telecommunication wavelength) photon is sent directly through a 50-metre fibre link to an analyser. Successful storage of entanglement in the crystal is proved by a violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality by almost three standard deviations (S = 2.64 ± 0.23). These results represent an important step towards quantum communication technologies based on solid-state devices. In particular, our resources pave the way for building multiplexed quantum repeaters for long-distance quantum networks.

### Telemedicine in hepatology: current applications and future directions [^6de6fbd4]. Liver Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Telemedicine refers to the use of information and communication technologies for providing health care at a distance. Through the use of telecommunication technologies such as cell phones, computers, and other electronic devices, health care providers are able to conduct patient visits, mentor/train other providers, and monitor patients' chronic diseases remotely, potentially hundreds or thousands of miles away. Over the past 2 decades, the use of telemedicine has grown in the field of hepatology. In this review, we provide a focused primer on telemedicine and its current applications in hepatology. In particular, we discuss the use of telemedicine in the management of chronic hepatitis C, the complications of liver disease, as well as preliver transplantation evaluation and posttransplantation care. In addition, we provide a synopsis of the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the use of telemedicine in hepatology.

### Implementing telehealth in practice: ACOG committee opinion summary, number 798 [^c814d896]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements for telehealth — the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, including its implementing regulations, is an important aspect of all health care, including telehealth, and physicians who provide telehealth must comply with the HIPAA privacy and security rules. Patients should be counseled that there is still a small possibility that even encrypted data could be accessed by unauthorized persons, that applications on a smartphone seldom have the same level of encryption as telehealth equipment used over telehealth networks, and that health information stored in a personal health record not offered through a physician or health plan is not covered by HIPAA. The HIPAA Security Rule provides technical and nontechnical safeguards and requires covered entities to establish 1) access controls, 2) audit controls, 3) integrity controls, and 4) transmission security for electronic protected health information.

### RoadMApp: a feasibility study for a smart travel application to improve maternal health delivery in a low resource setting in Zimbabwe [^b34a8544]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Sub-theme 1.5: waiting mothers' shelter

The non-availability of mothers' shelters at some rural clinics/hospitals presented a need for readily available transport systems for a referral to the next level of care, which in most cases were in urban areas that were very far from the women's homes. The length of stay affected the women as they did not have a social support system. Some women were absconding referrals and opting for risky home deliveries. A health care worker commented:

"Rural women are reluctant to be referred to the next level of care because of lack of accommodation and support, particularly in urban settings, " (Female Key informant within the age range 40–45).

Theme 2: telecommunications and network infrastructure

The telecommunications network providers have tried to ensure that most areas in Zimbabwe have network coverage. The RoadMApp intervention will heavily rely on the network accessibility and hence the importance of understanding the network patterns in the study areas.

Sub-theme 2.1: network coverage

Participants reported network coverage to be good in urban areas where all telecommunication service providers had a substantial number of base stations. However, network challenges were experienced when there were intermittent electricity supplies, a common occurrence in Zimbabwe. The farther away rural communities were from the urban areas, the weaker the network. Despite the low network coverage in most rural settings, voice calls and messages could still be received, but there was poor Internet connectivity. The communities knew the best spots to pick up signals for communication. However, this was a challenge for nurses who had to disrupt their duties to connect to networks. One participant said:

" At this place, we have serious network challenges, and it becomes difficult when our wives need emergency help. Sometimes one has to go up a tree to access the network, " (Rural male participant age range 28–35).

The community suggested that the RoadMApp application should have a communication system that did not rely much on the Internet and which could use the simplest mobile phones to benefit all communities. They suggested the adoption of platforms used by local mobile money wallet operators such as Econet, Netone, and Telecel, which can be accessed by punching a set of preprogrammed numbers.

### Cybersecurity framework for health care | NIST HPH guide… [^63bc36a3]. aspr.hhs.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

The United States has seen a marked increase in the use of digital technologies and cyber-physical systems, which in health care are critical integration of a network of medical devices. These systems are progressively used in hospitals to achieve continuous high-quality health care, resulting in an increase in the level of exposures to cyber-attacks, which target an organization's use of cyberspace for the purpose of stealing information or disrupting, disabling, or destroying related information resources. As a result of these ever-increasing cyber threats, President Barack Obama directed the National Institute of Standards and Technology to work with the private sector to develop the. Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, also known as the Cybersecurity Framework.

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework provides an organizational cybersecurity risk management model that industries, industry sectors, or organizations can leverage to identify opportunities for improving their management of cybersecurity risk. The following sections discuss the history of the various mandates and executive orders pertaining to the use of a voluntary Cybersecurity Framework in securing the critical infrastructures. Executive Order 13636: Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity.

Executive Order 13800: Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure In May 2017, President Trump issued EO 13800, Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure, which was intended to focus Federal efforts on supporting "the cybersecurity risk management efforts of the owners and operators of the Nation's critical infrastructure" by securing Federal networks, encouraging collaboration with industry, strengthening the deterrence posture of the United States, and building a stronger cybersecurity workforce. One of the actions taken by Federal agencies in response to this EO was to develop implementation plans for using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. Further benefits for implementing the NIST Cybersecurity Framework follow. Potential Reductions in Cybersecurity Insurance Premiums.

Cyber Physical Systems Security "addresses cybersecurity concerns for cyber-physical systems and internet of things devices… play an increasingly important role in critical infrastructure… and everyday life". 14 Ibid., p. i. 15 Exec.

### Chip-based quantum key distribution [^49a09124]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Improvement in secure transmission of information is an urgent need for governments, corporations and individuals. Quantum key distribution (QKD) promises security based on the laws of physics and has rapidly grown from proof-of-concept to robust demonstrations and deployment of commercial systems. Despite these advances, QKD has not been widely adopted, and large-scale deployment will likely require chip-based devices for improved performance, miniaturization and enhanced functionality. Here we report low error rate, GHz clocked QKD operation of an indium phosphide transmitter chip and a silicon oxynitride receiver chip-monolithically integrated devices using components and manufacturing processes from the telecommunications industry. We use the reconfigurability of these devices to demonstrate three prominent QKD protocols-BB84, Coherent One Way and Differential Phase Shift-with performance comparable to state-of-the-art. These devices, when combined with integrated single photon detectors, pave the way for successfully integrating QKD into future telecommunications networks.

### System-level planning, coordination, and communication: care of the critically ill and injured during pandemics and disasters: CHEST consensus statement [^67a2bfcf]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

Communication leadership and systems — health-care coalition/regional health authority (HC/RHA) organizational leadership should be consistent with ICS structure or equivalent, and HC/RHAs are the most important source of accurate, real-time data and serve as information clearinghouses on locations and levels of supplies, medications, beds, personnel, and virtually all resources necessary to coordinate an effective mass critical care disaster response and interface with the media and public. Regardless of communication modalities, redundancy is important, back-up systems should always be tested and readily available, and emergency contact information should be easily and quickly accessible with multiple ways of finding personnel. Web-based or network-centric computer information systems are powerful options, and telemedicine technology may be used to improve situational awareness, assist in field triage, and augment local medical surge capacity by providing specialty expertise immediately to the scene of an event. Partners should test technologies and processes to verify that they function as planned; we suggest this be done yearly at minimum but strongly encourage partners to use them at every opportunity, from planned large-scale events and moderate surge events to disasters. Although research on emergency network communication is proposed, no defined standards exist; social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, are a powerful way to disseminate information at a stunningly rapid pace during disasters, and we suggest HC/RHAs consult with social media experts or software companies in developing strategies to use them.

### Digital health and care: emerging from pandemic times [^857cf426]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2023). High credibility.

Preparing for the next pandemic

We suggest the following strategies to improve preparedness for future pandemics. First of all, further integration of telehealth services and remote patient monitoring technologies would enable seamless continuation of services with minimal physical contact during the next pandemic. We have only just started on this journey. In particular, a thorough evaluation of these services on care processes and patient outcomes is still needed. Second, a robust and interconnected data infrastructure, enabling real-time collection, analysis and sharing of health data across NHS and social care providers would facilitate early detection of outbreaks, rapid response coordination and effective resource allocation. The NHS is making progress on this front through the Secure Data Environment programme, but there is still a long way to go. Third, learning from mistakes during the COVID-19 pandemic, AI researchers should form multidisciplinary collaborations with provider organisations, social scientists and applied health researchers to define meaningful scenarios where ML algorithms can have added benefit during a pandemic, and develop methods and tools to address those scenarios when the time comes. Fourth and finally, building sufficient trust from both the public and the care professions is essential to become a truly data-driven and knowledge-driven learning health system that is prepared for the next pandemic.

### China: concurring regulation of cross-border genomic data sharing for statist control and individual protection [^5e1773ce]. Human Genetics (2018). Low credibility.

Personal data governance concerning privacy and cybersecurity

Insofar as genomic data contains personally identifiable data (including reversibly de-identified data), it is subject to a variety of legal instruments over the processing of personal data, whose policy goals include, most importantly, safeguarding privacy and cybersecurity. Due to the lack of a general law for personal data protection as well as a common statutory definition of privacy, sectoral instruments offer remedies to data privacy that depend on and differ between contexts (e.g. consumer data and telecommunication data). The obscure border of data privacy has hindered the regime of freedom of information which could otherwise enable re-use of government information for social progress (Chen). The incoherence in privacy often leaves data users uncertain about the scope and manner of lawful data sharing. Major instruments that affect genomic data processing will be further analyzed in " Privacy ".

In addition, lawmakers have recently tended to associate data protection with "cybersecurity" which emerges as an overriding state concern. Enacted in 2016, the Cybersecurity Law is now the highest level instrument that governs data transmitted and processed online. Apart from incorporating important guarantees of data privacy, the law emphasizes "cyberspace sovereignty" and national security, imposing on data users comprehensive obligations with respect to network operation and control of data content (PRC). Article 37 has a particularly significant impact on the transfer of genomic data. It prohibits "personal information or important data collected and generated within China by critical information infrastructure operators " (emphasis added by the authors) from being stored overseas. Where necessity exists in providing such data to overseas parties, domestic operators shall undergo security assessment in accordance with the rules formulated by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) and relevant departments of the State Council. As the rules are currently pending before the State Council, it remains unclear as to whether genomic data stewards inside China fall within the scope of "critical infrastructure operator" and what security assessment measures they should comply with (Livingston and Greenleaf). Overall, the Cybersecurity Law strengthens the restriction over cross-border genomic data sharing, and its state-centric policy goals echo those underpinning the "genetic exceptionalism" licensing framework.

With the major types of regulation unravelled, the following sections review the regulatory approaches pertaining to the specific dimensions of genomic data sharing.

### System-level planning, coordination, and communication: care of the critically ill and injured during pandemics and disasters: CHEST consensus statement [^1982e0a9]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

System-level communication — foundational principles state that we suggest HC/RHAs should have secure online and/or published directories for all partners' clinical and administrative leadership with emergency contact information and current call schedules; we suggest HC/RHA's should have defined communication vehicles which may include (but are not limited to) dedicated secure health-care coalition web sites, conference call lines and teleconferencing technologies (eg, Skype, others), hospital phones (land lines and cell phones), pagers, hand-held walkie-talkies, ham radios or other similar means of communication, and telemedicine technologies such as E-ICU integrated into their disaster plans; we suggest HC/RHA partners should attempt to routinely use those agreed upon communication vehicles when working together, that all agreed upon communication vehicles should be tested on a scheduled basis with objective criteria to validate the test, that the choice of vehicles and testing may be based on likely disaster/pandemic events (Hazard Vulnerability Analyses) and/or other appropriate considerations, and we suggest developing defined disaster/pandemic plans for monitoring and leveraging popular social media during all actual or potential surge events or unusual or large scale planned or unplanned events requiring cooperation as both a means for gathering and transmitting information, as appropriate.

### Applications of digital health for public health responses to COVID-19: a systematic scoping review of artificial intelligence, telehealth and related technologies [^2bf2cbb6]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite a large number of reports describing promising AI and big data applications in the pandemic, we found that minimal investigations for patient and/or provider acceptance have been reported. This is despite numerous reports of these tools being widely applied for surveillance or interpretation of chest imaging scans for operational efficiencies in overloaded healthcare services. Furthermore, few investigations of IoT solutions have been reported despite a large number of these solutions being deployed at the population level for the monitoring of high risk patients under quarantine, such as returning travelers or contacts of confirmed cases. That said, there have been a surprisingly large number of reports regarding applications of DCs such as digital messaging communications platforms, national/organizational websites for information dissemination (1-way), or online health communities (OHCs) that facilitate discussions (2-way). These categories of reports are further detailed in Table 3 using the report assessment criteria defined in the methodology section (screening reports).

### Guiding principles for managed care arrangements for the health of newborns, infants, children, adolescents and young adults [^20c604ec]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Pediatric managed care provider networks and access — Payers should construct provider networks that offer the full range of pediatric specialty services, even if it is necessary to use other networks or contract outside of traditional service areas, even crossing state lines when necessary, and managed care plans should make every effort to offer a robust network of high-quality providers with pediatric expertise and facilities that are accessible and able to meet the diverse needs of the pediatric population they are serving. As health outcomes for children are often influenced by social determinants, many vital services, particularly for children with special health care needs, will occur outside of the traditional medical setting, and regional managed care plans should recognize that pediatric specialty services often are more geographically distant than adult focused services, increasing the need for targeted contractual arrangements as well as for long-distance coordination between primary and specialty care providers, telemedicine encounters, and transportation supports for families. For adolescents and young adults with special health care needs, an appropriate network must include adult providers able to care for complex conditions that arise in childhood or support co-management and transitions between pediatric and adult care team members, and time-efficient credentialing procedures are necessary to bring a more adequate number of professionals, such as mental health professionals, into provider networks and provider practices.

### Applications of digital health for public health responses to COVID-19: a systematic scoping review of artificial intelligence, telehealth and related technologies [^ceeeceb9]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has overwhelmed healthcare services, faced with the twin challenges in acutely meeting the medical needs of patients with COVID-19 while continuing essential services for non-COVID-19 illnesses. The need to re-invent, re-organize and transform healthcare and co-ordinate clinical services at a population level is urgent as countries that controlled initial outbreaks start to experience resurgences. A wide range of digital health solutions have been proposed, although the extent of successful real-world applications of these technologies is unclear. This study aims to review applications of artificial intelligence (AI), telehealth, and other relevant digital health solutions for public health responses in the healthcare operating environment amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic scoping review was performed to identify potentially relevant reports. Key findings include a large body of evidence for various clinical and operational applications of telehealth (40.1%, n = 99/247). Although a large quantity of reports investigated applications of artificial intelligence (AI) (44.9%, n = 111/247) and big data analytics (36.0%, n = 89/247), weaknesses in study design limit generalizability and translation, highlighting the need for more pragmatic real-world investigations. There were also few descriptions of applications for the internet of things (IoT) (2.0%, n = 5/247), digital platforms for communication (DC) (10.9%, 27/247), digital solutions for data management (DM) (1.6%, n = 4/247), and digital structural screening (DS) (8.9%, n = 22/247); representing gaps and opportunities for digital public health. Finally, the performance of digital health technology for operational applications related to population surveillance and points of entry have not been adequately evaluated.

### Delivering urgent care using telemedicine: insights from experienced clinicians at academic medical centers [^7341cf4c]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Care delivered using telemedicine — virtual visits connecting patients and clinicians through videoconferencing — has been steadily growing in the USA but represented a small fraction of overall visits as few clinicians were historically offering telemedicine to their patients. In March 2020, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic resulted in federal and state de-regulation of telemedicine policies to help facilitate health care's accelerated shift towards telemedicine to prevent viral spread and maintain access to care for patients where in-person outpatient practices were limiting who could be seen in-person. –

The monumental transition of the US health care system towards telemedicine has been and will continue being a challenge for clinicians. A national survey of chief executive officers of US health care systems indicated that 38% of health systems had no digital health strategy in 2019. Even in health systems with digital health strategies, greater investments in technology infrastructure will be required to support clinicians with higher volumes of telemedicine visits, local information technology (IT) expertise to support their ongoing technical needs, and clinicians will need to develop proficiencies and clinical skills when caring for patients using telemedicine. While not all clinicians have historically used telemedicine, some academic medical centers have clinicians who adopted telemedicine early on. Understanding how experienced clinicians have practiced telemedicine can inform how we train and support clinicians who adopt telemedicine into if they are to provide high-quality, safe, and evidence-based care.

The objective of this study was to identify barriers and facilitators to providing effective, high-quality urgent care using telemedicine ("tele-urgent care") from the perspective of clinicians experienced in telemedicine.

### Physical distancing with social connectedness [^d93fff7d]. Annals of Family Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In light of concerns over the potential detrimental effects of declining care continuity, and the need for connection between patients and health care providers, our multidisciplinary group considered the possible ways that relationships might be developed in different kinds of health care encounters. We were surprised to discover many avenues to invest in relationships, even in non-continuity consultations, and how meaningful human connections might be developed even in telehealth visits. Opportunities range from the quality of attention or the structure of the time during the visit, to supporting relationship development in how care is organized at the local or system level and in the use of digital encounters. These ways of investing in relationships can exhibit different manifestations and emphases during different kinds of visits, but most are available during all kinds of encounters. Recognizing and supporting the many ways of investing in relationships has great potential to create a positive sea change in a health care system that currently feels fragmented and depersonalized to both patients and health care clinicians. The current COVID-19 pandemic is full of opportunity to use remote communication to develop healing human relationships. What we need in a pandemic is not social distancing, but physical distancing with social connectedness.

System-level communication — foundational principles — We suggest HC/RHAs should have secure online and/or published directories for all partners' clinical and administrative leadership, with emergency contact information (phone numbers, e-mail addresses, pagers, cell phone texting preferences, other means) and current call schedules. We suggest HC/RHA's should have defined communication vehicles which may include (but are not limited to): dedicated secure health-care coalition web sites; conference call lines and teleconferencing technologies (eg, Skype, others); hospital phones (land lines as well as cell phones); pagers, hand-held walkie-talkies, ham radios, or other similar means of communication; telemedicine technologies, such as E-ICU; integrated into their disaster plans. We suggest HC/RHA partners should attempt to routinely use those agreed upon communication vehicles when working together. We suggest all agreed upon communication vehicles should be tested on a scheduled basis, with objective criteria to validate the test. We suggest the choice of communication vehicles and testing may be based on likely disaster/pandemic events (Hazard Vulnerability Analyses), and/or other appropriate considerations. We suggest developing defined disaster/pandemic plans for monitoring and leveraging popular social media (eg, Twitter, Facebook, others) during all actual or potential surge events, or unusual or large scale planned or unplanned events requiring cooperation, as both a means for gathering and transmitting information, as appropriate. We suggest HC/RHAs should have defined communication tools designated for each level of organizational leadership, which should be consistent with ICS structure or equivalent.

### Digital ≠ paperless: novel interfaces needed to address global health challenges [^706b4eaa]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Going 'paperless' is hard

When the decision to use information technology is made, 'going digital' is commonly equated with 'going paperless'. Going paperless is challenging, especially for healthcare delivery in resource limited settings. Two important hurdles to digital (including mobile) health in LMICs stand out: (a) costs and complexities around infrastructure (not only of devices like computers/tablets/phones, but also backup power systems, networking, support, maintenance and procurement), and (b) costs and complexities around training (of diverse health system actors, often repeatedly, on complex hardware, software and workflows). Beyond these challenges, the shift to direct digital data entry at the point of care has a negative impact on both patient and provider satisfaction with the interaction. These are under-valued aspects of quality beyond technical skill, as time taken for direct digital data entry replaces time for direct patient–provider conversation and aspects like eye contact and non-verbal observation.

### Digital proximity tracing on empirical contact networks for pandemic control [^6244feb1]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Fig. 3
Policies based on distance and duration.

(a): The signal strength threshold T p and the duration threshold T d defining the policies are reported. Contacts with a duration larger than T d and signal strength larger than T p are considered at risk. The last column gives the fraction of the total number of interactions of the CNS data set that they correspond to. A larger value of the magnitude of the signal strength tends to correspond to a larger distance, such that in the second column the thresholds go from the least to the most restrictive policy. The policies are sketched in (b).

We remark that the policies implement distance detection directly as a measure of the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values, since a precise and reliable conversion to an actual distance is a notoriously difficult task, that would only add a layer of uncertainty to our analysis, without any gain in terms of accuracy. It is in general true that weak signal strengths correspond to large distances between users and vice versa but the link between RSSI and actual distance is affected by multiple factors, from the smartphone brand to the presence of obstacles between devices, and more.

### Cybersecurity in PACS and medical imaging: an overview [^468e3430]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Cybersecurity in PACS and Medical Imaging

While there is a large number of publications discussing the cybersecurity requirements of information technology in healthcare in general, the number of publications that specifically discusses security requirements of PACS and medical imaging is much smaller, and many of the publications available focus on the security requirements for the exchange of medical images over public networks, e.g. in the context of teleradiology/telemedicine applications or Electronic Health Records (EHR). Strickland discusses the risks associated with the deployment and operation of filmless PACS, although not focused on cybersecurity. Desjardins et al. provide an overview of cybersecurity issues related to DICOM and derive recommendations for radiologists, IT staff, and standards bodies. Ruotsalainen discusses requirements for trustworthy teleradiology models, focusing on organizational aspects. These requirements include "a common security policy that covers all partners and entities, common security and privacy protection principles and requirements, controlled contracts between partners, and the use of security controls and tools that supporting the common security policy. The security and privacy protection of any teleradiology system must be planned in advance, and the necessary security and privacy enhancing tools should be selected based on the risk analysis and requirements set by the legislation." Gutiérrez-Martínez et al. discuss how to implement an information security management system for a large-scale PACS in accordance with ISO/IEC 27002:2013. Finally, a recent NIST publication proposes a reference architecture for a secure PACS using commercially available, standards-based tools and technologies, including segmented network zones, authentication and access control, and a holistic risk management approach. The publications discussed below each present individual "building blocks" for a secure storage or exchange of medical images.

### Modernizing and designing evaluation frameworks for connected sensor technologies in medicine [^d30be0f5]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Operationalizing and deploying a connected sensor technology evaluation framework

An evaluation framework is an intellectual exercise until it is put into practice. In this section, we outline several pathways for operationalizing the framework we describe in this manuscript. We anticipate roles for regulators such as FDA, standards bodies like Xcertia and IEEE, and those who develop GxP processes for connected sensor technologies. We also need to have better communication infrastructure to make information more accessible to the stakeholders who evaluate and deploy these technologies, the patients, doctors, software engineers and so on.

The technique of labeling has been deployed as a communication tool for complex products in healthcare. Prescription drug labels communicate essential, science-based information to healthcare professionals. Nutrition labels communicate essential, easy-to-read information for consumers managing their diets. Labels are critical pieces of infrastructure that provide transparency and clarity for life-critical products. Efforts to improve Internet of Things (IoT) security transparency has the attention of the multiple government entities. In the United States Congress, the Cyber Shield Act has been proposed, which includes labeling elements to help consumers review the security features of devices they're buying; the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is exploring transparency tools such as product packaging labels and consumer-facing websites; the United Kingdom government has developed labeling proposals and researched consumer perceptions. Outside of governments, several more security and data-rights focused labels have been proposed such as Privacy and Security Nutrition Label for Smart Devices, Symantec's IoT label, the Data Transparency Label, and the Patient Privacy Rights Information Governance Label, as well as efforts to make a cybersecurity "Energy Star". These types of labels create a visual representation for metrics like the type of data collected, retention period, update capabilities (e.g. automatic), and authentication methods, making it easier for less technical consumers to understand important features and gaps in a product.

### Sustaining the internet with hyperbolic mapping [^0df34fd7]. Nature Communications (2010). Medium credibility.

The Internet infrastructure is severely stressed. Rapidly growing overheads associated with the primary function of the Internet-routing information packets between any two computers in the world-cause concerns among Internet experts that the existing Internet routing architecture may not sustain even another decade. In this paper, we present a method to map the Internet to a hyperbolic space. Guided by a constructed map, which we release with this paper, Internet routing exhibits scaling properties that are theoretically close to the best possible, thus resolving serious scaling limitations that the Internet faces today. Besides this immediate practical viability, our network mapping method can provide a different perspective on the community structure in complex networks.

### Globally networked risks and how to respond [^31c3f16b]. Nature (2013). Excellent credibility.

Today's strongly connected, global networks have produced highly interdependent systems that we do not understand and cannot control well. These systems are vulnerable to failure at all scales, posing serious threats to society, even when external shocks are absent. As the complexity and interaction strengths in our networked world increase, man-made systems can become unstable, creating uncontrollable situations even when decision-makers are well-skilled, have all data and technology at their disposal, and do their best. To make these systems manageable, a fundamental redesign is needed. A 'Global Systems Science' might create the required knowledge and paradigm shift in thinking.

### Transparent sharing of digital health data: a call to action [^545b2e3c]. Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Digital health — definition, categories, and data location are outlined as follows: "Digital health can be defined as the convergence between health care and emerging digital technologies that acquire, collect, manipulate, and share health data," spanning terms such as mHealth, wireless health, big data, quantified self, wearable computing, telehealth, body computing, precision medicine, and personalized medicine. Technologies "may be divided into" physician‑facing, patient/consumer‑facing, or centered on patient‑physician communication, with physician‑facing data (for example, CIEDs and medical‑grade wearable cardiac monitors) residing "within the traditional closed-loop medical establishment infrastructure," whereas patient/consumer‑facing data "reside primarily with the individual, to be shared as needed with health care providers." Consequently, "the challenges of sharing digital health data… are fundamentally different," and cardiac electrophysiology "is among the first domains of medicine to face both the opportunity and the challenges" under this paradigm, while issues like "privacy, security, and reimbursement" are noted as beyond the document's scope.

HIPAA, PHI, and PII — the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), Public Law 104–191, is a law enacted August 21, 1996, and Sections 261 through 264 of HIPAA require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to publicize standards for the electronic exchange, privacy, and security of health information. Protected health information (PHI) includes sensitive individually identifiable health information relating to an individual's past, present, or future healthcare status, treatment for health conditions, and payment for treatments maintained by HIPAA-covered entities and business associates in any form or medium. Personally identifiable information (PII) refers more broadly to data that may be used to identify an individual and includes data that is not considered PHI and therefore is not subject to HIPAA, with organizations including National Institute of Standards and Technology [NIST], the European General Data Protection Regulation [GDPR], and the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act [PIPEDA] offering in-depth definitions and examples.

### Digital technologies in the public-health response to COVID-19 [^574a6f4f]. Nature Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Digital technologies are being harnessed to support the public-health response to COVID-19 worldwide, including population surveillance, case identification, contact tracing and evaluation of interventions on the basis of mobility data and communication with the public. These rapid responses leverage billions of mobile phones, large online datasets, connected devices, relatively low-cost computing resources and advances in machine learning and natural language processing. This Review aims to capture the breadth of digital innovations for the public-health response to COVID-19 worldwide and their limitations, and barriers to their implementation, including legal, ethical and privacy barriers, as well as organizational and workforce barriers. The future of public health is likely to become increasingly digital, and we review the need for the alignment of international strategies for the regulation, evaluation and use of digital technologies to strengthen pandemic management, and future preparedness for COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.

### Mobile technologies to support healthcare provider to healthcare provider communication and management of care [^f1edb58e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Certainty of the evidence

The included randomised trials were mostly at low or unclear risk of selection bias. We downgraded the evidence for almost all of the outcomes due to a high risk of performance bias, and almost half of the trials were also at risk of detection, attrition, and reporting biases. We also downgraded some of the evidence for imprecision, due to the relatively small size of the trials. Our confidence in the effect estimates overall is moderate, although due to the relatively low number of trials, different uses of mHealth interventions and small numbers of participants recruited there is a possibility that the estimate of the effect is substantially different.

Potential biases in the review process

We limited the risk of publication bias by conducting a comprehensive literature search of different databases, including published articles, clinical trials registries and unpublished mHealth evidence. The WHO issued a call for papers through popular digital health communities of practice to identify additional primary trials as well as grey literature, all of which have contributed to limit publication bias. Two review authors screened records, extracted data and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE, with discussion with the author team whenever there were any discrepancies.

### Engagement and education: care of the critically ill and injured during pandemics and disasters: CHEST consensus statement [^3af83e75]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

CHEST consensus — communication and information systems for ICU disaster care summarize the following suggestions: We suggest integrated communication systems and a robust infrastructure of the electronic health record system. We suggest, when power is intact, virtual ICUs, point-of-care testing, portable monitoring systems with Global Positioning System, and telemedicine facilitate transfer and sharing of clinical information. We suggest aggregated essential clinical information be included with other key ICU logistical communication so that bidirectional transfer of information permits a consistent delivery of health care across the spectrum. We suggest public health/government officials at centralized or regional emergency management coordinating centers use expert medical guidance, such as burn, neuro, or trauma critical care, specific to the nature of the incident to inform decision-making for mass critical care delivery.

### Digital tracking, provider decision support systems, and targeted client communication via mobile devices to improve primary health care [^0ad89a60]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Quality of the evidence

Many of the studies in this review were cluster‐randomised controlled trials with large sample sizes. However, many of the outcomes were from single studies, resulting in downgrading the evidence for imprecision. A few outcomes could be pooled, but these had high levels of heterogeneity; for example, they were measured over different periods of time. As a result, most outcomes were assessed as being either moderate or low‐certainty evidence. Five outcomes were based on single non‐randomised studies and smaller sample sizes and were downgraded for risk of bias, imprecision and indirectness. As a result, these were assessed to be of very low certainty.

Potential biases in the review process

We tried to minimise bias in the review process in several ways: two or three review authors independently assessed eligibility for inclusion, carried out data extraction, assessed the risk of bias in the trials and assessed the GRADE evidence certainty. During meta‐analysis, we adjusted for clustering rather than for confounders, because it was not possible to adjust for both factors based on the available information, and we placed more importance on clustering.

### Digital proximity tracing on empirical contact networks for pandemic control [^e75e3540]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

As of mid-January 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over 85 million detected cases worldwide, overwhelming the healthcare capacities of many countries and thus presenting extraordinary challenges for governments and societies. Rigorous restrictions such as lockdowns and quarantine have proven to be effective in many countries as a measure to curb the spread of COVID-19, limit contagions and reduce the effective reproductive number. Many areas slowly started to lift the restrictions, but new outbreaks appeared again, arriving in waves as anticipated by several early models. An effective and affordable long-term plan is required, since the fraction of the population that has been infected is still far too low to provide herd immunity.

Despite their efficacy, large-scale quarantine and lockdown strategies carry large costs. Moreover, in a situation where most of the population is not infected, population-wide lockdowns are far from optimal, and interventions at smaller scale, selectively targeting individuals at higher risk of spreading the disease, are more desirable.

### Research centers collaborative network workshop on digital health approaches to research in aging [^f80c367d]. Innovation in Aging (2024). Medium credibility.

Translational Significance: Digital health technologies present opportunities and challenges to the care of older adults. These tools can extend care into the home and guide decision making based on data collected in the context in which people live. Conversely, how best to design these tools to meet the needs and preferences of older adults and those who care for them, and how to leverage data produced via digital health technologies to guide care remain key challenges. This article summarizes discussion arising from a workshop on digital health approaches to research in aging and provides recommendations for clinical care and future research.

Digital health is ubiquitous within the healthcare landscape, a phenomenon accelerated by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Digital health can be understood as the field of knowledge and practice associated with the development and use of digital technologies to improve health. This definition encompasses the terms eHealth and mHealth, where eHealth describes the provision of health services via information and communication technology, and often the term is used to describe internet- or computer-delivered services. mHealth refers specifically to the use of mobile technologies, and is commonly used to describe health-oriented smartphone or tablet applications. Digital health further describes other uses of digital technology to support health, using technologies as diverse as machine learning and big data analytics to the "internet of things." These tools offer daily or even within-day insight into important psychological, social, and physical determinants of health, and they extend the reach of traditionally center-based behavior change programming into the home.

### Business and continuity of operations: care of the critically ill and injured during pandemics and disasters: CHEST consensus statement [^99888fa3]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

Information technology/information priorities — during disasters when hospital infrastructures are damaged or otherwise unavailable, "we suggest planning and preparing for a portable mobile-support information network." Wireless local area networks are suggested, as they may be less vulnerable to damage, can be used for monitoring patients and for high-speed data applications, and are capable of supporting most portable or handheld hardware; cellular-based solutions may be less preferred, as cellular networks are not available in all circumstances. As an implementation example, after the Haiti earthquake in 2010 a field hospital using a wireless local area network powered by gas generators was operational within 6 h after arrival; a wired network was added within 48 h and was capable of managing data-intensive applications. Generators may maintain electrical power even under extreme circumstances, but plans for alternative power sources should include sufficient battery power, or possibly even solar power, and in any dire circumstance, providing available power for immediate clinical needs must be balanced with the benefit of maintaining a functioning information network. Patient identity and tracking may be done using paper bar-coded or electronic tags or depend on mobile provider handheld technology and can be used to electronically input patient data and used for tracking, and other portable information technology (IT) software applications are available, are faster than paper in entering patient information completely and accurately, and are effective for patient monitoring and tracking and useful for improving initial triage functions.

### System-level planning, coordination, and communication: care of the critically ill and injured during pandemics and disasters: CHEST consensus statement [^0c3f8e21]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

HC/RHAs and networks — transfer oversight, regional partners, and bed awareness: 6a. We suggest during a disaster requiring transfer of patients, whether from emergency medicine departments or inpatient areas, transferring partners may have initial choice of where patients are referred based on traditional referral patterns, but HC/RHA leadership must oversee this process and be able to intercede as both a resource and with the authority to redirect transfers based on anticipated or actual events, and defined health-care coalition coordination processes and transfer resources should be planned and identified ahead of time. 6b. Health-care coalitions should designate neighboring health-care coalitions as potential partners during a contingency or crisis event and have readily available leadership contact information and knowledge of these potential partners' size and capabilities. Hospitals commonly transfer and receive patients along an informal yet structured network based on geographic proximity of services, with more-resourced hospitals tending to receive more referrals, and approximately 4.5% of Medicare patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) ultimately undergo an interhospital critical care transfer. During a major disaster or pandemic, HC/RHA leadership needs to access knowledge of all regional ICU and hospital beds quickly.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need to prioritise mature digital health and data governance at both national and supranational levels to guarantee future health security. The Riyadh Declaration on Digital Healthwas formulated during the Riyadh Global Digital Health Summit, a landmark forum held in 2020 that highlighted the importance of digital technology, data and innovation for resilient global health and care systems. At the summit, a panel of 13 experts articulated 7 key priorities and 9 recommendations (box 1) for data and digital health that need to be adopted by the global health community to address future pandemics and health threats.

Box 1
Recommendations from the Riyadh Global Digital Health Summit

Implement data-driven and evidence-based protocols for clear and effective communication with common messaging to build citizens' trust.
Work with global stakeholders to confront propagation of misinformation or disinformation through social media platforms and mass media.
Implement a standard global minimum dataset for public health data reporting and a data governance structure tailored to communicable diseases.
Ensure countries prioritise digital health, particularly, improving digital health infrastructure and reaching digital maturity.
Enable health and care organisations by providing the necessary technology to collect high-quality data in a timely way and promote sharing to create health intelligence.
Cultivate a health and care workforce with the knowledge, skills and training in data and digital technologies required to address current and future public health challenges.
Ensure surveillance systems combine an effective public health response with respect for ethical and privacy principles.
Develop digital personal tools and services to support comprehensive health programmes (in disease prevention, testing, management and vaccination) globally.
Maintain, continue to fund and innovate surveillance systems as a core component of the connected global health system for rapid preparedness and optimal global responses.

### International perspectives on measuring national digital public health system maturity through a multidisciplinary Delphi study [^db4dc8dc]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Indicators on information-communication-technology requirements

ICT-system maturity is crucial for the success of a national DiPH service rollout. Without a sufficient broadband network in the country (especially in rural areas), potential users might be unable to access the system. This digital divide could potentially increase health inequalities, and is, therefore, essential when assessing the maturity degree of DiPH systems as a core requirement. Our participants also proposed multiple indicators to determine the general ICT-system maturity (like prices for and availability of broadband internet connections) and financial support to improve the sector. Additionally, the experts emphasized the need for indicators that bring together the healthcare and the ICT sectors through indicators on physician offices with Internet connections, training in DiPH, or the use of electronic documentation systems in hospitals. All ICT indicators with at least 70% importance agreement during R3 are displayed in Table 2.

Table 2
ICT indicators that reached the needed agreement in the third panel

Indicators on the legal regulation and political support

Several validated assessment tools for digital health regulation exist. However, currently none for DiPH. Nevertheless, as digital health (focusing on personalized healthcare) is a sub-dimension of the more holistic DiPH, we argue that the validated digital health regulation indicators might be applicable to some aspects of the developed DiPH indicators. Unsurprisingly, most indicators proposed through the panel assess health data's access, exchange, and security, which were also of interest for various validated indices (see Table 3). The global increase in the creation and use of health-related data holds promise for evidence-based and data-driven DiPH programs. However, poor data protection regulations pose a risk to individual users of data breaches or misuse. Therefore, countries must implement strong data governance structures and offer political support to protect these sensitive data from being misused. This importance is mirrored in the expert agreement for the need for a legal framework in DiPH data exchange and regulations for accessing health data through EHRs (both received 100% agreement).
