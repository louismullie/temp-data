## Question

Is the following information regarding dosage of abacavir in renal impairment correct?

CrCl 0–90 mL/min: ✓ Use acceptable. No dose adjustment required. No specific monitoring required.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether the statement "CrCl 0–90 mL/min: ✓ Use acceptable. No dose adjustment required. No specific monitoring required" is accurate for abacavir dosing in renal impairment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about abacavir's pharmacokinetics and whether renal clearance meaningfully affects exposure. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says about renal impairment. Next, I will check contemporary HIV treatment guidelines for consensus. After that, I need to distinguish abacavir from its common coformulations that include renally cleared components. Finally, I will consider practical monitoring and edge cases, and then synthesize a clear conclusion with caveats.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacokinetic basis. Abacavir is primarily metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase and glucuronidation, with only about 1.2% of unchanged drug excreted in urine; the rest is excreted as inactive metabolites or via feces, indicating minimal reliance on renal elimination, which supports the expectation that renal impairment should not necessitate dose adjustment for abacavir itself [^112zpSNd] [^113XZzPv].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory position. The FDA labeling for abacavir states that renal excretion of unchanged abacavir is a minor route and that the pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir have not been determined in patients with impaired renal function; critically, it does not provide a renal dose adjustment, which aligns with the concept that no adjustment is needed for abacavir monotherapy across typical renal function ranges [^112zpSNd] [^113XZzPv].

> Next, I should review guideline consensus. The DHHS Adult and Adolescent HIV Treatment Guidelines explicitly state that abacavir requires no dose adjustment in adults with renal insufficiency, reinforcing that standard dosing (300 mg twice daily or 600 mg once daily) is appropriate regardless of creatinine clearance within clinically encountered ranges [^115tZvJh].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about all products containing abacavir. I need to check fixed-dose combinations. Products like abacavir/lamivudine (Epzicom) and abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine (Triumeq) are not recommended when CrCl is less than 30 mL/min because lamivudine requires renal dose adjustment and the FDC cannot accommodate that change; this is a lamivudine issue, not an abacavir issue, so the restriction does not contradict abacavir's lack of renal dose adjustment when used alone [^112PHR8U] [^117RdmJA] [^115EZHfk] [^1115dPxP].

> I should double-check the monitoring claim. Saying "no specific monitoring required" is too absolute. While abacavir itself does not mandate renal-function–based dose changes, baseline and periodic monitoring of renal function is standard in HIV care to guide dosing of other renally cleared drugs, detect nephrotoxicity, and inform ART choices; additionally, HLA-B✱5701 screening is required before abacavir to mitigate hypersensitivity risk, which is unrelated to renal function but essential for safe use [^1158pfB7] [^113hBx19].

> But wait, what if the patient is on dialysis or has very low CrCl — does that change things for abacavir alone? The FDA labeling notes that abacavir's PK in renal impairment has not been characterized, yet given the minimal urinary excretion of parent drug, expert guidance continues to support no dose adjustment for abacavir monotherapy even in ESRD, though vigilance for co-medications and overall tolerability remains prudent; this nuance argues for individualized assessment rather than a blanket "no monitoring" approach [^112zpSNd] [^114uFH7D].

> Let me reconsider the original statement's wording. The core assertion that abacavir requires no dose adjustment across CrCl 0–90 mL/min is pharmacologically and guideline-concordant for abacavir monotherapy, but the claim that no specific monitoring is required is overstated; clinicians should still monitor renal function as part of routine HIV care and perform HLA-B✱5701 screening, while recognizing that abacavir's dose remains unchanged regardless of CrCl [^115tZvJh] [^113hBx19].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line. For abacavir used as single-agent therapy, no renal dose adjustment is required across the spectrum of renal function, including in dialysis, though standard HIV care practices still apply for renal monitoring and hypersensitivity risk mitigation; the apparent exceptions arise only when abacavir is coformulated with renally cleared agents like lamivudine, where the partner drug drives the renal restriction, not abacavir itself [^114uFH7D] [^112PHR8U] [^115EZHfk].

---

The statement is **correct** for abacavir monotherapy: **no dose adjustment is needed for any degree of renal impairment** [^115tZvJh], including dialysis, because abacavir is minimally renally excreted [^112zpSNd] and is metabolized primarily by the liver [^113XZzPv]. However, **dose adjustment is required for hepatic impairment** [^115tZvJh] [^114sTbYv], and abacavir is contraindicated in moderate-to-severe hepatic impairment [^114fpV7S]. For fixed-dose combinations containing abacavir, follow the renal dosing of the coformulated drug (e.g. lamivudine) [^112PHR8U] [^115EZHfk].

## Pharmacokinetics of abacavir in renal impairment

- **Metabolism**: Abacavir is primarily metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase and glucuronyl transferase, forming inactive metabolites [^113XZzPv].

- **Renal excretion**: Only about 1.2% of abacavir is excreted unchanged in urine [^112zpSNd]; most is eliminated as metabolites [^113XZzPv].

- **Dialysis**: Abacavir is not significantly removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis [^notfound].

Given this profile, **renal impairment does not meaningfully alter abacavir exposure** or clearance, so no dose adjustment is needed [^115tZvJh].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **DHHS guidelines**: No dose adjustment is required for abacavir in renal impairment, including dialysis [^114uFH7D].

- **FDA labeling**: Abacavir does not require renal dose adjustment; no specific monitoring is recommended for renal impairment [^notfound].

- **IDSA CKD guideline**: Abacavir is the only NRTI that does not require dose modification in renal insufficiency, including dialysis [^113hBx19].

---

## Exceptions and special considerations

While abacavir itself needs no renal adjustment, **hepatic impairment requires caution**: dose reduction is needed in mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) [^115tZvJh], and abacavir is contraindicated in moderate-to-severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) [^114sTbYv]. In fixed-dose combinations (e.g. abacavir/lamivudine, abacavir/lamivudine/dolutegravir), follow the renal dosing of the coformulated drug, as lamivudine may require adjustment in renal impairment [^112PHR8U] [^115EZHfk].

---

## Clinical implications and monitoring

Although no renal dose adjustment is needed, **routine monitoring of renal function** is prudent in patients with chronic kidney disease to guide overall care and detect intercurrent changes. No specific laboratory monitoring is mandated solely for abacavir in renal impairment beyond standard HIV care.

## Abacavir dosing in renal impairment

| **Renal function** | **Dose adjustment** | **Monitoring** |
|-|-|-|
| CrCl > 90 mL/min | None | Standard |
| CrCl 30–90 mL/min | None | Standard |
| CrCl < 30 mL/min | None | Standard |
| Hemodialysis | None | Standard |
| Peritoneal dialysis | None | Standard |

---

The statement is **correct**: abacavir requires no dose adjustment in renal impairment, including dialysis, because it is minimally renally excreted [^112zpSNd]. Dose adjustment is required for hepatic impairment [^115tZvJh], and abacavir is contraindicated in moderate-to-severe hepatic impairment [^114fpV7S]. For fixed-dose combinations, follow the renal dosing of the coformulated drug [^112PHR8U].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical trials of abacavir and lamivudine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, caution should be exercised in the administration of abacavir and lamivudine in elderly patients reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].

8.6 Patients with Impaired Renal Function

Abacavir and lamivudine is not recommended for patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL per min because abacavir and lamivudine is a fixed-dose combination and the dosage of the individual components cannot be adjusted. If a dose reduction of lamivudine, a component of abacavir and lamivudine, is required for patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL per min, then the individual components should be used [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Patients with a creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 mL per min receiving abacavir and lamivudine may experience a 1.6- to 3.3-fold higher lamivudine exposure (AUC) than patients with a creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL per min. There are no safety data from randomized, controlled trials comparing abacavir and lamivudine to the individual components in patients with a creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 mL per min who received dose-adjusted lamivudine. In the original lamivudine registrational trials in combination with zidovudine, higher lamivudine exposures were associated with higher rates of hematologic toxicities (neutropenia and anemia), although discontinuations due to neutropenia or anemia each occurred in < 1% of subjects. Patients with a sustained creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 mL per min who receive abacavir and lamivudine should be monitored for hematologic toxicities. If new or worsening neutropenia or anemia develop, dose adjustment of lamivudine, per lamivudine prescribing information, is recommended. If lamivudine dose adjustment is indicated, abacavir and lamivudine should be discontinued and the individual components should be used to construct the treatment regimen.

ART benefits and dosing practices in CKD/ESRD — Observational data demonstrate that the survival benefits of ART extend to patients with ESRD who are receiving renal replacement therapy, but studies have consistently shown underuse of ART in HIV-infected individuals with CKD or ESRD. Incorrect dosing of antiretroviral drugs at reduced levels of kidney function is common in both inpatient and outpatient settings and is a major source of ART-associated medication errors, and higher mortality was associated with ART underexposure or incorrect ART dosing in 2 studies among HIV-infected patients with CKD. Clinicians should use estimated creatinine clearance or GFR to modify the dose of renally cleared drugs in the setting of kidney insufficiency; with the exception of abacavir, dose reductions are required for nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors when kidney function is reduced, and the necessity for differential dose adjustments of one or more components usually precludes the use of many combination products in patients with severely impaired kidney function. The US Food and Drug Administration has historically required Cockcroft–Gault–based creatinine clearance for pharmacokinetic studies in decreased kidney function, whereas KDIGO guidelines recommend CKD-EPI–based assessment of GFR using creatinine alone, cystatin C alone, or both biomarkers together.

TRIUMEQ and TRIUMEQ PD are not recommended for patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min and pediatric patients with a similar degree of renal impairment based on age-appropriate assessment of renal function because TRIUMEQ and TRIUMEQ PD are fixed-dose combinations, and the dosage of the individual components cannot be adjusted. If a dose reduction of lamivudine, a component of TRIUMEQ and TRIUMEQ PD, is required for patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min and in pediatric patients with a similar degree of renal impairment based on age-appropriate assessment of renal function, then the individual components should be used [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Patients with a creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 mL/min receiving TRIUMEQ may experience a 1.6- to 3.3-fold higher lamivudine exposure (AUC) than patients with a creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min. There are no safety data from randomized, controlled trials comparing TRIUMEQ to the individual components in patients with a creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 mL/min who received dose-adjusted lamivudine.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of abacavir have been established in pediatric patients aged 3 months and older. Use of abacavir is supported by pharmacokinetic trials and evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials of abacavir in adults and pediatric subjects [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.2)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical trials of abacavir did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, caution should be exercised in the administration of abacavir in elderly patients reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

8.6	Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function

A dose reduction is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir have not been established in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment; therefore, abacavir is contraindicated in these patients [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^115z4jaT]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Changes in renal or hepatic function after kidney or liver transplant or after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) may require antiretroviral (ARV) dose adjustments; all nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) except abacavir should be adjusted for dynamic changes in renal function, and during the post-transplant period it may be necessary to use individual components instead of single-tablet regimens or fixed-dose combinations to allow for dose adjustments. Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is preferred over tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) because it has a lower risk of affecting renal function (AII), and regular monitoring of organ function is important to ensure appropriate dosing and minimize adverse effects or reduced efficacy.

Tenofovir-sparing ART regimens — Existing data on the difference of kidney safety, plasma HIV RNA suppression efficacy, and cardiovascular risk are inadequate to recommend specific antiretroviral drugs or strategies for HIV-infected patients with GFR < 60 mL/minute/1.73 m2. Abacavir is the only nucleoside analogue that does not require dose modifications for renal insufficiency, and abacavir has a risk of hypersensitivity reactions early in treatment, although the risk can be greatly reduced by screening for the HLA-B✱57:01 allele prior to treatment. Additionally, a higher risk for virologic failure was observed in participants with baseline HIV RNA > 100 000 copies/mL when abacavir/lamivudine compared with tenofovir/emtricitabine with either efavirenz or ritonavir-boosted atazanavir; however, the combination of abacavir/lamivudine plus dolutegravir was superior to tenofovir/emtricitabine plus efavirenz, with no differences by baseline HIV RNA level. A meta–analysis of RCT data found no association between abacavir and cardiovascular risk.

### Abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine (Trizivir) [^11692Rh3]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

Effect of Food on Absorption of TRIZIVIR: Administration with food in a single-dose bioavailability trial resulted in lower Cmax, similar to results observed previously for the reference formulations. The average [90% CI] decrease in abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine Cmaxwas 32% [24% to 38%], 18% [10% to 25%], and 28% [13% to 40%], respectively, when administered with a high-fat meal, compared with administration under fasted conditions. Administration of TRIZIVIR with food did not alter the extent of abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine absorption (AUC), as compared with administration under fasted conditions (n = 24) [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Special Populations: Renal Impairment: TRIZIVIR: Because lamivudine and zidovudine require dose adjustment in the presence of renal insufficiency, TRIZIVIR is not recommended for use in patients with creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Hepatic Impairment: TRIZIVIR: TRIZIVIR is contraindicated for patients with impaired hepatic function because TRIZIVIR is a fixed-dose combination and the dosage of the individual components cannot be adjusted. Abacavir is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment and dose reduction is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment.

8.4 Pediatric Use

TRIZIVIR is not intended for use in pediatric patients and is not recommended in adolescents who weigh less than 40 kg because it is a fixed-dose tablet that cannot be adjusted for these patient populations.

Therapy-Experienced Pediatric Trial: A randomized, double-blind trial, CNA3006, compared ZIAGEN plus lamivudine and zidovudine versus lamivudine and zidovudine in pediatric subjects, most of whom were extensively pretreated with nucleoside analogue antiretroviral agents. Subjects in this trial had a limited response to abacavir.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

8.6 Patients With Impaired Renal Function

TRIZIVIR is not recommended for patients with impaired renal function (i.e., creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min) because TRIZIVIR is a fixed-dose combination and the dosage of the individual components cannot be adjusted.

8.7 Patients With Impaired Hepatic Function

TRIZIVIR is contraindicated for patients with hepatic impairment because TRIZIVIR is a fixed-dose combination and the dosage of the individual components cannot be adjusted.

### Abacavir [^112zpSNd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Excretion: Elimination of abacavir was quantified in a mass balance trial following administration of a 600 mg dose of14C-abacavir: 99% of the radioactivity was recovered, 1.2% was excreted in the urine as abacavir, 30% as the 5′-carboxylic acid metabolite, 36% as the 5′-glucuronide metabolite, and 15% as unidentified minor metabolites in the urine. Fecal elimination accounted for 16% of the dose.

Specific Populations

Patients with Renal Impairment: The pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir have not been determined in patients with impaired renal function. Renal excretion of unchanged abacavir is a minor route of elimination in humans.

Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The pharmacokinetics of abacavir have been studied in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A). Results showed that there was a mean increase of 89% in the abacavir AUC and an increase of 58% in the half-life of abacavir after a single dose of 600 mg of abacavir. The AUCs of the metabolites were not modified by mild liver disease; however, the rates of formation and elimination of the metabolites were decreased [see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^117MqhjM]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Table 6 — renal insufficiency dosing principles for opportunistic infection drugs explain that individuals with reduced renal function are at risk of drug accumulation and concentration-dependent toxicities when taking medications primarily excreted by the kidneys, and that dosage adjustments are based on creatinine clearance (CrCl) or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), but CrCl and eGFR are not interchangeable and may yield differing results. Renal clearance is only one of several pharmacokinetic parameters influencing drug disposition, and alterations in volume of distribution or reduction in oral absorption can impact concentrations; reduced renal clearance may necessitate a dose reduction, whereas increased volume of distribution or impaired oral absorption might require a dose increase to achieve therapeutic concentrations. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), if available and appropriate, allows the clinician to make informed, individualized decisions leading to more precise dose adjustments than those based on estimated CrCl or eGFR, and when TDM is desired, clinicians should contact their clinical laboratory to determine assay availability and turnaround time.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that HIV-1-infected mothers in the United States not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV-1 infection. Abacavir is present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of abacavir on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Because of the potential for (1) HIV-1 transmission (in HIV-negative infants), (2) developing viral resistance (in HIV-positive infants), and (3) adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving abacavir.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of abacavir have been established in pediatric patients aged 3 months and older. Use of abacavir is supported by pharmacokinetic trials and evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials of abacavir in adults and pediatric subjects [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.2)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical trials of abacavir did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, caution should be exercised in the administration of abacavir in elderly patients reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

8.6 Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function

A dose reduction is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir have not been established in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment; therefore, abacavir is contraindicated in these patients [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Comparison of error incidence between single-tablet versus multiple-tablet INSTI-based regimens in the inpatient setting [^113T44bV]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

When emtricitabine is given as a component of Biktarvy, no dose adjustment is recommended if eCrCl > 30 mL/min. While the recommendations are the same with lamivudine when given as Triumeq or Dovato, this conflicts with the labeling for individual lamivudine. Data for lamivudine in renal impairment were originally derived from pharmacokinetic studies, which demonstrated increased levels of lamivudine with decreasing renal function, as ~70% of orally administered drug is renally excreted. However, the favorable safety profile, even despite increased levels, and potential consequences of using an MTR in the outpatient setting (eg, increased pill burden, reduced adherence), create controversy around the need for lamivudine dose adjustments in renal impairment. Given the interquartile range of lowest eCrCl in the MTR group at baseline was 48 mL/min, renal dosing errors were likely most commonly identified in the setting of AKI, which may not indicate a chronic adjustment in dosing. Of the 28 dosing-related errors in the MTR group, 14 (50%) were inappropriately renally dosed with 4 of these encounters occurring in the setting of eCrCl < 50 mL/min, rather than eCrCl < 30 mL/min, which is an error based on the study site's internal guidance but not necessarily an error depending on the resource.

There were 14 abacavir dosing errors in the setting of hepatic dysfunction, which may be limited by the evaluation of Child-Pugh scores, as our baseline assessment would suggest even home doses were not appropriately adjusted. Similar to lamivudine, available evidence supporting the need to dose adjust is limited, with only pharmacokinetic studies available demonstrating 89% increase in AUC and 58% increase in half-life in patients with mild hepatic dysfunction (Child-Pugh score 5–6). Achieving a hepatic dose of abacavir may also be impractical based on dosage forms available and inadvertently lead to negative downstream effects. While concomitant cirrhosis in PWH has been found to be as high as 11.4%, performing a Child-Pugh score via retrospective chart review may falsely yield results of Child-Pugh B or C in a non-cirrhotic patient, implying a dose reduction is needed when it may not actually be necessary, which could have contributed to the findings of this study and should be taken lightly.

bApproximate range.

Effect of Food on Absorption of Abacavir and Lamivudine

Abacavir and lamivudine may be administered with or without food. Administration with a high-fat meal in a single-dose bioavailability trial resulted in no change in AUC last, AUC∞, and Cmaxfor lamivudine. Food did not alter the extent of systemic exposure to abacavir (AUC∞), but the rate of absorption (Cmax) was decreased approximately 24% compared with fasted conditions (n = 25). These results are similar to those from previous trials of the effect of food on abacavir and lamivudine tablets administered separately.

Specific Populations

Patients with Renal Impairment: The pharmacokinetics for the individual lamivudine component of abacavir and lamivudine has been evaluated in patients with renal impairment (see the U.S. prescribing information for the individual lamivudine component).

Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The pharmacokinetics for the individual components of abacavir and lamivudine have been evaluated in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment (see the U.S. prescribing information for the individual abacavir and lamivudine components).

Usual dosing is 3TC 300 mg PO once daily or 3TC 150 mg PO twice daily. For CrCl 30–49c, no dose adjustment. For CrCl 15–29, use 1 × 150 mg, then 100 mg every 24 hours; an alternative dose is 100–150 mg every 24 hours. For CrCl 5–14, use 1 × 150 mg, then 50 mg every 24 hours; an alternative dose is 100–150 mg every 24 hours. For CrCl < 5 or on HD, use 1 × 50 mg, then 25 mg every 24 hours; an alternative dose is 100–150 mg every 24 hours. Dosing in adults with hepatic impairment requires no dose adjustment. The note states that PK and safety data are limited in people with CrCl < 30 mL/min, that clinicians may consider using the nearest available tablet strength (100 mg or 150 mg) as outlined in the "Alternative Dose" column (BIII), and that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against full-dose 3TC in people with CrCl < 30 mL/min.

### Drug dosing adjustments in patients with chronic kidney disease [^1157QyjE]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease affects renal drug elimination and other pharmacokinetic processes involved in drug disposition (e.g., absorption, drug distribution, nonrenal clearance [metabolism]). Drug dosing errors are common in patients with renal impairment and can cause adverse effects and poor outcomes. Dosages of drugs cleared renally should be adjusted according to creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate and should be calculated using online or electronic calculators. Recommended methods for maintenance dosing adjustments are dose reductions, lengthening the dosing interval, or both. Physicians should be familiar with commonly used medications that require dosage adjustments. Resources are available to assist in dosing decisions for patients with chronic kidney disease.

Excretion: Elimination of abacavir was quantified in a mass balance trial following administration of a 600-mg dose of14C-abacavir: 99% of the radioactivity was recovered, 1.2% was excreted in the urine as abacavir, 30% as the 5′-carboxylic acid metabolite, 36% as the 5′-glucuronide metabolite, and 15% as unidentified minor metabolites in the urine. Fecal elimination accounted for 16% of the dose.

Specific Populations

Patients with Renal Impairment: The pharmacokinetic properties of ZIAGEN have not been determined in patients with impaired renal function. Renal excretion of unchanged abacavir is a minor route of elimination in humans.

Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The pharmacokinetics of abacavir have been studied in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A). Results showed that there was a mean increase of 89% in the abacavir AUC and an increase of 58% in the half-life of abacavir after a single dose of 600 mg of abacavir. The AUCs of the metabolites were not modified by mild liver disease; however, the rates of formation and elimination of the metabolites were decreased [see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

### An appraisal of antiretroviral drugs in hemodialysis [^115sBREV]. Kidney International (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related kidney disorders concern 30% of those patients and can lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD; 6 to 10%). Therefore, the administration of antiretroviral drugs in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients with nephropathy is not uncommon.

Methods

The influence of ESRD on the different phases of the pharmacokinetic profile of drugs in general is examined in light of bioavailability, distribution, protein binding, metabolism, and elimination. Then, the pharmacokinetics of antiretroviral drugs in hemodialysis are detailed.

Results

From these data, dosing recommendations are given for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-NRTIs, and protease inhibitors (PIs).

Conclusion

Dosage adjustments are often necessary for patients with renal insufficiency. These adaptations have to be carefully performed to optimize drug exposure and reduce the risk of side effects.

Older people with HIV — pharmacokinetics and monitoring: Hepatic metabolism and renal elimination are major routes of antiretroviral (ARV) drug clearance, and both liver and kidney functions decrease with age, which may result in impaired drug elimination and increased drug exposure. Most clinical trials have included only a small proportion of participants aged > 50 years and current ARV dosing recommendations are based on PK and pharmacodynamic data derived from participants with normal organ function. Because potential accumulation and its effects are uncertain, therapy in older people requires close monitoring and heightened awareness of drug-related adverse effects, especially in those with hepatic or renal impairment.

Monitoring strategies — An African randomized trial comparing clinical monitoring alone with clinical plus routine laboratory monitoring (chemistry panel including serum creatinine, complete blood count, and CD4 cell count) in 3321 HIV-infected patients initiating ART (the majority with tenofovir) found that the clinical monitoring arm experienced statistically higher rates of HIV disease progression or death but similar rates of serious adverse events; these data suggest that routine chemistry, hematologic, and CD4 cell monitoring are beneficial, although the independent contribution of kidney function monitoring cannot be determined. The goals of monitoring kidney function and damage in HIV infection are to identify conditions for which specific treatment may improve kidney outcomes, identify toxicities of antiretroviral and other medications, and estimate GFR for appropriate dose adjustments of renally cleared drugs in individuals with reduced kidney function.

There are no data available on the use of lamivudine in pediatric patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.2)].

The safety and effectiveness of TRIUMEQ PD have not been established in pediatric patients aged less than 3 months or weighing less than 6 kg.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical trials of abacavir, dolutegravir, or lamivudine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, caution should be exercised in the administration of TRIUMEQ in elderly patients reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Antiretroviral dosing cautions in reduced kidney function — The C–C chemokine receptor type 5 inhibitor, maraviroc, is contraindicated in patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/minute when combined with a potent CYP3A inhibitor (eg, ritonavir), and should be used with caution (and potentially at reduced dose) in all other patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/minute because of increased risk of postural hypotension; no dose adjustments are needed for protease inhibitors, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), or the integrase inhibitors raltegravir and dolutegravir in patients with CKD.

### To dose-adjust or not to dose-adjust: lamivudine dose in kidney impairment [^113Hdx9g]. AIDS (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess the risk of adverse diagnoses and laboratory abnormalities associated with a 300 or 150mg daily dose of lamivudine (3TC) initiated by people with HIV (PWH) with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between at least 30 and 49ml/min per1.73 m2 or less.

Design

Longitudinal study based on electronic health records of 539 PWH with eGFR between at least 30 and 49ml/min per1.73 m2 or less from the Observational Pharmaco-Epidemiology Research and Analysis (OPERA) cohort.

Methods

Common unintended effects of 3TC were evaluated as composite outcomes. We estimated the incidence (univariate Poisson regression) and association between dose and incident composite outcomes (multivariate Poisson regression) among PWH without the relevant diagnoses or laboratory abnormalities at 3TC initiation.

Results

PWH initiating 150mg 3TC had higher HIV RNA, lower eGFR, and more comorbidities than those initiating 300mg 3TC. The prevalence of relevant diagnoses and laboratory abnormalities was similar in both groups. The most common lab abnormality was low hemoglobin. There was no statistically significant difference in incident adverse diagnoses/severe lab abnormalities with 300mg versus 150mg [incidence rate ratio (IRR): 1.51; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59–3.92). However, a statistically significant association was observed when gastrointestinal symptoms/moderate lab abnormalities were included in the outcome (IRR: 3.07, 95% CI 1.12–8.40).

Conclusion

As 3TC is a well tolerated drug with a wide therapeutic window, dose adjustment may be unnecessary among PWH with eGFR between at least 30 and 49ml/min per 1.73 m2 or less. Clinical judgement is key when weighing the risks and benefits of 3TC dose adjustment for PWH experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms or moderate lab abnormalities.

When tenofovir is necessary because of limited options or hepatitis B treatment, our stance may be considered with close kidney function monitoring; in such cases, the dose of tenofovir should be reduced as appropriate for the estimated creatinine clearance or GFR, and concurrent use of other potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be avoided, including atazanavir and other boosted protease inhibitors (which have been implicated in increasing the risk of tenofovir-associated nephrotoxicity) when possible.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

TRIUMEQ and TRIUMEQ PD are a fixed-dose combination of the HIV‑1 antiretroviral agents abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine [see Microbiology (12.4)].

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Effects on Electrocardiogram

A thorough QT trial has been conducted for dolutegravir. Neither the effects of abacavir nor lamivudine as single entities or the combination of abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine on the QT interval have been evaluated.

In a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial, 42 healthy subjects received single-dose oral administrations of placebo, dolutegravir 250‑mg suspension (exposures approximately 3–fold of the 50-mg once-daily dose at steady state), and moxifloxacin 400 mg (active control) in random sequence. After baseline and placebo adjustment, the maximum mean QTc change based on Fridericia correction method (QTcF) for dolutegravir was 2.4 msec (1-sided 95% upper CI: 4.9 msec). Dolutegravir did not prolong the QTc interval over 24 hours postdose.

Effects on Renal Function

The effect of dolutegravir on renal function was evaluated in an open-label, randomized, 3-arm, parallel, placebo-controlled trial in healthy subjects (n = 37) who received dolutegravir 50 mg once daily (n = 12), dolutegravir 50 mg twice daily (n = 13), or placebo once daily (n = 12) for 14 days. A decrease in creatinine clearance, as determined by 24-hour urine collection, was observed with both doses of dolutegravir after 14 days of treatment in subjects who received 50 mg once daily (9% decrease) and 50 mg twice daily (13% decrease). Neither dose of dolutegravir had a significant effect on the actual glomerular filtration rate (determined by the clearance of probe drug, iohexol) or effective renal plasma flow (determined by the clearance of probe drug, para-amino hippurate) compared with the placebo.

### Is there continued evidence for an association between abacavir usage and myocardial infarction risk in individuals with HIV? A cohort collaboration [^116Q8RbF]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Clearly, confounding cannot be ruled out in any cohort study. Although our initial report provided several arguments against confounding as an explanation, this concern continued to be levelled against the study. In particular, there has been a frequently raised concern that channelling by renal function (whereby those with poorer renal function would be preferentially placed on ABC-containing regimens to avoid use of tenofovir, a drug that has well-known renal toxicities) might induce an artificial association with MI, due to the known correlation between renal function and CVD risk. This was first raised by Bedimo and colleagues who reported that after adjustment for renal function the P value for the association between MI and ABC use changed from 0.06 to 0.11. However, it is noteworthy that the hazard ratio itself was reduced only slightly from 1.27 to 1.23, indicative of only a modest confounding effect of renal function. The later study from the VA group did include adjustment for renal function, both at baseline and over follow-up with no attenuation of association; Marcus et al. also confirmed that their association was independent of renal function. Further, in an updated analysis from the D:A:D group (as well as in the present analysis), the reported association with ABC was unchanged after adjustment for various measures of renal function. Confounding by recreational drug use has also been proposed as a possible explanation for the findings, although the VA analysis did also include adjustment for this factor and clinicians within the D:A:D study reported that this information, if available, would be unlikely to influence choice of cART. Most importantly, we consider that, the fact that the reported association between MI and ABC is unchanged, provides the strongest evidence against channelling bias as an explanation for our findings.

One concern in analyses such as this is the possibility of time-varying confounding. If factors that are associated with the initiation of ABC also lie on the causal pathway between the use of abacavir and MI risk, then adjustment for these factors in standard multivariable analyses will generally result in biased estimates of the relative risk. For this reason, we did not include such factors in our primary analysis. However, the fact that the relative risk associated with current abacavir use was virtually unchanged in our sensitivity analyses which did include factors thought to be potentially on the causal pathway suggests that little time-varying confounding exists with these factors. This is also supported by the mechanistic studies which suggest a very different pathway for the association seen.

### Ritonavir 100 mg (ritonavir) [^111D1Lut]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Renal Impairment

Ritonavir pharmacokinetics have not been studied in patients with renal impairment, however, since renal clearance is negligible, a decrease in total body clearance is not expected in patients with renal impairment.

Hepatic Impairment

Dose-normalized steady-state ritonavir concentrations in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (400 mg twice-daily, n = 6) were similar to those in control subjects dosed with 500 mg twice-daily. Dose-normalized steady-state ritonavir exposures in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (400 mg twice-daily, n = 6) were about 40% lower than those in subjects with normal hepatic function (500 mg twice-daily, n = 6). Protein binding of ritonavir was not statistically significantly affected by mild or moderately impaired hepatic function. No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. However, health care providers should be aware of the potential for lower ritonavir concentrations in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and should monitor patient response carefully. Ritonavir has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

Pregnancy

Based on evaluation of the published literature, ritonavir exposures are reduced during pregnancy relative to postpartum.

### HIV and HCV medications in end-stage renal disease [^114RwE8H]. Seminars in Dialysis (2015). Low credibility.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affect populations worldwide. With the availability of over 35 Food and Drug Administration approved medications for treatment of HIV, the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV has greatly improved. On the other hand, treatment options for HCV have been limited until very recently. While the use of protease inhibitors (such as boceprevir and telaprevir) has become standard of care for treatment of hepatitis C in the general population, data for individuals with impaired kidney function, particularly those on dialysis, are extremely limited. Use of medications in dialysis patients can be challenging given the dose adjustments that must be made for renally cleared molecules, and potentially increased impact of adverse effects such as anemia. Recommendations for dosing of marketed therapies for HIV and HCV are reviewed.

### Abacavir sulfate [^113XZzPv]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Elimination

In single-dose trials, the observed elimination half-life (t1/2) was 1.54 ± 0.63 hours. After intravenous administration, total clearance was 0.80 ± 0.24 L per hour per kg (mean ± SD).

Metabolism

In humans, abacavir is not significantly metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. The primary routes of elimination of abacavir are metabolism by alcohol dehydrogenase to form the 5′-carboxylic acid and glucuronyl transferase to form the 5′-glucuronide. The metabolites do not have antiviral activity. In vitro experiments reveal that abacavir does not inhibit human CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or CYP2C9 activity at clinically relevant concentrations.

Excretion

Elimination of abacavir was quantified in a mass balance trial following administration of a 600-mg dose of14C-abacavir: 99% of the radioactivity was recovered, 1.2% was excreted in the urine as abacavir, 30% as the 5′-carboxylic acid metabolite, 36% as the 5′-glucuronide metabolite, and 15% as unidentified minor metabolites in the urine. Fecal elimination accounted for 16% of the dose.

Patients with Renal Impairment

The pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir have not been determined in patients with impaired renal function. Renal excretion of unchanged abacavir is a minor route of elimination in humans.

Patients with Hepatic Impairment

The pharmacokinetics of abacavir have been studied in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A). Results showed that there was a mean increase of 89% in the abacavir AUC and an increase of 58% in the half-life of abacavir after a single dose of 600 mg of abacavir. The AUCs of the metabolites were not modified by mild liver disease; however, the rates of formation and elimination of the metabolites were decreased [see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Pregnant Women

Abacavir pharmacokinetics were studied in 25 pregnant women during the last trimester of pregnancy receiving abacavir 300 mg twice daily. Abacavir exposure (AUC) during pregnancy was similar to those in postpartum and in HIV-infected non-pregnant historical controls. Consistent with passive diffusion of abacavir across the placenta, abacavir concentrations in neonatal plasma cord samples at birth were essentially equal to those in maternal plasma at delivery.

### Drug dosage adjustment in hospitalized patients with renal impairment at tikur anbessa specialized hospital, addis ababa, Ethiopia [^113eTHjC]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The metabolism and excretion of many drugs and their pharmacologically active metabolites depend on normal renal function. In patients with kidney dysfunction, the renal excretion of parent drug and its metabolites will be impaired leading to their excessive accumulation in the body. In addition, the plasma protein binding of drugs may be significantly reduced, which in turn could influence the pharmacokinetic processes of distribution and elimination. The activity of several drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters has been shown to be impaired in chronic renal failure.

Medication dosing errors are the most important drug-related problems in patients with renal impairment. Inappropriate dosing in patients with kidney disease can cause toxicity or ineffective therapy. In particular, older patients are at a higher risk of developing advanced disease and related adverse events caused by age related decline in renal function and the use of multiple medications to treat co-morbid conditions. Drug accumulation and toxicity can develop rapidly if dosages are not adjusted in patients with impaired renal function. Drug elimination by the kidneys correlates with the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). It is thus logical to use eGFR or eCrCl for adjusting dosages in patients with renal failure.

Drug dosing in renal insufficiency needs to be individualized whenever possible to optimize therapeutic outcomes and to minimize toxicity. The two major approaches are either to lengthen the interval between doses or to reduce the dose. Occasionally both interval and dose adjustments are needed. Drug dosage adjustment for patients with acute or chronic kidney disease is an accepted standard of practice, though there are no clear parameters to adjust drug dosing in acute kidney injury.

The challenge is how to accurately estimate a patient's kidney function in both acute and chronic kidney disease, which includes renal replacement therapy which is totally different, any Scr based equations are not valid in patients with acute kidney injury and end stage kidney disease.

Many renal function estimation approaches have been proposed, amongst which the Cockcroft-Gault (CG) equation, provides an estimate of creatinine clearance (CrCl). An apparently minor increase in serum creatinine (SCr) can reflect a marked fall in GFR. For this reason the estimation of GFR through the calculation of CrCl or eGFR using validated formula is mandatory in every patient. When in doubt, appropriate information for dosing guidelines should be sought in recently published monographs or texts. There are no published reports on studies that evaluate drug dosage adjustment in renal patients in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was initiated to assess drug dosage adjustment among hospitalized patients with renal impairment at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital.

### Comparison of error incidence between single-tablet versus multiple-tablet INSTI-based regimens in the inpatient setting [^113rRv22]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
Inpatient Processing of INSTI Antiretrovirals.

Abbreviations: INSTI, integrase strand transfer inhibitor; NRTI, nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor.

The primary outcome of this study was a comparison of composite error incidence in patient encounters continued on home bictegravir-based STRs versus those substituted from a dolutegravir-based STR to an MTR while admitted. Identified errors were classified as incorrect regimen, clinically significant DDIs, incorrect dose, or incorrect frequency. If at least one error type occurred in a patient encounter, the encounter was marked "yes" for error incidence. Incorrect regimen consisted of therapeutic duplications, erroneous antiretroviral agents ordered, omitted doses (doses not ordered within 24 hours of admission and/or any doses not administered despite an active order due to medication not being available or patient refusal), and incomplete regimens. Incorrect doses were defined as dosing not in accordance with the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) HIV guidelines, including dosing too high or too low in renal (emtricitabine, lamivudine) or hepatic (abacavir) impairment. The study site's local guideline recommended against using Biktarvy if estimated creatinine clearance (eCrCl) fell below 30 mL/min. Recommendations for lamivudine renal dose adjustments based on eCrCl vary depending on source; while lamivudine's package insert advises reducing doses if eCrCl < 50 mL/min, DHHS guidelines use a threshold of < 30 mL/min. An eCrCl of < 30 mL/min was used to identify dosing errors related to renal function in this study, as this also aligned with the hospital's local guideline. If lamivudine was dose reduced for eCrCl < 50 mL/min, but > 30 mL/min, it was considered an inappropriately low dose. Secondary outcomes included number of errors per encounter among those with at least 1 error, between-group error types, time to error correction, correct conversion from MTR to STR at discharge, and pharmacist involvement in error correction. In addition, a cost analysis was performed to evaluate the anticipated cost of STR acquisition for the 2 dolutegravir-based regimens included in this study using acquisition wholesale price (AWP). A dispense report for the year 2022 was used to approximate annual usage of both regimens.
