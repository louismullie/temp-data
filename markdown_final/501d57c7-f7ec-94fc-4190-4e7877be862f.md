## Question

Kidney disease treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about kidney disease treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to frame the clinical question and define the population and scope. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence base and extract core recommendations. Next, I will examine disease-specific therapies, including diabetic CKD, non-diabetic CKD, and glomerular diseases. After that, I need to consider advanced CKD and kidney failure choices, including conservative care and shared decision-making. Finally, I should review emerging therapies, implementation barriers, and synthesize a practical, staged approach with monitoring and follow-up, making sure I double-check any numerical claims against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical framing and scope so I don't jump to conclusions. The question is broad, so I should specify that I will focus on chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults not yet on dialysis or transplant, using the 2024 KDIGO guideline as the primary evidence base and incorporating complementary guidance from ADA/KDIGO, VA/DoD, and KDOQI where relevant, while acknowledging that pediatric CKD, AKI, and malignancy-related kidney disease require different frameworks [^749982bf] [^69725d55] [^58859018] [^5e61e9ce].

> I need to check the highest-quality evidence base before synthesizing. KDIGO 2024 is a comprehensive, GRADE-based update with 28 recommendations and 141 practice points, emphasizing risk-based assessment, comprehensive risk reduction, and patient-centered care; I should anchor on this and explicitly cite the strength and certainty ratings when I make claims [^0e5ef9b5] [^151c3bc9] [^b4f476fc].

> Next, I should review foundational principles that apply across etiologies. Hold on, let me verify the core pillars: treat the underlying cause when identifiable, implement lifestyle measures (dietary sodium restriction, protein intake around 0.8 g/kg/day if not on dialysis, and physical activity), and use a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach with education and medication stewardship; these are consistently emphasized in KDIGO 2024 and echoed by primary care summaries and VA/DoD guidance [^0e5ef9b5] [^d865ac4f] [^58859018].

> I will now examine blood pressure targets and RAAS blockade, since this is foundational. Wait, let me verify the threshold and agent choice: KDIGO recommends a blood pressure target below 130/80 mmHg for CKD with albuminuria, using an ACE inhibitor or ARB as first-line, and advises against dual RAAS blockade due to harm; I initially thought the target was universal, but I should correct that — this 130/80 target is specifically for those with albuminuria, whereas for CKD without albuminuria, individualization is reasonable, and the strength of evidence is graded as Level 1 for many BP recommendations in CKD [^0e5ef9b5] [^749982bf].

> Now, let me consider diabetic CKD, where the therapeutic landscape has evolved rapidly. I should confirm the pillar approach: foundational RAAS blockade plus SGLT2 inhibition is recommended for most patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes, with addition of a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (finerenone) and, when needed, a GLP-1 receptor agonist; this aligns with KDIGO 2022 diabetes guidance and the 2024 ADA/KDIGO consensus, and the rationale is complementary mechanisms targeting hemodynamic, metabolic, and fibrotic pathways [^69725d55] [^62aac289]. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude of benefit for SGLT2 inhibitors: a collaborative meta-analysis cited in KDIGO 2024 shows a 37% reduction in kidney disease progression and a 23% reduction in AKI across diabetic and non-diabetic CKD, which supports their broad use when indicated [^cb6ca7c5].

> For non-diabetic CKD, I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing. SGLT2 inhibitors are now recommended for many patients with CKD regardless of diabetes status, given the same meta-analytic benefits, and statins are advised for adults over 50 with CKD to reduce atherosclerotic events; I should also remember that RAAS blockade remains first-line for proteinuric CKD, with the same cautions about hyperkalemia and monitoring [^cb6ca7c5] [^0e5ef9b5] [^dc27ab38].

> But wait, what if the CKD is driven by a glomerular disease where immunotherapy changes outcomes? I should confirm that kidney biopsy is suggested when the etiology is unclear and results would change management, and that disease-specific immunosuppression is indicated for certain glomerulopathies; participation in registries and trials is encouraged given access and cost constraints, and this is explicitly addressed in KDIGO 2024 and the KDOQI glomerular disease commentary [^6d5c4df6] [^2e4b648b].

> Next, I should review advanced CKD and kidney failure decision-making, and I need to ensure I don't present dialysis as the default. KDIGO 2024 emphasizes early, structured education about kidney replacement therapy options and comprehensive conservative care, with shared decision-making embedded throughout; patient decision aids can improve knowledge and alignment with preferences, though their long-term impact across trajectories remains under study [^0f220395] [^416dd786]. Hold on, I should verify timing and communication pitfalls: qualitative evidence shows patients often receive information too late or when they are too ill to process it, and clinicians sometimes frame dialysis as the default, which undermines truly informed choice; addressing this requires anticipatory guidance and explicit equipoise between dialysis and conservative management [^c2faabb8] [^81ac9d09].

> I will now examine emerging and investigational therapies, but I should be careful not to overstate. GLP-1 receptor agonists show promise for kidney outcomes, and the FLOW trial is a dedicated kidney outcomes study in type 2 diabetes with CKD; while results were pending at guideline publication, subsequent reporting supports kidney benefit, which may expand options in diabetic CKD [^006ab06a]. Let me also consider regenerative and genetic approaches: cell and gene therapy are promising for monogenic kidney diseases and systemic drivers like diabetes, but no kidney-targeted gene or cell therapy is approved yet, so these remain investigational; similarly, renal nanomedicines are an exciting frontier with preclinical rationale, but clinical translation faces targeting and safety hurdles [^a2fca8a0] [^5cd585c9].

> Implementation and equity are critical, so I should double-check barriers and system-level levers. Early detection via eGFR and albuminuria testing in high-risk groups, risk stratification with tools like the Kidney Failure Risk Equation, and team-based care improve outcomes, yet access to medications varies globally and many patients face cost and coverage constraints; this is highlighted in KDIGO 2024 and reinforced by VA/DoD guidance emphasizing coordinated, patient-centered care and early referral for advanced CKD [^0e5ef9b5] [^58859018] [^0ccdeaa8].

> Let me synthesize a practical, staged approach, and I should confirm each step aligns with evidence. In early CKD, prioritize risk factor modification, lifestyle change, and treat the cause; in proteinuric CKD, add RAAS blockade and titrate to blood pressure targets; in type 2 diabetes with CKD, layer SGLT2 inhibition and consider finerenone and GLP-1 RA; in advanced CKD, initiate structured education and shared decision-making about dialysis modalities, transplantation, and comprehensive conservative care; throughout, monitor kidney function, electrolytes, blood pressure, albuminuria, and cardiovascular risk, and adjust therapy as the clinical picture evolves [^0e5ef9b5] [^69725d55] [^0f220395].

> Finally, I should confirm key takeaways and ensure internal consistency. Modern CKD care is risk-based, comprehensive, and patient-centered, with strong emphasis on multidisciplinary management, shared decision-making, and equitable access; SGLT2 inhibitors have broadened indications beyond diabetes, RAAS blockade remains foundational for proteinuric disease, and conservative care is an active, legitimate option rather than "doing nothing", all supported by contemporary guidelines and evidence syntheses [^0e5ef9b5] [^cb6ca7c5] [^1bf8cdff].

Kidney disease treatment centers on **slowing progression** and **preventing complications** through risk-factor control, lifestyle changes, and evidence-based medications [^0e5ef9b5]. For CKD, use ACE inhibitors or ARBs for proteinuria, SGLT2 inhibitors for diabetic and many non-diabetic cases, and add finerenone in type 2 diabetes with CKD; control blood pressure to < 130/80 mmHg when albuminuria is present, and manage lipids with statins in adults ≥ 50 years [^0e5ef9b5] [^cb6ca7c5] [^69725d55]. Address lifestyle factors — sodium restriction, protein intake ~0.8 g/kg/day, weight management, smoking cessation, and ≥ 150 minutes/week of activity — and coordinate multidisciplinary care [^0e5ef9b5] [^41aed761]. For kidney failure, offer shared decision-making on dialysis modalities, transplant, or comprehensive conservative care, and individualize based on patient preferences and comorbidities [^0f220395] [^39863a7d]. Emerging options include GLP-1 receptor agonists, combination therapies, and regenerative approaches, but access and equity remain key barriers [^006ab06a] [^58543f43] [^a2fca8a0] [^0ccdeaa8].

## General principles of kidney disease treatment

- **Risk stratification**: Use eGFR and albuminuria to guide intensity of therapy and monitoring [^0e5ef9b5].
- **Comprehensive care**: Multidisciplinary teams (nephrology, primary care, dietetics, pharmacy, social work) improve outcomes [^notfound].
- **Patient-centered care**: Incorporate patient preferences, values, and goals into decisions [^39863a7d].

---

## Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle changes are foundational across CKD stages and include:

| **Lifestyle intervention** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Dietary sodium intake | < 2 g/day |
| Protein intake | 0.8 g/kg/day (not on dialysis) |
| Physical activity | ≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate intensity |
| Weight management | BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m² |
| Smoking cessation | Strongly recommended |

---

## Pharmacological management

### Blood pressure control

- **Target**: < 130/80 mmHg when albuminuria is present [^notfound].
- **First-line**: ACE inhibitors or ARBs for proteinuric CKD [^notfound].
- **Avoid**: Dual ACEi/ARB therapy due to harm [^749982bf].

---

### Glycemic control (for diabetic CKD)

- **First-line**: Metformin if eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^749982bf].
- **Add**: SGLT2 inhibitors for most with CKD and diabetes [^69725d55].
- **Further add**: GLP-1 receptor agonists or finerenone as indicated [^69725d55].

---

### Lipid management

Statins are recommended for adults ≥ 50 years with CKD not on dialysis to reduce cardiovascular events [^dc27ab38].

---

### Mineral and bone disorder management

Phosphate binders and vitamin D analogs are used to control phosphate, calcium, and PTH, with therapy individualized to lab abnormalities and patient factors [^notfound].

---

## Treatment of specific kidney diseases

- **Diabetic kidney disease**: Intensive glycemic control, RAAS blockade, SGLT2 inhibitors, and finerenone are key [^69725d55].
- **Glomerular diseases**: Immunosuppression (e.g. steroids, cyclophosphamide, rituximab) is tailored to disease and severity [^notfound].
- **Polycystic kidney disease**: Tolvaptan slows cyst growth in selected patients [^notfound].

---

## Management of advanced kidney disease and kidney failure

- **Shared decision-making**: Discuss dialysis modalities, transplant, and comprehensive conservative care early [^0f220395].
- **Dialysis**: Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis based on patient preference, comorbidities, and logistics [^f0634514].
- **Transplantation**: Consider preemptive transplant when eligible [^c032a20d].
- **Conservative care**: Active symptom management without dialysis for selected patients [^1bf8cdff].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

- **GLP-1 receptor agonists**: Potential kidney benefits in type 2 diabetes with CKD [^006ab06a].
- **Combination therapy**: Multipathway targeting (e.g. SGLT2 + MRAs) is under study [^c4d8715f].
- **Regenerative medicine**: Cell and gene therapies are promising but not yet clinical [^a2fca8a0].

---

## Barriers to effective treatment

- **Access and equity**: Disparities in care, medication access, and transplant evaluation persist [^0ccdeaa8].
- **Patient engagement**: Limited health literacy and late-stage presentation hinder optimal care [^f19f5e0d].
- **System factors**: Fragmented care and limited nephrology workforce constrain delivery [^c032a20d].

---

Kidney disease treatment is **multifaceted**, combining lifestyle, pharmacologic, and supportive strategies, with care individualized to disease stage, etiology, and patient preferences. Early detection, risk stratification, and coordinated care are essential to slow progression and improve outcomes [^0e5ef9b5].

### Can we personalize treatment for kidney diseases? [^027f7da9]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

The idea of individualizing therapies to obtain optimal clinical results is not new but has only recently been applied to kidney diseases. Nonetheless, kidney disorders present a variety of opportunities to personalize medicine. Here, the heterogeneity of kidney disorders is reviewed to provide a rationale for pursuing personalized medicine. Data on adjusting therapy on the basis of pharmacogenetics/genomics and pharmacodynamics are summarized to demonstrate where the field is, and biomarker studies that reflect the future of personalized medicine are discussed. The goal of this review is to demonstrate that we can personalize therapy for kidney diseases but that considerable investment in new research will be required for personalized medicine to be routinely used in nephrology clinics.

### Patient preferences for kidney failure treatments [^39863a7d]. Kidney International (2025). Medium credibility.

This review considers what is important to people making decisions about their kidney failure care. We begin by introducing the concept of preferences and how preference-sensitive decision-making is central to person-centered care. Next, we explore the preferences that patients have in relation to kidney failure care and the attributes of available treatments. We examine how decisions are made about kidney failure treatments and consider whether preference-sensitive care is widespread. Finally, we make recommendations regarding how kidney services could be reshaped to ensure that people's preferences guide the healthcare they receive. We conclude that people's preferences can guide decisions between treatments for kidney failure only if clinicians and systems facilitate this. The best treatment for a person is the one that fits best with what is important to them. The science of nephrology involves optimal delivery of treatments that prolong life, preserve and replace organ function. The art lies in shaping this care to the person.

### Factors that lead to dialysis as the preferred treatment modality for patients with chronic kidney disease [^750543dc]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To describe forces that lead to dialysis as the preferred treatment modality for patients with chronic kidney disease.

Recent Findings

Although chronic dialysis is life-saving and the only option available for many individuals, treatment of the underlying causes of kidney disease and transplantation may be preferable options for many patients. Factors that favor dialysis instead of treatment of underlying kidney disease or transplantation include lack of proper diagnosis, lack of proper treatment of underlying kidney disease, poor compliance, lack of consideration for transplantation, early initiation of dialysis therapy, and financial incentives. New developments that may reverse this trend include genetic panels that improve diagnosis of kidney disease, new methods of transplantation, and legislation that will encourage kidney transplantation.

Summary

By recognizing factors that favor dialysis over other therapies, nephrologists may be better able to provide care to their patients and prevent dialysis, researchers may be able to focus on research that will prevent the need for dialysis, and professional societies may work to prevent unneeded dialysis.

### Age and treatment of kidney failure [^3adb553f]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review discusses issues related to treatment of chronic kidney disease, and kidney failure in particular, among older adults.

Recent Findings

A substantial proportion of older adults have chronic kidney disease and progress to kidney failure. There is considerable variability in treatment practices for advanced kidney disease among older adults, and evidence that treatment decisions such as dialysis initiation may be made without adequate preparation. When initiated, survival among older adults on chronic dialysis remains poor, and is associated with a significant decline in functional status. There is also evidence to suggest that dialysis initiation may not reflect overall treatment goals of elderly patients, but rather a lack of clear communication between patients and health practitioners, and underdeveloped conservative care programs in many centers.

Summary

Kidney failure is common among older adults. When considering treatment options for kidney failure, patient priorities, preferences, and symptoms should be taken into account, using a shared decision-making approach.

### Kidney disease pathways, options and decisions: an environmental scan of international patient decision aids [^f0634514]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

A notable shift in clinical guidance for managing people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) Stages 4 and 5 [G4+; referred to herein as established kidney disease (EKD)] is to offer conservative management as an active treatment pathway alongside renal replacement therapies, dialysis and transplant. Most kidney services in Europe and North America have established educational programmes to help patients make decisions about their future treatment when their kidney disease is identified as progressing from chronic to EKD. Often known as pre-dialysis education, kidney professionals provide information about renal replacement options, focusing on discussions about which options fit best into a patient's life, including haemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD), with at-home or in-centre options. Conservative management is offered as an active option to manage symptoms arising from failing kidneys in patients meeting certain criteria, e.g. those > 75 years of age, with a high level of comorbidity and/or with a poor quality of life.

The conservative management and renal replacement therapy decision is complex and can be seen as a hierarchy of nested decisions (see Figure 1, adapted from Winterbottom et al. 2020) rather than a choice between discrete options. Decision-making takes place in the context of managing a long-term condition, with patients and professionals deliberating about treatment changes over months and years as kidney function stabilizes or continues to decline. Patients may switch or stop treatments as treatments fail, health worsens and life circumstances change. This dynamic context may explain why decision points are not easily identified or discussed and why patients may not be aware their kidney disease is worsening or may not be prepared to make shared decisions about future treatment with kidney professionals.

### Maintaining kidney health in aging societies: a JSN and ERA call to action [^e6cb12d2]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

CALL TO ACTION

On 15 September 2024, based on the above considerations, the ERA and JSN agreed on a call to action to address the growing burden of kidney disease in the elderly and aging societies (box). Overall, we feel that more should be done to promote the prevention and early diagnosis (and treatment) of CKD.

Box JSN and ERA call to action: Achieving Kidney Health in Aging/Aged Societies

- Encourage comprehensive data collection on kidney disease in the aging/aged population.

- Define kidney health in the elderly.

- Elucidate the mechanisms of kidney aging and accumulate knowledge on therapeutic options.

- Establish treatment goals and recommend appropriate therapeutic options for kidney disease in the elderly.

- Publish future recommendations for research on kidney disease in the elderly.

- Provide guidance for the at-risk elderly for prevention of CKD.

### Are your kidneys Ok? Detect early to protect kidney health [^9dcd3e6d]. American Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Timely treatment is the primary strategy to protect kidney health, prevent kidney disease progression and related complications, reduce cardiovascular disease risk, and prevent premature kidney-related and cardiovascular mortality. International population assessments show low awareness and low detection of kidney disease and substantial gaps in treatment. People with kidney failure universally express the preference for having been diagnosed early in their disease trajectory to allow more time for educational, lifestyle, and pharmacologic interventions. Therefore, increasing knowledge and implementing sustainable solutions for early detection of kidney disease to protect kidney health are public health priorities.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^0e5ef9b5]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 chronic kidney disease (CKD) guideline — scope and methods update states it "is an update to the KDIGO 2012 guideline" and aims "to assist clinicians caring for people with CKD, both adults and children", while noting that "People receiving dialysis and kidney transplant recipients are not the focus of this guideline". The scope "includes chapters dedicated to the evaluation of CKD, risk assessment in people with CKD, management to delay CKD progression and manage its complications, medical management and drug stewardship in CKD, and optimal models of CKD care", and includes "a presentation of the relative and absolute risks associated with specific outcomes from the CKD Prognosis Consortium (CKD-PC)". The guideline provides "actionable recommendations based on a rigorous formal evidence review" and "practice points that serve to direct clinical care", with "Treatment approaches and guideline recommendations" based on "systematic reviews of relevant studies", and appraisal following the "Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach".

### Kidney disease pathways, options and decisions: an environmental scan of international patient decision aids [^856e7455]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Our analysis identified a number of components likely to support people's reasoning in this context (Tables 4 and 5): description of kidney failure and consequences for EoL care; make explicit the decision problems in the context of long-term management; labelling of conservative management as an active option and treatment failure as a consequence of kidney replacement therapies, including dialysis modalities; if risk figures are presented, ensure they are described using the same format throughout the PtDA (e.g. x in 1000; y %); table summaries can help people compare across options but depend on which options and attributes are selected and described; prompts to help people think about what is important to them in their lives, after the decision is made; and make explicit people's preferences may change as their circumstances and treatment evidence changes. However, people react differentially to patient stories and/or images and including anecdotes or pictures of people receiving treatment may bias other's judgements and choices.

Limitations of this environmental scan method are that it provides a snapshot of resources at a given time, may exclude some resources not available in the public domain or accessible in English and bases evaluations on observations of the PtDAs alone, without assessing details within other development or endorsement documents (e.g.). We are confident that our findings are valid, as the survey was carried out with rigour; we followed a systematic process (the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses), drew on established guidelines for delivery of kidney services (NICE/KDIGO) and PtDA standards (IPDAS) and discussed, adjusted and agreed on all search, inclusion/ exclusion, analysis and synthesis decisions with our interdisciplinary, multi-stakeholder steering committee.

A challenge for developing PtDAs for people with EKD is the long-time worsening of the disease means a person's social circumstances, lifestyle, treatment preferences and services provision of treatment options may change from the point at which a care plan is agreed upon and implemented. These findings suggest a conservative care dialysis decision aid needs to be built on evidence about how people with worsening kidney disease make decisions about their health now, and in the future, and kidney professionals negotiate the different service pathways to deliver care to patients as their care needs change as their kidneys fail. These data, the kidney disease pathways, options and decision figure and IPDAS checklist may help structure a PtDA enabling people to explore what is important to them about this changing pathway of care when sharing decisions with kidney professionals.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^540a1ad7]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 chronic kidney disease guideline — recent developments and research recommendations — notes several developments since the KDIGO 2012 CKD guideline, including refinement of evaluation of GFR, population and individual risk prediction, and novel treatments; the Work Group aimed to generate a guideline rigorously devoted to new and existing evidence and clinically useful, and presents research recommendations at the end of the document to guide the next set of questions, focus on unanswered areas, and urge inclusivity across the lifecycle with attention to sex, gender, and etiology of CKD in all studies.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^8d18492b]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 — updating and developing guideline statements notes that "Recommendations from the KDIGO 2012 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease were considered in the context of new evidence… and updated as appropriate", and because "Practice points were not proposed as a separate category in 2012", the Work Group considered options: statements with no change in evidence "were retained as graded recommendations", graded recommendations "were updated where appropriate", some were "rewritten as practice points", and "new guideline statements (both recommendations and practice points) were generated".

### Executive summary of the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease: known knowns and known unknowns [^8aa59847]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) updates the KDIGO 2012 guideline and has been developed with patient partners, clinicians, and researchers around the world, using robust methodology. This update, based on a substantially broader base of evidence than has previously been available, reflects an exciting time in nephrology. New therapies and strategies have been tested in large and diverse populations that help to inform care; however, this guideline is not intended for people receiving dialysis nor those who have a kidney transplant. The document is sensitive to international considerations, CKD across the lifespan, and discusses special considerations in implementation. The scope includes chapters dedicated to the evaluation and risk assessment of people with CKD, management to delay CKD progression and its complications, medication management and drug stewardship in CKD, and optimal models of CKD care. Treatment approaches and actionable guideline recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant studies and appraisal of the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations which followed the "Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation" (GRADE) approach. The limitations of the evidence are discussed. The guideline also provides practice points, which serve to direct clinical care or activities for which a systematic review was not conducted, and it includes useful infographics and describes an important research agenda for the future. It targets a broad audience of people with CKD and their healthcare, while being mindful of implications for policy and payment.

### Chronic kidney disease-part 2: management and its complications [^92a039d6]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Due to the multifaceted aspects of kidney function, the management of CKD not only requires knowledge of kidney physiology and pathophysiology but also a keen understanding of how to diagnose, treat, and monitor the metabolic derangements and complications of reduced kidney function. In this article, we provide questions that cover a broad range of clinical scenarios that may test the clinical acumen of a kidney health professional. Each question starts with a brief clinical scenario to guide the reader. Questions are followed by a selection of answers. As in most clinical situations, a variety of tests and/or interventions may be appropriate. As knowledge on the management of kidney diseases and associated complications evolve, the optimal choice for these questions may also evolve.

### Global kidney health 2017 and beyond: a roadmap for closing gaps in care, research, and policy [^4c8b3a25]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

The global nephrology community recognises the need for a cohesive plan to address the problem of chronic kidney disease (CKD). In July, 2016, the International Society of Nephrology hosted a CKD summit of more than 85 people with diverse expertise and professional backgrounds from around the globe. The purpose was to identify and prioritise key activities for the next 5–10 years in the domains of clinical care, research, and advocacy and to create an action plan and performance framework based on ten themes: strengthen CKD surveillance; tackle major risk factors for CKD; reduce acute kidney injury-a special risk factor for CKD; enhance understanding of the genetic causes of CKD; establish better diagnostic methods in CKD; improve understanding of the natural course of CKD; assess and implement established treatment options in patients with CKD; improve management of symptoms and complications of CKD; develop novel therapeutic interventions to slow CKD progression and reduce CKD complications; and increase the quantity and quality of clinical trials in CKD. Each group produced a prioritised list of goals, activities, and a set of key deliverable objectives for each of the themes. The intended users of this action plan are clinicians, patients, scientists, industry partners, governments, and advocacy organisations. Implementation of this integrated comprehensive plan will benefit people who are at risk for or affected by CKD worldwide.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^151c3bc9]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 chronic kidney disease (CKD) guideline — rating of recommendations states that the strength of recommendations is "indicated as Level 1 or Level 2, and the certainty of the supporting evidence is shown as A, B, C, or D". Level 1 ("We recommend") implies for patients that "Most people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not", for clinicians that "Most patients should receive the recommended course of action", and for policy that "The recommendation can be evaluated as a candidate for developing a policy or a performance measure". Level 2 ("We suggest") implies for patients that "The majority of people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not", for clinicians that "Different choices will be appropriate for different patients. Each patient needs help to arrive at a management decision consistent with their values and preferences", and for policy that "The recommendation is likely to require substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders before policy can be determined". Certainty of evidence categories are defined as A "High" with "We are confident that the true effect is close to the estimate of the effect", B "Moderate" with "The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different", C "Low" with "The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect", and D "Very low" with "The estimate of effect is very uncertain, and often, it will be far from the true effect".

### Regenerative medicine in kidney disease [^3d44dec7]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

The treatment of renal failure has changed little in decades. Organ transplantation and dialysis continue to represent the only therapeutic options available. However, decades of fundamental research into the response of the kidney to acute injury and the processes driving progression to chronic kidney disease are beginning to open doors to new options. Similarly, continued investigations into the cellular and molecular basis of normal kidney development, together with major advances in stem cell biology, are now delivering options in regenerative medicine not possible as recently as a decade ago. In this review, we will discuss advances in regenerative medicine as it may be applied to the kidney. This will cover cellular therapies focused on ameliorating injury and improving repair as well as advancements in the generation of new renal tissue from stem/progenitor cells.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^41aed761]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to general principles, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to enable access to a patient-centered multidisciplinary care team consisting of dietary counseling, medication management, education, and counseling about different renal replacement modalities, transplant options, dialysis access surgery, and ethical, psychological, and social care for patients with CKD.

### The views of patients and carers in treatment decision making for chronic kidney disease: systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies [^c2faabb8]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Clinical guidelines in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Europe, and Australasia recommend that treatment options for chronic kidney disease include the preference of a fully informed patient. In the UK alone, 7000 patients a year progress to end stage kidney disease requiring transplantation, dialysis, or "supportive non-dialytic" (palliative) care. For most of these patients progression to end stage kidney disease can be anticipated, enabling patients' preferences for treatment to be incorporated into their care. Recent data from observational studies and the US Renal Data System, however, suggest that patients with chronic kidney disease may not be presented with adequate information on treatment options or given sufficient time in which to discuss management alternatives with their families or carers. Low rates of kidney transplantation in patients on low incomes and those from minority ethnic groups also suggest that patient and family preferences are not being taken into account.

Although large numbers of patients with chronic kidney disease exist worldwide, data on the factors that influence preferences for treatment from a patient or carer perspective are limited. Qualitative research methods used in focus groups or in-depth interviewing have the advantage of reporting the attitudes, feelings, and beliefs of patients, allowing readers some insight into their perspective. A synthesis of findings from several qualitative studies in chronic kidney disease has the ability to achieve a greater conceptual understanding of the topic beyond a single empirical study. Thematic synthesis, as first described in 1988, draws on the findings of original studies and uses those findings as data in a subsequent analysis. This allows readers to appreciate what has been discovered, build on what is already known, and translate these findings into their own clinical practice.

Awareness of the factors associated with decision making in the treatment of chronic kidney disease can provide health professionals with evidence on how best to deliver education programmes for patients and their families; it may also enhance communication and improve the capacity for patient and family involvement in shared decision making. We synthesised and analysed the views of patients and their informal carers on decision making in the treatment of chronic kidney disease and determined which factors influenced decisions about treatment.

### Systems biology and kidney disease [^b67a5f3c]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

The kidney is a complex organ responsible for maintaining multiple aspects of homeostasis in the human body. The combination of distinct, yet interrelated, molecular functions across different cell types make the delineation of factors associated with loss or decline in kidney function challenging. Consequently, there has been a paucity of new diagnostic markers and treatment options becoming available to clinicians and patients in managing kidney diseases. A systems biology approach to understanding the kidney leverages recent advances in computational technology and methods to integrate diverse sets of data. It has the potential to unravel the interplay of multiple genes, proteins, and molecular mechanisms that drive key functions in kidney health and disease. The emergence of large, detailed, multilevel biologic and clinical data from national databases, cohort studies, and trials now provide the critical pieces needed for meaningful application of systems biology approaches in nephrology. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the current state in the evolution of the field. Recent successes of systems biology to identify targeted therapies linked to mechanistic biomarkers in the kidney are described to emphasize the relevance to clinical care and the outlook for improving outcomes for patients with kidney diseases.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^2a9df281]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) recommendation strength nomenclature — Level 1 ("We recommend") means for patients that most people would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not; for clinicians that most patients should receive the recommended course of action; and for policy that the recommendation can be evaluated as a candidate for developing a policy or a performance measure. Level 2 ("We suggest") means for patients that the majority would want the recommended course of action but many would not; for clinicians that different choices will be appropriate for different patients and each patient needs help to arrive at a management decision consistent with their values and preferences; and for policy that the recommendation is likely to require substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders before policy can be determined.

### Kidney disease pathways, options and decisions: an environmental scan of international patient decision aids [^416dd786]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

This study critically evaluates the validity of patient decision aids (PtDAs) to support people with kidney disease making informed decisions between conservative management and dialysis options. PtDAs are designed to proactively support people's reasoning between treatment options. PtDAs use evidence from the decision sciences to ensure resources structure explicitly the decision problem, provide accurate and balanced information about all options and their consequences, enable people to evaluate these facts with their own values and reach a decision based on a trade-off of these evaluations. Studies evaluating PtDAs for the choices-between-dialysis decision show they increase patient knowledge and understanding of their kidney disease and their readiness to make a decision, helping them make dialysis decisions aligned with their preferences. It is unclear if PtDAs are sufficient to proactively support people's informed decisions between conservative management and renal replacement therapy across the longer-term trajectory of kidney disease.

The purpose of this work was to critically evaluate PtDAs developed to support patient–professional shared decision-making between dialysis and conservative management treatment pathways for people with EKD via an environmental scan of resources.

### Nanotherapeutics in kidney disease: innovations, challenges, and future directions [^acaa1de1]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

The treatment and management of kidney diseases present a significant global challenge, affecting over 800 million individuals and necessitating innovative therapeutic strategies that transcend symptomatic relief. The application of nanotechnology to therapies for kidney diseases, while still in its early stages, holds transformative potential for improving treatment outcomes. Recent advancements in nanoparticle-based drug delivery leverage the unique physicochemical properties of nanoparticles for targeted and controlled therapeutic delivery to the kidneys. Current research is focused on understanding the functional and phenotypic changes in kidney cells during both acute and chronic conditions, allowing for the identification of optimal target cells. In addition, the development of tailored nanomedicines enhances their retention and binding to key renal membranes and cell populations, ultimately improving localization, tolerability, and efficacy. However, significant barriers remain, including inconsistent nanoparticle synthesis and the complexity of kidney-specific targeting. To overcome these challenges, the field requires advanced synthesis techniques, refined targeting strategies, and the establishment of animal models that accurately reflect human kidney diseases. These efforts are critical for the clinical application of nanotherapeutics, which promise novel solutions for kidney disease management. This review evaluates a substantial body of in vivo research, highlighting the prospects, challenges, and opportunities presented by nanotechnology-mediated therapies and their potential to transform kidney disease treatment.

### Recent advances in diabetic kidney disease [^749982bf]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

What are the general treatment options for DKD?

Intensive glycemic control is critical in the prevention of DKD in the early course of the disease. However, a number of studies have shown that intensive glucose control may not reduce the risk of CKD progression or cardiovascular mortality in advanced stages of DKD. The KDIGO guidelines recommend a target HbA1c ranging from < 6.5 to < 8.0%, with the choice of an exact target guided by the extent of hypoglycemia risk in each patient.

For glycemic control, current guidelines suggest using both metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors for patients with DKD and GFR > 30 ml/min per 1.73 m². Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists can be added to manage hyperglycemia if needed. Uncontrolled hypertension can worsen DKD and increase the risk of progression to ESKD. The KDIGO guidelines recommend using an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) to maintain blood pressure below 130/80 mmHg in all patients with CKD and albuminuria regardless of their diabetic status. Prior studies showed that ACEis and ARBs offer kidney protection by lowering proteinuria and slowing the rate of CKD progression. Combination regimens with ACEis and ARBs are not recommended due to an increased risk of acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia.

Regarding the non-pharmacological therapies, KDIGO guidelines recommend the implementation of lifestyle modification among DKD patients, including low sodium intake (< 2 g/day), maintaining a protein intake of 0.8 g/kg/day for patients who are not on dialysis, and moderate-intensity physical activity for a cumulative duration of at least 150 min per week as tolerated.

### Physiological principles underlying the kidney targeting of renal nanomedicines [^5cd585c9]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

Kidney disease affects more than 10% of the global population and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality, highlighting a need for new therapeutic options. Engineered nanoparticles for the treatment of kidney diseases (renal nanomedicines) represent one such option, enabling the delivery of targeted therapeutics to specific regions of the kidney. Although they are underdeveloped compared with nanomedicines for diseases such as cancer, findings from preclinical studies suggest that renal nanomedicines may hold promise. However, the physiological principles that govern the in vivo transport and interactions of renal nanomedicines differ from those of cancer nanomedicines, and thus a comprehensive understanding of these principles is needed to design nanomedicines that effectively and specifically target the kidney while ensuring biosafety in their future clinical translation. Herein, we summarize the current understanding of factors that influence the glomerular filtration, tubular uptake, tubular secretion and extrusion of nanoparticles, including size and charge dependency, and the role of specific transporters and processes such as endocytosis. We also describe how the transport and uptake of nanoparticles is altered by kidney disease and discuss strategic approaches by which nanoparticles may be harnessed for the detection and treatment of a variety of kidney diseases.

### The rationale, design and baseline data of FLOW, a kidney outcomes trial with once-weekly semaglutide in people with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^006ab06a]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What is already known about this subject?

Evidence has emerged of the potential kidney-protective effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
To date, data have mostly been derived from cardiovascular (CV) outcome or glycaemic control trials featuring populations not selected for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and/or with kidney disease events as secondary outcomes.
Reduction of CKD progression by GLP-1RAs is yet to be confirmed and requires dedicated trials of kidney outcomes with GLP-1RAs.

What this study adds?

FLOW (NCT03819153) is a dedicated kidney outcomes trial to assess semaglutide, a once-weekly GLP-1RA, in a population with CKD and T2D at high risk of kidney disease progression.
The trial is designed to assess whether treatment with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide delays the progression of kidney disease and lowers the risk of kidney failure, as well as kidney and CV disease mortality, compared with placebo in people with CKD and T2D.
Baseline data from the FLOW trial, which is ongoing, show that enrolled participants are nearly all classified as high or very high risk for CKD progression according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines categorisation, which assesses risk based on estimated glomerular filtration rate and urine albumin:creatinine ratio.

What impact this may have on practice or policy?

The FLOW trial will provide evidence on the effects of semaglutide on kidney outcomes, potentially expanding treatment options for patients with T2D to slow the progression of CKD and reduce kidney failure.

### Novel therapeutic approaches for COVID-19 in chronic kidney disease and transplant [^7adc2a7a]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the novel virus responsible for the current worldwide pandemic. The scientific and healthcare communities have made every effort to discover and implement treatment options at a historic pace. Patients with kidney disease are uniquely vulnerable to an infectious pandemic because of their need to be in frequent contact with the healthcare system for life-sustaining renal replacement therapy whether it be by dialysis or transplant.

Recent Findings

The use of targeted viral therapies, extracorporeal therapies, immunosuppressive therapy and public health interventions are important in the management of patients with COVID-19 but require special consideration in patients with kidney disease because of the complexity of their condition.

Summary

Here, we discuss some of the major efforts made to prevent spread and emerging treatment options for this virus, as they pertain to patients with kidney disease.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^0b56e721]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Special considerations — lifespan, sex, and gender in chronic kidney disease (CKD) care emphasize that kidney diseases affect people at different times and with different impacts across the whole lifespan, making a personalized approach that considers age, sex, and gender for diagnosis, risk assessment, and treatment critical. At the extremes of age — the very young and the very old — diagnostic procedures, treatment aims, treatment modalities, and decision-making differ due to differences in prognosis, treatment options, and prioritization. Sex (biological attributes) and gender (socio-cultural factors), along with intersecting factors including geographical location, socioeconomic status (SES), and race and ethnicity, play important roles in kidney health and disease, and the guideline incorporates statements where such special considerations are relevant to clinical practice and understanding across the lifespan.

### How do older patients with advanced kidney disease, and their family members, understand kidney function and failure? A qualitative study [^b91ec8ca]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, we found older patients with advanced CKD and their family members held similar, simplified constructs of kidney function and failure. Whilst similar misperceptions have been demonstrated amongst younger people with kidney disease, our study identifies the unique implications of these where older individuals face a decision between dialysis and CKM. Current approaches to CKD education may be unsuitable for this older patient group and their families, for whom decisions about preparation for kidney failure are especially preference-sensitive. Evidence-based guidance and clinician education are needed to ensure information about kidney failure and its treatments is effectively communicated. Revising inaccurate and misleading terminology may help patients and families to make better informed and holistic choices about their future priorities and treatment preferences. The recently advocated move towards use of risk-based equations for guiding CKD referral and treatment decisions could provide an opportunity to re-examine how best to communicate disease severity in CKD, and its implications for treatment decisions, to older patients and their families. Improvement requires the development of evidence-based communication guidance, training and education, decision aids, and health literacy assessment; adapted for specific patient groups, all of which have the potential to enhance shared decision-making, advance care planning, and patient-centred outcomes. Our findings suggest that clinicians should shift focus away from numerical measures of disease severity towards wider factors guiding treatment decisions, such as quality of life, individualised values and goals. This may help people living with advanced kidney disease to better trade-off the benefits and burdens of available treatments.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^5e61e9ce]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) convened a work group to review the 2024 KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guideline for the management of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The KDOQI Work Group reviewed the KDIGO guideline statements and practice points and provided perspective for implementation within the context of clinical practice in the United States. In general, the KDOQI Work Group concurs with several recommendations and practice points proposed by the KDIGO guidelines regarding CKD evaluation, risk assessment, and management options (both lifestyle and medications) for slowing CKD progression, addressing CKD-related complications, and improving cardiovascular outcomes. The KDOQI Work Group acknowledges the growing evidence base to support the use of several novel agents such as sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors for several CKD etiologies, and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists and nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists for type 2 CKD in setting of diabetes. Further, KDIGO guidelines emphasize the importance of team-based care which was also recognized by the work group as a key factor to address the growing CKD burden. In this commentary, the Work Group has also assessed and discussed various barriers and potential opportunities for implementing the recommendations put forth in the 2024 KDIGO guidelines while the scientific community continues to focus on enhancing early identification of CKD and discovering newer therapies for managing kidney disease.

### Chronic kidney disease [^c982bc57]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is a general term for heterogeneous disorders affecting kidney structure and function. The 2002 guidelines for definition and classification of this disease represented an important shift towards its recognition as a worldwide public health problem that should be managed in its early stages by general internists. Disease and management are classified according to stages of disease severity, which are assessed from glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria, and clinical diagnosis (cause and pathology). Chronic kidney disease can be detected with routine laboratory tests, and some treatments can prevent development and slow disease progression, reduce complications of decreased GFR and risk of cardiovascular disease, and improve survival and quality of life. In this Seminar we discuss disease burden, recommendations for assessment and management, and future challenges. We emphasise clinical practice guidelines, clinical trials, and areas of uncertainty.

### Evaluation and management of obesity in chronic kidney disease [^5d7179b7]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Obesity is arguably the premier global public health problem of our era. It is also an independent risk factor for the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and adverse outcomes in persons with CKD. Fortunately, effective treatment options for obesity have proliferated in just the last few years. These newer therapies in conjunction with older treatments offer great potential in treating obesity and CKD, though many questions remain about their use, efficacy, and place within the overall therapeutic plan. This paper will provide a discussion of the definition of obesity, its etiology, and its importance as a risk factor for CKD and other kidney-associated problems. It will then review current treatment options for obesity and the related evidence base. Finally, it will address major topics or controversies that remain unresolved and identify obstacles to effective treatment.

### Cell and gene therapy for kidney disease [^a2fca8a0]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

Kidney disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality across the globe. Current interventions for kidney disease include dialysis and renal transplantation, which have limited efficacy or availability and are often associated with complications such as cardiovascular disease and immunosuppression. There is therefore a pressing need for novel therapies for kidney disease. Notably, as many as 30% of kidney disease cases are caused by monogenic disease and are thus potentially amenable to genetic medicine, such as cell and gene therapy. Systemic disease that affects the kidney, such as diabetes and hypertension, might also be targetable by cell and gene therapy. However, although there are now several approved gene and cell therapies for inherited diseases that affect other organs, none targets the kidney. Promising recent advances in cell and gene therapy have been made, including in the kidney research field, suggesting that this form of therapy might represent a potential solution for kidney disease in the future. In this Review, we describe the potential for cell and gene therapy in treating kidney disease, focusing on recent genetic studies, key advances and emerging technologies, and we describe several crucial considerations for renal genetic and cell therapies.

### Detecting and managing the patient with chronic kidney disease in primary care: a review of the latest guidelines [^d865ac4f]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major global health problem, affecting about 9.5% of the population and 850million people worldwide. In primary care, most CKD is caused by diabetes and/or hypertension, but a substantial proportion of cases may have alternative causes. During the early stages, CKD is asymptomatic, and many people are unaware that they are living with the disease. Despite the lack of symptoms, CKD is associated with elevated risks of cardiovascular disease, progressive kidney disease, kidney failure and premature mortality. Risk reduction strategies are effective and cost-effective but require early diagnosis through testing of the estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria in high-risk populations. Once diagnosed, the treatment of CKD centres around lifestyle interventions, blood pressure and glycaemic control, and preventative treatments for cardiovascular disease and kidney disease progression. Most patients with CKD should be managed with statins, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors. Additional treatment options to reduce cardiorenal risk are available in patients with diabetes, including glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. The Kidney Failure Risk Equation is a new tool that can support the identification of patients at high risk of progressive kidney disease and kidney failure and can be used to guide referrals to nephrology. This review summarizes the latest guidance relevant to managing adults with, or at risk of, CKD and provides practical advice for managing patients with CKD in primary care.

### Evidence underlying KDIGO (kidney disease: improving global outcomes) guideline recommendations: a systematic review [^3a8e8aac]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) clinical practice guidelines establish international recommendations for the definition and treatment of kidney disease. Our objective was to characterize the strength of evidence supporting the KDIGO guidelines, the class of recommendations made, and the relationship between these.

Study Design

We reviewed and abstracted the level of evidence and strength of recommendations in the currently available KDIGO guidelines.

Setting & Population

KDIGO clinical practice guidelines target care of patients with kidney disease to improve outcomes.

Selection Criteria For Studies

All KDIGO guidelines published on the KDIGO website as of November 2013 were included.

Predictor

Recommendations pertaining to disease, diagnosis, or treatment.

Outcomes

Levels of evidence and strength of recommendations.

Results

Of 853 recommendations in 9 guidelines, 5% were supported by level A quality evidence; 17%, level B; 31%, level C; 18%, level D; and 20%, ungraded evidence. The strength of recommendations was class 1 for 25%, class 2 for 54%, and ungraded for 20%. Only 3% of recommendations were class 1 in strength and supported by level A evidence. Of the recommendations, 2% concerned disease definition and classification; 29%, diagnosis; and 69%, treatment.

Limitations

Our study included only the KDIGO guidelines. We did not assess historical changes in nephrology guidelines recommendations.

Conclusions

KDIGO recommendations were based largely on weak evidence, reflecting expert opinion. Few recommendations were both strong and supported by high-level evidence.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^6c9dd275]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) grading determinants — The strength of a recommendation was graded as Level 1 or Level 2 and was determined by the balance of benefits and harms, the overall certainty of the evidence, patient values and preferences, resource use and costs, and other considerations; the overall certainty of the evidence was graded high (A), moderate (B), low (C), or very low (D). Healthcare and non–healthcare resources in the treatment management pathway were considered when grading, and no formal economic evaluations, including cost-effectiveness analysis, were conducted. Practice points represent the expert judgment of the guideline Work Group and may be based on limited evidence; each guideline recommendation provides an assessment of the strength (Level 1, "we recommend" or Level 2, "we suggest") and the overall certainty (A, B, C, D). Table 48 clarifies that larger differences between desirable and undesirable effects make a strong recommendation more likely, higher certainty makes a strong recommendation more likely, more variability or uncertainty in values and preferences makes a weak recommendation more likely, and higher costs make a strong recommendation less likely.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^9ca81c01]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Evaluation of chronic kidney disease (CKD) — Practice Point 1.1.1: Test people at risk for and with chronic kidney disease (CKD) using both urine albumin measurement and assessment of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Early detection of any chronic disease, including CKD, provides greater opportunities to reduce morbidity as treatments can be initiated earlier in the disease course, and because treatments for CKD provide benefits in reducing risk for both cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CKD progression, strategies that promote early detection of CKD should improve kidney and non–kidney-related outcomes. Knowledge of level of albuminuria and GFR also helps guide clinical decisions beyond initiating treatments specifically for CKD, and initial testing of blood and urine to detect CKD is important, with confirmatory testing if initial findings indicate the presence of abnormalities of creatinine/eGFR or albuminuria. Interviews with people who have CKD have provided evidence that many would alter their lifestyle if they received a diagnosis of CKD, and if a familial form of kidney disease is suspected, the diagnosis of the disease in one person may allow detection in other family members.

VA/DoD chronic kidney disease — recommendation status and strength for SDM and referral are described as follows: "Recommendation 8 is Not reviewed, Not changed, while Recommendations 9 and 10 are Not reviewed, Amended; hence, the Work Group did not conduct an updated evidence review but reviewed the evidence identified in the 2019 VA/DOD CKD CPG". The Work Group states that "the benefits of SDM in the care of patients with progressive kidney disease outweigh the harms/burdens", that "Timely education for patients with progressive CKD is essential so that they can articulate their goals of care and make an informed decision about the direction of their treatment", and that "Early referral facilitates adequate preparation for whichever treatment option the patient chooses (i.e., vascular access placement or palliative care referral)". It further reports that "The Work Group decided to carry forward three Weak for recommendations, two of which were combined into 2025 Recommendation 9, and one Neither for nor against recommendation, suggesting the utilization of SDM involving the patient, caregivers, the PCP, and the nephrology team to achieve patient-centered treatment goals".

### Preventing chronic kidney disease and maintaining kidney health: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) controversies conference [^489d751b]. Kidney International (2025). Medium credibility.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Given the growing global threats to kidney health and the known benefits of kidney protective strategies and therapies, the current era holds an opportunity to broaden focus from managing existing CKD to maintaining kidney health. Based on a large body of evidence, the consensus of meeting participants centered on a lifespan approach that takes into consideration physical, mental, and social determinants of health. Beyond healthy lifestyle and treatment of risk factors, therapeutics such as SGLT2i and GLP-1RA may prevent or regress CKD. To achieve goals for optimal, cost-effective means for implementing CKD prevention, the nephrology and primary care communities must ambitiously advocate for system-level change focused on kidney risk profiling and appropriate testing (including both eGFR and UACR). Future kidney guidelines may consider recommendations for screening to identify individuals at high risk of CKD, similar to the approach used in diabetes (Table 5). Additionally, measures of overall well-being can expand relevant kidney health outcomes. Societal perspectives should be considered in messaging the imperatives for CKD prevention to broad public health audiences. Endorsements from authoritative bodies such as the World Health Organization add legitimacy to health-related messages. Application of logic models can be used to enhance understanding of interdependent systems for implementation efforts. Collaborations among primary care and specialist health care professionals, health systems, payers, and policymakers are needed to align goals.

### Evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease: synopsis of the kidney disease: improving global outcomes 2024 clinical practice guideline [^b4f476fc]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Description

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) organization updated its existing clinical practice guideline in 2024 to provide guidance on the evaluation, management, and treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults and children who are not receiving kidney replacement therapy.

Methods

The KDIGO CKD Guideline Work Group defined the scope of the guideline and determined topics for systematic review. An independent Evidence Review Team systematically reviewed the evidence and graded the certainty of evidence for each of the review topics. Latest searches of the English-language literature were done in July 2023. Final modification of the guideline was informed by a public review process during summer of 2023 involving registered stakeholders.

Recommendations

The full guideline included 28 recommendations and 141 practice points. This synopsis focuses on the recommendations that have the greatest evidence. Practice points reflect the expert opinion of the group where evidence is not that strong. Recommendations include greater emphasis on cystatin C for assessment of glomerular filtration rate, point-of-care testing in remote areas, a shift to an individualized risk-based approach to predict kidney failure, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors for some patients with CKD with and without diabetes, and statin use for adults older than 50 years and CKD. Together the recommendations and practice points provide guidance for how to evaluate and manage persons with CKD.

### Diagnostic tests and treatment options in glomerular disease: 2014 update [^829aca0a]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Glomerular diseases historically have been challenging disorders to comprehend and treat for patients and physicians alike. Kidney biopsy is the gold standard of diagnosis, but the link between pathophysiology and the histologic representation of kidney injury has remained elusive in many of these diseases. As a result, treatment of glomerular disease usually involves therapies that are not specific to disease pathogenesis, such as blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and various immunosuppression regimens. Recent research has resulted in greater insight into some glomerular diseases, leading to the hope that new diagnostic tests and treatments targeting disease-specific mechanisms are on the horizon. We review recent progress on the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of 4 glomerular diseases: immunoglobulin A nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, the C3 glomerulopathies, and idiopathic membranous nephropathy.

### Precision medicine in kidney disease: the patient's view [^78e6ea6a]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2020). High credibility.

Research in the field of nephrology continues to improve our understanding of the mechanisms that promote and drive kidney disease, including how human genetic variation might affect disease predisposition and progression. One of the goals of these research efforts is to inform and enable the implementation of precision medicine, whereby patient management is tailored to the individual according to the mechanisms underlying their disease to increase the chances of therapeutic success. To achieve this goal, we need a clearer understanding of the molecular pathways that underlie the many different causes of kidney failure. These research insights are being increasingly translated and implemented into clinical practice. In this Viewpoint, we asked three individuals who have been affected by kidney failure for their views on the importance of understanding the drivers of kidney disease and, on a personal level, what they hope might be achieved with this information.

### The cardio-kidney patient: epidemiology, clinical characteristics and therapy [^582ba1bd]. Circulation Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk to develop cardiovascular disease with its manifestations coronary artery disease, heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. In addition, the presence of CKD has a major impact on the prognosis of patients with cardiovascular disease, leading to an increased morbidity and mortality if both comorbidities are present. Therapeutic options including medical therapy and interventional treatment are often limited in patients with advanced CKD, and in most cardiovascular outcome trials, patients with advanced CKD have been excluded. Thus, in many patients, treatment strategies for cardiovascular disease need to be extrapolated from trials conducted in patients without CKD. The current article summarizes the epidemiology, clinical presentation, and treatment options for the most prevalent manifestations of cardiovascular disease in CKD and discusses the currently available treatment options to reduce morbidity and mortality in this high-risk population.

The K/DOQI guidelines recommend that patients with nondiabetic kidney disease and a random urine total protein-to-creatinine ratio greater than 200 mg per g, and those with diabetic kidney disease, should be treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker, regardless of the presence of hypertension. 15 ACE inhibitors and ARBs have similar ability to reduce proteinuria and have achieved an absolute risk reduction for requiring dialysis from 3. 5 to 6 percent over two to three years in patients with diabetic and nondiabetic kidney disease. 16–19 There is less evidence to support the effectiveness of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in slowing the progression of CKD in patients without proteinuria. The benefit of these medications in older adults with CKD is uncertain, because most of these patients do not have proteinuria, and most trials did not enroll patients older than 70 years.

20 There is often concern about the benefits and risks of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in patients with advanced CKD, but evidence suggests a reduction of adverse renal outcomes even in advanced stages. 21, 22 Adverse effects of ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy include hyperkalemia and a decline in GFR, but these agents generally may be continued if the GFR decline over four months is less than 30 percent from baseline value and serum potassium is 5. 5 mEq per L or less.
15. 28 A large randomized controlled trial in patients with moderate to advanced CKD demonstrated that simvastatin/ezetimibe reduced major atherosclerotic events by 17 percent, but not progression to dialysis or transplantation.
29.

Based on evidence of the benefits of lipid lowering in the general population, the K/DOQI dyslipidemia guidelines concur with the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines and recommend that all adults with CKD have a complete fasting lipid profile, with treatment goals of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels less than 100 mg per dL and triglyceride levels less than 150 mg per dL. Three randomized controlled trials have greatly affected practice in this area. Two trials randomized CKD patients to higher versus lower hemoglobin targets, which were achieved with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents.

### Kidney and cardiovascular-protective benefits of combination drug therapies in chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes [^7e7c1bcf]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Given the substantial burden of chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes, an aggressive approach to treatment is required. Despite the benefits of guideline-directed therapy, there remains a high residual risk of continuing progression of chronic kidney disease and of cardiovascular events. Historically, a linear approach to pharmacologic management of chronic kidney disease has been used, in which drugs are added, then adjusted, optimized, or stopped in a stepwise manner based on their efficacy, toxicity, effects on a patient's quality of life, and cost. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, which may result in missing a window of opportunity to slow chronic kidney disease progression. Instead, a pillar approach has been proposed to enable earlier treatment that simultaneously targets multiple pathways involved in disease progression. Combination therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes is being investigated in several clinical trials. In this article, we discuss current treatment options for patients with chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes and provide a rationale for tailored combinations of therapies with complementary mechanisms of action to optimize therapy using a pillar-based treatment strategy.

### Cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease: pathophysiological insights and therapeutic options [^ca517fda]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Patients with CKD have high cardiovascular risk, with cardiovascular death being the leading cause of death. Several novel therapies to decrease the risk of cardiovascular diseases in CKD are in clinical development or have been already established, raising the hope that cardiovascular risk in patients with CKD may be modifiable in the future. Still, the lack of data from large cardiovascular outcome trials in the high-risk group of patients with CKD should be a call for action to ensure that novel therapeutic options are assessed in dedicated trials in the CKD population, in particular in those with advanced CKD, thus paving the way toward a more evidence-based approach to reduce cardiovascular risk in CKD.

### Pillar risk-based treatment for chronic kidney disease in people with type 2 diabetes: a narrative review [^b4e2a59a]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease continues to be a significant burden for people living with type 2 diabetes, despite the available guideline-directed treatment options. Traditionally, a stepwise approach has been implemented for the management of chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, which involves the linear sequential initiation of one therapy after the other on the basis of an individual's treatment outcomes. However, this approach is not beneficial for all individuals, as it can lead to treatment inertia and subsequent disease progression. Therefore, primary care practitioners should consider implementing a more proactive treatment strategy to optimize care. The pillar risk-based approach is an emerging concept with goals of glucose control and blood pressure control as well as comprising simultaneous or rapid sequential initiation of multiple therapies, such as renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi), sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (finerenone), and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, which target the different hemodynamic, metabolic, and fibrotic/inflammatory pathways involved in chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes. This approach enables earlier chronic kidney disease risk reduction, and the recently published CONFIDENCE trial reported tolerability and efficacy of simultaneous initiation of two of these therapies (finerenone and empagliflozin) in those already receiving RASi. This review article provides primary care practitioners with practical considerations, discussing current guideline-directed treatment options for chronic kidney disease in people with type 2 diabetes in the context of a historical stepwise approach versus the new patient-centric pillar risk-based approach.

### The next generation of therapeutics for chronic kidney disease [^f88591a5]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2016). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) represents a leading cause of death in the United States. There is no cure for this disease, with current treatment strategies relying on blood pressure control through blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Such approaches only delay the development of end-stage kidney disease and can be associated with serious side effects. Recent identification of several novel mechanisms contributing to CKD development - including vascular changes, loss of podocytes and renal epithelial cells, matrix deposition, inflammation and metabolic dysregulation - has revealed new potential therapeutic approaches for CKD. This Review assesses emerging strategies and agents for CKD treatment, highlighting the associated challenges in their clinical development.

People with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk for kidney failure, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and premature mortality. Recent clinical trials support new approaches to treat diabetes and CKD. The 2022 American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes and the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease each provide evidence-based recommendations for management. A joint group of ADA and KDIGO representatives reviewed and developed a series of consensus statements to guide clinical care from the ADA and KDIGO guidelines. The published guidelines are aligned in the areas of CKD screening and diagnosis, glycemia monitoring, lifestyle therapies, treatment goals, and pharmacologic management. Recommendations include comprehensive care in which pharmacotherapy that is proven to improve kidney and cardiovascular outcomes is layered on a foundation of healthy lifestyle. Consensus statements provide specific guidance on use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, metformin, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, and a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. These areas of consensus provide clear direction for implementation of care to improve clinical outcomes of people with diabetes and CKD.

### Going upstream: coordination to improve CKD care [^c032a20d]. Seminars in Dialysis (2016). Low credibility.

Care coordination for patients with chronic kidney disease has been shown to be effective in improving outcomes and reducing costs. However, few patients with CKD benefit from this systematic management of their kidney disease and other medical conditions. As a result, outcomes for patients with kidney disease are not optimal, and their cost of care is increased. For those patients who transition to kidney failure treatment in the United States, the transition does not go as well as it could. The effectiveness of treatments to delay progression of kidney disease in contemporary clinical practice does not match the efficacy of these treatments in clinical trials. Conservative care for kidney disease, which should be an option for patients who are very old and very sick, is not considered often enough or seriously enough. Opportunities for early and even pre-emptive transplantation are missed, as are opportunities for home dialysis. The process of dialysis access creation is rarely optimal. The consequence is care which is not as good as it could be, and much more expensive than it should be. We describe our initial efforts to implement care coordination for chronic kidney disease in routine clinical care and attempt to project some of the benefits to patients and the cost savings.

### The views of patients and carers in treatment decision making for chronic kidney disease: systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies [^f19f5e0d]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Gaining knowledge of options

The theme gaining knowledge of options described the ways in which the patients and their carers learnt about treatment options, and the factors influencing their decision making. Peer influence referred to the impact of other patients' experiences on treatment decision making. Timing of information related to the provision of information on treatment options along the trajectory of chronic kidney disease, with reference to other events such as hospital admissions for acute illness or creation of vascular access.

Peer influence — Patients were greatly influenced by the experiences of other patients. They imagined themselves in a similar position (for example, looking really well after transplantation or managing a Tenckhoff catheter) and described being inspired to carry out dialysis themselves. Similarly, some patients dismissed a particular therapy after seeing complications in other patients, such as refusing haemodialysis after seeing a swollen and disfigured arm following a fistula operation.

Timing of information — Ten studies reported the importance of the timing of information on treatment options. Patients recounted being too unwell to take in the information presented or too rushed into making a decision without having time to discuss the options with their families. Information about kidney transplantation was commonly introduced to patients after dialysis had been established. For some patients information about treatment options came after undergoing surgery for vascular access.

### Challenges in conducting clinical trials in nephrology: conclusions from a kidney disease-improving global outcomes (KDIGO) controversies conference [^8d08e61e]. Kidney International (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects ∼10% of adults in high-income countries, and its treatment is burdensome and costly, accounting for substantial proportions of health budgets. It is now recognized as an important cause of death, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where diabetes is becoming common and resources for treatment are limited. Other conditions affecting the kidney, such as acute kidney injury, and kidney stone disease, also contribute a substantial burden of morbidity and mortality. Despite the high individual patient and societal burden of kidney diseases, the amount of reliable information available to guide kidney patient care is very limited. Although some treatments have been assessed in randomized trials, most of these have been too small to detect treatment effects of a magnitude that can realistically be achieved with a single intervention (e.g. reductions of 15%–20% in major outcomes such as death or disability). Experience to date indicates that conducting trials in patients with kidney disease on the sort of scale that has led to major therapeutic advances in other specialties (e.g. oncology, diabetes, and cardiology) is challenging.

### Grading evidence and recommendations for clinical practice guidelines in nephrology. A position statement from kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) [^71e503d1]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

Considerable variation in grading systems used to rate the strength of guideline recommendations and the quality of the supporting evidence in Nephrology highlights the need for a uniform, internationally accepted, rigorous system. In 2004, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) commissioned a methods expert group to recommend an approach for grading in future nephrology guidelines. This position statement by KDIGO recommends adopting the Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for the grading of evidence and guidelines on interventions. The GRADE approach appraises systematic reviews of the benefits and harms of an intervention to determine its net health benefit. The system considers the design, quality, and quantity of studies as well as the consistency and directness of findings when grading the quality of evidence. The strength of the recommendation builds on the quality of the evidence and additional considerations including costs. Adaptations of the GRADE approach are presented to address some issues pertinent to the field of nephrology, including (1) the need to extrapolate from studies performed predominantly in patients without kidney disease, and (2) the need to use qualitative summaries of effects when it is not feasible to quantitatively summarize them. Further refinement of the system will be required for grading of evidence on questions other than those related to intervention effects, such as diagnostic accuracy and prognosis.

Introduction

Acute and chronic kidney diseases encompass a vast range of etiologies that affect patients in all demographics. Kidney disease is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. For example, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an important risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. It is estimated that approximately 3 million Canadians are living with CKD due to the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hypertension. CKD is often caused by an initial insult or disease within the kidney tissue, which causes permanent disruption of normal function and persists into a chronic, progressive condition. To date, the majority of kidney diseases are diagnosed on morphological or clinical grounds with only general biomarkers available to stratify risk, guide care, and monitor therapy. Furthermore, due to an inadequate understanding of disease pathogenesis and a paucity of specific biomarker developments, treatment options are generally non-specific (e.g. use of steroids or anti-proliferative agents) and applied broadly with limited success.

There is a great need to better understand the underlying etiology of various kidney diseases. Moreover, the application of genetic and molecular knowledge to the human condition is essential to further incorporate mechanistic data to existing morphologic disease classification. These two fundamental events are essential not only to reveal an individuals' risk or prognosis with kidney disease, but to also identify improved and targeted treatment options. In combination with well-established clinical parameters and risk models, the incorporation of genetic/molecular data into patient care is, in essence, the definition of precision (or personalized) medicine that will surmount to a substantial shift in the very nature of renal pathology and nephrology practice.

The past decade has been marked by an increase in strategies to bring precision medicine to the forefront of healthcare. As a result, the need to establish appropriate infrastructure to link patients and high quality clinical data to advanced molecular and genetic technologies has become apparent. A cornerstone to achieving this capacity is the development of biobanks that can collect and maintain collections of human biospecimens needed to support precision medicine advances in kidney disease. Due to the rising prevalence of kidney diseases and CKD in Canada, as well as the critical need for improved diagnostic testing methods and treatment options in this patient population, in 2015 the University of Calgary established the Biobank for the Molecular Classification of Kidney Disease (BMCKD). In this paper, we describe the planning, execution and operational aspects of the BMCKD. We also review some of the short and long term challenges encountered in the process to serve as a reference for other centres planning to enter into this exciting area of medicine.

### Kidney disease: improving global outcomes [^226f74ea]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2009). Medium credibility.

Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) is an independent organization with the mission to improve care and outcomes of patients with kidney disease worldwide through the development and coordination of clinical practice guidelines. KDIGO has established firm links with other organizations that have previously produced clinical practice guidelines in the field of kidney disease. The first three KDIGO guidelines — treatment of hepatitis C, management of bone and mineral disease, and care of kidney transplant recipients — have been finalized and the next three — acute kidney injury, management of glomerulonephritis, and management of blood pressure in chronic kidney disease — are under development. The ultimate goal is to cover most major aspects of care for patients with kidney disease. Corner stones of KDIGO's guideline development process are independent, multidisciplinary, international work groups, close collaboration with professional methodology experts who perform systematic evidence reviews, and open public review of each guideline. Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology is applied for grading the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. International conferences organized by KDIGO support the coordination of guideline development, assess the suitability of guideline topics and help to establish global consensus on definitions and policies.

### Preventing chronic kidney disease and maintaining kidney health: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) controversies conference [^b21ac6f7]. Kidney International (2025). Medium credibility.

The primary focus of care for chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been managing progression, complications, and kidney failure after the development of CKD. Maintaining or restoring kidney health has received scant attention within nephrology or the broader medical community. However, promoting kidney health and preventing CKD could save millions of lives and markedly reduce health care costs.

Globally, > 800 million individuals live with CKD, and > 2 million die each year, with one-half of these deaths occurring due to lack of access to kidney replacement therapy (KRT) in the form of dialysis or transplantation. - The cost of KRT is extraordinarily high, consuming up to 3% of health care budgets in high-income countries (HICs). Approximately 40% of HICs and 70% of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) do not provide insurance coverage for KRT, resulting in high out-of-pocket costs that can preclude adequate access to lifesaving care. Additionally, dialysis, especially hemodialysis, has an unsustainable environmental impact.

The global age-standardized mortality rate of CKD is increasing, and CKD is predicted to be the fifth leading cause of death globally by 2040. Both public health surveillance of CKD and global public health strategies to maintain kidney health are urgently needed. Efforts to address the CKD epidemic require interventions to maintain kidney health because current approaches that only address established CKD are not effectively curbing kidney failure or related conditionssuch as cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer,- and infection. Indeed, the majority of individuals die from CKD complications before reaching kidney failure.

In December of 2023, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) held a Controversies Conference to assess the state of knowledge related to CKD prevention across the lifespan. At the conference, international experts from multiple health care and scientific disciplines as well as individuals living with kidney disease focused on the evidence regarding primary prevention, considering lifestyle and pharmacologic approaches to prevent CKD onset. The potential for arresting CKD progression or inducing regression was also discussed.

### Renal association commentary on the KDIGO (2017) clinical practice guideline update for the diagnosis, evaluation, prevention, and treatment of CKD-MBD [^7397f264]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Rationale

Recommendation 4.3.3 maintains the same language but has been broadened from CKD G3a-G3b to CKD G3a-G5D in light of the revised bone biopsy recommendation (recommendation 3.2.2). Although this largely unchanged recommendation continues to emphasise the lack of definitive clinical trial evidence on the efficacy of antiresorptive medications in patients with CKD-MBD, the growing clinical experience with these agents in patients with CKD would appear to have addressed, at least in part, some of the concerns raised in the 2009 KDIGO Guideline.

The updated guideline recommendation remains broad in its treatment approach and does not support prioritising one agent over another. Treatment choices for patients with CKD at risk for fracture should consider treatment of underlying biochemical abnormalities, in addition to treatment with an antiresorptive medication. Clinicians are also asked to consider whether the type of renal osteodystrophy diagnosed by bone biopsy will inform treatment decisions, as well as to take into account the course of kidney function decline. The narrative to this recommendation further implies the need for individualised treatment strategy.

The suggested approach, perhaps more pragmatic given available evidence, is applicable in the UK. However, there may be some ambiguity facing implementation of the guideline update in clinical practice because of both the inherent challenges in using biomarkers to predict underlying bone histology, and the present practical constraints in performing bone biopsies in the UK. These deficiencies are likely to impede on the selection of an appropriate pharmacological treatment for this population. The Renal Association also notes that antiresportive therapies are not licensed in children and most are not authorised for those with eGFR < 30 ml/min/m 2.

RA recommendation

In patients with CKD G3a–G5D and evidence of MBD, we suggest that treatment choices take specific side effects into account and the risk of their administration must be weighed against the accuracy of the diagnosis of the underlying bone phenotype.

Chapter 5: Evaluation and treatment of kidney transplant bone disease

2009 KDIGO guideline

5.5: In patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate greater than approximately 30 ml/min/1.73 m², we suggest measuring BMD in the first 3 months after kidney transplant if they receive corticosteroids, or have risk factors for osteoporosis as in the general population (2D).

2017 KDIGO update

5.5: In patients with CKD G1T–G5T with risk factors for osteoporosis, we suggest that BMD testing be used to assess fracture risk if results will alter therapy (2C).

### The views of patients and carers in treatment decision making for chronic kidney disease: systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies [^1baef4f6]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Timing of information

Participants often reported being too sick to make sense of the information they were given on treatment options: "The doctor might have mentioned it [continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis] but I was so sick at the time I didn't catch on to it". Patients and families also identified needing time to absorb information and to adjust to the approaching treatment regardless of whether they were contemplating a home haemodialysis modality or palliative care.

Research on nephrologist-patient communication suggests that nephrologists provide information on treatment options over an extended period of time but increase the amount of detail about specific treatments when the patient requires renal replacement therapy. Although this sounds reasonable it is likely that this approach will reduce the time available to patients to make decisions and means that information provision will coincide with the patient becoming symptomatic or cognitively impaired. From a patient's perspective this practice of increasing discussions about treatment options when end stage kidney disease is approached is inadequate for decision making. Guidelines for chronic kidney disease from the UK and kidney disease quality outcomes initiative recommend counselling for treatment options six months before the onset of established renal failure. These same guidelines, however, also recommend that a native arteriovenous access be created six months before end stage renal disease. There are several potential consequences of having a fistula created before a full discussion of treatment options. Firstly, patients risk having surgery for a treatment they do not wish to pursue. Secondly, our analysis suggests that the creation of vascular access may mean that a patient believes a treatment choice has already been made for them.

### Combination therapy: an upcoming paradigm to improve kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in chronic kidney disease [^c4d8715f]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

In this article the authors review recent advances in the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with diabetes, and summarize evidence supporting combination therapy approaches to improve patient outcomes. Driven by the global rise in diabetes, the worldwide burden of CKD has nearly doubled since the 1990s. People with CKD have notably increased risks for premature cardiovascular disease (heart and blood vessels disease), kidney failure and death. CKD, diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease are closely interrelated and share common risk factors. These health conditions therefore comprise what is now known as cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome. Recently approved medications, including sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and the non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (ns-MRA) finerenone, represent agents capable of reducing metabolic, kidney and cardiovascular risk through complementary mechanisms of action. Current evidence supports use of these therapies in combination. Besides providing additive protective effects, combination therapy may also help reduce side effects. For instance, using an SGLT2 inhibitor in combination with finerenone helps decrease the risk for high potassium levels. Through the multipronged approach, combination therapy allows tailoring treatment for the individual patient characteristics and needs. Several planned and ongoing clinical trials continue to study the benefits of combination therapy in people with CKM syndrome. With building evidence supporting the use of combination therapy, it is crucial to raise awareness of the importance of this treatment approach and develop processes to incorporate new therapies into every day practice to support optimal care and improved outcomes.

Abstract

The global burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD) increased by nearly 90% in the period spanning 1990 to 2016, mostly attributed to an increase in the prevalence of CKD in diabetes. People living with CKD have an elevated lifetime risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) when compared with the general population, with risk increasing in parallel with albuminuria and kidney function decline. Metabolic disease, CKD and CVD share common risk factors including neurohumoral activation, systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, thus prompting the introduction of a broader construct of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome. An important rationale for the introduction of this concept are recent and ongoing therapeutic advancements fundamentally changing CKM management. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and the non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (ns-MRA) finerenone have shifted the therapeutic paradigm for patients with CKD and have emerged in rapid succession as cornerstones of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT). Recently completed clinical trials of aldosterone synthase inhibitors and endothelin receptor antagonists have additionally reported additive antiproteinuric effects on the background of renin-angiotensin system and SGLT2 inhibition, with acceptable safety profiles. The sum of current evidence from both preclinical and clinical studies support combination therapy in the setting of CKD to achieve additive and potentially synergistic kidney and heart protection by addressing metabolic, hemodynamic, and pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic mechanistic pathways. This narrative review will discuss available evidence supporting combination GDMT in CKD with diabetes and additionally discuss ongoing and future trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of combination therapies for CKD with or without diabetes.

### The case for early identification and intervention of chronic kidney disease: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) controversies conference [^6392ae89]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) causes substantial global morbidity and increases cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Unlike other chronic diseases with established strategies for screening, there has been no consensus on whether health systems and governments should prioritize early identification and intervention for CKD. Guidelines on evaluating and managing early CKD are available but have not been universally adopted in the absence of incentives or quality measures for prioritizing CKD care. The burden of CKD falls disproportionately upon persons with lower socioeconomic status, who have a higher prevalence of CKD, limited access to treatment, and poorer outcomes. Therefore, identifying and treating CKD at the earliest stages is an equity imperative. In 2019, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) held a controversies conference entitled "Early Identification and Intervention in CKD". Participants identified strategies for screening, risk stratification, and treatment for early CKD and the key health system and economic factors for implementing these processes. A consensus emerged that CKD screening coupled with risk stratification and treatment should be implemented immediately for high-risk persons and that this should ideally occur in primary or community care settings with tailoring to the local context.

KDIGO 2021 blood pressure in chronic kidney disease — reference keys for rating recommendations state that "Within each recommendation, the strength of recommendation is indicated as Level 1 or Level 2, and the quality of the supporting evidence is shown as A, B, C, or D". Level 1 'Strong' 'We recommend' has implications that "Most people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not", that "Most patients should receive the recommended course of action", and that "The recommendation can be evaluated as a candidate for developing a policy or a performance measure". Level 2 'Weak' 'We suggest' implies that "The majority of people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not", that "Different choices will be appropriate for different patients. Each patient needs help to arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences", and that "The recommendation is likely to require substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders before policy can be determined". Evidence quality meanings are: A (High) "We are confident that the true effect is close to the estimate of the effect"; B (Moderate) "The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different"; C (Low) "The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect"; D (Very low) "The estimate of effect is very uncertain, and often it will be far from the true effect".

### Controversies in optimal anemia management: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^e8ecca98]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

In chronic kidney disease, anemia and disordered iron homeostasis are prevalent and associated with significant adverse consequences. In 2012, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) issued an anemia guideline for managing the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease. Since then, new data have accrued from basic research, epidemiological studies, and randomized trials that warrant a re-examination of previous recommendations. Therefore, in 2019, KDIGO decided to convene 2 Controversies Conferences to review the latest evidence, explore new and ongoing controversies, assess change implications for the current KDIGO anemia guideline, and propose a research agenda. The first conference, described here, focused mainly on iron-related issues, including the contribution of disordered iron homeostasis to the anemia of chronic kidney disease, diagnostic challenges, available and emerging iron therapies, treatment targets, and patient outcomes. The second conference will discuss issues more specifically related to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, including epoetins, and hypoxia-inducible factor-prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors. Here we provide a concise overview of the consensus points and controversies resulting from the first conference and prioritize key questions that need to be answered by future research.

### Renal association commentary on the KDIGO (2017) clinical practice guideline update for the diagnosis, evaluation, prevention, and treatment of CKD-MBD [^d9acf0d0]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

This report comments on the relevance and utility of the recently published (2017) KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline Update for the diagnosis, evaluation, prevention and treatment of mineral bone disease in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD-MBD) with respect to UK clinical practice. This document replaces all previously published Renal Association guidelines on the topic.

In each case, we have included the guideline from the original 2009 KDIGO Report, followed by the updated recommendation or suggestion from the 2017 Update and a summary of the rationale behind each change. This is, of course, covered more comprehensively in the original documents.

Where UK guidance also exists from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) concerning individual recommendations, we have highlighted key similarities and differences before making a summary recommendation of how the Guideline Update may influence UK clinical practice.

The most significant change in the update is a move away from treating to specific targets towards a more pragmatic and personalised approach to management. It is worth noting that of the 21 updated recommendations / suggestions reviewed here, 8 of them (38%) remain 'ungraded' and all of the others are graded Level 2 which, according to the KDIGO nomenclature and description for rating guideline recommendations, means that 'Different choices will be appropriate for different patients. Each patient needs help to arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his vaand preferences' and reflects the relative lack of evidence on which clinical practice is based in this area. As a result, management of CKD-MBD in patients should be individualised, multi-professional and often pragmatic in its approach.

This represents a significant shift in the way that data are reported and interpreted by both health care professionals and patients here in the UK. As mentioned, the KDIGO working group highlighted the relative paucity of high-quality data from clinical trials that has underpinned these changes and recommend a number of priority research areas in their document. This reinforces the importance of supporting, and recruiting to, new and ongoing clinical trials wherever and whenever practically possible.

Conclusions

In conclusion, in our study, when talking to older people, kidney doctors and nurses more commonly presented dialysis as the default treatment for advanced kidney disease and CKM as a subordinate option. Presenting conservative management and dialysis as on an equal footing enables patient to take a more active role in decision-making. These findings have important implications for clinical practice and education.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major global health priority affecting 10%–12% of the population (over 850 million people) with the number of affected individuals projected to increase rapidly over the next few decades. The prevalence of CKD is higher in those over 60 years of age, as well as in individuals with increased body mass index, diabetes and hypertension. Having CKD has significant negative implications for both life expectancy and quality of life, especially as a core component of the increasingly recognized cardio-kidney-metabolic multimorbidity syndrome. The 2024 Report from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study using 2021 data shows that CKD is the 11th leading cause of death, with 1.53 million deaths, with a further 2.1 million cardiovascular deaths attributable to CKD. CKD is also expected to rise from the 23rd leading cause of disease burden worldwide in 2022 to the 10th by 2050. However, much of the kidney disease burden globally, and its impact on outcomes of other conditions, remains uncounted, therefore these numbers are likely conservative estimates.

The new 2024 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of CKD, 12 years on from the previous guideline in 2012, are a very welcome update which emphasize both the advancements in the fields and the remaining gaps to fill. The document is an impressive text at 198 pages with 937 references, with multiple associated documents including supplementary material, executive summary and takeaway message summaries.

The purpose of this article is not to summarize the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline but, on behalf of the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) group of the European Renal Association (ERA), to highlight some of what is new and relevant, especially in the European context. Given the rapidly evolving and expanding field of treatment for CKD [for example, the FLOW trial data on Semaglutide, a Glucagon Like Peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1ra), on kidney disease progression which was published after the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline], we chose to focus on the remaining Achilles' heel of the global push to improve CKD care and outcomes — the first step towards effective management of the disease — evaluation and risk assessment in people with CKD.

### The burden of kidney disease: improving global outcomes [^33aa4ba9]. Kidney International (2004). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide public health problem. There is an increasing incidence and prevalence of patients with kidney failure requiring replacement therapy, with poor outcomes and high cost. There is an even higher prevalence of patients in earlier stages of CKD, with adverse outcomes such as kidney failure, cardiovascular disease, and premature death. Patients at earlier stages of CKD can be detected through laboratory testing and their treatment is effective in slowing the progression to kidney failure and reducing cardiovascular events. The science and evidence-based care of these patients are universal and independent of their geographic location. There is a clear need to develop a uniform and global public health approach to the worldwide epidemic of CKD. It is to this end that a new initiative "Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes" has been established. Its stated mission is "Improve the care and outcomes of kidney disease patients worldwide through promoting coordination, collaboration and integration of initiatives to develop and implement clinical practice guidelines".

### Lipid management in chronic kidney disease: synopsis of the kidney disease: improving global outcomes 2013 clinical practice guideline [^dc27ab38]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Description

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) organization developed a clinical practice guideline in 2013 on lipid management and treatment of all adults and children with chronic kidney disease (CKD). All forms of CKD are included (non-dialysis-dependent, dialysis-dependent, and kidney transplant recipients).

Methods

The KDIGO Lipid Guideline Development Work Group defined the scope of the guideline, gathered evidence, determined topics for systematic review, and graded the quality of evidence that had been summarized by an evidence review team. Searches of the English-language literature were conducted through August 2011 and supplemented by targeted searches through June 2013. Final modification of the guidelines was informed by the KDIGO Board of Directors and a public review process involving registered stakeholders.

Recommendations

The full guideline includes 13 recommendations; a key element was the recommendation for statin or statin with ezetimibe treatment of adults aged 50 years or older with estimated glomerular filtration rates less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m² but not treated with long-term dialysis or kidney transplantation. This synopsis focuses on 8 recommendations pertinent to assessment of lipid status and treatment with a statin-based regimen in adults.

### Combination therapy as a new standard of care in diabetic and non-diabetic chronic kidney disease [^58543f43]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The complex pathophysiology that underlies the development and progression of diabetic and non-diabetic CKD argues the need for multiple evidence-based therapies used in combination to reduce the lifetime risks of kidney failure, cardiovascular events, and mortality. Evidence for combination therapy is strongest in diabetic CKD, with four agents proven to improve kidney, cardiovascular, and mortality outcomes. A similar pillared approach is likely to emerge in non-diabetic CKD, with the additional dimension of disease-specific immunological therapies. Current evidence suggests additive effects and potential safety advantages with the combined use of available therapies, however, additional work to determine optimal timing, sequence, and intensity of evidence-based kidney therapies will help transition CKD management towards a multi-medicine strategy to reduce residual kidney and cardiovascular risk.
