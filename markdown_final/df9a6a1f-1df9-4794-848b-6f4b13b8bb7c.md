## Question

What are the first steps to a patient presenting with chest pain?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the first steps in evaluating a patient who presents with chest pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and life-threatening causes. Then, I should verify the timing and acquisition of the ECG. Next, I will review the focused history and physical examination elements that change pretest probability. After that, I need to check the biomarker strategy with high-sensitivity troponin and serial sampling. Then, I will apply risk stratification using validated clinical decision pathways. Next, I should review disposition thresholds and the role of observation units. Finally, I will consider special populations, documentation language, and the role of shared decision-making and follow-up testing, ensuring each step aligns with contemporary ACC/AHA guidance and ED pathways.

> Let me first confirm the immediate priorities: airway, breathing, circulation, and rapid identification of life-threatening causes such as ACS, aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, tension pneumothorax, pericardial tamponade, and esophageal rupture, because delays here carry the highest morbidity and mortality. I need to ensure continuous monitoring, IV access, and oxygen if hypoxic while I simultaneously obtain an ECG and order troponin without waiting for a full history if instability is suspected [^115zGece] [^113xH9FF].

> Wait, let me verify the ECG timing and scope before moving on. The ECG should be obtained and interpreted within 10 minutes of arrival for all patients with acute chest pain, with attention to STEMI, STEMI-equivalents, new ischemic changes, and comparison to prior tracings, and if posterior MI is suspected with a nondiagnostic initial ECG, I should add posterior leads V7–V9 and repeat ECGs if symptoms persist or evolve, because missing a STEMI is unacceptable and subtle ischemia can evolve over time [^114xzs4A] [^112bG2YX] [^115u9pdV].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions based on pain intensity. I should obtain a focused history that characterizes the pain (quality, location, radiation, onset/duration, precipitating and relieving factors), elicits associated symptoms (dyspnea, diaphoresis, nausea/vomiting, syncope), and quantifies cardiovascular risk factors, while remembering that women and older adults more often present with atypical features and that certain descriptors like exertional radiation to the arms increase the likelihood of ACS, even though history alone cannot safely exclude ACS [^114L3p7U] [^1141VuTm] [^111g2gsb].

> I will now examine the patient with a targeted cardiovascular and systems exam, looking for signs of instability (hypotension, tachycardia, cool extremities), new murmurs suggesting acute MR or VSD, jugular venous distension, unequal pulses or blood pressures raising concern for aortic dissection, and pulmonary or abdominal findings that might redirect the diagnosis. I should confirm that the exam is adjunctive and not specific for ischemia, so I must integrate it with ECG and troponin rather than relying on it in isolation [^113iX3S4] [^113JDTgA].

> Next, I should review the biomarker strategy. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin should be measured as soon as possible on arrival, with repeat sampling at 1–3 hours for hs-cTn or 3–6 hours for conventional assays per institutional protocol, and if symptoms began at least 3 hours prior and the initial hs-cTn is below the assay's limit of detection, a single negative result can reasonably exclude myocardial injury, though I need to ensure the ECG is nondiagnostic and there is no ongoing ischemia before applying this shortcut [^115T4a6T] [^114wzEjJ] [^116JguhQ].

> Let me consider risk stratification now. I should apply a validated clinical decision pathway such as HEART, EDACS, or TIMI/ADAPT to categorize patients into low-, intermediate-, or high-risk strata, because CDPs standardize disposition and testing and have been shown to reduce unnecessary admissions and testing while maintaining high sensitivity for myocardial injury and 30-day MACE. I should double-check that my institution's hs-cTn thresholds and delta criteria are embedded in the CDP to avoid misclassification [^1144ozkh] [^115Z6F6N] [^113NJEZ4].

> I should confirm disposition thresholds. Low risk is generally defined as a 30-day risk of death or MACE less than 1 percent, and such patients can often be discharged without inpatient testing when CDP criteria are met, whereas high-risk patients warrant admission and guideline-directed ACS care, and intermediate-risk patients benefit from observation unit management with serial troponins and risk reassessment to shorten length of stay and reduce cost. I need to ensure that my documentation reflects the CDP used and the objective risk estimate communicated to the patient [^116RFQAY] [^117FpDzx] [^114yLT3N].

> But wait, what if the patient is in an observation unit with known CAD and escalating symptoms? I should optimize guideline-directed medical therapy before ordering additional testing, because intensifying anti-ischemic and preventive therapies often alleviates symptoms and may obviate immediate invasive procedures, and this principle applies to both obstructive and nonobstructive CAD contexts [^113kefyX] [^117TBLD4].

> Next, I should review ancillary testing that supports alternative diagnoses without delaying reperfusion. A chest radiograph is reasonable in most patients with possible ACS to screen for pulmonary or thoracic causes, but it must not delay PCI for STEMI, and transthoracic echocardiography is valuable when I suspect noncoronary catastrophes such as aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, pericardial effusion, or when ECGs are concerning but not diagnostic of ischemia, guiding the need for CT angiography or advanced imaging [^116sYTH1] [^113JDTgA] [^112bG2YX].

> I need to ensure my documentation uses precise terminology. I should avoid calling pain "atypical" and instead classify it as cardiac, possibly cardiac, or noncardiac, and I should explicitly record the CDP and risk estimate used, the troponin sampling intervals, and the shared decision-making discussion, because this improves clarity, reduces bias, and supports patient-centered choices about observation versus outpatient testing [^114rDZVo] [^115cvQpm] [^115JL5Ld].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and settings. Women are at risk for underdiagnosis, so I must actively consider ACS and probe for associated symptoms like nausea and dyspnea, patients with language barriers require professional translation to avoid history errors, and prehospital activation of EMS reduces ischemic time and should be encouraged when symptoms begin in the community. For office evaluations, any suspicion of ACS mandates urgent ED transfer and an ECG within 10 minutes when feasible [^1141VuTm] [^116EuJvg] [^114xzs4A].

> Let me reconsider the role of shared decision-making. For low-risk patients, decision aids can improve understanding and reduce low-value observation admissions, and for intermediate-risk patients, discussing radiation, costs, and test characteristics helps align testing with patient preferences and local expertise, which I should document to support value-conscious care [^111veToj] [^115JL5Ld].

> Finally, I should double-check the downstream testing strategy. For intermediate-risk patients without known CAD, coronary CT angiography is often preferred in younger patients not yet optimized on preventive therapy, whereas stress testing may be favored in older patients or those with baseline ECG abnormalities, and for low-risk stable chest pain, pretest probability models and coronary artery calcium scoring can help defer testing when appropriate, with exercise ECG without imaging as a reasonable first-line option when the ECG is interpretable [^117VsZSy] [^116cw1CX].

The first steps in evaluating chest pain are to **assess ABCs and vital signs** to identify instability, obtain a **12-lead ECG within 10 minutes** [^114xzs4A] to detect STEMI or high-risk ischemia, and draw **high-sensitivity troponin** [^116JguhQ] with serial measurements per protocol. Concurrently, take a **focused history** (onset, quality, radiation, duration, risk factors) [^114L3p7U] and perform a **targeted exam** for murmurs, JVD, pulmonary findings, and pulses [^113iX3S4]. If STEMI is present, activate the cath lab immediately; otherwise, risk-stratify using validated pathways (HEART, EDACS, TIMI) [^113NJEZ4] and repeat ECG/troponin to guide disposition and testing [^114wzEjJ].

---

## Immediate assessment and stabilization

- **Airway, breathing, circulation (ABCs)**: Rapidly assess and stabilize; intubate if airway compromise, provide oxygen for hypoxia, and treat hypotension or shock [^115zGece].

- **Vital signs**: Obtain BP, HR, RR, SpO2, and temperature; instability (hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia) requires urgent intervention [^113xH9FF].

- **IV access**: Establish at least one large-bore IV for medications and fluids.

---

## Rapid diagnostic testing

- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: Obtain and interpret a 12-lead ECG within 10 minutes of arrival [^112bG2YX]; identify STEMI, NSTEMI, or other ischemic changes [^112bG2YX].

- **High-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn)**: Draw immediately [^115T4a6T] and repeat at 1–3 hours per institutional protocol; hs-cTn improves early detection/exclusion of myocardial injury [^114wzEjJ].

- **Serial ECGs**: Repeat if initial ECG is nondiagnostic but suspicion remains high [^115u9pdV]; posterior leads (V7–V9) if posterior MI is suspected [^112JTzTy].

---

## Focused history and physical examination

Obtain a **focused history** detailing onset, quality, location, radiation, duration, precipitating/relieving factors, and associated symptoms (dyspnea, nausea, diaphoresis, syncope) [^114L3p7U], and document cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking, family history) [^111NMhTM]. Perform a **focused physical examination**, including inspection, palpation, auscultation, and pulse assessment, to identify murmurs, JVD, pulmonary crackles, or unequal pulses suggesting alternative diagnoses (e.g. aortic dissection, PE) [^113iX3S4].

---

## Risk stratification and clinical decision pathways

Use **validated clinical decision pathways** (HEART, EDACS, TIMI) [^113NJEZ4] to stratify risk and guide disposition and testing [^115Z6F6N]. Low-risk patients have a **< 1% 30-day MACE risk** [^116RFQAY] and can often be discharged without urgent testing [^116RFQAY]; intermediate-risk patients warrant observation, repeat troponin, and noninvasive testing [^11613zoQ]; high-risk patients require admission and invasive coronary angiography [^114uP7HV].

---

## Initial management based on ECG and troponin results

| **Ecg/troponin result** | **Initial management** |
|-|-|
| STEMI | Activate cath lab immediately; reperfusion therapy (PCI or thrombolysis) [^112bG2YX] |
| NSTEMI | Admit; initiate antiplatelet, anticoagulant, beta-blocker, statin; invasive strategy if high risk [^11613zoQ] |
| Normal ECG, negative troponin | Observe; repeat ECG/troponin; consider noncardiac causes if low risk [^116JguhQ] |

---

## Additional diagnostic tests (as indicated)

Order a **chest X-ray** to evaluate for pulmonary, aortic, or other thoracic causes; obtain an **echocardiogram** if valvular disease, pericarditis, or wall-motion abnormalities are suspected; and pursue **CT angiography** if PE, aortic dissection, or other vascular causes are suspected [^116sYTH1].

---

## Patient education and disposition planning

Explain the working diagnosis, test results, and next steps, and discuss **red flags** that require immediate return. For low-risk patients, arrange **follow-up** with primary care or cardiology; for intermediate/high-risk patients, admit for further evaluation and management [^115JL5Ld].

---

The first steps in chest pain evaluation are to **stabilize, obtain an ECG within 10 minutes, and draw hs-cTn with serial measurements**, while concurrently taking a focused history and performing a targeted exam. Risk stratification with validated pathways then guides disposition and further testing, ensuring rapid identification and treatment of life-threatening causes [^116JguhQ].

Type 2 myocardial infarction (MI) ongoing therapy and risk modification — For patients with known or newly diagnosed CAD or ischemia, "secondary prevention therapies, including aspirin and lipid-lowering therapy, should be initiated", and "Beta-blockers may be beneficial, particularly among patients with angina, tachyarrhythmias, and confirmed CAD". In those with symptoms, "antianginal medications should be adjusted", and "Treatments for cardiovascular comorbidities, including diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and hypertension, should also be optimized according to prevention guidelines". In obstructive CAD, "revascularization may be considered on a case-by-case basis", while if CAD or ischemia is excluded, "aspirin and lipid-lowering therapy should be implemented in those who meet treatment indications… ", and broader "cardiovascular risk factors… should be addressed and optimized".

Acute chest pain with suspected gastrointestinal syndromes — among outpatients who present with chest pain, approximately 10% to 20% have a gastrointestinal cause, and in patients with recurrent acute chest pain without evidence of a cardiac or pulmonary cause, evaluation for gastrointestinal causes is reasonable. The first step in evaluation of potential esophageal chest pain is a careful history, and a history of use of medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, potassium supplements, iron, or bisphosphonates should be sought. When an esophageal cause of chest pain is suspected, upper endoscopy should be considered, and symptoms and signs that merit early evaluation (usually within 2 weeks) include dysphagia, odynophagia, gastrointestinal bleeding, unexplained iron deficiency anemia, weight loss, and recurrent vomiting. Patients without these symptoms may merit a trial of empiric acid suppression therapy, and if an upper endoscopy is normal and the symptoms persist despite a trial of acid suppression, consideration should be given to additional evaluation, such as esophageal function testing and pH monitoring, to exclude other esophageal causes.

Chest pain, the second most frequent presenting complaint in the emergency department (ED), often poses a challenge to the physicians dealing with these patients owing to the wide spectrum of presentation of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). A majority of the patients presenting with chest pain are usually admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management. Despite the availability of modern-day tools for diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), about 5% of patients with AMI are missed in the ED with subsequent associated morbidity and mortality and legal consequences. Several centers have adapted critical pathways derived from American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines for the management of patients presenting with ACS. We now have some evidence suggesting adherence to the critical pathways derived from ACC/AHA guidelines will optimize the quality of patient care and probably result in better patient outcomes. This article reviews initial evaluation and the importance of risk stratification of the patients presenting with chest pain using the currently available clinical and diagnostic tools. Critical pathways derived from the ACC/AHA guidelines for various presentations of ACS are also reviewed.

Patient-centric considerations — acute chest pain and prehospital transport: In patients with acute chest pain, it is recommended that 9–1–1 be activated by patients or bystanders to initiate transport to the closest ED by emergency medical services (EMS) (COR 1, LOE C-LD), and EMS transportation is associated with substantial reductions in ischemic time and treatment delays; moreover, 1 in 300 patients with chest pain transported to the ED by private vehicle suffers a cardiac arrest en route. To ensure the timely delivery of appropriate care, especially reperfusion therapy, it is strongly recommended that patients with acute chest pain be transported to the ED by trained EMS personnel. For patients of various racial and ethnic subgroups in whom English may not be the primary language, formal translation services are recommended to address language barriers and obtain an accurate and complete history.

Key Points for Practice
- Attempt to perform 12-lead ECG in patients with chest pain within 10 minutes of arrival to a clinic or emergency setting.
- Use a clinical decision pathway to identify patients with low-risk chest pain who can be discharged from the emergency department.
- If available, use CCTA preferentially over stress testing for patients with intermediate-risk chest pain to determine the need for invasive coronary angiography. For patients with high-risk chest pain, provide referral for invasive coronary angiography. Initial Evaluation Chest pain can present as pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort in the chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw and less commonly as shortness of breath, nausea, or fatigue without pain. Chest pain is considered acute with new onset or if it involves a change in pattern, intensity, or duration; it is considered stable if it is chronic with unchanging triggers such as exertion or emotional stress.

Initial evaluation should focus on ruling out life-threatening illnesses such as acute coronary syndrome, aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolism, which are often not indicated by pain severity. Response to nitroglycerin is not an accurate means of ruling in cardiac chest pain. Patients with diabetes mellitus, women, and older patients more often present with associated nausea, fatigue, and shortness of breath. ACS should be considered when patients older than 75 years present with shortness of breath, syncope, mental impairment, or abdominal pain, or if they experience an unexplained fall. Diagnostic Evaluation Initial evaluation should involve 12-lead electrocardiography, which is recommended within 10 minutes of arrival in clinic and emergency settings.

Because up to 6% of patients with cardiac ischemia are discharged from the emergency department after a single normal ECG, repeat testing should be considered in patients with normal ECG but a higher index of suspicion. Adding leads V7 to V9 should be considered on repeat testing to assess for posterior wall ischemia. ST elevation, hyperacute T waves, left bundle branch block, and ST depression are the most concerning findings for cardiac chest pain. Nonischemic Chest Pain Immediate echocardiography should be used in patients with suspected nonischemic causes of chest pain such as aortic dissection, pericardial effusion, and pulmonary embolism. If echocardiography rules out life-threatening injury, computed tomography or cardiovascular MRI can be used to confirm a suspected diagnosis.

Top 10 take-home messages for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain emphasize that chest pain means more than pain in the chest, and that pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort in the chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw, as well as shortness of breath and fatigue should all be considered anginal equivalents. High-sensitivity cardiac troponins are the preferred standard for establishing a biomarker diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, allowing for more accurate detection and exclusion of myocardial injury. Patients with acute chest pain or chest pain equivalent symptoms should seek medical care immediately by calling 9–1–1, and the evaluation of all patients should focus on the early identification or exclusion of life-threatening causes. Clinically stable patients presenting with chest pain should be included in decision-making; information about risk of adverse events, radiation exposure, costs, and alternative options should be provided to facilitate the discussion. For patients with acute or stable chest pain determined to be low risk, urgent diagnostic testing for suspected coronary artery disease is not needed. Clinical decision pathways for chest pain in the emergency department and outpatient settings should be used routinely. Chest pain is the dominant and most frequent symptom for both men and women ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome, and women may be more likely to present with accompanying symptoms such as nausea and shortness of breath. Patients with acute or stable chest pain who are at intermediate risk or intermediate to high pre-test risk of obstructive coronary artery disease, respectively, will benefit the most from cardiac imaging and testing. "Noncardiac" should be used if heart disease is not suspected, whereas "Atypical" is a misleading descriptor of chest pain, and its use is discouraged. For patients presenting with acute or stable chest pain, structured risk assessment should be used and risk for coronary artery disease and adverse events should be estimated using evidence-based diagnostic protocols.

Acute chest pain — shared decision-making with clinical decision pathways (CDP): For patients deemed low risk by a CDP, "patient decision aids are beneficial to improve understanding and effectively facilitate risk communication", and for those deemed intermediate risk by a CDP, "shared decision-making between the clinician and patient regarding the need for admission, for observation, discharge, or further evaluation in an outpatient setting is recommended for improving patient understanding and reducing low-value testing".

### Does this patient with chest pain have acute coronary syndrome? the rational clinical examination systematic review [^112Zsapb]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

About 10% of patients with acute chest pain are ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Early, accurate estimation of the probability of ACS in these patients using the clinical examination could prevent many hospital admissions among low-risk patients and ensure that high-risk patients are promptly treated.

Objective

To review systematically the accuracy of the initial history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and risk scores incorporating these elements with the first cardiac-specific troponin.

Study Selection

MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched (January 1, 1995-July 31, 2015), along with reference lists from retrieved articles, to identify prospective studies of diagnostic test accuracy among patients admitted to the emergency department with symptoms suggesting ACS.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

We identified 2992 unique articles; 58 met inclusion criteria.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratio (LR) of findings for the diagnosis of ACS. The reference standard for ACS was either a final hospital diagnosis of ACS or occurrence of a cardiovascular event within 6 weeks.

Results

The clinical findings and risk factors most suggestive of ACS were prior abnormal stress test (specificity, 96%; LR, 3.1 [95% CI, 2.0–4.7]), peripheral arterial disease (specificity, 97%; LR, 2.7 [95% CI, 1.5–4.8]), and pain radiation to both arms (specificity, 96%; LR, 2.6 [95% CI, 1.8–3.7]). The most useful electrocardiogram findings were ST-segment depression (specificity, 95%; LR, 5.3 [95% CI, 2.1–8.6]) and any evidence of ischemia (specificity, 91%; LR, 3.6 [95% CI,1.6–5.7]). Both the History, Electrocardiogram, Age, Risk Factors, Troponin (HEART) and Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk scores performed well in diagnosing ACS: LR, 13 (95% CI, 7.0–24) for the high-risk range of the HEART score (7–10) and LR, 6.8 (95% CI, 5.2–8.9) for the high-risk range of the TIMI score (5–7). The most useful for identifying patients less likely to have ACS were the low-risk range HEART score (0–3) (LR, 0.20 [95% CI, 0.13–0.30]), low-risk range TIMI score (0–1) (LR, 0.31 [95% CI, 0.23–0.43]), or low to intermediate risk designation by the Heart Foundation of Australia and Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand risk algorithm (LR, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.19–0.31]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with suspected ACS presenting to emergency departments, the initial history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram alone did not confirm or exclude the diagnosis of ACS. Instead, the HEART or TIMI risk scores, which incorporate the first cardiac troponin, provided more diagnostic information.

Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Low-risk patients with acute chest pain — definition and disposition: Patients with acute chest pain and a 30-day risk of death or major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) < 1% should be designated as low risk, and in suspected ACS who are deemed low-risk (< 1% 30-day risk of death or MACE), it is reasonable to discharge home without admission or urgent cardiac testing.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Low-risk patients with acute chest pain — risk definition and disposition: Patients with acute chest pain and a 30-day risk of death or major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) < 1% should be designated as low risk, and in patients with acute chest pain and suspected ACS who are deemed low-risk (< 1% 30-day risk of death or MACE), it is reasonable to discharge home without admission or urgent cardiac testing.

Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Low-risk stable chest pain with no known coronary artery disease (CAD) — outpatient risk assessment and initial testing: For patients with stable chest pain and no known CAD presenting to the outpatient clinic, a model to estimate pretest probability of obstructive CAD is effective to identify low-risk patients with favorable prognosis in whom additional diagnostic testing can be deferred. In low-risk patients, coronary artery calcium (CAC) testing is reasonable as a first-line test for excluding calcified plaque and identifying patients with a low likelihood of obstructive CAD. In low-risk patients with an interpretable electrocardiogram (ECG), exercise testing without imaging is reasonable as a first-line test to exclude myocardial ischemia and determine functional capacity.

Defining chest pain — recommendations (class of recommendation [COR] and level of evidence [LOE]) — include that an initial assessment of chest pain is recommended to triage patients effectively on the basis of the likelihood that symptoms may be attributable to myocardial ischemia (COR 1, LOE B-NR). The guideline also states that chest pain should not be described as atypical, because it is not helpful in determining the cause and can be misinterpreted as benign in nature; instead, chest pain should be described as cardiac, possibly cardiac, or noncardiac because these terms are more specific to the potential underlying diagnosis (COR 1, LOE C-LD).

Aim

This clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain provides recommendations and algorithms for clinicians to assess and diagnose chest pain in adult patients.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted from November 11, 2017, to May 1, 2020, encompassing randomized and nonrandomized trials, observational studies, registries, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Collaboration, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality reports, and other relevant databases. Additional relevant studies, published through April 2021, were also considered. Structure: Chest pain is a frequent cause for emergency department visits in the United States. The "2021 AHA/ACC/ASE/CHEST/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR Guideline for the Evaluation and Diagnosis of Chest Pain" provides recommendations based on contemporary evidence on the assessment and evaluation of chest pain. This guideline presents an evidence-based approach to risk stratification and the diagnostic workup for the evaluation of chest pain. Cost-value considerations in diagnostic testing have been incorporated, and shared decision-making with patients is recommended.

Initial evaluation of acute chest pain — priorities and exclusions for accelerated pathways are summarized as follows: "The initial clinical evaluation of a patient with acute chest pain should focus on rapid identification and treatment of patients with life-threatening conditions such as ACS, aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolism". Additionally, "Patients who are hemodynamically unstable, have significant arrhythmias, or have evidence of significant heart failure should be evaluated and treated appropriately and are not candidates for an accelerated CDP".

### Initial evaluation… [^1144wiiW]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Initial Evaluation The first decision point for most physicians is to determine whether the patient needs immediate referral to the emergency department for further testing to determine whether the chest pain is an acute coronary syndrome caused by coronary ischemia. 10 The impression of chest pain is often determined by a combination of clinical symptoms at the time of presentation, physical examination, initial electrocardiography, and risk factors for ACS. 11 Patients often do not use the term pain to describe their symptoms but frequently use other terms such as pressure, aching, discomfort, tightness, squeezing, or indigestion.
12. For patients with chest pain not requiring immediate referral who have a low to intermediate pretest probability of CAD, exercise stress testing should be considered.

26 As a result, CCTA is becoming a first-line test for patients presenting with chest pain in the emergency department and should be a consideration for family physicians evaluating and managing patients with stable chest pain in the office. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging may be useful in the evaluation of typical angina. For the evaluation of acute chest pain, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is comparable to angiography in mortality at one year; however, it results in less need for invasive angiography and fewer subsequent revascularization procedures. 34 Yet, concomitant panic disorder and chest pain are often not recognized, leading to more testing, follow-up, and higher costs of care. 34 A moderately accurate assessment for detecting panic disorder is had by asking the following validated screening question: "In the past four weeks, have you had an anxiety attack.

" This question is good at supporting a diagnosis of panic disorder when patients answer yes and is good at ruling it out when the answer is no.
35. PNEUMONIA Common symptoms of pneumonia include fever, chills, productive cough, and pleuritic chest pain. ACUTE THORACIC AORTIC DISSECTION Patients with acute thoracic aortic dissection may present with chest or back pain. 48 History and physical examination are only modestly useful for supporting or ruling out the diagnosis; acute chest or back pain and a pulse differential in the upper extremities modestly increases the likelihood of an acute thoracic aortic dissection. 49 Clinical suspicion for thoracic dissection warrants immediate referral to the emergency department.

Chest pain — setting considerations for diagnostic testing are as follows: Unless a noncardiac cause is evident, an ECG should be performed for patients seen in the office setting with stable chest pain; if an ECG is unavailable the patient should be referred to the ED so one can be obtained. Patients with clinical evidence of ACS or other life-threatening causes of acute chest pain seen in the office setting should be transported urgently to the ED, ideally by EMS. In all patients who present with acute chest pain regardless of the setting, an ECG should be acquired and reviewed for STEMI within 10 minutes of arrival. In all patients presenting to the ED with acute chest pain and suspected ACS, cTn should be measured as soon as possible after presentation. For patients with acute chest pain and suspected ACS initially evaluated in the office setting, delayed transfer to the ED for cTn or other diagnostic testing should be avoided.

Initial evaluation — synopsis and comprehensive history elements in the emergency department (ED): Patients presenting to the ED with nontraumatic chest pain are a frequent diagnostic challenge. The priorities are rapid initiation of optimal management for life-threatening conditions such as acute coronary syndromes (ACS), aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolism (PE), as well as nonvascular syndromes (eg, esophageal rupture, tension pneumothorax), and deliberate therapy for those with less critical illness. The initial electrocardiogram (ECG) is important to the evaluation, but history, examination, biomarkers, and other aids remain essential, and there is frequently a lack of correlation between intensity of symptoms and seriousness of disease. A comprehensive history that captures chest pain characteristics — nature, onset and duration, location and radiation, precipitating factors, relieving factors, and associated symptoms — can help better identify potential cardiac causes and should be obtained from all patients.

Patients with acute chest pain and suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (not including STEMI) should be managed using clinical decision pathways (CDPs) that categorize patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk strata, with standardized troponin sampling intervals and incorporation of prior testing; specifically, recommended time intervals after the initial troponin sample collection (time zero) for repeat measurements are 1 to 3 hours for high-sensitivity troponin and 3 to 6 hours for conventional troponin assays, institutions should implement a CDP that includes a protocol for troponin sampling based on their particular assay, previous testing when available should be considered and incorporated into CDPs, and for patients with a normal ECG and symptoms suggestive of ACS that began at least 3 hours before ED arrival, a single hs-cTn concentration that is below the limit of detection on initial measurement (time zero) is reasonable to exclude myocardial injury.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis of anatomic vs functional index testing in patients with low-risk stable chest pain [^111f71br]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are first-line anatomic approaches to low-risk stable chest pain evaluation cost-effective compared with functional testing?

Findings

In this cost-effectiveness analysis using an individual-based Markov microsimulation model based on 10 003 participants in a randomized clinical trial, anatomic approaches were cost-effective compared with functional testing across a wide range of variations in clinical care and patient characteristics. Adding fractional flow reserve to coronary computed tomography angiography resulted in modest improvements after the initially increased costs of care were offset by fewer and more targeted coronary revascularizations.

Meaning

These findings suggest that anatomic strategies may present a favorable initial diagnostic option in the evaluation of low-risk stable chest pain compared with functional testing.

Known CAD with stable chest pain — initial management emphasis — In patients with known CAD, clinicians should opt to intensify GDMT first, if there is an opportunity to do so, and defer testing. Although GDMT exists for obstructive CAD, there are no current guidelines that are specific to nonobstructive CAD; thus, adhering to atherosclerotic CV prevention guidelines is recommended. ACC/AHA clinical practice guidelines for treatment of patients with stable CAD recommend optimization of anti-ischemic and preventive therapies with the goal to reduce the patient's angina burden and improve clinical outcomes, and for all patients with a history of CAD risk factors, optimized preventive therapy should be used according to ACC/AHA clinical practice guidelines.

Value in health care — definition and illustrative testing strategy example: One definition of value is that it represents health care that has positive results (improved patient outcomes, safety, and satisfaction) at a total cost that is reasonable and affordable, and care is of low value if it contributes little to outcomes, safety, and satisfaction or incurs an inappropriately high cost. In the noninvasive evaluation of patients with chest pain who are able to exercise and have normal resting electrocardiograms, the ACC/AHA guidelines have recommended treadmill exercise electrocardiographic testing as a first step, and a recent randomized study compared this strategy with exercise myocardial perfusion imaging as the first step in evaluating a population of women at low to intermediate risk. Outcomes over 2 years were not significantly different between the 2 groups; however, costs were far higher in the group evaluated with initial exercise myocardial perfusion imaging, thus exercise treadmill electrocardiographic testing without imaging was more cost-effective (greater benefit for cost outlay).

Chest pain protocols/clinical decision pathways (CDPs) scope — Chest pain protocols are intended to add structure to the process of patient evaluation, and they can collectively be referred to as CDPs. CDPs are generally used to help guide disposition, but some also include guidance for cardiac testing of intermediate-risk patients. Compared with an unstructured clinical assessment, CDPs have been shown to decrease unnecessary testing and reduce admissions while maintaining high sensitivity for detection of acute myocardial injury and 30-day MACE (Table 6). The warranty period of prior cardiac testing should be considered when symptoms are unchanged (Table 7), and low-risk chest pain has been defined in Table 8. Risk scores are essential when conventional cTn assays are used, and the hs-cTn result may be more predictive than other clinical components of the risk score.

Chest pain evaluation and diagnosis take-home messages emphasize that clinically stable patients presenting with chest pain should be included in decision-making and information about risk of adverse events, radiation exposure, costs, and alternative options should be provided to facilitate the discussion. For patients with acute or stable chest pain determined to be low risk, urgent diagnostic testing for suspected coronary artery disease is not needed.

### Value and limitations of chest pain history in the evaluation of patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes [^111g2gsb]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

The chest pain history, physical examination, determination of coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factors, and the initial electrocardiogram compose the information immediately available to clinicians to help determine the probability of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with chest pain. However, conflicting data exist about the usefulness of the chest pain history and which components are most useful.

Objective

To identify the elements of the chest pain history that may be most helpful to the clinician in identifying ACS in patients presenting with chest pain.

Evidence Acquisition

MEDLINE and Ovid were searched from 1970 to September 2005 by using specific key words and Medical Subject Heading terms. Reference lists of these articles and current cardiology textbooks were also consulted.

Evidence Synthesis

Certain chest pain characteristics decrease the likelihood of ACS or AMI, namely, pain that is stabbing, pleuritic, positional, or reproducible by palpation (likelihood ratios [LRs] 0.2–0.3). Conversely, chest pain that radiates to one shoulder or both shoulders or arms or is precipitated by exertion is associated with LRs (2.3–4.7) that increase the likelihood of ACS. The chest pain history itself has not proven to be a powerful enough predictive tool to obviate the need for at least some diagnostic testing. Combinations of elements of the chest pain history with other initially available information, such as a history of CAD, have identified certain groups that may be safe for discharge without further evaluation, but further study is needed before such a recommendation can be considered reasonable.

Conclusion

Although certain elements of the chest pain history are associated with increased or decreased likelihoods of a diagnosis of ACS or AMI, none of them alone or in combination identify a group of patients that can be safely discharged without further diagnostic testing.

Noninvasive cardiovascular diagnostic testing — objectives and target population are defined: the primary role of subsequent testing is for evaluation of patients classified as intermediate risk according to the initial CDP evaluation; low-risk patients have a very low event rate and can usually be discharged without in-hospital testing, whereas high-risk patients should usually be admitted and initiated on guideline-based therapies if type 1 MI is considered; goals are accurate diagnosis or exclusion of clinically significant CAD or other cardiovascular conditions, risk-stratification to determine which patients require immediate treatment versus those for whom it can be delayed or deferred, and identification of abnormalities such as nonobstructive coronary atherosclerosis or left ventricular hypertrophy requiring follow-up, underscoring the importance of consistent post-test reporting.

Stable chest pain in patients with no known coronary artery disease (CAD) — stable chest pain is a symptom of myocardial ischemia characterized by chest pain that is provoked with stress, and risk status in suspected stable ischemic heart disease is not well defined. In symptomatic patients with suspected CAD, use of validated scores to predict the pretest probability of obstructive CAD may be useful to identify low-risk patients for whom testing may be deferred, and it is preferable to use contemporary estimates from the past 10 years in preference to historic series, which may overestimate the frequency of obstructive CAD. Alternatively, low-risk patients may be those < 40 years of age or who have symptoms with a low likelihood of representing ischemia, and when available, information on the presence and amount of coronary artery calcium may be useful for enhancing the pretest probability of obstructive CAD.

### Acute chest pain-a stepwise approach, the challenge of the correct clinical diagnosis [^1172FwrQ]. Resuscitation (2002). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To assess the safety and the accuracy of a 4 h stepwise diagnostic approach relying on clinical judgement in unselected patients with acute chest pain.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

Emergency department (ED) of a tertiary care university hospital.

Patients

1288 unselected patients presenting with acute chest pain.

Interventions

After history and physical examination, clinical judgement (step I), governed the need for further patient evaluation: baseline 12 lead electrocardiogramm (ECG) and laboratory examinations (step II), serial 12 lead ECG and laboratory examinations after 4 h (step III), and 4 h troponin T measurement (step IV) to exclude or to confirm a coronary origin of chest pain. Patients were followed clinically for 6 months for future occurrence of cardiac events (myocardial infarction, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), CABG, cardiac death), any death and for accuracy of the ED diagnosis in non-coronary chest pain patients.

Measurements and Results

Chest pain was diagnosed to be coronary in origin in 381 and non-coronary in 907 patients, respectively. Cardiac events occurred during follow up in 240 (19%) of 1288 patients, in 233 of 381 (61%) with presumed coronary and seven of 907 (1%) with presumed non-coronary chest pain. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for correct detection of coronary chest pain were 97, 86, 61 and 99%, respectively. In non-coronary chest pain patients the agreement between the ED diagnosis and the final diagnosis was good (kappa = 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67–0.75).

Conclusions

The 4 h stepwise approach guided by clinical judgement was safe for ruling out impending cardiac events in unselected patients with acute chest pain. However, more extensive evaluation is necessary for accurate rule-in of coronary chest pain.

Shared decision-making for emergency department chest pain — Shared decision-making is the process by which patients and clinicians share information and take steps to build consensus about preferred tests and treatments. In a single-center randomized trial of adults presenting to the ED with a chief complaint of chest pain (n = 204) who were being considered by the treating clinician for admission to the observation unit for cardiac stress testing, patients randomized to shared decision-making facilitated by the Chest Pain Choice Decision Aid had greater knowledge, were more engaged in the decision-making process, and less frequently decided to be admitted to the observation unit for stress testing (58% versus 77%, absolute difference 19%, 95% CI: 6%–31%). There were no MACE after discharge in either group. The decision aid was subsequently tested in a population of 898 patients with greater socioeconomic diversity recruited from 6 EDs across the United States, and analysis of health care use in this trial showed fewer cardiac imaging tests and lower overall 45-day health care use in patients randomized to the decision aid.

Noninvasive testing and coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) — use and interpretation are outlined as follows: Recommendations regarding noninvasive testing should be considered in the context of availability of institutional testing and local expertise; however, CTA is an important tool for evaluation of intermediate-risk patients in the ED, and thus, broader application across centers and greater availability within centers is recommended. Clinical decision pathways (CDPs) for rapid evaluation of chest pain should be interpreted within the context of all available clinical information, and the provider's clinical judgment at the bedside remains an indispensable tool that may lead to different triage decisions than those suggested by the CDP.

In all patients who present with acute chest pain regardless of the setting, an ECG should be acquired and reviewed for STEMI within 10 minutes of arrival. In all patients presenting to the ED with acute chest pain and suspected ACS, cTn should be measured as soon as possible after presentation. For patients with acute chest pain and suspected ACS initially evaluated in the office setting, delayed transfer to the ED for cTn or other diagnostic testing should be avoided.

Aim

This executive summary of the clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain provides recommendations and algorithms for clinicians to assess and diagnose chest pain in adult patients.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted from November 11, 2017, to May 1, 2020, encompassing studies, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Collaboration, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality reports, and other relevant databases. Additional relevant studies, published through April 2021, were also considered.

Structure

Chest pain is a frequent cause for emergency department visits in the United States. The "2021 AHA/ACC/ASE/CHEST/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR Guideline for the Evaluation and Diagnosis of Chest Pain" provides recommendations based on contemporary evidence on the assessment and evaluation of chest pain. These guidelines present an evidence-based approach to risk stratification and the diagnostic workup for the evaluation of chest pain. Cost-value considerations in diagnostic testing have been incorporated and shared decision-making with patients is recommended.

Synopsis — testing preferences and event rates in intermediate-high risk: The approach to the diagnostic evaluation of patients with no known CAD who are at intermediate to high risk (Figure 12) should be guided by the ability to achieve high-quality imaging as well as local availability and expertise. Intermediate-high risk patients have modest rates of obstructive CAD (~10%–20%) and risk of clinical events (~1%–2% per year). CCTA is preferable in those < 65 years of age and not on optimal preventive therapies, while stress testing may be advantageous in those ≥ 65 years of age (with a higher likelihood of ischemia).

### Time to move on: redefining chest pain outcomes [^112SH6iY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Chest pain is the second most common presenting symptom to emergency departments (EDs), accounting for > 7 million visits in the United States each year. 1 However, as few as 10% of patients presenting to the ED with chest pain will ultimately be diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). 2 ACS can be a challenging diagnosis in the ED as the initial history, physical examination, and ECG alone can neither confirm nor exclude the diagnosis. 2, 3

Although there have been many clinical decision rules for chest pain evaluation, the HEART score (history, EGG, age, risk factors, troponin) has come to the forefront of emergency medicine practice, as it is the only model to be evaluated by multiple independent research groups in both validation and clinical impact studies and has outperformed alternate prediction models in comparison studies. 2, 3

It was designed to assess patients presenting to the ED with possible ACS and identify those at low risk for adverse events who may be suitable for discharge. 4 However, the HEART score can also be used to justify hospital admission for those deemed to be moderate to high risk for a major adverse cardiac event (MACE), which may lead to increased testing and/or intervention.

But is MACE an appropriate outcome? And is the timeline relevant to a decision at the beside in the ED? A MACE outcome is a composite of acute myocardial infarction (MI), percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and all‐cause death. Composite outcome measures, such as MACE, result in higher event rates and have been used when other serious events (missed MI or death) are relatively rare. Clinical trials designed with composite end points subsequently require fewer patients, are less costly, and can be completed more quickly. Death and acute MI are important measures to assess in composite, but including revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass graft surgery) as outcome measures may imply that an adverse event has occurred, although appropriate emergent care has been provided. In addition, the MACE outcome is measured at 4–6 weeks, an unusual timeline in the ED disposition decision. This begs the question: does an increased risk of MACE at 4–6 weeks justify immediate hospitalization or emergent intervention?

Emergency department ECG assessment summary — The ECG is a critical component of the initial assessment and management of ED patients with possible ACS. The ECG should be rapidly assessed for evidence of acute infarction or ischemia, and if present, subsequent care should follow current guidelines for management of acute STEMI and NSTE-ACS. The ECG should also be examined for subtle changes that are also consistent with ACS as well as for other findings that could suggest a non-ACS cause for their symptoms, and patients who have a non-ischemic ECG (as defined previously) are eligible for entering a CDP, and further clinical evaluation should take place as outlined later.

Patients with chest pain in whom the initial ECG is consistent with an ACS should be treated according to STEMI and non–ST-segment–elevation ACS guidelines (COR 1; LOE C-EO). In patients with chest pain and intermediate-to-high clinical suspicion for ACS in whom the initial ECG is nondiagnostic, supplemental electrocardiographic leads V7 to V9 are reasonable to rule out posterior myocardial infarction (MI) (COR 2a; LOE B-NR).

Acute chest pain and suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) — troponin sampling, prior testing, and single-sample rule-out: In patients for whom serial troponins are indicated to exclude myocardial injury, repeat measurements after the initial sample are 1 to 3 hours for high-sensitivity troponin and 3 to 6 hours for conventional troponin assays. Institutions should implement a clinical decision pathway (CDP) with a protocol for troponin sampling based on their particular assay, and previous testing when available should be considered and incorporated into CDPs. For patients with a normal ECG and symptoms suggestive of ACS that began at least 3 hours before ED arrival, a single hs-cTn concentration that is below the limit of detection on initial measurement (time zero) is reasonable to exclude myocardial injury.

Evaluation of acute chest pain with suspected gastrointestinal syndromes — In patients with recurrent acute chest pain without evidence of a cardiac or pulmonary cause, evaluation for gastrointestinal causes is reasonable (COR 2a, LOE C-LD). Among outpatients who present with chest pain, approximately 10% to 20% have a gastrointestinal cause. The first step in evaluation of potential esophageal chest pain is a careful history, and when an esophageal cause of chest pain is suspected, upper endoscopy should be considered. Symptoms and signs that merit early evaluation (usually within 2 weeks) include dysphagia, odynophagia, gastrointestinal bleeding, unexplained iron deficiency anemia, weight loss, and recurrent vomiting. Patients without these symptoms may merit a trial of empiric acid suppression therapy, and if an upper endoscopy is normal and symptoms persist despite a trial of acid suppression, consideration should be given to additional evaluation, such as esophageal function testing and pH monitoring, to exclude other esophageal causes.

Initial assessment of chest pain — terminology, examination, and chest X-ray guidance include using the terms "cardiac, possible cardiac, and noncardiac" to describe the suspected cause; clinical assessment "should include the chest pain description and associated symptoms, onset, duration, location, radiation, and precipitating and relieving factors"; there are "no physical examination findings specific for coronary ischemia", so the exam "should be targeted to identify findings associated with high risk for morbidity and mortality in ACS, or to the presence of potential alternative diagnoses", with high-risk findings including "signs of low cardiac output… heart failure… and a new systolic murmur concerning for acute mitral regurgitation or a ventricular septal defect"; as part of the initial assessment, "a chest X-ray should be performed in almost all patients with possible ACS", given its potential to identify high-risk and noncardiac causes, and "performance of a chest X-ray should not delay emergent interventions such as primary percutaneous coronary intervention for those with a definitive STEMI".
