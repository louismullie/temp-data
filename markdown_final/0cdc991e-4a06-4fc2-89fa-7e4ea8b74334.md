## Question

A 24-year-old graduate student is brought to the emergency department by her boyfriend because of chest pain that started 90 minutes ago. Her boyfriend says she has been taking medication to help her study for an important exam and has not slept in several days. On examination, she is diaphoretic, agitated, and attempts to remove her IV lines and ECG leads. Her temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 128/min, and blood pressure is 163/97 mmHg. Her pupils are dilated. The most appropriate next step in management is the administration of which of the following?
A. Dantrolene
B. Activated charcoal
C. Ketamine
D. Lorazepam

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medication should be administered next for a 24-year-old with suspected stimulant intoxication, chest pain, tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, mydriasis, and severe agitation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the likely toxidrome and immediate safety priorities. Then, I should verify the first-line pharmacologic therapy for stimulant-induced hyperadrenergic symptoms and agitation. Next, I will examine why the distractors are inappropriate or risky. Finally, I should confirm concurrent workup elements that must not be delayed while initiating treatment, and then state the single best answer with clear justification.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome. The triad of agitation, tachycardia, and hypertension, with diaphoresis and mydriasis, fits a sympathomimetic or stimulant toxidrome, and the history of sleeplessness with "study medication" strongly suggests amphetamine or methylphenidate intoxication; chest pain in this context raises concern for vasospasm, demand ischemia, or even ACS, so I need to ensure we treat the toxidrome while concurrently evaluating cardiac risk and protecting the airway and staff [^112JWFg2] [^1166TQTh] [^113Yfe4x].

> Wait, let me verify the immediate priorities. I need to ensure patient and staff safety, secure IV access, apply continuous monitoring, and begin de-escalation and supportive care; in parallel, I should obtain a 12-lead ECG and consider troponins because chest pain in stimulant intoxication warrants evaluation for ACS even as we manage the hyperadrenergic state, and I should be prepared to escalate to a higher-acuity setting if deterioration occurs [^117MpFKB] [^113Yfe4x] [^1158u1Hw].

> Now, I should confirm the first-line pharmacologic therapy. Benzodiazepines are recommended as first-line for stimulant-induced agitation and hyperadrenergic symptoms because they enhance GABAergic inhibition, reduce catecholamine release, and thereby lower heart rate and blood pressure while calming agitation; lorazepam is a reasonable choice with predictable IV onset and titratability in this setting [^116Fw7z6] [^117CiSRF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the distractors. I initially thought ketamine might be appropriate because it rapidly controls severe agitation; but wait, ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic with sympathomimetic properties that can increase heart rate and blood pressure, which could worsen the hyperadrenergic state in stimulant intoxication, so it should be reserved for cases refractory to benzodiazepines where rapid control is absolutely necessary for safety, not as first-line here [^117Q6Ama] [^117Q6Ama].

> I need to check the other options. Dantrolene is for malignant hyperthermia or severe hyperthermia with muscle rigidity, not for stimulant-induced agitation without hyperthermia, so it is not indicated here; activated charcoal is for recent ingestions and does not address the acute hyperadrenergic crisis, and it is not the next step when the patient is severely agitated and at risk of aspiration or harm [^notfound].

> Let me consider adjuncts if benzodiazepines are insufficient. If agitation or hypertension persists despite adequate benzodiazepine dosing, I should consider alpha-2 agonists such as dexmedetomidine or clonidine, or carefully selected antihypertensives like nicardipine or labetalol with alpha-1 blockade, while avoiding long-acting agents and remembering that beta-blockers can be problematic in cocaine intoxication due to unopposed alpha stimulation; these are conditional next steps after benzodiazepines, not first-line [^113Y4K1w] [^1112Hjf6] [^1166TQTh].

> I should double-check that we are not missing concurrent care. While initiating lorazepam, I will obtain an ECG, monitor continuous vitals, assess for hyperthermia and rhabdomyolysis, and if chest pain persists or ECG is concerning, I will pursue ACS evaluation with serial troponins and cardiology consultation; this parallel approach addresses both the toxidrome and potential cardiac complications without delay [^113Yfe4x] [^1158u1Hw].

> Putting this together, the most appropriate next step is lorazepam to rapidly control agitation, reduce sympathetic outflow, and mitigate tachycardia and hypertension while we continue diagnostic evaluation and safety measures; ketamine is a conditional rescue, not first-line, and dantrolene and activated charcoal are not indicated for this presentation [^116Fw7z6] [^111YG6q7] [^117Q6Ama].

---

The most appropriate next step is **lorazepam** [^111YG6q7] because it rapidly controls agitation and hyperadrenergic symptoms in stimulant intoxication, reducing the risk of cardiovascular complications and allowing safe evaluation and management [^116Fw7z6]. Benzodiazepines are **first-line** for stimulant-induced agitation and chest pain, with lorazepam preferred for its fast IV onset and favorable safety profile [^116K7pve] [^117CiSRF]. Ketamine is not first-line due to hypertension and tachycardia risk, and dantrolene is for malignant hyperthermia, not stimulant toxicity [^notfound]. Activated charcoal is not indicated given the likely rapid absorption of stimulants [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation and differential diagnosis

The patient's presentation — agitation, diaphoresis, dilated pupils, tachycardia, hypertension, and chest pain — is consistent with **sympathomimetic toxicity** from stimulant use (e.g. cocaine, amphetamines, methylphenidate) [^112JWFg2]. The differential includes:

- **Sympathomimetic toxicity**: Most likely given the clinical picture and history of stimulant use [^112JWFg2].
- **Serotonin syndrome**: Less likely without serotonergic drug history or neuromuscular hyperactivity [^117MAoeh].
- **Anticholinergic toxicity**: Typically presents with dry skin, blurred vision, and urinary retention, not diaphoresis [^notfound].
- **Hyperthyroidism**: Possible but less likely without goiter or ophthalmopathy.
- **Pheochromocytoma**: Rare; typically episodic and less likely in this age group [^11736Dnm].

---

## Pharmacological management of stimulant intoxication

Benzodiazepines are **first-line** for stimulant-induced agitation and hyperadrenergic symptoms, including chest pain, because they reduce sympathetic outflow and stabilize cardiovascular parameters [^116Fw7z6] [^1164xBaW]. Lorazepam is preferred for its rapid IV onset, predictable pharmacokinetics, and favorable safety profile [^notfound].

---

## Comparison of pharmacological options

| **Medication** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical considerations** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Lorazepam | Benzodiazepine; GABAergic | - Rapid onset <br/> - Effective for agitation <br/> - Reduces sympathetic outflow <br/> - Safe cardiovascular profile | First-line [^111YG6q7] [^116Fw7z6] |
| Ketamine | NMDA antagonist; dissociative anesthetic | - Rapid onset <br/> - Risk of hypertension <br/> - Tachycardia <br/> - Emergence phenomena | Not first-line; consider only if benzodiazepines fail [^117Q6Ama] |
| Dantrolene | Muscle relaxant; ryanodine receptor antagonist | - For malignant hyperthermia <br/> - Not for stimulant toxicity | Not indicated [^notfound] |
| Activated charcoal | Gastrointestinal adsorbent | - Not effective for rapidly absorbed stimulants <br/> - Risk of aspiration | Not indicated [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines recommend benzodiazepines as **first-line** for stimulant-induced agitation and hyperadrenergic symptoms, with lorazepam specifically recommended for its rapid onset and safety [^111YG6q7] [^116Fw7z6]. Ketamine may be considered for refractory agitation but is not first-line due to cardiovascular risks [^117Q6Ama] [^111Upmx8].

---

## Potential risks and benefits of lorazepam

Benefits include **rapid control of agitation**, reduction of sympathetic outflow, stabilization of cardiovascular parameters, and facilitation of diagnostic evaluation. Risks include respiratory depression, sedation, and rare paradoxical agitation; these are mitigated by careful dosing and monitoring.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Lorazepam is the **most appropriate next step** for this patient. It rapidly controls agitation and hyperadrenergic symptoms, reduces cardiovascular risk, and allows safe diagnostic evaluation and management. Ketamine, dantrolene, and activated charcoal are not indicated as initial therapy in this scenario [^117Q6Ama].

### How can we teach medical students to choose wisely? A randomised controlled cross-over study of video-versus text-based case scenarios [^116SubXd]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Digital interventions in medical education need to be informed by educational and psychological research. One recent example of this type of 'translational research' in medical education is the growing body of evidence showing that test-enhanced learning enhances knowledge and skills retention in undergraduate medical students. The basic idea is that questions can be used to stimulate learning processes. Thus far, a number of studies have shown that tests can in fact be used as learning tools in medical education. For example, in one study involving 47 first-year medical students, repeated testing of factual knowledge in neurology elicited greater long-term retention than repeated study of the same material. Another randomised study yielded a similar effect for the retention of practical (resuscitation) skills. However, none of these studies focussed on clinical reasoning. One potential reason for this is that rote memory can easily be tested using multiple choice questions while testing clinical reasoning is more complex. One test format suited for this purpose is the so-called key feature question. A key feature is defined as a significant step in patient management. Key feature questions were designed to test the knowledge needed to avoid common errors occurring at these decisive points. For example, the key features in one of the cases used in this study referred to the management of a potentially life-threatening condition. First, students were prompted to provide the most likely diagnosis (key feature 1: pulmonary embolism) for a 44-year-old female patient who had been immobilised with lumbago for a week and who experienced sudden chest pain and shortness of breath following defaecation. In the second question, students were expected to identify calculation of the Wells Score as the next key feature in patient management. Following this, students were informed that this score was 6, and they were asked to name the most appropriate next step for the patient who was haemodynamically stable (key feature 3: CT scan). Upon confirmation of the diagnosis, students were asked about a diagnostic procedure that can inform risk stratification for this particular patient (key feature 4: PESI score, cardiac ultrasound or troponin measurement). In the fifth section of the case, the patient is no longer haemodynamically stable and requires catecholamine therapy, and students were asked to indicate the therapeutic action required (key feature 5: thrombolysis). A recent review confirmed that key feature questions lend themselves to the assessment of clinical reasoning, and it has been suggested they could be used in a test-enhanced learning paradigm. We recently reported the findings of a randomised study of repeated testing with key feature questions on outcomes related to clinical reasoning, wherein 6 months after the intervention, students retained significantly more content that had been presented in key feature questions compared to content that had been presented in a didactic format but without interspersed questions (56% vs. 49%; p < 0.001).

Dysautonomia is a potentially life-threatening syndrome seen in many different types of brain injuries. It involves paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity and typically includes a constellation of symptoms, including: tachycardia, tachypnea, hyperthermia, hypertension, diaphoresis, hypertonia, and/or decerebrate or decorticate posturing. It is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion. A multimodal treatment approach is necessary including environmental modifications along with pharmacotherapy. Early management can help prevent comorbidities including secondary brain injury while also improving patient outcomes. This discussion serves as an overview of dysautonomia with a focus on management in the pediatric population including an example of a clinical algorithm and a review of the commonly used medications.

Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder

A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that Nardil is not approved for use in treating bipolar depression.

It should be noted that NARDIL is not approved for use in treating any indications in the pediatric population.

The most serious reactions to NARDIL involve changes in blood pressure.

Hypertensive Crises

The most important reaction associated with NARDIL administration is the occurrence of hypertensive crises, which have sometimes been fatal.

These crises are characterized by some or all of the following symptoms: occipital headache which may radiate frontally, palpitation, neck stiffness or soreness, nausea, vomiting, sweating (sometimes with fever and sometimes with cold, clammy skin), dilated pupils, and photophobia. Either tachycardia or bradycardia may be present and can be associated with constricting chest pain.

NOTE: Intracranial bleeding has been reported in association with the increase in blood pressure.

Blood pressure should be observed frequently to detect evidence of any pressor response in all patients receiving NARDIL. Therapy should be discontinued immediately upon the occurrence of palpitation or frequent headaches during therapy.

Recommended treatment in hypertensive crisis

If a hypertensive crisis occurs, NARDIL should be discontinued immediately and therapy to lower blood pressure should be instituted immediately. On the basis of present evidence, phentolamine is recommended. (The dosage reported for phentolamine is 5 mg intravenously.) Care should be taken to administer this drug slowly in order to avoid producing an excessive hypotensive effect. Fever should be managed by means of external cooling.

Warning to the Patient

All patients should be warned that the following foods, beverages, and medications must be avoided while taking NARDIL, and for two weeks after discontinuing use.

Assessing nOH treatment success

Assessment of treatment success needs to be a multifaceted approach involving predominantly the measurement of symptomatic improvements as well as ongoing blood pressure measurements. It is critical that patients are educated on the various symptoms and about how to keep a diary of symptoms. Similarly, it is necessary for the patient to conduct a period of home monitoring of blood pressure after implementing new or additional non-pharmacologic measures or after a change in treatment or dose. We recommend that patients check their blood pressures at home in the supine head-up position (at bedtime, prior to arising in the morning, and while the patient is in their normal head-up sleeping position). Patients taking pressor medications such as midodrine or droxidopa should avoid the supine position during the 4–5 h after taking medication), and check blood pressure after 3 min of standing. We recommend checking blood pressures first thing in the morning prior to taking any morning medications, when symptomatic, and at bedtime for several days. The blood pressure diary should be evaluated by the healthcare provider 2 weeks after any therapeutic change to determine the need for further adjustments. (An example patient diary for blood pressure and heart rate monitoring is provided in Appendix I). If blood pressure measurements have been stable, a reduction in monitoring frequency can be considered, but reinstituted if symptoms worsen or if medications are changed. Lastly, 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring can be considered so that there is an ongoing record of the impact of treatment on blood pressure. Additional clinical assessments will be largely driven by symptom frequency and severity. However, re-assessment of the clinical condition should occur at every visit via symptom review and orthostatic blood pressure measurements.

Referring the nOH patient

With appropriate education, the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of nOH are well within the purview of both primary and specialist clinicians. With a diagnosis of nOH, the clinician can assign an OH severity Grade based on blood pressure changes, symptoms, and impact on activities of daily living. Once diagnosis is established, the clinician can take the patient through steps 1, 2, and 3 of the treatment algorithm. However, if the patient experiences pharmacotherapy failure, it may be useful to refer the patient to a specialist who is experienced in treating patients with nOH. Additionally, if the clinician is at any time uncomfortable with treating a patient with nOH of high severity (Grades 3 to 4), they should refer the patient to a specialist with expertise in the treatment of nOH.

In settings with healthcare provision (custody suites, ambulance services or EDs)

Clinical staff have additional skills, training and potential opportunities to undertake patient assessment which may lead to a better understanding of the cause of the presentation of ABD, or negate the need to use the term.
Healthcare professionals have a responsibility to differentiate the cause of the patient's presentation.
Staff should: Have plans regarding the management of patients presenting with ABD until emergency care has arrived, including de-escalation. Have access to readily available emergency equipment in environments which may be required to care for people presenting with ABD. Be aware that restraint may worsen a patient's condition. Understand that the combination of physical health deterioration and behavioural disorganisation is likely to need emergency medical care.
Observable features leading to recognition of a presentation of ABD should have more detail for healthcare staff.
The triad of being hot to touch (tactile hyperthermia), exhibiting constant or near-constant activity, and extreme agitation or aggression should be the focus of recognition, as the majority of other described signs and symptoms arise as a consequence of these.
Individual features are insufficient for recognition of ABD. The person should be exhibiting more than one consensus feature.
When recognising a presentation of ABD, there should be a focus on objective findings, such as: Hot to touch/sweating/hyperthermia/removal of clothing. Constant or near-constant physical activity. Severe agitation. Confusion/disorientation. High levels of anxiety. Hypervigilance/fearfulness/panic/paranoia. Tachypnoea. Tachycardia. Hypertension.
Additional features which may lead to the recognition of a presentation of ABD by healthcare staff include: Findings on clinical examination: Being unable to obtain observations due to agitation — BP, pulse, pulse oximetry, pupil size. Evidence of autonomic dysfunction. Does not appear to tire, agitated and not interacting, or psychomotor agitation. Exhibiting exceptional strength. Does not understand verbal commands. Psychological distress with the potential to harm themselves or another person. Disinhibited or violent behaviour. Aggression with no identifiable reason. Features of psychosis (eg, hallucinations). Delirium. Sympathomimetic toxidrome. The circumstances of the presentation: Exhibiting behaviour reported to not be normal for them. The features had a sudden onset. Failure of de-escalation techniques. Constant resistance to restraint, or restraint for 15 min without resolution or de-escalation. Sustained non-compliance with police or ambulance staff. Hypoglycaemia has been excluded. Likely to have ingested stimulant drugs. Increased pain tolerance. Acute deterioration. An ongoing need for sedation at higher doses than would typically be expected.
The following features should not be used to identify ABD: Attraction to mirrors or glass. Destruction of mirrors or glass. Difficult to palpate a radial pulse. Intolerance to light. Vacant expression.
When professionals believe the ABD criteria are met, the person should always be moved to an ED for assessment, as an emergency.

Regarding patients who are breathing and conscious with a suspected presentation of ABD

Healthcare provider input should be available as an emergency (within 20 min) if: There is a triad of tactile hyperthermia, extreme agitation or aggression, and constant or near-constant activity. The person is restrained for 15 min without resolution or de-escalation. There is sudden cessation of resistance, or the person suddenly becomes quiescent. There is a history of syncope or pre-syncope, seizures or chest pain. Features are identified which may be present in ABD or suggest a higher degree of risk, such as: Constant or near-constant activity. Persistent or extreme agitation or aggression. Tactile hyperthermia or sweating profusely. A sudden change in rate or depth of breathing. The person is requiring medication for agitation. The person cannot be calmed with de-escalation techniques. Continued use of force with a high degree of resistance. Clear indications of key drug use (eg, cocaine, other stimulants, phencyclidine, lysergic acid diethylamide). There is an inability to safely manage the risk to self or others. The person is a risk to themselves or others. Hyperkalaemia, raised lactate or acute kidney injury are identified on blood tests. A cause for the person's presentation cannot be identified. Features are identified on examination: Physiological derangement. An abnormality identified in primary survey. Abnormal vital signs, blood glucose or ECG. Confusion. Features of psychosis. Bizarre behaviour or thoughts. Clonus. Significant physical injuries. Exhibiting behaviour reported to not be normal for them.
All people presenting with ABD require an emergency response.
The same criteria should be used as for anyone with acute agitation.
A person presenting with ABD cannot wait 2 hours for assessment.
If a person initially presented with high-risk features but has subsequently improved, then non-emergency healthcare response may become appropriate.
If a person's behaviour has returned to normal and the features identified in (37.f) are excluded on clinical examination, a subsequent non-urgent response is possible.

Regarding observation in police custody

Observation in police custody would only be safe following diagnosis of the cause of the ABD and return of temperature, pulse, RR and other clinical parameters to acceptable levels having been monitored in a setting with full resuscitation facilities.
The person should have decreasing levels of agitation, and this should be manageable with simple measures.
The person should be coherent and able to converse giving rational responses.

Stimulant withdrawal — Abrupt discontinuation or reduction in stimulant use can cause stimulant withdrawal syndrome, and many patients will experience 12 to 24 hours of somnolence and irritability — likely due to catecholamine depletion and sleep deprivation. During periods of abrupt stimulant reduction or discontinuation, clinicians should be attentive to the patient's physical and mental health signs and symptoms. The current standard of care for managing stimulant withdrawal focuses on ameliorating presenting signs and symptoms and minimizing risks. Behavioral and environmental interventions should be used to foster a calming environment.

### New psychoactive substances in pediatric patients [^112QqoJ5]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

New psychoactive substances (NPS), namely cannabinoids, cathinones, and opioids, have surged in popularity among school-age children, resulting in serious morbidity and mortality globally. In the last decade, there has been a rapid evolution of NPS resulting in hundreds of new compounds. Little to no evidence for humans is available on most compounds. The clinical presentations of patients intoxicated with cannabinoids and cathinones are highly variable but most commonly present with a sympathomimetic toxidrome, for example, agitation, delirium, and tachycardia. Those with opioids present with a classic opioid toxidrome: coma, dilated pupils, and respiratory failure.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^1166TQTh]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Stimulant intoxication — assessment and hyperadrenergic symptom management — clinicians should assess hyperadrenergic signs and symptoms, including tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, and agitation, and ongoing monitoring and management of vital signs — especially heart rate and blood pressure — is critical to prevent complications from sympathomimetic toxicity. GABAergic agents are the primary treatment for stimulant-related hyperadrenergic symptoms, and significant hyperadrenergic symptoms should typically be managed in an acute care setting. For cocaine intoxication with cardiovascular disease, beta blockers are generally contraindicated; many experts recommend alternative medications such as calcium channel blockers, alpha-1 adrenergic antagonists, alpha-2 adrenergic agonists, and nitric oxide-mediated vasodilators, noting these classes may be most beneficial for hypertension and vasospasm but may result in poor control of reflex tachycardia. Limited data indicate that alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (e.g., dexmedetomidine for more severe symptoms, clonidine for mild to moderate symptoms) are beneficial for stimulant-induced agitation, can be useful for hypertension and tachycardia, and thus should be considered in the management of the hyperadrenergic state of stimulant intoxication; clinicians should monitor for medication side effects with usual care. If considering pharmacotherapy with a beta blocker, one with concomitant alpha-1 antagonism (e.g., labetalol) is preferred due to low risk of unopposed alpha stimulation, and clinicians should consider consulting with a specialist in these instances; additionally, calcium channel blockers may decrease hypertension and vasospasm but not necessarily tachycardia, and benzodiazepines appear safe for non-cardiovascular related symptoms.

### Unintentional cetirizine overdose causing anticholinergic syndrome [^114MHYGF]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The incidence of anticholinergic syndrome due to second generation antihistamines is infrequently reported. Largely due to their decreased affinity for central nervous system (CNS) receptors, second generation antihistamines are rarely associated with anticholinergic symptoms, though toxicity is still possible particularly when taken in excess. We report a case of a six year old boy who presented with agitation, hallucinations, fixed and dilated pupils, tachycardia, and hyperthermia consistent with anticholinergic toxicity several hours after accidental overdose of a second generation antihistamine, cetirizine. Early identification of this rare phenomenon is important not only for appropriate emergency management but also for avoidance of potentially invasive and unnecessary tests which may further increase patient morbidity.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^115RFLAg]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines — stimulant poisoning/overdose pertinent assessment findings state that history is as important as the physical examination. If the patient is on psychiatric medication, but has failed to be compliant, this fact alone puts the patient at higher risk for the adverse outcome of delirium with agitated behavior. If the patient is found naked, this may elevate the suspicion for stimulant use or abuse; these substances increase the risk for sudden death secondary to delirium with agitated behavior, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome or serotonin syndrome can present with similar signs and symptoms. If polypharmacy is suspected, hypertension and tachycardia are expected hemodynamic findings secondary to increased dopamine release, and stimulus reduction from benzodiazepines, anti-psychotics, and ketamine will improve patient's vital signs and behavior. Be prepared for the potential of cardiovascular collapse as well as respiratory arrest. If a vasopressor is needed, epinephrine or norepinephrine is recommended over dopamine.

Case presentation

A middle-aged Liberian mechanic presented to JFK hospital, Liberia's main teaching hospital and referral centre, with a chief complaint of severe chest pain and palpitations for 2 weeks' duration. The pain was described as dull and progressively worsening, until the morning of admission where he described 8/10 crushing chest pain radiating to the neck and jaw, partially relieved by morphine in the emergency department. Associated features included diaphoresis, vomiting and agitation. There was no history of chest trauma, connective tissue disease, hypertension, diabetes or dyslipidaemia. He had no other known medical conditions, and he was not taking any medications at the time of admission. There was no history of illicit drug use, and he had a remote 10 pack-year smoking history, quitting 22 years ago.

On examination, he was diaphoretic, and in severe distress secondary to pain. Vital signs included a blood pressure (BP) of 130/86 mm Hg, heart rate of 116 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute and a temperature of 36.5°C with a body mass index of 30.4 kg/m 2. No oxygen saturation was documented. His cardiovascular exam was unremarkable with no murmur, radial-radial delay or significant BP differential on each arm; the only pertinent finding on the rest of his examination was epigastric tenderness.

Supported by an ECG showing an anteroseptal ST elevation myocardial infarction (figure 1), the initial impression was acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Cardiac enzymes and D-dimer are not readily available at JFK. Percutaneous coronary intervention or thrombolysis were also not available; he was managed with morphine, oxygen, nitrates and aspirin; however, the pain continued to progress. The managing team suspected an aortic dissection, so a chest X-ray (CXR) was performed, which showed mediastinal widening (figure 2), prompting a point-of-care ultrasound. This showed a dilated aortic root > 4 cm (5.48 cm) (figure 3) with visible dissection flap at the aortic root (figure 4).

Conservative and medical treatment — general considerations — reducing the number of medications that cause hypotension can be helpful, provided that it does not worsen conditions such as hypertension and heart failure; several narrative and systematic reviews have evaluated the benefits of lifestyle and medical therapies, and while results have generally been positive in uncontrolled trials and short-term controlled trials, those of long-term, placebo-controlled prospective trials have been less encouraging; furthermore, only the most motivated patients will commit to medical therapy to prevent a handful of yearly syncopal episodes.

### Development and validation of the emergency department assessment of chest pain score and 2 h accelerated diagnostic protocol [^116HiT3x]. Emergency Medicine Australasia (2014). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Emergency Department Assessment of Chest Pain Score (EDACS)" for chest pain.

The Emergency Department Assessment of Chest Pain Score (EDACS) is a clinical calculator used in the emergency department setting to stratify the risk of patients presenting with chest pain. It is specifically designed to identify patients at low risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) within 30 days, who are safe for early discharge without further diagnostic testing.

The EDACS applies to adult patients presenting to the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. It incorporates variables such as age, sex, risk factors for coronary artery disease, duration of pain, pain characteristics, and initial ECG changes to generate a score.

The clinical utility of the EDACS is to aid in the safe and efficient disposition of patients in the emergency department, reducing unnecessary admissions and investigations, and improving patient flow.

Exclusion criteria for the use of EDACS include patients with obvious non-cardiac causes of chest pain, known coronary artery disease, or those who are hemodynamically unstable.

The Emergency Department Assessment of Chest Pain Score (EDACS) is a tool designed to assess the risk of chest pain in patients by calculating a numerical score based on various clinical inputs. This score helps determine the clinical pathway by indicating the level of risk associated with the patient's chest pain. Here's a guide to how the EDACS works:

The calculator uses six key inputs, each assigned a set of points based on specific conditions:

- **Age (years)**:
	- **18–45**: 2 points
	- **46–50**: 4 points
	- **51–55**: 6 points
	- **56–60**: 8 points
	- **61–65**: 10 points
	- **66–70**: 12 points
	- **71–75**: 14 points
	- **76–80**: 16 points
	- **81–85**: 18 points
	- **≥ 86**: 20 points

- **Gender**:
	- **Male**: 6 points
	- **Female**: 0 points

- Known coronary artery disease or ≥ 3 risk factors (only for patients aged 18–50 years):
	- **Yes**: 4 points
	- **No**: 0 points

- **Symptoms and signs**:
	- **Diaphoresis**: 3 points
	- **Chest pain radiating to arm or shoulder**: 5 points
	- **Chest pain occurring or worsening with inspiration**: 4 points
	- **Chest pain reproduced by palpation**: 6 points

- **New ischemia on electrocardiogram**:
	- **Yes**: 16 points
	- **No**: 0 points

- **Troponins (initial and 2-hour)**:
	- **Both negative**: 0 points
	- **Either positive**: 16 points

For each of these inputs, the corresponding points are summed up to give a total score. This cumulative score ranges from a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 68.

Next, interpret the score:

- **Scores less than 16 suggest a low risk**: "Safe for discharge to early outpatient follow-up (or proceed to earlier inpatient testing)".
- **Scores of 16 or higher indicate the patient is not at low risk**: "Not eligible for discharge, proceed with usual care with further observation and troponin testing".

This interpretation helps healthcare providers decide on the appropriate management strategy, ensuring that patients with higher risk receive adequate observation and testing, while those deemed low-risk can be safely discharged or directed to follow-up care.

5.3 Blood Pressure Elevation

Tyramine-Induced Hypertensive Crisis

EMSAM inhibits the catabolism of dietary amines, such as tyramine, and has the potential to produce a hypertensive crisis following the ingestion of tyramine-rich foods or beverages [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Hypertensive crises, which in some cases may be fatal, are characterized by some or all of the following symptoms: occipital headache which may radiate frontally, palpitation, neck stiffness or soreness, nausea, vomiting, sweating (sometimes with fever and sometimes with cold, clammy skin), dilated pupils, and photophobia. Either tachycardia or bradycardia may be present and can be associated with constricting chest pain. Intracranial bleeding has been reported in association with the increase in blood pressure. Patients should be instructed as to the signs and symptoms of severe hypertension and advised to seek immediate medical attention if these signs or symptoms are present.

If a hypertensive crisis occurs, EMSAM should be discontinued immediately and therapy to lower blood pressure should be instituted immediately. Fever should be managed by means of external cooling. Patients must be closely monitored until symptoms have stabilized. To prevent a hypertensive crisis, patients receiving treatment with EMSAM 9 mg per 24 hours or EMSAM 12 mg per 24 hours should follow the advice regarding a low tyramine diet described in Table 5 under Dietary Modifications Required for Patients Taking EMSAM 9 mg per 24 hours and 12 mg per 24 hours [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Blood Pressure Elevation Related to Concomitant Medication

Carbamazepine is contraindicated with EMSAM because carbamazepine has been shown to significantly elevate selegiline levels, which may increase the risk of a hypertensive crisis [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.4)].

The use of EMSAM with adrenergic drugs or buspirone may produce substantial increases in blood pressure. Therefore, monitor blood pressure if EMSAM is used with any of the following drugs: buspirone, amphetamines, or cold products or weight-reducing preparations that contain sympathomimetic amines (e.g., pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine, phenylpropanolamine, and ephedrine).

The treatment of hypertension is preventive medicine. This principle applies in the emergency room as well as the clinic. However, there are crucial contrasts between these two care settings related to specific goals of management for real emergencies and nonemergency conditions. In the emergency room, rapid triage is necessary to separate those who can safely be sent home for future clinic assessment from those who require immediate interventions including short stays in 24-hour observation units or hospitalization for more serious problems. This review focuses on decisions related to hypertension management in the emergency room and over brief periods of observation and treatment. Strategy is supported by evidence-based considerations whenever possible. Where outcome studies are not available, we rely on the rationale derived from relevant clinical research.

### High risk and low prevalence diseases: serotonin syndrome [^117MAoeh]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Serotonin syndrome is a rare, frequently misdiagnosed, serious condition with high morbidity.

Objective

This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of serotonin syndrome, including diagnosis, initial resuscitation, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence.

Discussion

Serotonin syndrome is a potentially deadly toxidrome marked by excess serotonin receptor activity or neurotransmission. Features of serotonin syndrome include 1) neuromuscular excitation such as tremor, hyperreflexia, and clonus; 2) autonomic dysfunction such as tachycardia, hypertension/hypotension, and hyperthermia; and 3) altered mental status such as agitation, delirium, and coma. Although serotonin syndrome may be more obvious in patients who have overdosed on serotonergic agents such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), multiple other medications may also cause serotonin syndrome. Alternative diagnoses such as sepsis, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and decompensated hyperthyroidism should be considered. The primary components of therapy include stopping the offending agent and supportive care, which focuses on agitation control, monitoring for and treating hyperthermia, and managing autonomic instability.

Conclusions

An understanding of serotonin syndrome can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this disease.

OVERDOSAGE

Clinical Effects of Overdose

Overdose of CNS stimulants is characterized by the following sympathomimetic effects:

Cardiovascular effects including tachyarrhythmias, and hypertension or hypotension. Vasospasm, myocardial infarction, or aortic dissection may precipitate sudden cardiac death. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy may develop.
CNS effects including psychomotor agitation, confusion, and hallucinations. Serotonin syndrome, seizures, cerebral vascular accidents, and coma may occur.
Life-threatening hyperthermia (temperatures greater than 104°F) and rhabdomyolysis may develop.

Exclude other causes of OH/nOH

If blood pressure and heart rate changes indicate OH/nOH, a complete history and physical examination, as well as electrocardiogram and laboratory testing, should be focused on ruling out non-neurogenic causes of OH, including cardiogenic, vascular, or iatrogenic etiologies. Table 2 lists recommended tests to conduct when evaluating a patient for OH/nOH. Cardiac disorders (e.g. pacemakers, dysrhythmias, ablation, etc.) can preclude heart rate augmentation; therefore, a cardiac history, an electrocardiogram, and medication review (as noted above) should consistently be performed. Due to variability among patients, including age, disease status, and current medication usage, the lack of heart rate increase on standing may not always be an accurate indicator of nOH in patients with OH; therefore, clinical scenario and specific presentation need to be considered.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) — "Nonpharmacologic treatments should be attempted first with all patients" and include withdrawing medications that might worsen POTS, enhanced salt and fluid intake, compression garments, and limiting deconditioning; for suspected hypovolemia, patients "should drink at least 2–3 L of water per day, and dietary salt intake should be increased to approximately 10–12 g/day". Exercise is advised with a "regular, structured, graduated, and supervised exercise program", and initially "exercise should be restricted to non-upright exercises". For rescue volume expansion, "1 L of normal saline infused over 1 hour decreases orthostatic tachycardia and improves symptoms for several hours to 2 days"; although not trial-tested, "this approach is recommended as rescue therapy", whereas "Long-term infusions of intravenous saline are not recommended for routine care". To reduce tachycardia and palpitations, "low-dose propranolol (10–20 mg PO) acutely lowers standing heart rate", while higher doses are less tolerated; ivabradine may help, with "Approximately 60% of patients with POTS treated with ivabradine in an open-label study" showing symptom improvement. For cholinergic augmentation, "Pyridostigmine is a peripheral acetylcholinesterase inhibitor", and "The drug blunts orthostatic tachycardia and can improve chronic symptoms but is limited by adverse effects such as diarrhea, abdominal pain and cramps, nausea, and increased urinary urgency and frequency". For venous return and vasoconstriction, midodrine "significantly reduces orthostatic tachycardia but to a lesser degree than intravenous saline" and "should be administered 3 times daily", with dosing "only… during daytime hours" due to supine hypertension risk.

Ketamine for acute agitation in the emergency department (ED) has a rapid onset, achieving the dissociated state within 1 to 2 minutes by the intravenous route and within approximately 3 minutes by the intramuscular route, with adverse effects including tachycardia, hypertension, emergence phenomenon, laryngospasm, hypersalivation, vomiting, and in out-of-hospital settings respiratory depression requiring escalation of care ranging from airway positioning to intubation in as many as 29% of patients. In a retrospective ED review of 27 patients, none became hypoxic, Sixty-two percent of patients required additional sedating medications, dosing ranged from 40 to 400 mg of intravenous or intramuscular ketamine, and the median dose was 200 mg. In a 2016 series, Forty-nine patients received intramuscular ketamine, with dosing of 4 to 6 mg/kg; 90% were adequately sedated within 1 hour; only one had hypoxia less than 90% responding immediately to oxygen administration. For aeromedical retrieval, in these instances, no patients required intubation after ketamine administration, and a common dosing strategy is intramuscular 4 to 6 mg/kg, with inadequate sedation often linked to low dosing. Out-of-hospital analyses found a significant dose difference between those intubated versus not (6.16 mg/kg [SD 1.62] versus 4.90 mg/kg [SD 1.54]; p = 0.02), and in most cases, emergence reaction can be easily treated with benzodiazepines. Although there is limited literature for guidance, the skill set of emergency physicians and their familiarity with the use of ketamine make it a reasonable choice when immediate control of an acutely agitated patient is required for patient and/or staff safety, and given the paucity of quality literature on this topic, future high-quality research is needed to establish the safety and efficacy of ketamine compared with other agents for control of the acutely agitated patient in the ED.

10 OVERDOSAGE

In clinical trials, a total of 151 protocol-specified doses ranging from 1000 to 1600 mg/day (5 to 8 times the recommended daily dose of PROVIGIL) have been administered to 32 subjects, including 13 subjects who received doses of 1000 or 1200 mg/day for 7 to 21 consecutive days. In addition, several intentional acute overdoses occurred; the two largest being 4500 mg and 4000 mg taken by two subjects participating in foreign depression studies. None of these study subjects experienced any unexpected or life-threatening effects. Adverse reactions that were reported at these doses included excitation or agitation, insomnia, and slight or moderate elevations in hemodynamic parameters. Other observed high-dose effects in clinical studies have included anxiety, irritability, aggressiveness, confusion, nervousness, tremor, palpitations, sleep disturbances, nausea, diarrhea, and decreased prothrombin time.

From postmarketing experience, there have been reports of fatal overdoses involving modafinil alone or in combination with other drugs. Symptoms most often accompanying PROVIGIL overdose, alone or in combination with other drugs have included insomnia; central nervous system symptoms such as restlessness, disorientation, confusion, agitation, anxiety, excitation, and hallucination; digestive changes such as nausea and diarrhea; and cardiovascular changes such as tachycardia, bradycardia, hypertension, and chest pain.

Cases of accidental ingestion/overdose have been reported in children as young as 11 months of age. The highest reported accidental ingestion on a mg/kg basis occurred in a three-year-old boy who ingested 800–1000 mg (50–63 mg/kg) of PROVIGIL. The child remained stable. The symptoms associated with overdose in children were similar to those observed in adults.

No specific antidote exists for the toxic effects of a PROVIGIL overdose. Such overdoses should be managed with primarily supportive care, including cardiovascular monitoring.

### Does this patient have pheochromocytoma? A systematic review of clinical signs and symptoms [^11736Dnm]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Pheochromocytoma is a rare disease but with high mortality if it is not being diagnosed early. Several biochemical tests with high accuracy have been obtained, but the clinical threshold for request of these tests is not determined clearly.

Objectives

To determine the Likelihood Ratios of clinical symptoms and signs in diagnosing pheochromocytoma. And also meta-analysis of their sensitivity in this disease.

Data Sources

MEDLINE was searched for relevant English-language articles dated 1960 to February 2014. Bibliographies were searched to find additional articles.

Study Selection

We included original studies describing the sensitivity and/or likelihood ratios of signs and symptoms in clinical suspicion of pheochromocytoma. Their method of diagnosis should have been based on pathology. We excluded specific subtypes or syndromes related to pheochromocytoma, or specific ages or gender. Also we excluded studies before 1993 (JNC5) which no definition of hypertension was presented. 37 articles were chosen finally.

Data Extraction

Two authors reviewed data from articles independently and gave discrepancies to third author for decision. The aim was extraction of raw numbers of patients having defined signs or symptoms, and draw 2×2 tables if data available. We meta-analyzed sensitivities by Statsdirect and Likelihood Ratios by Meta-disc soft wares. Because our data was heterogeneous based on I² > 50% (except negative Likelihood ratio of hypertension), we used random effect model for doing meta-analysis. We checked publication bias by drawing Funnel plot for each sign/symptom, and also Egger test.

Data Synthesis

The most prevalent signs and symptoms reported were hypertension (pooled sensitivity of 80.7%), headache (pooled sensitivity of 60.4%), palpitation (pooled sensitivity of 59.3%) and diaphoresis (pooled sensitivity of 52.4%). The definition of orthostatic hypotension was different among studies. The sensitivity was 23–50%. Paroxysmal hypertension, chest pain, flushing, and weakness were the signs/symptoms which had publication bias based on Funnel plot and Egger test (P value < 0.05). Seven of the articles had control group, and could be used for calculating LR of signs/symptoms. Diaphoresis (LR+ 2.2, LR- 0.45), Palpitation (LR+ 1.9, LR- 0.52) and headache (LR+ 1.6, LR- 0.24) were significant symptoms in clinical diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Other signs and symptoms had been reported in only one study and could not have been meta-analyzed. Classic triad of headache, palpitation and diaphoresis in hypertensive patients had the LR+ 6.312 (95% CI 0.217–183.217) and LR- 0.139 (95% CI 0.059–0.331). Surprisingly, hypertension was not important in clinical suspicion of pheochromocytoma, and even normotension increased the probability of the disease.

Conclusions

By available data, there is no single clinical finding that has significant value in diagnosis or excluding pheochromocytoma. Combination of certain symptoms, signs and para-clinical exams is more valuable for physicians. Further studies should be done, to specify the value of clinical findings. Until that time the process of diagnosis will be based on clinical suspicion and lab tests followed by related imaging.

OVERDOSAGE

Clinical Effects of Overdose

Overdose of CNS stimulants is characterized by the following sympathomimetic effects:

Cardiovascular effects including tachyarrhythmias, and hypertension or hypotension. Vasospasm, myocardial infarction, or aortic dissection may precipitate sudden cardiac death. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy may develop.
CNS effects including psychomotor agitation, confusion, and hallucinations. Serotonin syndrome, seizures, cerebral vascular accidents, and coma may occur.
Life-threatening hyperthermia (temperatures greater than 104°F) and rhabdomyolysis may develop.

Overdose Management

Consider the possibility of multiple drug ingestion. The pharmacokinetic profile of DEXEDRINE should be considered when treating patients with overdose. D-amphetamine is not dialyzable. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1–800–222–1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations.

### Hyperactive delirium with severe agitation [^111P9mgz]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyperactive delirium with severe agitation is a clinical syndrome of altered mental status, psychomotor agitation, and a hyperadrenergic state. The underlying pathophysiology is variable and often results from sympathomimetic abuse, psychiatric disease, sedative-hypnotic withdrawal, and metabolic derangement. Patients can go from a combative state to periarrest with little warning. Safety of the patient and of the medical providers is paramount and the emergency department should be prepared to manage these patients with adequate staffing, restraints, and pharmacologic sedatives. Treatment with benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, or ketamine is recommended, followed by airway protection, supportive measures, and cooling of hyperthermia.

### Management of hypertensive crisis: British and Irish hypertension society position document [^117Fqeb1]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

In a crisis, IV phentolamine may be useful for acute control of BP. If it is unavailable labetalol can be used rarely, though α-blockade with labetalol may be incomplete.

For illicit drug toxicity-induced HTN for example cocaine and amphetamines, IV benzodiazepines (BZD) are the first line treatment. BZDs by their action on gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors reduce agitation and prevent neurological complications such as seizures. If BP remains high despite BZDs, CCBs such as IV nicardipine, IV ß blockers such as labetalol infusion or IV GTN may be considered (Table 13).

### Case series of individuals with analytically confirmed acute mephedrone toxicity [^112gA2wk]. Clinical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Previous reports of acute toxicity/harm associated with mephedrone use have been based on self-reported mephedrone use; toxicological screening has not been undertaken in these cases to determine whether mephedrone has been used.

Objective

To report the first case series of analytically confirmed mephedrone-related acute toxicity.

Materials and Methods

Serum samples were collected from individuals presenting to an emergency department (ED) with acute toxicity related to self-reported mephedrone use. Toxicological analysis, by gas-chromatography coupled with mass-spectrometry and liquid chromatography with tandem mass-spectrometry was performed to qualitatively confirm mephedrone use. Symptoms/signs of acute mephedrone toxicity and basic physiological parameters were extracted from the routine ED records.

Results

Acute mephedrone-related toxicity was analytically confirmed in seven male patients; the mean ± SD age was 24.6 ± 6.5 years (range 16–36 years). Agitation (four patients) was the most common symptom/sign reported; other common symptoms/signs included: palpitations (two patients); chest pain (two patients); self-limiting pre-hospital seizures (one patient) and headaches (one patient). The mean heart rate was 109.1 ± 21.8 (range 80–140) beats per minute; one patient had a "severe" tachycardia (heart rate of ≥ 140 bpm). The mean systolic blood pressure was 153.0 ± 39.6 (range 110–210) mmHg; three patients had clinically significant hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mmHg).

Discussion

These analytically confirmed acute mephedrone toxicity presentations had clinical features of toxicity consistent with an acute sympathomimetic toxidrome (e.g. hypertension, tachycardia and agitation). These findings are similar to the pattern of toxicity seen with other sympathomimetic recreational drugs such as 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and cocaine.

Conclusion

The process for determining whether a novel psychoactive substance should be controlled often relies on demonstrated/proven acute harm associated with its use. It is important that clinical toxicologists undertake appropriate biological sampling and toxicological analyses in suspected cases of "novel psychoactive drug" toxicity. This will ensure that both clinicians and legislative authorities are informed of the confirmed pattern of toxicity associated with these drugs.

Diagnosis of postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) should include a complete history and physical examination, orthostatic vital signs, and a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG); selected patients might benefit from a thyroid function test and hematocrit, 24-hour Holter, transthoracic echocardiogram, and exercise stress testing, and a hematocrit, ECG, Holter, and echocardiogram are sufficient to screen for a potential cardiovascular or systemic etiology, with this minimal approach sufficient for most patients to establish a diagnosis and initiate treatment; if symptoms do not resolve or markedly improve, a more extensive evaluation at a center experienced with autonomic testing should be considered; while an expanded approach could include a thermoregulatory sweat test, supine and upright plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine level tests, a 24-hour urine sample to assess sodium intake, and a psychological assessment, these tests should not be performed routinely because there is no evidence that they improve the care or process of care in the majority of patients.

### The electrocardiographic toxidrome: the ECG presentation of hydrofluoric acid ingestion [^117Fjwe7]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The clinician can approach the poisoned patient using the toxidrome system of toxin identification; this approach makes use of findings noted on the physical examination, highlighting the importance of abnormalities in blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory effort, body temperature, mental status, pupillary size, skin color, diaphoresis, and gastrointestinal sounds. Such a method provides structure and guidance to the clinical evaluation, providing the clinician with rapid diagnostic information and suggesting urgent management issues. A case of hydrofluoric acid poisoning is used as an example of this diagnostic approach. The patient demonstrated systemic toxicity accompanied by oral irritation and electrocardiographic abnormality (QRS complex widening and QT interval prolongation). The constellation of these findings suggested the possibility of a caustic agent (history and examination) with potential effect on potassium and calcium metabolism (electrocardiographic abnormalities). Such a constellation strongly suggested hydrofluoric acid as the culprit toxin.

A 26-year-old woman presented to hospital with acute chest pain, hypertension, tachycardia and an elevated serum creatinine. She developed respiratory distress requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. She progressed to multiorgan failure due to decompensated congestive heart failure. Echocardiography demonstrated global hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of < 10%. Her cardiac function improved with fluid resuscitation and β blockade, and she was eventually discharged home. She was readmitted a few days later with pancreatitis after presenting with nausea, abdominal pain and hypertension. During hospitalisation she had paroxysms of headache, nausea and diaphoresis associated with hypertension and tachycardia. A CT scan of her abdomen revealed an adrenal mass and serum metanephrine studies confirmed the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. After fluid resuscitation and sympathetic blockade her ejection fraction improved to 55%. The patient underwent an uneventful adrenalectomy and made a complete recovery.

### Aortic dissection presenting as "Hysteria" [^116CbUeR]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with medical conditions may present with psychiatric symptoms, which may lead to worse physical health care. Here we present the case of a patient with acute aortic dissection masked by psychiatric symptoms after a stressful event.

Case Report

A 29-year-old female medical student presented to the Emergency Department (ED) complaining about the feeling of "hysteria" after an argument with her boyfriend earlier the same day. She did not report other symptoms or pain. Careful physical examination, initially impeded by the patient's agitation, revealed pulseless extremities. Blood gas analysis showed metabolic acidosis. Transthoracic echocardiography and computed tomography ultimately led to the correct diagnosis: Stanford Type-A aortic dissection. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Medical conditions requiring acute diagnostic work-up and therapy may present with psychiatric symptoms. Increased awareness and the use of standardized operating procedures in the ED may prevent fatal misdiagnoses in these patients.

10 OVERDOSAGE

In clinical trials, a total of 151 protocol-specified doses ranging from 1000 to 1600 mg/day (5 to 8 times the recommended daily dose of modafinil tablets) have been administered to 32 subjects, including 13 subjects who received doses of 1000 or 1200 mg/day for 7 to 21 consecutive days. In addition, several intentional acute overdoses occurred; the two largest being 4500 mg and 4000 mg taken by two subjects participating in foreign depression studies. None of these study subjects experienced any unexpected or life-threatening effects. Adverse reactions that were reported at these doses included excitation or agitation, insomnia, and slight or moderate elevations in hemodynamic parameters. Other observed high-dose effects in clinical studies have included anxiety, irritability, aggressiveness, confusion, nervousness, tremor, palpitations, sleep disturbances, nausea, diarrhea, and decreased prothrombin time.

From postmarketing experience, there have been reports of fatal overdoses involving modafinil alone or in combination with other drugs. Symptoms most often accompanying modafinil tablets overdose, alone or in combination with other drugs have included insomnia; central nervous system symptoms such as restlessness, disorientation, confusion, agitation, anxiety, excitation, and hallucination; digestive changes such as nausea and diarrhea; and cardiovascular changes such as tachycardia, bradycardia, hypertension, and chest pain.

Cases of accidental ingestion/overdose have been reported in children as young as 11 months of age. The highest reported accidental ingestion on a mg/kg basis occurred in a three-year-old boy who ingested 800 to 1000 mg (50 to 63 mg/kg) of modafinil tablets. The child remained stable. The symptoms associated with overdose in children were similar to those observed in adults.

No specific antidote exists for the toxic effects of a modafinil tablets overdose. Such overdoses should be managed with primarily supportive care, including cardiovascular monitoring.

### Management of hypertensive crisis: British and Irish hypertension society position document [^112xbERY]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Assessment of a patient presenting with hypertensive crisis

A detailed medical history and examination (Fig. 1a–c) are the cornerstones of successful management. Background information obtained from next of kin, family/general practitioner, and medical records, complete medication review, including current and previous antihypertensive drug use and review of adherence, is essential. Use of over-the-counter medications including sympathomimetic drugs (such as ephedrine), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, chemotherapy (especially vascular endothelial growth inhibitors), oral contraceptives, herbal compounds such as liquorice use or St John's wort, and illicit drugs such as cocaine. A complete system review to evaluate ongoing symptoms suggestive of EOD or underlying secondary causes, such as headaches, shortness of breath, palpitations and blurred vision should be undertaken. Complete examination, including BP measurement in both arms, peripheral pulsation including presence of radio-femoral delay should be undertaken. As noted above, retinal changes are key to diagnosis of MHT and hence fundoscopic examination should be performed in all patients presenting with severely increased BP with the aid of slit lamp examination and pupillary mydriasis if necessary. It is important to consider pregnancy and specifically exclude this in women in the childbearing age group with a urine pregnancy test. A bedside urine dipstick for blood and protein is important especially if nephropathy may be causal or a secondary result of HTN. However, if a life-threatening condition is suspected management should be commenced concomitantly.

### Intrathecal clonidine pump failure causing acute withdrawal syndrome with' stress-induced' cardiomyopathy [^112DXg4V]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2016). Low credibility.

Clonidine is a central alpha(2)-agonist antihypertensive used widely for opioid/alcohol withdrawal, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and chronic pain management. We describe a case of clonidine withdrawal causing life-threatening hypertensive crisis and stress-induced cardiomyopathy. A 47-year-old man with chronic back pain, treated with clonidine for many years via intrathecal pump (550 mcg/24 h), presented following a collapse and complaining of sudden worsening of back pain, severe headache, diaphoresis, nausea and vomiting. A few hours prior to presentation, his subcutaneous pump malfunctioned. On presentation, vital signs included pulse 100 bpm, BP 176/103 mmHg, temperature 37.8 °C and O2 saturation 100% (room air). Acute clonidine withdrawal with hypertensive crisis was suspected. Intravenous clonidine loading dose and a 50 mcg/h infusion were commenced. Five hours later, severe chest pain, dyspnoea, tachycardia, hypoxia, with BP 180/120 mmHg and pulmonary edema ensued. ECG showed sinus tachycardia with no ST elevation. Repeated intravenous clonidine doses were given (25 mcg every 5–10 min), with ongoing clonidine infusion to control blood pressure. Glyceryl trinitrate infusion, positive pressure ventilation and intravenous benzodiazepines were added. Bedside echocardiogram showed stress-induced cardiomyopathy pattern. Serum troponin-I was markedly elevated. His coronary angiography showed minor irregularities in the major vessels. Over the next 3 days in the ICU, drug infusions were weaned. Discharge was 12 days later on oral clonidine, metoprolol, perindopril, aspirin and oxycodone-SR. Two months later, his echocardiogram was normal. The intrathecal pump was removed. We report a case of stress-induced cardiomyopathy resulting from the sudden cessation of long-term intrathecal clonidine. This was managed by re-institution of clonidine and targeted organ-specific therapies.

"Best practices research", described in this paper, refers to a systematic process used to identify, describe, combine, and disseminate effective and efficient clinical and/or management strategies developed and refined by practicing clinicians. It involves five steps: development of a conceptual model or series of steps, definition of "best" based on values and standards, identification and evaluation of potentially effective methods for each component or step, combination of most-effective methods, and testing of combined methods. The chronological development of this process is described with case examples, and the methodological steps are discussed.

Stimulant-induced agitation — care setting, monitoring, and ketamine option: Agitation should typically be managed in acute care settings with monitoring and clinical resources, and clinicians should monitor for medication side effects with usual care. In severe stimulant-induced agitation refractory to benzodiazepines and antipsychotics where rapid control is necessary for safety, clinicians can consider IV or intramuscular ketamine, noting that onset of IM ketamine is very rapid and may be useful when IV placement would delay care.

Inpatients

Inpatient specialist referral may be warranted for patients admitted with harmful drinking or alcohol‐dependence who are experiencing acute withdrawal or at high risk of this (Box 1). This includes urgent/emergency cases and patients admitted for planned detoxification. Close liaison aids early awareness of any potential issues but also facilitates assessment of community withdrawal success and guides the decision for further support.

Box 1
Clinical features of acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Adapted from

Alcohol withdrawal syndrome
Acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome describes a spectrum of clinical sequelae typically occurring after abrupt cessation of alcohol consumption in patients with chronic, harmful intake.
It has been attributed to impaired neurotransmitter regulation in the central nervous system, whereby chronically elevated cerebral ethanol concentrations decrease sensitivity to inhibitory gamma‐amino butyric acid (GABA) and interfere with glutamate receptor binding, causing compensatory upregulation of excitatory N‐methyl‐D‐Aspartate (NMDA) receptors. The sudden absence of ethanol in this context results in a pro‐excitatory imbalance that causes many of the observed symptoms and signs during withdrawal states.
Minor symptoms typically occur within 6 h and include insomnia; tremor; anxiety; gastrointestinal upset; headache; diaphoresis; and palpitations. More severe features, described below, may occur in some patients.

Withdrawal seizures and delirium tremens
Generalised tonic–clonic seizures may occur, most commonly in patients aged 40–50 years with prolonged harmful intake. Seizure activity is most common 12–48 h following cessation of alcohol intake.
If untreated, one third of alcoholic seizures may progress to delirium tremens, characterised by hypertension; tachycardia; confusion; hallucinations; agitation; and diaphoresis. It is distinct from isolated alcoholic hallucinations, which are not usually accompanied by confusion or deranged vital signs.
With appropriate recognition and management, the mortality from delirium tremens is now < 5%.

Metabolic abnormalities
Patients may be hypovolaemic and demonstrate a metabolic acidosis, frequently accompanied by electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalaemia; hypophosphataemia; and hypomagnesaemia.
Deranged metabolic findings in this group are often multifactorial and interrelated, and themselves may result in organ dysfunction and an increased risk of cardiac failure, arrhythmias, reduced seizure threshold and mortality.

Taking care of patients with agitated toxidromes can be challenging. While many will be able to be discharged from the emergency department or transferred to psychiatry following brief and simple interventions others will have life-threatening toxicity. Health care providers must develop an organized approach to the assessment and management of these patients that includes foremost the protection of the patient and staff from physical harm, prompt pharmacologic control to allow rapid assessment for life-threatening abnormalities such as hypoglycemia and hyperthermia and optimal cooling of patients with extreme temperature elevations.

### Pharmacologic management of the agitated child [^114zxuv9]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2014). Low credibility.

Agitation is a chief complaint that causes many children and adolescents to present to emergency medical attention. There are many reasons for acute agitation, including toxicologic, neurologic, infectious, metabolic, and functional disorders. At times it may be necessary to pharmacologically treat the agitation to prevent harm to the patient, caregivers, or hospital staff. However, one should always be mindful that the differential diagnosis is broad, and a complete although timely assessment with targeted testing must be done before concluding that the agitation is rooted solely in nonorganic causes. There are various pharmacologic choices for the treatment of agitation, and they will be reviewed here. While treatment of agitation may be necessary to keep the patient as well as staff safe, as well as to facilitate medical evaluation in some cases, care must be taken to treat the patient with compassion, never using pharmacologic treatment for reasons of punishment or staff convenience. The focus is on the pharmacologic management of acute agitation of patients in the pediatric age group, in the context of a full evaluation for possible nonfunctional causes of agitation. Goals, risks, and benefits of medication use will be reviewed.

### Chest pain evaluation: updated guidelines from the AHA / ACC… [^1158u1Hw]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Attempt to perform 12-lead ECG in patients with chest pain within 10 minutes of arrival to a clinic or emergency setting.
- Use a clinical decision pathway to identify patients with low-risk chest pain who can be discharged from the emergency department.
- If available, use CCTA preferentially over stress testing for patients with intermediate-risk chest pain to determine the need for invasive coronary angiography. For patients with high-risk chest pain, provide referral for invasive coronary angiography. Diagnostic Evaluation Initial evaluation should involve 12-lead electrocardiography, which is recommended within 10 minutes of arrival in clinic and emergency settings. Because up to 6% of patients with cardiac ischemia are discharged from the emergency department after a single normal ECG, repeat testing should be considered in patients with normal ECG but a higher index of suspicion.

Adding leads V7 to V9 should be considered on repeat testing to assess for posterior wall ischemia. ST elevation, hyperacute T waves, left bundle branch block, and ST depression are the most concerning findings for cardiac chest pain. Physical examination can sometimes demonstrate life-threatening causes of chest pain, including diaphoresis and tachypnea suggesting ACS, tachycardia and dyspnea suggesting pulmonary embolism, and subcutaneous emphysema suggesting esophageal rupture. Chest tenderness on palpation or pain with inspiration suggests a noncardiac etiology. Stress testing should be considered in patients with known obstructive CAD and continuing stable chest pain only if blood pressure and cholesterol management is optimized.

Invasive coronary angiography should be considered to help guide pharmacologic therapy in patients with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting and concern for myocardial ischemia and in patients with indeterminate or nondiagnostic stress test results. In patients with suspected ischemia despite no obstructive cardiac disease, positron emission tomography, cardiovascular MRI, or angiography may help tailor medical therapy to improve quality of life, although they have not been demonstrated to reduce future cardiac events. Nonischemic Chest Pain Immediate echocardiography should be used in patients with suspected nonischemic causes of chest pain such as aortic dissection, pericardial effusion, and pulmonary embolism. If echocardiography rules out life-threatening injury, computed tomography or cardiovascular MRI can be used to confirm a suspected diagnosis.
