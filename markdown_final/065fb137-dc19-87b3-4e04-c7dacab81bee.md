## Question

Role of echo with agitated saline in takotsubo cardiomyopathy diagnosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of echocardiography with agitated saline ("bubble study") in the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what agitated saline actually does and what it is used for in echocardiography. Then, I should verify whether agitated saline helps visualize left ventricular wall motion or perfusion in takotsubo syndrome. Next, I will check authoritative guidelines and consensus statements to see if they recommend agitated saline for takotsubo diagnosis. After that, I should distinguish agitated saline from true ultrasound-enhancing agents that opacify the left ventricle. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded conclusion and clarify when, if ever, a bubble study might still be reasonable in a takotsubo workup.

> Let me first confirm the fundamentals: agitated saline creates macroscopic bubbles that are trapped in the pulmonary capillaries and therefore opacify only the right-sided chambers. They do not normally traverse the lungs, so they cannot be used to enhance left ventricular endocardial definition or myocardial perfusion, which is a key limitation I need to keep in mind [^6e46e4fd] [^f22e7b85].

> Wait, let me verify the intended uses of agitated saline so I don't jump to conclusions: bubble studies are for detecting right-to-left shunts (PFO/ASD) and intrapulmonary shunting, and they can help localize pericardial catheters. They are not designed to assess LV wall motion or myocardial perfusion, which are the diagnostic targets in takotsubo syndrome [^bb3b4f3f] [^6e46e4fd] [^334fd3fd].

> I will now examine whether any guideline or review links agitated saline to takotsubo diagnosis. Hold on, I should double-check the consensus documents and expert statements: the InterTAK and ESC/HFA consensus algorithms emphasize echocardiography to document characteristic wall motion abnormalities and complications, but they do not list agitated saline as a diagnostic tool for takotsubo. Instead, they note that ultrasound-enhancing agents (true LV contrast) can improve endocardial definition when images are suboptimal, which is a different entity altogether [^a639fd22] [^c0f6ba14].

> Let me consider the pathophysiologic rationale. Takotsubo syndrome presents with transient regional wall motion abnormalities that often extend beyond a single coronary territory; diagnosing it hinges on visualizing these patterns and excluding ischemia, not on detecting shunts. Agitated saline adds nothing to that core task, whereas clear endocardial visualization — sometimes aided by LV opacification agents — helps confirm the circumferential or apical ballooning pattern and detect complications like LV thrombus, which is where contrast can be valuable [^bc728348] [^c0f6ba14].

> But wait, what if someone argues that "contrast echocardiography" helps in takotsubo, so shouldn't agitated saline qualify? I need to ensure I distinguish terminology: when the literature supports "contrast" in takotsubo, it refers to ultrasound-enhancing agents that cross the pulmonary circulation and opacify the LV cavity (e.g. Definity, Optison), enabling better endocardial border definition and detection of apical thrombus; that is not the same as agitated saline, which remains intrapulmonary and right-sided only [^6e46e4fd] [^c0f6ba14].

> Next, I should review practical scenarios where a bubble study might still be reasonable despite a takotsubo presentation. Hold on, I should verify: if there is concomitant concern for paradoxical embolism (e.g., cryptogenic stroke, suspected PFO-related pathology), then an agitated saline study is appropriate to evaluate for right-to-left shunting, but this addresses a separate clinical question and does not contribute to confirming takotsubo cardiomyopathy itself [^b090c57d] [^c70e73a9].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not missing anything: agitated saline contrast echocardiography has no established role in diagnosing takotsubo cardiomyopathy because it cannot visualize LV wall motion or perfusion. Its legitimate uses are shunt detection and procedural guidance, not myocardial or endocardial assessment. In contrast, when image quality is poor, true LV ultrasound-enhancing agents can improve endocardial definition and help identify takotsubo patterns and complications, which is a different, guideline-supported application [^f22e7b85] [^c0f6ba14] [^6e46e4fd].

> Final answer: Agitated saline ("bubble study") is not used to diagnose takotsubo cardiomyopathy; it does not opacify the left ventricle and cannot delineate the characteristic wall motion abnormalities. Use standard transthoracic echocardiography, and consider true LV contrast agents only when image quality is suboptimal or when you need to detect LV thrombus or precisely quantify function, while reserving agitated saline for suspected intracardiac or intrapulmonary shunts unrelated to takotsubo diagnosis [^f22e7b85] [^c0f6ba14] [^6e46e4fd].

Echo with agitated saline is **not used to diagnose takotsubo cardiomyopathy** because it does not opacify the left ventricle or assess myocardial perfusion [^6e46e4fd]. Agitated saline is for **right-sided shunt detection** (PFO/ASD) and is not indicated for LV wall motion assessment [^bb3b4f3f]. In takotsubo, echocardiography is used to identify apical or mid-ventricular ballooning with preserved basal function, and if contrast is needed for poor windows, use **LV opacification agents** (e.g. Definity) [^c0f6ba14] [^856ba5af]. Agitated saline has no role in confirming takotsubo cardiomyopathy [^c70e73a9].

---

## Pathophysiology and diagnostic features of takotsubo cardiomyopathy

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is characterized by **transient LV dysfunction** — typically apical or mid-ventricular ballooning with preserved basal function — and is often triggered by emotional or physical stress [^bc728348]. Diagnosis relies on clinical presentation, ECG changes, biomarker elevation, and imaging that excludes obstructive coronary artery disease [^5de9dfb0].

---

## Role of echocardiography in takotsubo cardiomyopathy

Echocardiography is **first-line** to identify the characteristic wall motion abnormalities and complications (e.g. LVOT obstruction, mitral regurgitation, thrombus) [^c0f6ba14]. Typical findings include:

- **Apical ballooning**: akinesis or dyskinesis of the apical and mid-ventricular segments with preserved basal function [^bc728348].
- **Mid-ventricular ballooning**: hypokinesis of mid-ventricular segments with preserved basal and apical function [^notfound].
- **Basal ballooning**: rare, with hypokinesis of basal segments and preserved apical function [^notfound].

---

## Agitated saline contrast echocardiography: principles and applications

Agitated saline produces macroscopic bubbles that opacify the right heart but are filtered by the lungs and **do not enter the left heart** unless there is a right-to-left shunt [^6e46e4fd]. It is used to detect intracardiac shunts (PFO, ASD) and intrapulmonary shunting, not to assess LV function or perfusion [^c70e73a9].

---

## Limitations of agitated saline in takotsubo cardiomyopathy

Agitated saline is **unsuitable** for takotsubo diagnosis because:

- **No LV opacification**: it cannot delineate LV endocardium or wall motion [^6e46e4fd].
- **No perfusion assessment**: it cannot evaluate myocardial perfusion or viability [^notfound].
- **No wall motion analysis**: it cannot identify regional wall motion abnormalities [^notfound].

---

## Alternative contrast agents for echocardiography in takotsubo cardiomyopathy

When image quality is poor, **LV opacification agents** (e.g. Definity) are used to improve endocardial definition and enable accurate assessment of LV function and wall motion [^c0f6ba14] [^856ba5af]. These agents are indicated for suboptimal acoustic windows or when precise quantification is needed [^5c8424ef].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines and expert consensus **do not recommend agitated saline** for takotsubo diagnosis [^notfound]. Agitated saline is reserved for shunt detection, whereas LV opacification agents are recommended when echo windows are poor or when accurate LV assessment is required [^bb3b4f3f] [^5c8424ef].

---

## Clinical scenarios where agitated saline may be considered

Although not for takotsubo diagnosis, agitated saline may be used if a **concomitant shunt** is suspected (e.g. cryptogenic stroke, platypnea-orthodeoxia) [^b090c57d]. It is not indicated for evaluating LV function or wall motion in takotsubo [^notfound].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Contrast agent** | **Indication in takotsubo cardiomyopathy** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Agitated saline | Not indicated | - No LV opacification <br/> - No perfusion assessment <br/> - No wall motion analysis |
| LV opacification agents (e.g. Definity) | Indicated for poor acoustic windows | - Requires IV access <br/> - Potential allergic reactions <br/> - Cost considerations |

---

Agitated saline is **not used** for takotsubo diagnosis because it cannot assess LV wall motion or perfusion; use standard echocardiography, and consider LV opacification agents only when image quality is poor [^c0f6ba14].

The ECG in the Figure shows sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of 50 beats per minute. There was a distinctive end-QRS notch followed by J point elevation in all leads except V1 and V2, eponymously known as Osborn waves. 1 The amplitude was highest in the lateral precordial leads. The QTc interval was prolonged at 474 milliseconds. The immediate concern was hypothermia. Clinical Course The patient's core body temperature was normal at 98. 8 °F; thus, other causes of Osborn waves were considered. Nonhypothermic causes of Osborn waves include hypercalcemia, hypothyroidism, diabetic ketoacidosis, acute myocardial ischemia, myocarditis, and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. 2 The prolonged QTc interval made hypercalcemia unlikely. Nevertheless, an evaluation of serum electrolytes revealed normal levels of serum calcium, magnesium, and potassium. Thyroid function test results and blood glucose levels were normal. A bedside transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal ventricular systolic function.

Troponin levels were slightly elevated at 0. 13 ng/mL but did not display any rising titers. Thus, severe myocarditis or stress-induced cardiomyopathy, both of which have been known to be associated with nonhypothermic Osborn waves, were excluded. The patient died of COVID-19 pneumonia 5 days later. Discussion. They may also be seen in several nonhypothermic conditions, including severe hypercalcemia, central nervous system injury, acute myocardial ischemia, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, severe myocarditis, early repolarization syndromes, cocaine use, haloperidol overdose, and resuscitation from cardiac arrest. 2 Osborn waves are often seen in patients with critical illness and is regarded as a predictor of ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. Osborn waves have been reported in hospitalized patients with COVID-19–associated pneumonia in the absence of hypothermia.

5 The mechanisms proposed in these reports include myocardial and/or conduction system damage. Owing to disturbed electrolyte current in the cardiomyocytes on a background of oxidative stress, it has been proposed as a predictor of future fatal cardiac arrhythmias. 6 Presence of Osborn wave was shown to be predictive of short-term mortality in patients with COVID-19–associated pneumonia in a small retrospective study. 5.

Takotsubo syndrome is an acute reversible heart failure syndrome that is increasingly recognized in modern cardiology practice. This Position Statement from the European Society of Cardiology Heart Failure Association provides a comprehensive review of the various clinical and pathophysiological facets of Takotsubo syndrome, including nomenclature, definition, and diagnosis, primary and secondary clinical subtypes, anatomical variants, triggers, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, complications, prognosis, clinical investigations, and treatment approaches. Novel structured approaches to diagnosis, risk stratification, and management are presented, with new algorithms to aid decision-making by practising clinicians. These also cover more complex areas (e.g. uncertain diagnosis and delayed presentation) and the management of complex cases with ongoing symptoms after recovery, recurrent episodes, or spontaneous presentation.

Right ventricular involvement is characterized by RV dilatation with hypo- to akinesia of the free wall and apex in its isolated form.

In TTS, LV wall motion abnormalities extend beyond the distribution of a single coronary artery territory, therefore systolic dysfunction appears 'circular' at speckle-tracking echocardiography. A WMSI ≥ 1.75 with more than four dysfunctional segments identifies TTS with 83% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Doppler estimation of coronary artery flow ameliorates the diagnostic accuracy of wall motion abnormalities, whereas adenosine may lead to dramatic improvements of global and regional LV function.

Intravenous ultrasound contrast agents facilitate wall motion assessment especially at the apexand constitute a useful method especially in patients in whom CAG is not performed, mainly due to active bleeding or other comorbid conditions that may imbalance the risk-benefit ratio of CAG (see Cardiac computed tomography angiography section). Myocardial opacification is reduced within dysfunctional segments with the transmural perfusion defects being more evident early after TTS onset. Coronary flow reserve, assessed by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography, is reduced to 1.6–2.6 at the levels of the right and left coronary arteries, and correlates with indices of LV systolic but not diastolic function. In contrast to ischaemic cardiomyopathy, myocardial contraction does not improve with low-dose dobutamine at the early stages. However, it has also been demonstrated that low dose dobutamine stress echocardiography improved systolic left ventricular function by normalizing or improving the hypokinetic segments. Moreover, in STEMI, viable myocardial segments exhibit longitudinal shortening, while in TTS systolic lengthening (passive motion) is present initially and resolves at follow-up.

Investigations

The investigation of takotsubo syndrome may occur either because it is the primary suspected diagnosis or, more commonly, following initial investigation for acute coronary syndrome due to the marked overlap in clinical presentation. A multimodal imaging approach is often needed to discriminate between the differential diagnoses of the acute cardiac presentation (Table 1), with cardiac magnetic resonance playing an increasingly important role.

Conclusions

Takotsubo syndrome is increasing in incidence and becoming more widely recognized in the medical community. The diagnosis can be challenging, and clinicians must look for signs distinguishing takotsubo syndrome from other causes of acute myocardial injury. The use of multi-modality imaging may help in this regard and improve our understanding of its underlying etiology and pathophysiology. Currently takotsubo syndrome remains a poorly understood condition with substantial morbidity and mortality without proven or effective treatments that urgently needs to be addressed.

### International expert consensus document on Takotsubo syndrome (part I): clinical characteristics, diagnostic criteria, and pathophysiology [^4fc60b8d]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract

Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is a poorly recognized heart disease that was initially regarded as a benign condition. Recently, it has been shown that TTS may be associated with severe clinical complications including death and that its prevalence is probably underestimated. Since current guidelines on TTS are lacking, it appears timely and important to provide an expert consensus statement on TTS. The clinical expert consensus document part I summarizes the current state of knowledge on clinical presentation and characteristics of TTS and agrees on controversies surrounding TTS such as nomenclature, different TTS types, role of coronary artery disease, and etiology. This consensus also proposes new diagnostic criteria based on current knowledge to improve diagnostic accuracy.

### Standard and advanced echocardiography in Takotsubo (stress) cardiomyopathy: clinical and prognostic implications [^691f3d7e]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Low credibility.

Echocardiography is frequently the initial noninvasive imaging modality used to assess patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC). Standard transthoracic echocardiography can provide, even in the acute care setting, useful information about left ventricular (LV) morphology as well as regional and global systolic or diastolic function. It allows the differentiation of different LV morphologic patterns according to the localization of wall motion abnormalities. A "circumferential pattern" of LV myocardial dysfunction characterized by symmetric wall motion abnormalities involving the midventricular segments of the anterior, inferior, and lateral walls should be considered suggestive of TTC and included in the differential diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes. Moreover, advanced echocardiographic techniques, including speckle-tracking, myocardial contrast, and coronary flow studies, are providing mechanistic and pathophysiologic insights into this unique syndrome. Early identification of any potential complications (i.e. LV outflow tract obstruction, reversible moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, right ventricular involvement, thrombus formation, and cardiac rupture) are crucial for the management, risk stratification, and follow-up of patients with TTC. Because of the dynamic evolution of the syndrome, comprehensive serial echocardiographic examinations should be systematically performed. This review focuses on these aspects of imaging and the increasing understanding of the clinical and prognostic utility of echocardiography in TTC.

### Dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy resulting in cardiogenic shock [^34051953]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Learning points

Presentation with cardiogenic shock is a severe complication of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy that is often caused by dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. It should be diagnosed quickly due to consequences of treatment. Bedside echocardiography plays an essential role.
In case of cardiogenic shock and presence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, treatment of cardiogenic shock with inotropes and most vasopressors, such as norepinephrine or epinephrine, are counterproductive. Treatment consists of beta-blockers and volume therapy, even though it may seem counterintuitive.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy can be accompanied by ischaemic origin of cardiomyopathy due to obstructive coronary artery disease.

### Agitated saline contrast echocardiography in the identification of intra-and extracardiac shunts: connecting the dots [^c70e73a9]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). Medium credibility.

Agitated saline contrast studies are an essential component of contemporary echocardiography. Agitated saline contrast plays a critical role in the elucidation of intracardiac versus intrapulmonary shunting and can have major therapeutic implications, particularly in light of the evolution of percutaneous treatment options for atrial septal defects or a patent foramen ovale. Despite their perceived simplicity, however, there are numerous pitfalls of these investigations that can occur during their performance and interpretation. As such, the authors review the "bubble study" in identifying intracardiac and extracardiac shunts, including the history of its development, the physics and physiology of contrast enhancement, how to optimally perform and interpret an agitated saline contrast study, and its safety in unique populations.

### Review of multi-modality imaging update and diagnostic work up of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy [^64435ef5]. Clinical Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC) is an acute but reversible non-ischemic heart failure syndrome. It is characterized by a transient form of ventricular dysfunction typically manifesting as basal hyperkinesis with hypokinesia and ballooning of left ventricle mid-cavity and apex. Imaging helps in both diagnosis and follow up. Echocardiogram is the first-line modality to assess the typical contractile dysfunction in suspected patients with catheter angiography showing normal coronary arteries. Cardiac MRI is currently the modality of choice for the non-invasive initial assessment of TC and for follow up imaging. The current review focusses on historical background of TC, its pathophysiology, diagnostic work up and differential diagnosis and provides multimodality imaging work up of TC including role of echocardiogram, invasive catheterization, nuclear imaging, cardiac computed tomography and cardiac MRI including basic and advanced MRI sequences.

### A simple procedure in a complex patient: perioperative Takotsubo cardiomyopathy [^aa488f4a]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Outcome and follow-up

The patient was given an infusion of levosimenden in the ICU after consultation with the cardiology team, at 300 µg/hour, to optimise cardiac function and coronary blood flow. The catecholamines were weaned off over the next 12 hours. She remained stable overnight and was extubated the following day. She continued to make a full recovery and was discharged from the hospital 5 days later with a plan for outpatient cardiology review in 3 months time, with an echocardiogram to assess LV function prior to review. Repeat echocardiography at 3 months showed normal LV size and function, with an LVEF of 71% (video 2), helping to further affirm a diagnosis of TTC over ACS. Given the improvement in LV function and initial NT-proBNP changes, the cardiologist's recommendation was that a formal angiography was not required at that stage to definitively exclude coronary pathology, and the patient would continue to receive ongoing cardiology follow-up and review as required.

### Dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy resulting in cardiogenic shock [^24953fb7]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

An obstruction of the LV outflow tract is most common in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but also frequently seen in TC. The underlying pathophysiological mechanism is hypercontractility of the LV basal segments that leads to a Venturi-effect by systolic narrowing of the LV outflow tract with occurrence of SAM with secondary MR. Due to manifestation of LVOTO that hinders ejection, this condition is the most serious and challenging complication to manage.

With the use of TTE, this condition can be quickly diagnosed. The detection of LVOTO is important because the treatment of shock depends on the presence of LVOTO. Standard treatment of shock could even be fatal: inotropic agents may increase the LV pressure gradient due to stimulating contractility, therefore worsening of the SAM and MR, resulting in exacerbation of obstruction. Vasopressors, such as norepinephrine or epinephrine are also counterproductive in TC, as they are thought to further activate the catecholamine-related pathways. Vasopressin, on the other hand, increases peripheral vascular resistance using different pathways, and could be considered in this scenario. Other pharmacological agents that are indicated in acute heart failure/pulmonary oedema, such as vasodilators (eg, nitroglycerine, diuretics), are counterproductive as well, due to reduction of preload and afterload. Instead, LVOTO should be managed similarly to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Beta-blockers and volume therapy are indicated in order to lessen basal hypercontractility and to prolong diastole with greater end-diastolic volume. This results in widening of LVOT and therefore decreasing obstruction, elevating arterial pressure and downgrading MR, as seen in our case and of others. There are no randomised trials that back-up these measures, with only a few supporting case reports and case-controlled studies. Santoro and colleagues showed that esmolol infusion in nine patients with TC and LVOTO resulted in a reduction of LVOT pressure gradient (before treatment: 48 ± 17 mm Hg, after: 18 ± 2 mm Hg; p < 0.01). Even though there were signs of left-sided decompensation in the form of pulmonary congestion, we carefully administered saline intravenously, which resulted in some beneficial effect on blood pressure. The ultimate bail-out measure to stabilise the cardiac condition in LVOTO would have been LV mechanical support, such as Impella. This was fortunately not necessary in our case, due to rapid stabilisation of the cardiac condition after fluid resuscitation and intravenous metoprolol.

### Takotsubo cardiomyopathy: a unique cardiomyopathy with variable ventricular morphology [^7a41c577]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2010). Low credibility.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an important differential diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome. It is characterized by normal (or near-normal) coronary arteries, regional wall motion abnormalities that extend beyond a single coronary vascular bed, and often, a precipitating stressor. Variants of the classical left ventricular apical ballooning, including mid- or basal left ventricular wall motion abnormalities, are increasingly recognized. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is not rare, and heightened awareness of this unique cardiomyopathy likely will lead to a higher reported incidence. Diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy has important implications for clinical management at presentation and afterward. The long-term prognosis is generally favorable; however, a small subset has potentially life-threatening complications during the initial presentation. The pathophysiologic mechanism is unknown, but catecholamine excess likely has a central role.

### Guidelines for performing a comprehensive pediatric transthoracic echocardiogram: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^2fa207ea]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2024). High credibility.

Agitated saline contrast and UEA protocol — pediatric transthoracic echocardiography includes indications, venous access, views, preparation, and interpretation. Appropriate indication includes "Possible intracardiac shunt", "Possible intrapulmonary shunt", and "Possible unroofed coronary sinus". Venous access options are "Right antecubital vein if right SVC", "Left antecubital vein if left SVC draining to the coronary sinus", or "Bilateral antecubital veins to evaluate bilateral SVCs ± connecting vein". Views include "Apical four-chamber view" and "Subcostal coronal view", with "Harmonic imaging to improve visualization of contrast". Preparation specifies "Two 10-mL syringes… normal saline + 0.5–1 mL air ± 1 mL blood… ", followed by "Rapid injection of mixture while acquiring a long image clip (up to 10 sec)" to achieve "Full contrast opacification of the right atrium and right ventricle". For intracardiac (interatrial) shunt, it is "Likely present if contrast appears in LA within three to six cardiac cycles after RA opacification", and "Valsalva maneuver or gentle pressure on abdomen… helpful if initial test negative". For intrapulmonary shunt, it is "Likely present if contrast appears in LA later than six cardiac cycles after RA opacification". For unroofed coronary sinus, perform "Agitated saline contrast injection into a left superior systemic vein", and positivity is "Present if contrast appears in coronary sinus then simultaneously in RA and LA". For UEA study, the approved pediatric indication (Lumason) is "LV cavity opacification", with off‑label indications including "Intracardiac mass", "Apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy", "LV noncompaction", and "Differences in myocardial perfusion at rest or with stress".

Future directions

Over recent years research has shown that TTS is a much more heterogeneous condition than previously thought. Originally believed to be a benign disease, studies have shown that TTS has morbidity and mortality rates that are comparable to those of ACS. TTS can affect many others aside from postmenopausal women with an emotional trigger, as originally described, and can present as an atypical type rather than apical ballooning. Still, there is much more to be uncovered surrounding TTS and the underlying pathophysiology of the syndrome.

Key questions

Many questions need further investigation: Why are women affected predominantly? What is the role of triggering factors in stress responses of the heart? Why do different TTS phenotypes exist? Which patients are vulnerable to TTS or prone to recurrence? Is there a genetic predisposition to TTS? What is the exact pathogenesis of TTS? Are there specific treatment options in the acute stage of this life-threatening syndrome or to prevent recurrence? Additional research needs to be conducted to answer these important questions.

Prospective approaches

The link between the brain and heart seems to play a key role in TTS. Additionally, studies on circulating miRNAs suggest there could be a genetic aspect to the pathophysiology of TTS, and the predominance of female patients suggests that TTS could be related to sex hormones and the endocrine system. Takotsubo syndrome is more than a cardiac disease, and it requires a new and interdisciplinary approach to increase awareness among not only cardiologists, but physicians at large. To establish evidence based strategies for effective TTS treatment, randomized prospective trials will be necessary utilizing a large number of patients from multicentre international consortia.

### An unusual manifestation of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy [^66fa1e49]. Clinical Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy typically presents with chest pain, ST changes, and transient left ventricular apical ballooning in the absence of epicardial coronary artery disease. This process is reversible and usually benign. An unusual manifestation is that of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction with systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. Recognition of this finding is critical in patient management especially in the setting of cardiogenic shock, as inotropes are likely to aggravate and worsen the clinical condition. We provide a systematic review and an illustrative case and discuss treatment strategies.

### Stimulant-related Takotsubo cardiomyopathy [^82a64c45]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC) is a rare but increasingly recognized mimic of acute coronary syndrome. Patients present with angina, ST-segment changes on electrocardiogram (both elevations and depressions), and rapid rises in cardiac biomarkers. Many kinds of stressful events have been associated with TC, but only a handful of drug-related cases have previously been reported. We describe the case of a 58-year-old woman who developed TC 2 days after crack cocaine use, a diagnosis first suggested as bedside echocardiography in the emergency department. Recognition of the classic echocardiographic appearance of TC — apical hypokinesis causing "ballooning" of the left ventricle during systole — may greatly assist providers in the early identification of this condition.

### International expert consensus document on Takotsubo syndrome (part I): clinical characteristics, diagnostic criteria, and pathophysiology [^607e7a2b]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Diagnostic criteria

The diagnosis of TTS is often challenging because its clinical phenotype may closely resemble AMI regarding ECG abnormalities and biomarkers. While a widely established non-invasive tool allowing a rapid and reliable diagnosis of TTS is currently lacking, coronary angiography with left ventriculography is considered the gold standard diagnostic tool to exclude or confirm TTS.

Abe et al. introduced the first diagnostic criteria for TTS in 2003. One year later, a dedicated group of cardiologists from the Mayo Clinic proposed their diagnostic criteria. In 2006, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association classified TTS as a primary acquired cardiomyopathy. In 2008, the revised version of the Mayo Clinic Diagnostic Criteria was published incorporating neurogenic stunned myocardium. Furthermore, the authors defined different TTS sub-types and highlighted that obstructive coronary lesions may occasionally be present concomitantly. The Mayo Clinic Diagnostic Criteria are the most widely known, but exceptions to the rule [e.g. the presence of CAD] are poorly appreciated among physicians and cardiologists. More recently, other research groups have proposed slightly different criteria for TTS, i.e. the Japanese Guidelines, the Gothenburg criteria, the Johns Hopkins criteria, the Tako-tsubo Italian Network proposal, the criteria of the Heart Failure Association (HFA) TTS Taskforce of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), as well as the criteria recommended by Madias. Thus, there is a lack of a worldwide consensus. Based on current knowledge, we have developed new international diagnostic criteria (InterTAK Diagnostic Criteria, Table 1) for the diagnosis of TTS that may help to improve identification and stratification of TTS. The most important changes with accompanying rationale include:

Agitated saline contrast (bubble study) for shunt detection — Agitated saline contrast is used to detect intracardiac and intrapulmonary right-to-left shunting, with the intravenous line for injection usually placed in the upper extremity on the same side as the superior vena cava (SVC). Optimization methods include filling a 10-mL syringe with saline plus approximately 1 mL blood and 0.5 to 1 mL air, connecting via a three-way stopcock to a second 10-mL syringe, and agitating back and forth before injection. Appearance of contrast in the left atrium and left ventricle within three to six cardiac cycles after right atrial (RA) opacification suggests interatrial shunting, whereas intrapulmonary shunting is highly suspected if contrast is seen in the left atrium later than six cardiac cycles after RA opacification.

### The role of early focused cardiac ultrasound in a not-so-typical presentation of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy: a case report [^92b1e2ec]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Focused cardiac ultrasound (FoCUS) can be extremely helpful in identifying unexpected diagnoses that can significantly alter treatment options. The diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) may be difficult to identify.

Case Report

We describe a 47-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department (ED) with atypical features of TCM. Her clinical features included being a premenopausal woman with mild chest pain with a lack of identifiable emotional or physical stressors or significant electrocardiographic changes. Initial findings on FoCUS were consistent with TCM, with these findings replicated on repeat bedside echo performed in the ED by the cardiology fellow. A subsequent comprehensive echo showed marked improvement of the TCM pattern within 24 hours. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? TCM may present in younger women or men, without obvious preceding physical or emotional stressors and with nonspecific ECG findings. FoCUS performed in the ED may suggest a diagnosis of TCM in patients with chest pain or dyspnea of uncertain etiology. The performance of FoCUS, as highlighted by this case report, can lead to timely intervention and follow-up of a variety of cardiac conditions.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) is a rare but life-threatening condition that is still not completely understood. Characterised by rapidly reversible ventricular dysfunction without any prior coronary artery disease, it can imitate a myocardial infarction and lead to death if not managed appropriately.

Echocardiography

Echocardiography can be used to help support the diagnosis (extent, severity and location of the wall motion abnormalities) and to identify potential complications of takotsubo syndrome. Approximately 20% of patients have evidence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Usually occurring in those with the typical apical to mid cavity ballooning with basal hyperkinesia and can be associated with mitral regurgitation secondary to systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve apparatus. Ultrasound contrast agents can be useful to delineate wall motion abnormalities and assess for left ventricular thrombus formation, which can occur acutely or later in the disease course. More advanced techniques, such as speckle-tracking echocardiography, can also show abnormalities of left ventricular twist and lower mean values of systolic peak velocity, strain and strain rate. Whilst left ventricular twist and deformation indices typically improve during the recovery phase, persistently abnormal cardiac deformation indices suggest a phenotype of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

Cardiac magnetic resonance

Cardiac magnetic resonance with gadolinium contrast administration distinguishes takotsubo syndrome from acute myocardial infarction and myocarditis. Unlike these latter conditions, fibrosis depicted by late gadolinium enhancement is usually not a feature of takotsubo syndrome. Rarely, a characteristic pattern of takotsubo syndrome appears as a thin transmural band of fibrosis at the hinge points between the hyperkinetic base and dyskinetic apex or mid-cavity. This can be seen both acutely (at the time of presentation) and 4–5 months later at follow up (Figure 2). This possibly results from the opposing strong shear forces applied to the left ventricular wall. Cardiac magnetic resonance also provides a reliable assessment of right ventricular involvement, identification of left and right ventricular thrombi, and often shows the presence of a small pericardial effusion (as well as pleural effusions), particularly if the test is performed early after presentation.

Intense myocardial edema is an important feature of takotsubo syndrome (Figure 2). Edema is not only confined to regions of abnormal contractility but is present to a lesser extent within the entirety of the ventricular myocardium. Myocardial edema resolves gradually over weeks or months following the index event, typically taking much longer to recover than myocardial contractility. Reflecting this, left ventricular mass is markedly elevated and native T1 and T2 mapping values are increased during the acute phase, gradually resolving over 5–6 months during convalescence (Figure 2). Both myocardial edema and acute inflammation are detectable at presentation, but it remains unclear whether they are a consequence of takotsubo syndrome or if they represent a primary, causal inflammatory stimulus.

Focused cardiac ultrasound — pericardial effusion evaluation notes that studies have shown a high degree of sensitivity and specificity in the detection of pericardial effusions in both medical and trauma patients using FOCUS, and imaging in multiple views or windows provides the most accurate detection of pericardial effusion; pericardial tamponade is a clinical diagnosis that includes the visualization of pericardial fluid, blood, or thrombus, in addition to clinical signs including hypotension, tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus, and distended neck veins; when small or focal effusions are difficult to recognize with FOCUS, a comprehensive echocardiogram or other diagnostic imaging testing is indicated whenever the clinical suspicion for the presence of effusion is high and the FOCUS could not demonstrate it; when emergency pericardiocentesis is indicated, ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis in the critically ill patients has been shown to have fewer complications and a higher success rate than if done without ultrasound guidance, and injection of agitated saline may be helpful in localizing needle placement during this procedure.

Types of takotsubo syndrome

Although several anatomical TTS variants have been described four major types can be differentiated based on the distribution of regional wall motion abnormalities as shown in Figure 4. The most common TTS type and widely recognized form is the (i) apical ballooning type also known as the typical TTS form, which occurs in the majority of cases. Over the past years, atypical TTS types have been increasingly recognized. These include the (ii) midventricular, (iii) basal, and (iv) focal wall motion patterns. Recently, it has been demonstrated that patients suffering from atypical TTS have a different clinical phenotype. These patients are younger, suffer more often from neurologic comorbidities, have lower brain natriuretic peptide values, a less impaired LVEF, and more frequent ST-segment depression compared to typical TTS. In-hospital complication rate is similar between typical and atypical types, while 1-year mortality is higher in typical TTS. After adjustment for confounders, LVEF < 45%, atrial fibrillation, neurologic disorders but not TTS phenotype were independent predictors of death. Beyond 1-year, long-term mortality is similar in typical and atypical TTS phenotypes, therefore, patients should be equally monitored and treated. The basal phenotype has been reported to be associated with the presence of pheochromocytoma, epinephrine-induced TTS, or subarachnoid haemorrhageconsequently, these conditions should be considered in this particular setting.

The blue dashed lines demonstrate the region of the wall motion abnormality. Reprinted and modified with permission from Templin et al.

Besides the four major TTS types, other morphological variants have been described including the biventricular (apical type and right ventricular involvement), isolated right ventricular, and global form. Global hypokinesia as a manifestation of TTS is difficult to prove given the very broad differential diagnoses including conditions such as tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Right ventricular involvement is present in about one-third of TTS patients and may be a predictor for worse outcome. The true prevalence of the isolated right ventricular form is unknown since little attention is paid to the right ventricle in daily clinical echo routine.

Patients with recurrent TTS can demonstrate different wall motion patterns at each event, suggesting that left ventricular adrenergic receptor distribution does not explain different TTS types.

Best practices for contrast administration — Oregon Health & Science University infusion and agitated saline protocols specify that Personnel — IV Start: Sonographer/registered nurse (RN)/fellow/physician; Personnel — Contrast Administration: Sonographer/RN/fellow/physician; Personnel — Agitated Saline Administration: Sonographer/RN/fellow/physician. For infusion, withdraw 27 mL (for Optison) or 28.5 mL (for Definity) of 0.9% normal saline into a 35-mL syringe, then using an Optispike add Optison (3 mL) or Definity (1.5 mL) leaving 0.5 mL airspace, insert the syringe into a syringe pump, and titrate the rate, with approximately 90 mL/h providing good left ventricle (LV)/endocardial border delineation. The contrast purpose/indication is "to optimize the assessment of LV function in patients with suboptimal acoustic windows or to provide an accurate and reproducible quantitative LV ejection fraction", with additional benefits including delineation of intracavitary masses, apical abnormalities, and enhancement of Doppler signals in the systemic circulation. For agitated saline, supplies include a 10-mL, single-dose vial bacteriostatic 0.9% sodium chloride, a three-way stopcock, and 10 mL Luer-Lok (2) syringes; preparation uses two 10-mL syringes — one with 10 mL bacteriostatic 0.9% sodium chloride and the other with 1 mL air — agitated between syringes and injected rapidly when ready.

T2-weighted images demonstrating normal signal intensity of the basal myocardium but global edema of the mid and apical myocardium. Computer-aided SI analysis of the T2-weighted images with color-coded display of relative SI normalized to skeletal muscle confirm the presence of global mid and apical edema. Left ventricular ejection fraction was reduced in all patients. Stress cardiomyopathy was accurately identified by CMR using specific criteria: a typical pattern of LV dysfunction, myocardial edema, absence of significant necrosis/fibrosis, and markers for myocardial inflammation.

Follow-up CMR imaging showed complete normalization of LV ejection fraction and inflammatory markers in the absence of significant fibrosis in all patients. Stress cardiomyopathy, first reported in Japan as takotsubo, is characterized by acute, profound, but reversible left ventricular dysfunction in the absence of significant coronary artery disease, triggered by acute emotional or physical stress. 1 This phenomenon is identified by a distinctive pattern of "apical ballooning" and primarily affects postmenopausal women. 2–5 The majority of patients have a clinical presentation similar to that of acute coronary syndrome. Accordingly, international guidelines have included SC as an important differential diagnosis of ACS.
6.

The diagnosis of SC was defined through clinical consensus based on fulfilling the following criteria: an acute cardiac event typically presenting with chest pain and/or dyspnea; transient systolic dysfunction with marked LV contraction abnormality (akinesia or dyskinesia of the LV apical and/or midventricular. Our study allowed for several important observations: first, we found a considerably broader clinical profile than previously reported. Second, myocardial edema, inflammation, and absence of fibrosis have been identified as potentially important markers for diffuse, reversible myocardial injury and provide unique insights into the pathogenesis and tissue pathology of this increasingly recognized syndrome. Third, our data indicate that CMR imaging using specific criteria may be useful as a diagnostic tool for patients with SC at the time of acute clinical presentation.

### Serial evaluation of microcirculatory dysfunction in patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy by myocardial contrast echocardiography [^6b44395a]. Clinical Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Stress cardiomyopathy manifests as reversible left ventricular apical ballooning in the absence of epicardial coronary obstruction. Transient microcirculatory dysfunction has been proposed as a potential putative mechanism. This study aimed to understand the natural history of this dysfunction using readily available noninvasive methods.

Hypothesis

Stress cardiomyopathy presents with profound microvascular dysfunction that improves quickly over a period of 3 to 4 weeks.

Methods

Nine consecutive patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy were followed serially with myocardial perfusion echocardiograms at 24 hours, within 1 week, and 3 to 6 months after index admission.

Results

The mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) steadily improved from 38% at baseline to 48% within 1 week to 67% by the end of 3 to 6 months follow-up. The number of wall segments with reduced or absent perfusion decreased from 4.1 at baseline to 2 at 1 week. By 3 to 6 months, perfusion had returned to normal in all but 1 segment in 1 patient. At 1 week, the relative improvement in mean LVEF was 26%, whereas perfusion had improved by nearly 50%, suggesting a fairly pronounced improvement in microcirculatory function prior to recovery of wall motion.

Conclusions

Patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy present with significant acute microcirculatory dysfunction that recovers quickly prior to the recovery of regional wall motion abnormalities.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy — alcohol septal ablation uses myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) to map septal perforator perfusion and is defined as successful by at least a 50% reduction in left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient; intraprocedural MCE has replaced probatory balloon inflation at most centers, and after cannulation a diluted echocardiographic contrast agent of 1 to 2 cm3 is injected followed by a 1-mL to 2-mL saline flush during continuous imaging, with agitated radiographic contrast as an alternative; operators should document the absence of perfusion of remote segments including the left ventricular anterior wall, right ventricular free wall, and papillary muscles, MCE guidance can lead to changes in the perforator selected and even cancellation with some referred for surgery, and at most centers transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) with multiple views is used and multiple views are recommended to delineate opacification of both target and nontarget regions.

Importantly, echocardiography allows detection of all acute TTS complications. In LV apical ballooning, basal segments are hyperkinetic and may cause dynamic LVOTO, mainly in patients with pre-existing septal bulgewhich further reduces stroke volume and is associated with mitral regurgitation (MR) due to systolic anterior motion of the mitral leaflet (Figure 3 B). Severe MR may also result from leaflet tethering by displacement or dysfunction of papillary muscles. Mitral regurgitation is estimated to be present in 14–25% of TTS patients.

Advanced echocardiographic techniques such as speckle-tracking imaging which reveals a paradoxical (dyskinetic) positive longitudinal systolic strain of biventricular mid-apical segments. Echocardiography also identifies covered rupture of the LV free wallas well as thrombus formation within a dysfunctional LV apexor within left-atrial appendage even in the absence of atrial fibrillation. Independent predictors of adverse outcomes include low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), increased LV filling pressure, and moderate-to-severe MR at 4–6 weeks.

At peak, apical and anteroseptal akinesis with basal hyper-contractility produces near-cavity obliteration.

Typically, LV contractility recovers completely in 4–8 weeks. Some segments of the LV recover earlier than others, displaying increased apical rotation, LV twisting and untwisting and recovered global longitudinal strain. Resolution of LVOTO and MRoccurs in parallel with myocardial functional recovery. During TTS recurrence, the LV ballooning pattern may resemble the initial eventor alternatively, manifest as other variants.

Complications and outcomes

Although TTS is generally considered a benign disease, contemporary observations show that rates of cardiogenic shock and death are comparable to ACS patients treated according to current guidelines. While TTS is a reversible condition, hemodynamic and electrical instability during the acute phase expose patients to the risk of serious adverse in-hospital events which occur in approximately one-fifth of TTS patients (Figure 4). This substantial incidence of life-threatening complications necessitates close monitoring and early intervention in unstable TTS patients with risk stratification at diagnosis allowing triage to appropriate care. Parameters predicting adverse in-hospital outcome include: physical trigger, acute neurologic or psychiatric diseases, initial troponin > 10× upper reference limit, and admission LVEF < 45%. Furthermore, male patients have an up to three-fold increased rate of death and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE)and more often had an underlying critical illness, further contributing to the higher mortality. Sobue et al. demonstrated that physical triggers and male gender are independent risk factors of in-hospital mortality in TTS. Data from the Tokyo Coronary Care Unit Network revealed that high values of BNP and white blood cell counts were also linked to higher rates of in-hospital complications. Complications included cardiac death, pump failure (Killip gradeΙΙ), sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF), and advanced atrioventricular block (AV-block). In the study by Takashio et al. the magnitude and extent of ST-segment elevation with ECG were found to be independent predictors of in-hospital adverse events. However, those findings were not confirmed by others. Common in-hospital complications include cardiac arrhythmias, LVOTO, cardiogenic shock, ventricular thrombus, pulmonary oedema, ventricular septal defect, and free wall rupture. In addition, to the demographic parameter of age75, echocardiographic parameters that predict adverse in-hospital outcome (acute heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and in-hospital mortality) include LVEF, E / e ' ratio, and reversible moderate to severe MR. However, only reversible moderate to severe MR was an independent predictor when considering cardiogenic shock and death as the composite outcome in this study, in addition to heart rate. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that high heart rate and low systolic blood pressure are associated with increased mortality in TTS. Along with the Charlson comorbidity index and systolic pulmonary artery pressure, RV involvement is an independent predictor of acute heart failure and of a composite endpoint including adverse events, such as acute heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and in-hospital mortality.

The first significant clinical description of contrast echocardiography is usually credited to Drs. Gramiak and Shah who in 1969 traced the cloud of echo signals produced by the left atrial injection of indocyanine green as it opacified the left atrium and subsequently the aorta by m‐mode echocardiography. Subsequently, contrast echocardiography consisted primarily of the injection of microbubbles produced by agitating saline which opacified the right ventricle but not the left since they were removed by the lungs. The recognition that a room air microbubble of the size of a red blood cell would persist intact in circulation for less than a second stimulated the development of microbubbles using heavier molecular weight and less diffusible gases surrounded by a shell comprised largely of albumen lipoproteins. These enhanced microbubbles efficiently persisted in circulation to cross the lungs and opacify the left sided cardiac chambers. They effectively and accurately delineate the endocardial border, an ability of paramount importance in patients with technically suboptimal images (Figure and video 1). There are currently a number of ultrasound enhancing agents approved for this application (Table 1) and the safety of the procedure has been well established. Left ventricular opacification with ultrasonic contrast agents has achieved an established role in clinical echocardiography and is currently applied routinely on a daily basis to define the endocardial border and assess left ventricular size and contraction. However, additional applications of ultrasonic contrast agents have been identified, and several potential applications are currently under development for standard application in clinical cardiology (Table 2).

### Trump cardiomyopathy: a new form of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy [^97adf5ef]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

An 84-year-old man developed angina while watching televised coverage of the President Trump impeachment hearings and presented to the emergency department with positive cardiac biomarkers and EKG changes indicative of ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Echocardiogram and coronary angiography were consistent with non-ischemic, 3 vessel coronary artery disease with apical hypokinesis resulting in the diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. This case is the first report of politically-induced cardiomyopathy and warrants further evaluation of political stress as an etiology of cardiac events.

### Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in pregnancy [^97e0e126]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a cardiac condition associated with the acute onset of chest pain, abnormalities in cardiac enzymes and electrocardiogram, and a distinct pattern of left ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography. This case evaluates an obstetric patient diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy during her 23rd week of pregnancy.

Case

A woman (G3P2002) at 23 weeks in an intrauterine pregnancy was admitted with chest pain. ST-segment elevation was noted on electrocardiogram with elevated cardiac enzymes. Subsequent tracings showed resolution of ST elevation with conservative management. Echocardiography was consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She delivered through spontaneous vaginal delivery at term after a complete resolution of her cardiomyopathy.

Conclusion

Although uncommon, physicians who manage cardiac complications should be familiar with the diagnosis and management of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

### Guidelines for the use of echocardiography in the evaluation of a cardiac source of embolism [^b090c57d]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2016). Medium credibility.

Echocardiographic evaluation of suspected paradoxical embolism — agitated saline technique and interpretation: To assess for the role of PFO in cryptogenic stroke, the presence of a right-to-left shunt needs to be established; if routine color Doppler imaging fails to detect a shunt, assessment can include lowering the Nyquist limit or performing an agitated saline contrast study. Injections should be performed at rest and with provocative maneuvers such as cough and the Valsalva maneuver. The presence of PFO is presumed when agitated saline is seen in the left atrium within three cardiac cycles after complete opacification of the right atrium, whereas absence after five cardiac cycles should prompt consideration of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. Persistent interatrial bowing toward the right atrium can hold a PFO closed and yield a false-negative finding. Adequate beats must be captured to evaluate for PFO, and the agitated saline contrast study may need to be repeated multiple times if necessary.

Saline contrast optimization for transthoracic and transesophageal right-to-left shunt detection — A saline contrast injection is indicated to rule out an intrapulmonary or intracardiac right-to-left shunt; the literature has clearly shown the advantage of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) over transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in detecting these shunts, though screening procedures have still used TTE; saline contrast is useful to assess for right-to-left shunting and detect residual shunts after defect closure; bolus injections of sterile saline contrast macroscopic bubbles that do not normally cross the pulmonary circuit is the method of choice to screen for a patent foramen ovale (PFO); it is recommended that the saline contrast be composed of ≥ 8 mL of bacteriostatic normal saline agitated with 0.5 mL of room air, agitated between two sterile syringes using a three-way stopcock just before IV bolus injection through a forearm or hand vein.

### Takotsubo cardiomyopathy: role of cardiac MRI [^98025c1e]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

We present a case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TC) which is a non ischemic cardiomyopathy. It is stress related and also known as broken heart syndrome. The patient presented to our emergency department with symptoms of chest pain and breathlessness. The patient was diagnosed as acute coronary syndrome and various tests including ECG, Screening ECHO, Coronary CT and Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) were done before arriving at the diagnosis of TC. Currently CMR is the modality of choice as it detects the wall motion abnormalities (WMA), presence of wall edema and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) characteristics can be well appreciated. No intervention was done and the case was managed medically.

Regional abnormalities in the absence of coronary artery disease — Regional wall motion abnormalities may occur without coronary artery disease in conditions such as myocarditis, sarcoidosis, and stress-induced (takotsubo) cardiomyopathy. Abnormal motion patterns of the interventricular septum may be found postoperatively or with a left bundle branch block or RV epicardial pacing, as well as RV dysfunction caused by RV pressure or volume overload. Furthermore, some conduction delays can cause regional wall motion abnormalities in the absence of primary myocardial dysfunction, and ideally the temporal sequence of activation and motion should be described.

### American Society of Echocardiography COVID-19 statement update: lessons learned and preparation for future pandemics [^1afd0399]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2023). High credibility.

Left ventricular dysfunction in acute COVID-19 — indications, etiologies, and diagnostic features: One of the most common indications for echocardiography in patients with COVID-19 infection is suspected left-sided heart failure or LV systolic dysfunction. The incidence of LV systolic dysfunction in patients with COVID-19 infection varies between studies and may be confounded by the fact that some patients may have had preexisting LV systolic dysfunction that placed them at increased risk for symptomatic COVID-19 infection. A reduced LV ejection fraction (LVEF) has been shown to be associated with increased inpatient mortality in patients with COVID-19. Stress (takotsubo) cardiomyopathy is a known cause of LV systolic dysfunction in patients with COVID-19 infection and may be suspected in patients who have the classic echocardiographic finding of preserved basal systolic function but hypokinesis, akinesis, or dyskinesis of the apical myocardium. Other important causes of LV systolic dysfunction in patients with acute COVID-19 infection are myocarditis and multisystem inflammatory syndrome, and multisystem inflammatory syndrome can occur in adults or children and often presents as LV systolic dysfunction in association with systemic signs and symptoms such as elevated inflammatory markers, fever, shock, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Studies reported LV diastolic dysfunction in patients with acute COVID-19 infection, but the exact incidence of diastolic dysfunction attributable solely to COVID-19 is difficult to determine.

### Characteristics and outcome of patients with COVID-19 complicated by Takotsubo cardiomyopathy: case series with literature review [^cd70d669]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 is now known to affect the myocardium. Studies from Wuhan, China, indicate that patients who develop cardiac injury manifested by elevation of high-sensitivity troponin I (TnI) levels have higher overall mortality, with rates as high as 59.6%. However, not all patients who have elevation in their cardiac biomarkers have viral myocarditis, but it can be due to the development of secondary TC. The exact role of SARS-CoV-2 in TC development has yet to be determined. Possible mechanisms could be an interaction of viral spike protein with ACE2 receptors in the heart, procoagulant state created by the virus, direct myocardial damage, endothelial injury and microvascular dysfunction. Further research is required to determine the role of viral interaction with cardiac ACE2 receptors and the development of cardiomyopathy in patients with COVID-19. Nevertheless, the diagnosis of COVID-19 and the state of being in a pandemic itself produces a huge emotional stress in patients, which predisposes them to develop TC.

We believe that the development of TC in patients with COVID-19 is multifactorial in nature and starts from being in a pandemic state, the stress associated with a COVID-19 diagnosis, hypoxia secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia and intense inflammatory state caused by the virus with a release of the cytokine storm. These characteristics along with the presence of predisposing factors, such as DM, intubation and use of vasopressors could trigger TC in patients with COVID-19.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest series of COVID-19-associated TC cases described in the literature. A literature review of the available cases suggested a higher rate of recovery of cardiac function and lower mortality rate than in our series. This is mainly attributable to the severity of cases in our cohort. However, more studies are required to understand the role of SARS-CoV-2 in the development of TC.

Limitations

The inability to completely rule out coronary artery disease was a limitation in our case series. However, three of our patients had echocardiograms documenting the recovery of cardiac function, and one had had a recent cardiac catheterisation with no evidence of epicardial coronary artery disease.

The proposed algorithms are based on our literature review of studies on secondary TC and not validated for secondary TC in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. This is meant to serve just as a guide for clinicians.

### International expert consensus document on Takotsubo syndrome (part II): diagnostic workup, outcome, and management [^ba162562]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Diagnostic workup

A diagnostic algorithm for takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is proposed by the expert committee (Figure 1). Patients presenting with ST-segment elevation should undergo urgent coronary angiography (CAG) with left ventriculography to exclude acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In patients with non ST-segment elevation the InterTAK Diagnostic Score can be considered. While an InterTAK Score ≤ 70 points suggests a low to intermediate probability of TTS, a score ≥ 70 indicates a high probability for the presence of TTS. Patients with a low probability should undergo CAG with left ventriculography, while in patients with a high score transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) should be considered. In the absence of a circumferential ballooning pattern CAG is recommended. In stable patients with circumferential ballooning pattern coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is favoured to exclude coronary artery disease (CAD). In unstable patients, typical complications of TTS such as left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) should be determined with TTE and CAG to safely rule out AMI. In patients with normal coronaries on CCTA or CAG and typical ballooning patterns without 'red flags' of acute infectious myocarditis TTS is the most likely diagnosis and can be confirmed after follow-up echocardiography. In case of positive 'red flags' of acute infectious myocarditis cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) should be performed to confirm the diagnosis.

Practical image acquisition with contrast agents — Table 5 lists practical guidelines and ways to avoid common pitfalls, including the following sequence and adjustments: Start at apical window and have the patient in a bed with a cutout; use respiratory movements; move transducer to change its position (more laterally); if shadowing cannot be eliminated, attempt to direct shadow through center of left ventricle; if apex is underfilled with contrast medium, reduce MI, inject more contrast medium, and use a higher volume and more rapid saline flush; if attenuation occurs, wait a few seconds, increase the MI, and use high-power impulse.

### American Society of Echocardiography consensus statement on the clinical applications of ultrasonic contrast agents in echocardiography [^19d2a566]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2008). Medium credibility.

Doppler echocardiography contrast enhancement — applications and technique — improves weak or suboptimal Doppler signals and supports specific measurements and acquisition steps. Contrast enhancement of the Doppler signal has been shown to be of value when the signal is weak or technically suboptimal, and peak velocity measurement in patients with aortic stenosis may be enhanced with echocardiographic contrast agents. Tricuspid regurgitant velocities used for assessing pulmonary artery systolic pressure can be enhanced by either agitated bacteriostatic saline contrast or commercially available echocardiographic contrast agents. Usually, contrast is used first for two-dimensional imaging and Doppler acquired subsequently because the threshold for detecting contrast by Doppler is far less than for two-dimensional imaging, with the most distinct spectra often obtained at the onset of injection. Care must be taken to avoid blooming that can overestimate velocities; this can be avoided by reducing the Doppler gain such that clear spectral envelopes are seen without distortion along the edge of the profile.

### Echocardiography in congenital heart disease [^ee64e151]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

As the prevalence of adult congenital heart disease continues to grow secondary to advances in surgical and diagnostic techniques, it is important for a physician to supplement their examinations with non-invasive imaging techniques to assess their patients. Although a number of these patients have regular cardiology followup, some may be new patients that do not even know their cardiac history. Echocardiography has proven to be a useful tool for this purpose and its utility has expanded drastically with the development of better technology and newer techniques. In this article, we highlight some of these advancements including 2D echocardiography, agitated saline, contrast echocardiography, stress, and 4D, in addition to how each modality can help assess key aspects of the structure and function of a congenital heart defect.

### Established and emerging roles for ultrasound enhancing agents (contrast echocardiography) [^5c8424ef]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound enhancing agents may also be of value in defining endocardial landmarks on three‐dimensional echocardiography which is less sensitive in imaging low intensity targets than conventional two‐dimensional imaging.

Despite documentation that ventricular opacification by contrast echo could accurately identify left ventricle volumes and ejection fraction and thereby influence patient management, implementation of these recordings in echo laboratories has been slow and variable. Evidence exists to indicate that, although 15%−30% of echocardiographic studies are marginal or inadequate, especially stress echo and those performed in the intensive care unit, only approximately 5% of echo studies employ ultrasound enhancing agents. A number of factors appear to contribute to this underutilization, such as the need to do an intravenous injection and the legacy mindset of interpreting echocardiograms for years without the benefit of contrast visualization. This has led to an attempt to define those patients in whom ultrasound enhancing agents should be applied in their echocardiogram Obvious candidates include patients with obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chest deformities, and any patient in whom acoustic windows are limited to yield adequate images. An important application of left ventricular opacification has been to increase the reproducibility of echo quantification of left ventricular size and contraction. It has been demonstrated that the use of ultrasound enhancing agents and markedly reduced variability in echo quantification and yield measurements of echocardiographic size and function to reproducibility is comparable to that of other techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging. Based upon these data, the guidelines for contrast utilization of the American Society of Echocardiography recommend the use of ultrasound enhancing agents in all patients undergoing rest echocardiograms for the indication of evaluation of left ventricular systolic function, not just those in whom images are technically inadequate. The criteria for determining that studies are technically inadequate include the inability to visualize the endocardial border in two or more contiguous segments of the left ventricle in unenhanced images. Obviously, since abnormal contraction of even one left ventricular segment on a stress echocardiogram establishes an abnormal study, the indication for contrast enhancement in this setting is greater.

While the ability to enhance endocardial border definition by contrast echo is well established and integrated into practice, a number of other applications other than border definitions are often encountered. The injection of microbubbles produced by agitated saline to identify right to left cardiac or intrapulmonary shunts is well established and will not be further discussed.

We then examine the probable molecular explanations for this condition and suggest a probable molecular mechanism based on animal studies. Future therapeutic options are also briefly discussed.

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging cannot be used easily in the acute setting of TTS, but is very useful in the subacute phase. In addition to identification of typical RWMAs, CMR allows precise quantification of RV and LV function, assessment of additional abnormalities/complications (i.e. pericardial and/or pleural effusion, LV and RV thrombi), and characterization of myocardial tissue (i.e. oedema, inflammation, necrosis/fibrosis) (Figure 3 C). Recently, specific CMR criteria for TTS diagnosis at the time of acute presentation were established which include the combination of typical RWMAs, oedema, and the absence of evidence of irreversible tissue injury [late gadolinium enhancement (LGE)]. While LGE is usually absent and predicts complete normalization of LV function, subtle fibrosis may be present and a sign of worse outcomes. In most TTS patients, myocardial oedema is present in regions with abnormal systolic function possibly due to inflammation, increased wall stress and/or transient ischemiaand indicative of the extent and severity of tissue injury.CMR is superior to echocardiography for detection of RV involvementincluding isolated RV TTSwhich may negatively impact outcome. Importantly, absence of LGE in dysfunctional LV regions allows distinction between TTS and other conditions including ACS (subendocardial or transmural LGE corresponding to a vascular territory) and many cases of acute myocarditis (frequent, but not universal presence of epicardial or 'patchy' LGE). Therefore, CMR provides incremental value for the differential diagnosis, and therapeutic decision-making in patients with suspected TTS.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^333cfc44]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Stress-induced cardiomyopathy (Tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy) — This entity is characterized by acute transient left ventricular (LV) dysfunction triggered by a profound emotional or physical stressor and is named for its distinctive pattern of apical ballooning similar to octopus catching pots used in Japan; it has a predilection for postmenopausal women, with a mean age of 65 years and with 96% of women being ≥ 50 years of age in 1 series, and the incidence is not known. Evidence supports an adrenergically mediated process with supraphysiological elevations of plasma catecholamines demonstrated, and although the ventricular apex has relatively sparse sympathetic innervation, it appears more responsive to sympathetic stimuli because of increased β2-adrenergic receptor density; other theories include microvascular vasospasm.

### Takotsubo cardiomyopathy complicating acute pancreatitis: a case report [^1413beb3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Further diagnostic challenge lies in the overlap of biochemical and ECG changes of TCM with those of acute coronary syndrome. Our presented case, like several others, was diagnosed presumptively as acute coronary syndrome and treated as such. Emergency reperfusion therapy with thrombolysis, whilst not inappropriate for this patient given the considerable delay in reaching cardiac catheterisation, is not without significant risks of bleeding and stroke. However, in a centre where primary percutaneous coronary intervention was available within 90 min, a diagnosis of TCM could have been reached sooner, and the potential complications of thrombolysis could have been avoided. Interestingly, there may be a role in the stable patient for early echocardiogram and subsequent computed tomography coronary angiography to reach a diagnosis of TCM, thereby avoiding the vascular complications of cardiac catheterisation.

The outcomes of TCM as a complication of pancreatitis appear to be good. There has been no reported deaths, even in the severe case of cardiac arrest ultimately requiring left ventricular assist device. All patients, where treatments were described, were discharged on a beta-blocker and ACEi, and in those whose follow-up was reported, all but one had recovered left ventricular function, ranging from as early as 10 days up to 6 weeks. Abe et al. reported the case of persistently reduced left ventricular function even at 4 months, which was hypothesised to be due to ongoing alcohol use (Table 1).

Overall, TCM is a rare, and potentially under-recognised, complication of acute pancreatitis. In a scenario where delays in diagnosis can lead to unnecessary interventions and complications, increasing awareness of this phenomenon by surgeons and physicians alike is imperative.

### ED echo of reverse tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy: a rare and misleading finding [^09f058d3]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Tako-tsubo transient cardiomyopathy (TCM) is a syndrome of specific myocardial wall motion abnormalities that appear in response to extreme physiological or emotional stress. The patients have normal coronary arteries and usually present as new-onset heart failure or acute coronary syndrome. We report on a 48-year-old woman with post-community cardiac arrest presenting as an acute myocardial infarction. An emergency physician–performed echocardiogram showed significant wall motion abnormalities, suggesting myocardial infarction. Cardiac catheterization revealed patent epicoronary circulation, and ventriculography demonstrated a rare and only recently described variant of TCM:"reverse" TCM. The patient subsequently died from a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

### It's a trap! clinical similarities and subtle ECG differences between Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and myocardial infarction [^50f3c4c4]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

We describe a 65-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and smoking who presented with an acute episode of chest pain precipitated by severe emotional stress. Her initial electrocardiogram done in the emergency room showed non-specific T wave changes in the lateral leads and her cardiac troponin levels were mildly elevated. Because of her clinical presentation, she was admitted with a presumptive diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction and managed with antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy. Coronary angiogram did not reveal coronary artery disease and left ventriculography showed findings consistent with apical ballooning syndrome or takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Subsequent electrocardiograms displayed dramatic changes including T wave inversions, QT interval prolongation and U waves. The patient remained asymptomatic and recovered uneventfully. Three weeks post-discharge, an echocardiogram documented resolved left ventricular dysfunction. We describe the clinical features and highlight the electrocardiographic findings that may help differentiate takotsubo cardiomyopathy from myocardial infarction.

### Takotsubo syndrome: pathophysiology, emerging concepts, and clinical implications [^5de9dfb0]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic Criteria

The diagnosis of takotsubo syndrome can be challenging because clinical features have many similarities with acute coronary syndrome and immediate early cardiac imaging is needed because of the rapid normalization of left ventricular ejection fraction. The most widely used diagnostic criteria are those proposed by the Mayo Clinic in 2004and subsequently revised in 2008(Figure 3). Other groups have proposed slightly different diagnostic conventions, such as the Gothenburg criteria, Johns Hopkins criteria, the Takotsubo Italian Network proposaland the Heart Failure Association Takotsubo Syndrome Taskforce of the European Society of Cardiology criteria. The underlying principle is that takotsubo syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion since there has yet to be defined a specific diagnostic test or biomarker to identify the condition. Indeed, this extends to the post-mortem examination of fatal cases where specific diagnostic pathological features have yet to be defined, making it currently impossible to assign this diagnosis at autopsy.

Traditionally, the presence of coronary artery disease may have deterred the clinician from a diagnosis of takotsubo syndrome. Despite this uncertainty, it has become evident that takotsubo syndrome can co-exist in the presence of fixed coronary artery disease and can even be triggered by acute coronary syndrome. It is vital to look for subtle differences in clinical presentation to avoid misdiagnosis (Table 1). Equally, patients may be incorrectly diagnosed with takotsubo syndrome if coronary angiography reveals non-obstructive coronary artery disease, and the possibility of plaque rupture has not been ruled out, especially as stressful events are also associated with acute plaque rupture and type 1 myocardial infarction. The Inter-TAK diagnostic scorewas developed to aid the clinician in distinguishing takotsubo syndrome from acute coronary syndrome, but its performance is variable. Because understanding of the fundamental pathophysiology of takotsubo syndrome is limited, these criteria are likely to continue to evolve with time. We provide a diagnostic pathway incorporating the Inter-TAK score to aid diagnosis (Figure 3). Ultimately, the hallmark of takotsubo syndrome is the reversibility in systolic function which occurs within hours, days or weeks, in the absence of infarct-specific myocardial fibrosis. The clinical implication of recovery time remains unknown and there is emerging evidence that full recovery may be slower and less complete than initially thought.

Atria, septa, shunt evaluation, and mass characterization — reporting requirements: The size and morphology of the LA should be described and indexed to the BSA, and any LA masses should be described; pulmonary vein spectral Doppler blood flow patterns should be mentioned when significant mitral regurgitation is present or if there is suspicion for elevated LA or LV pressure. The RA size should be reported and any masses described. The morphology and structure of the IVS and the presence of ventricular septal defects should be reported when indicated, and the morphology and structure of the IAS should also be reported. If agitated saline contrast studies are performed, the absence or presence of shunting should be stated along with the maneuver used, and commenting on the degree of shunting is recommended (e.g., "large amount of saline contrast seen in the left heart"). Reporting cardiac masses should include comments about location, attachment, size, echogenicity, shape, mobility, and differential diagnosis such as neoplasm, vegetation, or thrombus.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^bc728348]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) — imaging features and differentiation from myocardial infarction (MI) include that in most cases the coronary arteries are angiographically normal, and where coronary artery disease (CAD) is present (15% cases) it is not sufficient to explain the observed pattern of regional wall motion abnormalities. Left ventriculography or echocardiography may show LV regional wall motion abnormalities including apical (82% of patients), mid-ventricular (14.6%), basal (2.2%), or focal (1.5%) akinesis or hypokinesis in a circumferential pattern involving > 1 coronary artery territory. Evidence of myocardial edema is often seen on cardiac magnetic resonance during the acute phase but late gadolinium enhancement is usually absent. The recovery time for LV function varies from hours to several weeks, and persistent abnormalities occur at long-term follow-up in 10% to 15% of patients. In the absence of recovery of regional wall motion abnormalities, LGE-CMR is recommended to exclude MI with spontaneous recanalization. Distinction between MI and TTS can be challenging, particularly when concurrent CAD is present (15% in the International Takotsubo Registry), and helpful features include QTC prolongation > 500 ms during the acute phase and recovery of LV function over 2 to 4 weeks.

Differential diagnosis

Differential diagnoses for the patient's presentation of chest tightness with associated shortness of breath, vomiting and sinus tachycardia include cardiac, pulmonary and oesophageal aetiology (table 1). Her initial ECG demonstrated sinus tachycardia with no ischaemic changes. Her hs-cTnT was elevated and a primary diagnosis of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) was made, with differentials including spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) and coronary artery spasm. Coronary angiography demonstrated mild coronary artery disease with no evidence of SCAD or acute plaque rupture. The left ventriculogram was suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

Table 1
Differential diagnosis for chest pain

The D-dimer assay that was performed to investigate dyspnoea and chest tightness was elevated (0.62 mg/L, normal < 0.50 mg/L). A CT pulmonary angiogram (CT-PA) was performed and found no evidence of pulmonary embolism. There was also no evidence of tension or spontaneous pneumothorax nor oesophageal perforation on CT-PA.

Echocardiography confirmed the presence of mid-cavity dilatation and anterior wall hypokinesis, consistent with the left ventriculography results, and a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was made.

Diagnostic Approach

No consensus on diagnostic criteria for MACM currently exists. In the literature, the presumptive diagnosis of MACM has been based on recent methamphetamine use or positive urine toxicological findings, and exclusion of other common causes of HF. We recommend obtaining a detailed history on drug use, including duration and frequency (Table). Physical examination may uncover signs of methamphetamine use. Urine toxicological findings are helpful to detect recent use, as methamphetamine may be present in the urine for up to 2 and 4 days with short‐ and long‐term use, respectively. Caution is advised as high false‐positive rates are possible with medications, such as pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, phenylephrine, bupropion, trazadone, promethazine, and ranitidine. 74 An echocardiogram is useful in detecting findings of severe LV dysfunction or biventricular failure with global hypokinesis and Takotsubo or reversed Takotsubo‐like appearance. Contrast echocardiography may be needed to confirm the presence of intracardiac thrombus. 75 Ischemic evaluation is often warranted, especially in patients presenting with chest pain, troponin elevation, and wall motion abnormalities. CMR may be useful for assessment of the presence and degree of myocardial fibrosis, a strong predictor of reversibility of cardiac function, and the presence of intracardiac thrombus. 76, 77

### A simple procedure in a complex patient: perioperative Takotsubo cardiomyopathy [^817d9a2c]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Background

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) is a rare but life-threatening condition characterised by transient left ventricular (LV) wall motion abnormality occurring in the abscence of coronary artery disease. First described in 1990, its presentation mimics an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and is thought to comprise approximately 1%–2% of patients presenting with symptoms of ACS. While several mechanisms have been suggested to explain its pathogenesis, the most widely accepted hypothesis suggests a catecholamine surge causing a 'stunning' of the myocardium, leading to transient LV dysfunction. This is supported by stress (physical or emotional) being implicated as a trigger for TTC. The incidence of perioperative TTC is estimated to be 1/6700 cases. Diagnosis is typically based on meeting the clinical criteria as outlined by the Mayo clinic in 2008 (box 1). While other criteria have been proposed, the Mayo criteria is most widely accepted and used. Management is generally aimed at managing myocardial ischaemia with oxygen, anticoagulation (until a diagnosis of coronary artery disease is excluded) and beta-blockers.

Box 1
Mayo criteria for diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (reprinted with permission from Prasad et al)

Transient hypokinesis, akinesis/dyskinesis of the left ventricular mid segments, with or without apical involvement.
Absence of obstructive coronary disease.
New ECG abnormalities - > ST elevation/T inversion or modest increase in troponin.
Absence of pheocromocytoma and myocarditis.

Cases of TTC are often associated with increased levels of serum catecholaminesand therefore agents that increase catecholamines (such as Selective Noradrenaline Re-uptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)) may be a contributing factor in development of the condition. The report below outlines a case of perioperative TTC in a patient taking duloxetine along with other precipitating factors.

### ECG criteria to differentiate between Takotsubo (stress) cardiomyopathy and myocardial infarction [^8ba17f13]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

This is the largest study defining specific ECG criteria to differentiate between TTC and MI. Our aim was to generate simple and specific ECG criteria that are helpful in the differential diagnosis of TTC and acute MI in the emergency setting. Due to a different management, the acute recognition of TTC is clinically important, but usually a challenging task given the similarities in the clinical presentation, ECG, and biomarker characteristics of the 2 entities. 1, 6, 7, 8 Eventually, emergency coronary angiography and ventriculography are required to confirm the underlying diagnosis of both conditions. The early differentiation between these 2 entities has a potential benefit regarding the timing of the coronary angiography and the antiplatelet/anticoagulation regimen to be used, especially in patients with multiple comorbidities such as those presenting after physical stressors such as subarachnoid hemorrhage or hemorrhagic stroke, known to be typical triggers for TTC. 1

### Takotsubo cardiomyopathy after minor burn injury [^5d052cab]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2011). Low credibility.

The relationship between severe emotional stress and subsequent acute cardiac dysfunction has been anecdotally noted for decades. In fact, cases of "death by fright" have been described since ancient times, and a growing body of evidence suggests that this phenomenon is due to an acute catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy. The authors present a case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy complicating a minor burn injury that occurred during an operating room fire. Two PEA arrests occurred immediately after injury, and an intra-aortic balloon pump was required due to hemodynamic instability. The diagnosis was confirmed by echocardiogram and cardiac catherization. This condition is often unrecognized as a cause of hemodynamic instability and may be more common after burn injury than we presently recognize.

### Artificial intelligence in differentiating Takotsubo syndrome from myocardial infarction… [^58eb7fe0]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Single images do not contain enough information for the classification of TTS vs AMI. The relevant information about the patient's disease is contained in the characteristic dynamic of the different parts of the myocardium and heart chambers, ie, the typical wall movement changes in TTS. These regional wall movements were captured by providing the segmented masks of an echocardiogram video as input into the trained autoencoder model. We used this insight to investigate the prediction mechanism of the model. To identify the area of the myocardium that contains the most important information for the differentiation of apical TTS vs AMI associated with occlusion of left anterior descending coronary artery, we conducted an ablation study by evaluating the performance, measured in AUC, for each latent feature sequence individually.

The difference in the affected area of each latent feature value was weighted by the achieved AUC score and superimposed over the original echocardiographic video. We report the mean prediction accuracy and SD of the resulting 15 overall classifiers by testing each of them on an independent test data set that comprised a total of 220 echocardiogram videos. In addition, we evaluated the viability of our algorithm to distinguish between 2 common subtypes of the diseases that might present with similar pattern of regional wall motional abnormalities, such as apical TTS and LAD-AMI. The full diagnostic pipeline was compared against 4 cardiologists by ROC curve analysis. Our best performing model that leverages information from both chamber views achieved a mean AUC of 0. 79 and outperformed all the 4 readers whose AUCs ranged from
0. 68 to 0.
74.

Although certain echocardiographic features might be helpful in TTS diagnostic work-up, these are usually not sufficient for the definitive diagnosis of TTS. In terms of discriminating TTS from AMI, previous echocardiography studies revealed that despite a lower increase in troponin values, patients with TTS show more diffuse regional wall motion abnormalities than patients with anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction. 20 In addition, a characteristic pattern of regional systolic myocardial dysfunction that extends beyond the distribution territory of a single coronary artery with symmetrical involvement of anterior, inferior, septal, and lateral walls, has been described for patients with TTS.

### Serial changes of myocardial perfusion imaging in Takotsubo and reverse Takotsubo cardiomyopathy [^132c49f2]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Moreover, these findings are similar to those observed in acute myocardial infarction, where reperfusion therapy was performed, and myocardial salvage was successful. In patients with acute anterior infarction, a threshold of 50% of maximal Tc-99m sestamibi uptake had the best predictive value (positive predictive value of 90% and a negative predictive value of 91%) for improvement of LV function. In this study, the min-%-uptake in the acute phase of TTC and rTTC remained within the predicted range for viability in acute coronary syndrome in most cases. These findings may suggest that damaged myocardia have temporary myocardial ischemia in patients with TTC and rTTC. Multivessel epicardial coronary vasospasms have been suggested as a plausible causative factor of TTC for a long time. In our study, the ACh provocation test provoked epicardial coronary spasm in 5 of the 12 (42%) patients. Tawarahara et al. reported a case of TTC in which intracoronary ACh injection induced coronary spasm and the uptake of thallium-201 in the apex was decreased in the acute phase but recovered in the chronic phase. However, in recent years, TTC involvement and epicardial coronary vasospasm have been denied because provocative vasospasm was confirmed only in a limited number of cases in the ACh provocation test. Conversely, provoked coronary spasm cases in patients with TTC have been reported and their variants from the early era of discovering this syndrome to the present.-This discrepancy in the relationship between TTC and spasm may be due to the sensitivity of the ACh provocation test. Sueda et al. reported that intracoronary injection of ACh is less sensitive for diagnosis in young patients with rest angina and recommend performing sequential spasm provocation tests of ACh and ergonovine. Sato et al. reported a case of recurrent takotsubo-like cardiomyopathy associated with pheochromocytoma exhibiting different patterns of LV wall motion abnormality and different results of ACh provocation tests performed several times. As another possibility, it is hypothesized that epicardial and microvascular spasm could play a pathogenetic role in TTC. Abnormal coronary microvascular responses have been reported with various modalities in TTC. Loffi reported that Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction frame count and quantitative blush evaluator was impaired in left anterior descending artery territory in TTC patients. Some cases also reported that the index of microcirculatory resistance with pressure wire increased in the acute phase and improved in the chronic phase in TTC patients.-Mildly reduced uptake of Tc-99m sestamibi in TTC and rTTC patients similar to those with stunned myocardium might be due to the coronary microcirculatory disorder and the mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from epicardial or microvascular coronary vasospasm.

### Intrapulmonary arteriovenous shunt: diagnosis by saline contrast bubbles in the pulmonary veins [^d5d389eb]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2002). Low credibility.

A 54-year-old man with end-stage cirrhosis of the liver presented for evaluation of dyspnea. Intrapulmonary arteriovenous shunting was suspected. Transthoracic echocardiography with agitated saline contrast injection from the right antecubital vein was performed. Late arrival of saline contrast bubbles in the left atrium by pulmonary veins leading to complete left heart opacification confirmed the diagnosis of significant intrapulmonary shunting. This case and images illustrate the use of agitated saline contrast in combination with transthoracic echocardiography for the diagnosis of intrapulmonary arteriovenous fistula.

### Guidelines for the use of echocardiography as a monitor for therapeutic intervention in adults: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography [^b7082ffc]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Neurosurgery — transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in the sitting position is used primarily in a rescue setting and has an "equivocal" endorsement as category B by the American Society of Anesthesiologists; evaluation of the interatrial septum by color-flow Doppler and agitated saline contrast can assess risk for paradoxical emboli. Ongoing intraoperative assessment for air entrainment into right sided cardiac chambers is recommended when the risk for paradoxical emboli is high. Although TEE monitoring is useful in the sitting position, it has been associated with posterior tongue edema and even necrosis, and further controlled studies are needed to define the beneficial role of transesophageal monitoring in this setting.

### Guidelines for performing a comprehensive transesophageal echocardiographic examination: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography and the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists [^988f7be2]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2013). Medium credibility.

Interatrial shunt determination — Compared with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) performed with multiple (at least five) saline injections and provocative maneuvers has been shown to be accurate for right-to-left intracardiac shunt detection (sensitivity, 99%; specificity, 85%), whereas using color Doppler alone with TTE reduces sensitivity to 22% (specificity, 96%), and the absence of color flow should not be used to exclude patent foramen ovale (PFO). For agitated saline studies, more than three bubbles in the left heart within three beats after right heart opacification is most consistent with PFO, and one approach defines three to 10 microbubbles as a small shunt, 11 to 30 as moderate, and > 30 as large; others suggest a PFO is present if more than one contrast bubble appears in the left atrium and that a large shunt is > 10 bubbles. Femoral vein injections have the highest sensitivity, bubbles typically appear in the left heart after a delay of more than three to eight cardiac cycles, and timing of bubble appearance is not a reliable indicator of shunt location. To increase sensitivity, coughing or releasing a sustained Valsalva maneuver is most effective; during conscious sedation abdominal compression may be used, and if the interatrial septum does not move toward the left atrium despite adequate right atrial opacification the study should be considered inadequate, with repeat attempts at the end of the examination considered when the patient can perform a cough or Valsalva.

Patients with thyrotoxicosis can develop cardiovascular complications that include tachyarrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, atrial ectopics, etc), and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy should be increasingly noted as a potential complication.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with symptoms consistent with acute coronary syndrome.
Following diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, investigation for underlying hyperthyroidism is recommended.
Treatment of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy should include treating the aetiology of the disease as well as institution of heart failure medications.
More studies are required to determine the exact pathophysiology of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

### Contrast guided two-dimensional echocardiography for needle localization during pericardiocentesis: a case report [^82804b87]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2010). Low credibility.

The authors present a case of pericardial effusion that was percutaneously drained using agitated saline for echocardiographic contrast guidance. This technique can safely confirm the location of a pericardiocentesis needle in the pericardial space prior to tract dilation and insertion of the pericardial drainage catheter. In this instance, this technique prevented the inadvertent placement of the pericardiocentesis catheter in the right ventricle.
