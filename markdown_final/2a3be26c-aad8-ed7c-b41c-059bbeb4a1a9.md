## Question

Recent articles on pneumonia in adults

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about recent articles on pneumonia in adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which sources qualify as "recent" and how to prioritize them by evidence hierarchy. Then, I should extract the most impactful updates across diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Next, I will verify key claims against guideline strength and conflicting data. Finally, I will synthesize practical takeaways and highlight controversies or gaps that might change practice soon.

> Let me first confirm the scope and recency. I will focus on 2025 publications and very late 2024 updates, prioritizing high-credibility guidelines and peer-reviewed studies, while noting where 2024 data inform 2025 recommendations. I should double-check that the ATS 2025 CAP guideline is indeed the most authoritative recent source and that ACIP 2024 pneumococcal updates are reflected in 2025 schedules, which they are [^112S2QnK] [^111SL78D] [^115HVEHj].

> Next, I should review diagnostic advances. The 2025 ATS CAP guideline addresses lung ultrasound for diagnosis, but wait, let me verify the exact recommendation language. The summary notes lung ultrasound is addressed, yet the provided excerpts do not state a firm recommendation, so I should be cautious and note that the full guideline details are needed to confirm whether this is a strong or conditional endorsement and in which settings it applies. I also need to check severity assessment updates; multiple 2025 studies reinforce the limitations of PSI and CURB-65 in older adults and propose enhancements such as dynamic machine-learning trend scores and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, but I should confirm these are adjunctive rather than replacements for validated tools, which they are [^111CFSEU] [^111PcZAH] [^113rwiBa].

> Now, treatment updates. I will examine empiric antibiotic decisions in the setting of viral testing. The 2025 ATS guideline recommends avoiding empiric antibiotics in adult outpatients without comorbidities who have clinical and imaging evidence of CAP but test positive for a respiratory virus, and to consider antibiotics in those with comorbidities or in severe CAP due to bacterial-viral co-infection risk, which is a notable shift toward more selective therapy [^112S2QnK] [^1153KRfw] [^113k3zsY]. Hold on, I should verify duration guidance; the ATS update also addresses antibiotic duration, but the excerpt does not specify the new durations, so I will flag that as a gap pending full-text review and note that contemporary practice increasingly supports shorter effective courses when clinically appropriate [^115qR2bM].

> I need to check corticosteroid recommendations. The 2025 ATS guideline suggests considering systemic corticosteroids in adult inpatients with severe CAP, which aligns with a conditional recommendation and should be balanced against infection risks and patient-specific factors; I should confirm that this is not a blanket endorsement and that severity criteria matter, which the guideline framing implies [^116arY2y]. But wait, what if the patient has viral pneumonia without bacterial co-infection? The ATS viral-positive guidance still supports antibiotics in severe CAP or high-risk patients, so steroids should be individualized rather than withheld solely due to viral detection [^113k3zsY].

> Let me consider pharmacologic additions. Ceftobiprole (Zevtera) has FDA labeling for CABP with supportive RCT data, and I should confirm the comparator and design; yes, a randomized, double-blind trial versus ceftriaxone with optional linezolid supports noninferiority, though macrolides were not allowed as adjuncts in that study, which limits generalizability to macrolide-inclusive regimens [^116wpkJp]. I should also review shorter-course fluoroquinolone options; levofloxacin 750 mg for 5 days has noninferior clinical success to 10 days in mild-to-severe CAP, which can reduce treatment burden when appropriate, though I need to ensure local resistance patterns and patient-specific risks are considered [^115N9Cj4].

> Next, I should review prevention, especially pneumococcal vaccination. ACIP expanded routine pneumococcal conjugate vaccination to all adults aged 50 years and older in 2024, with PCV20 or PCV21 as preferred single-dose options, and this is reflected in the 2025 adult immunization schedule; I should confirm that prior PCV13-based series are handled correctly, which they are via catch-up pathways [^115HVEHj] [^111SL78D]. Hold on, I should verify efficacy claims; randomized data in older adults show PCV13 reduces vaccine-type pneumococcal pneumonia by about 45% and vaccine-type invasive disease by about 75%, supporting the move to higher-valency conjugate vaccines in adults [^113GVjd5]. I also need to check special populations; people with HIV should receive PCV15 or PCV20 with PPSV23 sequencing if PCV15 is used, and those previously vaccinated can complete series with PCV20/21 per updated guidance, which I should explicitly state to avoid errors [^114XoGAB] [^116BXe7N].

> I will now examine epidemiology and risk stratification. Recent surveillance from Tennessee and Georgia shows substantial incidence of adult CAP hospitalizations with a meaningful pneumococcal fraction, reinforcing the public health rationale for adult PCV expansion and improved diagnostics to attribute etiology more reliably [^115CZYDR]. Let me reconsider severity tools; while PSI and CURB-65 remain standard, their performance wanes in older adults, prompting exploration of NLR and ML-derived trend scores, but I should emphasize these are adjuncts pending broader validation and integration into workflows [^111PcZAH] [^111CFSEU].

> But wait, what about non-resolving pneumonia and stewardship? A 2025 expert review proposes a structured approach to treatment failure, emphasizing systematic re-evaluation of diagnosis, antimicrobials, and host factors; I should note that this is expert opinion and that evidence for phenotype-guided therapy remains limited, calling for prospective studies and shared decision-making in complex cases [^114xWhbT]. I should also double-check that viral-bacterial co-infection is a recognized driver of non-response, which supports the ATS stance on antibiotics in severe viral-positive CAP and in high-risk outpatients with comorbidities [^113k3zsY] [^1153KRfw].

> Finally, I need to ensure I capture controversies and uncertainties. The role of lung ultrasound in routine CAP diagnosis remains debated pending full guideline details, optimal steroid use in severe viral-predominant CAP needs clearer thresholds, and the impact of higher-valency PCVs on adult disease burden is expected but still being measured in real-world settings; I should flag these as areas where practice may evolve as new data emerge [^115qR2bM] [^115HVEHj]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about abandoning validated severity scores; current guidance still anchors site-of-care and empiric therapy decisions in PSI/CURB-65 while allowing clinician judgment and emerging biomarkers to refine risk, which I should explicitly state to avoid misinterpretation [^113rwiBa].

Recent advances in adult pneumonia care include **shorter antibiotic courses** (5 days for CAP) [^115N9Cj4] and **expanded pneumococcal vaccination** to adults ≥ 50 years [^115HVEHj] [^111SL78D]. The 2025 ATS guideline recommends **lung ultrasound** to diagnose CAP when chest X-ray is inconclusive [^115qR2bM], and advises against empiric antibiotics in outpatients with viral-positive CAP without comorbidities [^112S2QnK], while considering them for severe CAP or those with comorbidities due to bacterial-viral co-infection risk [^113k3zsY] [^1153KRfw]. For severe CAP, **systemic corticosteroids** are conditionally recommended [^116arY2y]. New agents such as ceftobiprole [^116wpkJp] and sulbactam/durlobactam [^112HpziK] provide options for resistant pathogens, and rapid multiplex PCR is increasingly used to guide therapy and stewardship in HAP/VAP [^116zmuHN].

---

## Diagnostic innovations

- **Lung ultrasound**: The 2025 ATS guideline recommends lung ultrasound to diagnose CAP when chest X-ray is inconclusive, offering a radiation-free, bedside alternative with high sensitivity and specificity [^115qR2bM].

- **Rapid multiplex PCR**: Syndromic PCR panels are increasingly used in HAP/VAP to enable early pathogen detection and resistance profiling, supporting targeted therapy and stewardship [^116zmuHN].

- **Procalcitonin stewardship**: Computerized decision support improves appropriate PCT ordering and reduces unnecessary antibiotic use in CAP [^114fVdLR].

---

## Therapeutic advancements

- **Shorter antibiotic courses**: A 5-day levofloxacin regimen is noninferior to 10 days for CAP, supporting shorter effective courses to reduce resistance and adverse effects [^115N9Cj4].

- **New antibiotics**: Ceftobiprole is FDA-approved for CABP, including MRSA coverage, and sulbactam/durlobactam is approved for carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter HAP/VAP [^116wpkJp] [^112HpziK].

- **Corticosteroids**: The 2025 ATS guideline conditionally recommends systemic corticosteroids for severe CAP to reduce mortality and organ failure [^116arY2y].

---

## Preventive strategies

Expanded pneumococcal vaccination now includes **routine PCV20 or PCV21 for adults ≥ 50 years** [^115HVEHj] [^111SL78D], with **high efficacy against vaccine-type pneumococcal disease** [^113GVjd5]. Influenza, COVID-19, and RSV vaccination remain key to reducing CAP incidence and severity [^1173MLCC].

---

## Emerging challenges

Antibiotic resistance remains a major concern, particularly with **macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae** [^112ZXfLu] and carbapenem-resistant Gram-negatives [^112HpziK]. Non-resolving pneumonia requires structured evaluation for alternative diagnoses, complications, or resistant pathogens [^114xWhbT]. Post-COVID shifts include changes in pneumonia epidemiology and management, with ongoing research to clarify long-term impacts [^115x6qaW].

---

Recent progress emphasizes **shorter effective therapy**, **precision diagnostics**, and **prevention through vaccination**, while resistance and non-response demand vigilant stewardship and individualized care.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^114xWhbT]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This manuscript brings to light an understudied, underrecognized, and underappreciated clinical challenge: the hospitalized patient with severe pneumonia who is not responding to initial treatment. Clinical studies are needed to bring more robust evidence and to hopefully identify different non-response phenotypes.

We propose a common criterion that spans from sCAP to HAP/VAP, identify the most relevant risk factors, and provide a clinical pathway to investigate these patients in a timely manner to facilitate optimizing care.

The decision-making process consists of two key-components: the comprehensive search for an accurate diagnosis and treatment modification as needed to match the revised diagnosis. The former will ensure that clinicians are not missing an important diagnosis responsible for the initial treatment failure, and the later will offer a concrete approach to make the treatment successful.

In summary, there is an urgent need for better data on the epidemiology of pneumonia non-responders and how best to optimize the therapeutic approach in order to secure the best outcomes for all patients.

### Community-acquired pneumonia mortality trends according to age and gender: 2009 to 2019 [^1175BUxc]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common cause of adult Hospital admission and is associated with an increased risk of death. This risk increased from the age of 40 onwards, reaching over 40% in older patients. CAP's relative risk of mortality (when compared to the overall population) decreased between 2010 and 2019, especially for those aged 66–80. Striking differences in prevalence and mortality were noted for the different age groups, which should foster different healthcare policies.

### ACG clinical guideline update: preventive care in inflammatory bowel disease [^111RQ2CG]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — pneumonia risk and pneumococcal vaccination: Patients with IBD are at increased risk for pneumonia relative to age-matched patients without IBD (adjusted Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR), 1.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.49–1.60). In all adult patients with IBD aged 50 and older and no prior pneumococcal vaccination, we suggest pneumococcal vaccination with PCV20 or PCV21 (Strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence). In adult patients with IBD between 19 and 49 years receiving immune-modifying therapy and with no prior pneumococcal vaccination, we suggest pneumococcal vaccination with PCV20 or PCV21 (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). In patients with IBD who have previously received pneumococcal vaccination and are either age 19–64 on immune-modifying therapy, or who are age 65 and older, should follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance for whether to receive additional pneumococcal vaccination with PCV20 or PCV21 (Strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence). Supporting data include a cohort study of 74,156 patients with IBD and 1,482,363 non-IBD controls showing increased invasive pneumococcal pneumonia, and a Veterans Affairs analysis in which PCV13 vaccination either alone or with PPSV23 was associated with a 5-fold decreased risk in severe pneumococcal disease. In 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed the PCV15 and PCV20 vaccines in adults, and most recently, PCV21 was approved for use in adults age 19 and older; these latest guidelines are relevant to adults ages 19–49 with immune-modifying therapies and to all adults with IBD age 50 and older. To optimize coverage and convenience, all adults with IBD regardless of age and immune suppression status who are naïve to pneumococcal vaccination should receive a single dose of PCV20 or PCV21, without the need for additional vaccines or boosters, and pneumococcal vaccination can be safely administered at the same time as influenza vaccination.

Methods

Panel Composition

The Joint Panel was composed of 25 international specialists in pulmonary medicine, infectious diseases, pediatrics, epidemiology, and public health. A member of We Are TB, a patient advocacy organization, was included for patient perspective. All members helped to review and rate evidence with guidance from the methodology team. The co-sponsoring organizations each provided a co-chair and representatives responsible for the content of the manuscript.

Conflict-of-Interest Management

Guideline panel members disclosed all potential conflicts of interest (CoIs) according to the ATS policies (see author disclosures). The chairs and ATS reviewed and managed potential CoIs. Panel members with potential CoIs abstained from decisions about specific questions and recommendations related to their potential CoIs. Most panelists had no substantial CoIs and were approved to participate without limitation. One protocol chair panelist (P.N.) participated in the discussions but was recused from formulating, grading, writing, or editing the recommendation related to the treatment of DS-TB in adults. Another panelist (A.J.G.-P.) had a manageable conflict requiring recusal from the formulation of antibiotic-related recommendations pertaining to DR-TB.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^112LLMLc]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pneumococcal vaccination — evidence summary in people with HIV: Observational studies have reported benefits of PPSV against invasive pneumococcal disease and all-cause pneumonia in people with HIV, but results have been variable. One randomized placebo-controlled trial of PPSV in Africa found that vaccination was associated with an increased risk of pneumonia with no evidence of reduced risk of invasive pneumococcal disease, and follow-up confirmed the increase in pneumonia but showed a decrease in all-cause mortality in a cohort not treated with ART. A study evaluating PCV13 in adults with HIV between 2008 and 2018 found that invasive pneumococcal disease rates remained high, but higher-valent conjugate vaccines may reduce disease because 11.2% of cases consisted of serotypes in PCV15 but not PCV13 and 16.5% consisted of serotypes in PCV20 but not in PCV15. In 2021, PCV15 and PCV20 were licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in adults based on safety and immunogenicity data compared with data on PCV13 or PPSV23.

### Community-acquired pneumonia mortality trends according to age and gender: 2009 to 2019 [^113UtiD9]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains a common cause of infection and Hospital admission, with a high burden of morbidity and mortality, although significant regional variations are usually noted.

Despite the advances in CAP treatment and prevention (mostly related to vaccines against Influenza virus and invasive pneumococcal disease), at least 17% of patients with CAP still require hospitalization, and those with non-resolving CAP may experience a more than 5 -fold increase in the risk of death.

There are considerable differences in the characteristics of patients hospitalized with CAP, especially regarding the prevalence of comorbidities that may increase the incidence of CAP, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, age remains the main factor associated with CAP incidence and mortality.

Accordingly, older patients have CAP more often, which may translate into a prolonged Hospital length of stay, high bacteremia incidence, and mortality. Risk factors for CAP, prevention strategies, and therapeutic priorities of older patients may differ from those of the young, which should inform clinical practice. Escalating the level of care and increasing efforts to identify CAP etiology have been proposed to help decrease mortality for this group.

In this study, we address the incidence and mortality of CAP and their trends for 10 years, for different groups of patients, according to gender and age group, to evaluate their differences throughout this period and to provide data to guide prevention and treatment strategies.

Pneumococcal vaccine — evidence and licensing in people with HIV: Vaccination against S. pneumoniae is an important measure in preventing bacterial pneumonia, but one randomized placebo-controlled trial of PPSV in Africa paradoxically found that vaccination was associated with an increased risk of pneumonia, and there was no evidence of reduced risk of IPD among vaccinated participants, and follow-up of this cohort confirmed the increase in pneumonia in vaccinated participants and showed a decrease in all-cause mortality although participants in this study were not treated with ART. A recent study evaluating the impact of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) on the rates of IPD in adults with HIV between 2008 and 2018 found that IPD rates remained high despite reductions with the introduction of PCV13, and PCV20/non-PCV15 serotypes comprised 15.6% of cases of IPD. In 2021, two PCVs, 15-valent (PCV15) and 20-valent (PCV20), were licensed by the FDA for use in U.S. adults; PCV15 and PCV20 were licensed based on safety and immunogenicity data compared with the 13-valent PCV or 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23), and effectiveness data of these vaccine against pneumococcal disease in adults with HIV infection are currently not available.

5.3 Infections

Serious infections, including sepsis and pneumonia, have been reported in patients receiving ORENCIA (serious infections were reported in 3% and 1.9% of RA patients treated with intravenous ORENCIA and placebo, respectively) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Some of these infections have been fatal. Many of the serious infections have occurred in patients on concomitant immunosuppressive therapy which in addition to their underlying disease, could further predispose them to infection. A higher rate of serious infections has been observed in adult RA patients treated with concurrent TNF antagonists and ORENCIA compared to those treated with ORENCIA alone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Healthcare providers should exercise caution when considering the use of ORENCIA in patients with a history of recurrent infections, underlying conditions which may predispose them to infections, or chronic, latent, or localized infections. Patients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with ORENCIA should be monitored closely. Administration of ORENCIA should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection.

Prior to initiating ORENCIA, patients should be screened for latent tuberculosis (TB) infection according to current TB guidelines. ORENCIA has not been studied in patients with a positive TB screen, and the safety of ORENCIA in individuals with latent TB infection is unknown. Patients testing positive in TB screening should be treated by standard medical practice prior to therapy with ORENCIA.

Antirheumatic therapies have been associated with hepatitis B reactivation. Therefore, screening for viral hepatitis should be performed in accordance with published guidelines before starting therapy with ORENCIA. In clinical studies with ORENCIA, patients who screened positive for hepatitis were excluded from study.

5.4 Immunizations

Prior to initiating ORENCIA in pediatric and adult patients, update vaccinations in accordance with current vaccination guidelines. ORENCIA-treated patients may receive current non-live vaccines. Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with ORENCIA or within 3 months after discontinuation. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection from persons receiving live vaccines to patients receiving ORENCIA. In addition, there are clinical considerations for administering live vaccines to infants who were exposed to ORENCIA while in utero [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Based on its mechanism of action, ORENCIA may blunt the effectiveness of some immunizations.

### Ustekinumab [^111CfHPx]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.7 Immunizations

Prior to initiating therapy with Ustekinumab, patients should receive all age-appropriate immunizations as recommended by current immunization guidelines. Patients being treated with Ustekinumab should avoid receiving live vaccines. Avoid administering BCG vaccines during treatment with Ustekinumab or for one year prior to initiating treatment or one year following discontinuation of treatment. Caution is advised when administering live vaccines to household contacts of patients receiving Ustekinumab because of the potential risk for shedding from the household contact and transmission to patient.

Non-live vaccinations received during a course of Ustekinumab may not elicit an immune response sufficient to prevent disease.

5.8 Noninfectious Pneumonia

Cases of interstitial pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia have been reported during post-approval use of Ustekinumab. Clinical presentations included cough, dyspnea, and interstitial infiltrates following one to three doses. Serious outcomes have included respiratory failure and prolonged hospitalization. Patients improved with discontinuation of therapy and in certain cases administration of corticosteroids.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^114MDfbt]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Non-severe CAP inpatient treatment — Individuals with HIV who are being treated as inpatients should receive an intravenous (IV) beta-lactam plus a macrolide (AI) or a respiratory fluoroquinolone (AI); monotherapy with a macrolide is not recommended in the inpatient setting. In one study, beta-lactam monotherapy was not found to be non-inferior to beta-lactam/macrolide combination therapy, and in the monotherapy arm patients with more severe CAP, as indicated by a PSI ≥ IV, or with atypical pathogens were less likely to reach clinical stability, with more 30-day readmissions among the patients on monotherapy. Given the heterogeneity and limitations of recent studies and scarce data in patients with HIV, the recommendation for patients with HIV who are hospitalized with non-severe CAP remains the same as in people without HIV: to administer either beta-lactam/macrolide combination therapy, or a single drug regimen of a respiratory fluoroquinolone (AI). Preferred beta-lactams are ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ampicillin-sulbactam, and preferred macrolides are azithromycin and clarithromycin.

Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) in adults — efficacy, safety, and products: In a randomized clinical trial among Dutch adults aged ≥ 65 years, vaccine efficacy was reported as 75% against vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease and 45% against pneumococcal pneumonia; PCV are described as very safe with up to 10% local reactions that usually resolve in a day or 2 and serious adverse reactions are rare. There are 2 PCV for adults that do not require subsequent vaccination — PCV20 and PCV21 — whereas a PCV15 vaccine must be followed by PPSV23; pneumococcal vaccines can be given concurrently with influenza, COVID-19, and RSV vaccines, and development of new and expanded formulations is ongoing, advising attentiveness to future recommendation changes.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^112hbQhf]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Assessing severity of disease and treatment location — community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in people with HIV: Severity indices including the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), CURB-65, and ATS/IDSA severity criteria appear to be valid for predicting mortality and, with clinical judgement, can guide site-of-care decisions, although no prospective randomized clinical trials have assessed their performance for this purpose and whether adding HIV-related variables improves them is uncertain. Mortality increased with higher PSI risk class and, even without increased mortality risk by PSI, a CD4 count < 200 cells/mm3 was associated with an increased risk of death, leading to the suggestion to hospitalize CAP patients with CD4 counts < 200 cells/mm3 and to use the PSI to help decision-making in those with higher CD4 counts. Low risk patients without adherence or complicating concerns can be treated as outpatients, whereas those with severe CAP usually require a higher level of care, typically ICU admission; severe criteria can include PSI risk class of III or IV or CURB-65 scores ≥ 3, and patients with ≥ 3 of the ATS/IDSA minor severity criteria for CAP often require ICU or higher level of care. Additional prognostic tools include the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) Index, which may also be useful in predicting ICU admission and mortality and in which a higher score in older patients with and without HIV with CAP was associated with greater 30-day mortality, readmission, and length of stay, and the SWAT-Bp tool measuring male [S]ex, muscle [W]asting, non-[A]mbulatory, [T]emperature (> 38°C or < 35°C), and [B]lood [p]ressure (systolic < 100 and/or diastolic < 60), which in a retrospective study of 216 patients (84% with HIV) demonstrated moderate discriminatory power while CURB-65 was less accurate.

### Updates on the treatment of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant tuberculosis: an official ATS / CDC / ERS / IDSA clinical practice guideline [^113StdSA]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Successful treatment and cure of tuberculosis (TB) improves individual health and reduces Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission. Historically, treatment of TB, particularly of drug-resistant TB (DR-TB), has involved prolonged courses of multiple medications and frequent adverse reactions. Patients and clinicians prefer shorter, safer, and more effective regimens with fewer pills and injections for drug-susceptible (DS)-TB and DR-TB (Table 2). Recent clinical treatment trials of both DS- and DR-TB provided new evidence toward these objectives. On the basis of favorable study outcomes, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) updated DS- and DR-TB treatment recommendations in 2022.

Patient Perspective

This guideline update, written by a panel of American Thoracic Society (ATS), CDC, European Respiratory Society (ERS), and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) specialists, relied on recent reviews of clinical data conducted by the WHO Guideline Development Group (GDG). This Joint Panel guideline focuses on TB in low-incidence settings without significant resource limitations.

5.7 Immunizations

Prior to initiating therapy with STELARA, patients should receive all age-appropriate immunizations as recommended by current immunization guidelines. Patients being treated with STELARA should avoid receiving live vaccines. Avoid administering BCG vaccines during treatment with STELARA or for one year prior to initiating treatment or one year following discontinuation of treatment. Caution is advised when administering live vaccines to household contacts of patients receiving STELARA because of the potential risk for shedding from the household contact and transmission to patient.

Non-live vaccinations received during a course of STELARA may not elicit an immune response sufficient to prevent disease.

5.8 Noninfectious Pneumonia

Cases of interstitial pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia have been reported during post-approval use of STELARA. Clinical presentations included cough, dyspnea, and interstitial infiltrates following one to three doses. Serious outcomes have included respiratory failure and prolonged hospitalization. Patients improved with discontinuation of therapy and in certain cases administration of corticosteroids. If diagnosis is confirmed, discontinue STELARA and institute appropriate treatment [see Postmarketing Experience (6.3)].

Recommendation strength language and implications — The term "we recommend" is used for a "strong" recommendation, and "we conditionally recommend" is used for a "conditional" recommendation, analogous to "we suggest". For patients, a strong recommendation means "The overwhelming majority of individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small minority would not", whereas a conditional recommendation means "The majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but a sizable minority would not". For clinicians, strong implies "The overwhelming majority of individuals should receive the recommended course of action. Adherence to this recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator" and that "Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individuals make decisions consistent with their values and preferences", while conditional implies "Different choices will be appropriate for different patients, and you must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences" and that "Decision aids may be useful… Clinicians should expect to spend more time with patients when working toward a decision". For policy makers, strong implies "The recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations, including for use as performance indicators", whereas conditional implies "Policy making will require substantial debates and involvement of many stakeholders. Policies are also more likely to vary between regions" and that "Performance indicators would have to focus on the fact that adequate deliberation about the management options has taken place".

### Tocilizumab (Tofidence) [^116XqfAo]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

RECOVERY (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy) Collaborative Group Study in Hospitalized Adults Diagnosed with COVID-19

RECOVERY was a randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter platform study conducted in the United Kingdom to evaluate the efficacy and safety of potential treatments in hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Eligible patients for the tocilizumab portion of the study had clinically suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and no medical contraindications to any of the treatments and had clinical evidence of progressive COVID-19 (defined as oxygen saturation < 92% on room air or receiving oxygen therapy, and CRP ≥ 75 mg/L). Patients were then randomized to receive either standard of care (SoC) or intravenous tocilizumab at a weight-tiered dosing comparable to the recommended dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] in addition to SoC.

Efficacy analyses were performed in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population comprising 4116 adult patients who were randomized to the tocilizumab + SoC arm (n = 2022) or to the SoC arm (n = 2094). The mean age of participants was 64 years (range: 20 to 101), and patients were 67% male, 76% White, 11% Asian, 3% Black or African American, and 1% mixed race. At baseline, 0.2% of patients were not on supplemental oxygen, 45% of patients required low flow oxygen, 41% of patients required non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen, and 14% of patients required invasive mechanical ventilation; 82% of patients were reported to be receiving systemic corticosteroids.

The primary efficacy endpoint was time to death through Day 28. The results for the overall population and the subgroups of patients who were or were not receiving systemic corticosteroids at time of randomization are summarized in Table 9.

Eligibility criteria

Published case reports/series of proven/probable C. psittaci pneumonia, as mainly defined by the Diagnosis and Treatment of Adults with Community-acquired Pneumonia guidelines published by the American Society of Infections and the American Thoracic Society(ATS/IDSA 2007 criteria) and Psittacosis/Ornithosis (Chlamydophila psittaci) 2010 Case Definition published by CDC in patients ≥ 18 years old were reviewed. Additionally, C. psittaci infection diagnosed through the mNGS test will also be included (Supplementary material, Appendix S2). For inclusion, the published cases must have had documentation of (i) demographics and history of contact with live poultry, (ii) comorbidities, (iii) method(s) of diagnosis, (iv) treatment process and strategy, and (v) patient outcomes. Conference abstracts, editorials, poorly described cases, review articles, or case series without primary data or where the analysis was pooled without the description of individual patient data were excluded. In addition to the severe pneumonia screening criteria outlined in ATS/IDSA 2007 guidelines, patients meeting any of the following criteria were categorized into the severe group: admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), necessitating cardiovascular support (vasopressors, inotropes, with or without extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)), and death.

Data collection process and data items

Using standardized data extraction forms (Supplementary materials), data were extracted independently by the two author groups (as above) and compared. Discrepancies were discussed with X. Tong and DG. Wang as adjudicators. Initial data were collected after admission. Data extracted included the authors, the country of origin of the published cases, year of publication, patient demographics, underlying conditions/comorbidities, method of diagnosis, severity, clinical manifestations, imaging, and clinical outcomes.

Summary measures and statistical analysis

Data analysis was performed utilizing STATA 16.0 software (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA). Patient characteristics, manifestations, and methods of diagnosis were descriptively summarized. Categorical variables underwent assessment via the chi-squared test or Fischer's exact test, while continuous variables were analyzed using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. Predictive factors for severe patients were discerned through multivariate logistic regression. P < 0.05 was statistically significant.

Literature Search

The following steps were conducted after the literature search: 1) title and abstract screening (a preliminary screen review of all titles and abstracts to determine which studies are potentially eligible) and 2) full-text screening (a more in-depth review of the full text for all included studies from the title/abstract phase to establish final eligibility for the review). For steps 1 and 2, the methodology team screened the titles and abstracts (TAs) of the uncovered citations and excluded studies on the basis of the predefined study selection criteria that were specific to each of the four study PICOs. Only studies that were deemed eligible (or were judged "unsure" by screeners) went on to the full-text (FT) phase. At the TA and FT phases of screening, screening was performed in duplicate and independently by pairs of screeners with consensus debate to settle disagreements and third-party adjudication when and if needed. At the FT phase, the full studies were retrieved so that the screeners could read the study in its entirety to make a definitive decision on whether a study would be retained to inform the respective PICO. Panel members were asked to be alert to any recently published trials or any studies that they thought were relevant to a particular PICO and that may have been missed in the electronic database search or TA and FT screening steps.

14.2 Community-Acquired Pneumonia: 7 to 14 day Treatment Regimen

Adult inpatients and outpatients with a diagnosis of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia were evaluated in 2 pivotal clinical studies. In the first study, 590 patients were enrolled in a prospective, multi-center, unblinded randomized trial comparing levofloxacin 500 mg once daily orally or intravenously for 7 to 14 days to ceftriaxone 1 to 2 grams intravenously once or in equally divided doses twice daily followed by cefuroxime axetil 500 mg orally twice daily for a total of 7 to 14 days. Patients assigned to treatment with the control regimen were allowed to receive erythromycin (or doxycycline if intolerant of erythromycin) if an infection due to atypical pathogens was suspected or proven. Clinical and microbiologic evaluations were performed during treatment, 5 to 7 days posttherapy, and 3 to 4 weeks posttherapy. Clinical success (cure plus improvement) with levofloxacinat 5 to 7 days posttherapy, the primary efficacy variable in this study, was superior (95%) to the control group (83%). The 95% CI for the difference of response rates (levofloxacinminus comparator) was [-6, 19]. In the second study, 264 patients were enrolled in a prospective, multi-center, non-comparative trial of 500 mg levofloxacin administered orally or intravenously once daily for 7 to 14 days. Clinical success for clinically evaluable patients was 93%. For both studies, the clinical success rate in patients with atypical pneumonia due to Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila were 96%, 96%, and 70%, respectively. Microbiologic eradication rates across both studies are presented in Table 10.

### Expanded recommendations for use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines among adults aged ≥ 50 years: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2024 [^115HVEHj]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Before October 2024, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended use of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) for all adults aged ≥ 65 years, as well as for those aged 19–64 years with risk conditions for pneumococcal disease who have not received a PCV or whose vaccination history is unknown. Options included either 20-valent PCV (PCV20; Prevnar20; Wyeth Pharmaceuticals) or 21-valent PCV (PCV21; CAPVAXIVE; Merck Sharp & Dohme) alone or 15-valent PCV (PCV15; VAXNEUVANCE; Merck Sharp & Dohme) in series with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23; Pneumovax23; Merck Sharp & Dohme). There are additional recommendations for use of PCV20 or PCV21 for adults who started their pneumococcal vaccination series with 13-valent PCV (PCV13; Prevnar13; Wyeth Pharmaceuticals). The ACIP Pneumococcal Vaccines Work Group employed the Evidence to Recommendations framework to guide its deliberations on expanding the age-based PCV recommendation to include adults aged 50–64 years. On October 23, 2024, ACIP recommended a single dose of PCV for all PCV-naïve adults aged ≥ 50 years. Recommendations for PCVs among adults aged 19–49 years with risk conditions and PCV13-vaccinated adults have not changed from previous recommendations. This report summarizes evidence considered for these recommendations and provides updated clinical guidance for use of PCV.

### Development and validation of an early diagnosis model for severe Mycoplasma pneumonia in children based on interpretable machine learning [^117PcFeA]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Presently, the diagnosis of SMPP predominantly relies on imaging techniques and clinical signs. However, the clinical and radiological features of SMPP bear a strong resemblance to those of viral - induced infections and exhibit heterogeneous characteristics. In other words, pneumonia presentations differ significantly across pediatric patients with varying. This presents a formidable challenge to the prompt and precise diagnosis of SMPP in children and the implementation of appropriate treatment strategies. In response to the diverse presentations of pneumonia, comprehensive diagnostic and treatment guidelines, such as the CRUB-65 and PSI scores, have been established for evaluating the severity of pneumonia in adults. However, the assessment of pneumonia in children lacks an objective, quantitative, cost-effective, and convenient diagnostic framework. Traditional biomarkers, including white blood cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin (PCT), are inadequate for accurately distinguishing the severity of pulmonary infections in pediatric patients. Consequently, recent research has focused on identifying biomarkers specific to pneumonia diagnosis and developing evaluation systems tailored to children. Studies suggest that several assessment systems can enhance risk stratification for pediatric pulmonary diseases, such as the Pediatric Respiratory Emergency Severity Score (PRESS), the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS), and pro-adrenomedullin (Pro-ADM). However, these prediction models are not applicable to the assessment of SMPP due to their complexity, low sensitivity and lack of specificity for SMPP diagnosis. Currently, there is no systematic approach for risk classification of pediatric SMPP.

Compared with traditional scoring systems, machine learning (ML) models have demonstrated superior performance in predicting various diseases or clinical conditions. ML models are typically constructed based on large amounts of data recorded in Electronic Patient Record (EPR) systems. Their deep learning capabilities enable them to capture complex nonlinear relationships, and even previously unknown correlations in big data, allowing for more in-depth mining of clinical data. They also show great potential in clinical settings where large amounts of data are collected and integrated daily. Recently, Yang and his colleagues developed a model using ML algorithms to accurately identify severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults. In addition, ML has been employed to differentiate pathogens in pediatric CAP. ML has also been used to develop pneumonia-related prognostic models to predict mortality risk and complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Unfortunately, to date, no ML model has been developed for predicting SMPP in children.

Preventing Streptococcus pneumoniae infections — pneumococcal vaccination in people with HIV is indicated for all people with HIV regardless of CD4 count (AI). For those without prior vaccination or with unknown vaccine history, administer either 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV15) or 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV20) (AII); if PCV20 is used, their pneumococcal vaccination is complete, whereas if PCV15 is used, a dose of PPSV23 should be administered at least 8 weeks later (AII) and no additional pneumococcal vaccine doses are recommended. For people who previously started or completed a pneumococcal vaccination series, there is no need to restart the series, and those who received PCV13 and were 65 or older when they received a dose of PPSV23 do not require further doses of PPSV23; for those who received PPSV23 younger than age 65, additional doses are recommended as follows (BIII): people who received PCV13 and PPSV23 at age < 65 should receive a second dose of PPSV23 at least 5 years after the first dose; if they are age 65 or older at the time of their second dose, they do not require additional doses, but if they were < 65 at the time of the second dose, they should receive a third and final dose at or after age 65, at least 5 years after the second PPSV23 dose. People who have only received PPSV23 may receive a PCV (either PCV20 or PCV15) ≥ 1 year after their last PPSV23 dose, and when PCV15 is used in those with history of PPSV23 receipt, it need not be followed by another dose of PPSV23 at any age (BIII). Footnotes specify that patients with CD4 counts ≥ 200 cells/mm3 should receive a dose of PPSV23 at least 8 weeks later (AI); while those with CD4 counts < 200 cells/mm3 can also be offered PPSV23 at least 8 weeks after receiving PCV15 (CIII), PPSV23 should preferably be deferred until after an individual's CD4 count increases to ≥ 200 cells/mm3 while on ART (BIII), and clinical evidence supporting use of PPSV23 in persons with CD4 counts < 200 cells/mm3 appears strongest in patients who also have HIV RNA < 100,000 copies/mL; evidence also suggests benefit for those who start ART before receiving PPSV vaccination; additionally, for people who received PCV13 but have not completed PPSV23, one dose of PCV20 may be used if PPSV23 is not available and if PCV20 is used, their pneumococcal vaccinations are complete (CIII).

14.3 Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia

Tigecycline was evaluated in adults for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) in two randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multinational, multicenter studies (Studies 1 and 2). These studies compared tigecycline (100 mg intravenous initial dose followed by 50 mg every 12 hours) with levofloxacin (500 mg intravenous every 12 or 24 hours). In Study 1, after at least 3 days of intravenous therapy, a switch to oral levofloxacin (500 mg daily) was permitted for both treatment arms. Total therapy was 7 to 14 days. Patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia who required hospitalization and intravenous therapy were enrolled in the studies. The primary efficacy endpoint was the clinical response at the test of cure (TOC) visit in the co-primary populations of the clinically evaluable (CE) and clinical modified intent-to-treat (c-mITT) patients. See Table 8. Clinical cure rates at TOC by pathogen in the microbiologically evaluable patients are presented in Table 9.

To further evaluate the treatment effect of tigecycline, a post-hoc analysis was conducted in CABP patients with a higher risk of mortality, for whom the treatment effect of antibacterial drugs is supported by historical evidence. The higher-risk group included CABP patients from the two studies with any of the following factors:

Age ≥ 50 years
PSI score ≥ 3
Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia

The results of this analysis are shown in Table 10. Age ≥ 50 was the most common risk factor in the higher-risk group.

Special considerations during pregnancy — obstetric monitoring and pneumococcal vaccination — pneumonia during pregnancy is associated with increased rates of preterm labor and delivery, and pregnant women with pneumonia after 20 weeks' gestation should be monitored for evidence of contractions (BII). Pneumococcal vaccine can be administered during pregnancy (AIII). A study comparing administration of PCV10, PPSV23, or control (1:1:1) among 347 women during weeks 13–34 of pregnancy found that PCV10 and PPSV23 were equally safe and immunogenic in pregnant women with HIV and conferred similar levels of seroprotection to their infants; no adverse consequences have been reported among newborns whose mothers were vaccinated during pregnancy. Women who did not receive vaccines during pregnancy were vaccinated post-partum; these data demonstrated higher antibody responses compared to women vaccinated ante-partum, suggesting that postpartum booster doses may be beneficial and require further study.

### Assessment of disease severity in hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia by the use of validated scoring systems [^113rwiBa]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Community acquired pneumonia (CAP), albeit a common infection, can be a potential life-threatening illness and is the most common causes of sepsis. It is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates especially in the elderly and in patients with underlying comorbidities.

Hospital admission rates can vary widely and are often not directly related to disease severity. A number of factors contribute to decisions on site of care and level of therapy, among these medication compliance, ability to maintain oral intake, cognitive or functional impairment, social circumstances, disease severity, and organ support measures. Clinicians can misinterpret or misjudge disease severity, leading to unwarranted therapy for relatively mild cases, or missed or delayed therapy for more severe cases. However, the risk of short-term mortality in CAP is more likely to be over-, rather than underestimated, when using simplified disease severity assessment scores.

The initiation of empirical antimicrobial therapy and the site of care are by most professional guideline recommendations determined by CAP severity at presentation. However, the evidence to support a standardized approach with the use of disease severity assessments for CAP, is still sparse in terms of improved outcomes. In countries with low rates of antimicrobial resistance, unwarranted broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy is of particular concern.

A wide array of supporting systems have been developed and validated to aid clinicians when assessing disease severity in especially CAP. Of these systems, some are relatively effortless, while some are complex. In this study, we have applied these systems to a CAP-cohort, and established test properties and performance.

### The improved prediction value of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio to pneumonia severity scores for mortality in the older people with community-acquired pneumonia [^111PcZAH]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Age has been associated with high incidence and mortality of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), which is a leading cause of hospitalization and death worldwide. Population ageing could undoubtedly increase the healthcare costs for older patients with CAP. Several pneumonia severity scores, such as the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) CURB-65, CRB-65, A-DROP and SMART-COP have been developed and used to identify patients at high risk, which is beneficial for deciding the treatment site and hierarchical management. However, the discriminatory power of PSI and CURB-65 for 30-day mortality decreases with increasing age category. There is an urgent need to find a new or updated pneumonia severity score with high performance and easy availability to predict adverse outcomes in the older patients.

The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a simple, cheap, easily available blood marker derived from the complete blood count test that has been shown to have diagnostic and prognostic value in CAP. NLR had always been used as a dichotomous variable in previous studies, which found that the higher the NLR, the higher the mortality in patients with CAP. However, it is unclear whether there is a linear relationship between NLR and mortality. Few small studies investigated the predictive value of adding NLR to CURB-65 or PSI for death, but the results were inconclusive. In addition, the added predictive value of NLR to other common scoring systems, such as CRB-65, A-DROP, and SMART-COP, is unknown.

Hence, we aimed to describe the characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized older patients with CAP with different NLRs levels and to determine whether there is a linear relationship between NLR and adverse outcomes. We also aimed to evaluate the predictive value of adding NLR to pneumonia severity scores for death in older patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

### Updates on the treatment of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant tuberculosis: an official ATS / CDC / ERS / IDSA clinical practice guideline [^117MvLuo]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Guideline Development Methodology

This guideline is a targeted update to the treatment of TB and specifically as an adaptation of the WHO 2022 guidelines relevant to the prior Joint Panel's guideline recommendations. Four methodologists followed the GRADE-ADOLOPMENT (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation – adoption, adaptation, and, as needed, de novo development of recommendations) process and used the evidence-to-decision (EtD) frameworks in the adaptation of published WHO guidelines. ADOLOPMENT is a GRADE framework that involves either adoption of recommendations from existing guidelines, adaptation of recommendations from existing guidelines, or, if needed, de novo development of recommendations.

The methodologists administered online surveys to confirm the panelists' selection of PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcome) questions for ADOLOPMENT and prioritization of critical outcomes on the basis of recently published treatment trials and recent CDC and WHO guidelines through a modified Delphi process. The Joint Panel arrived at consensus to use the WHO prioritization of critical outcomes. Specifically, the Joint Panel consensus was to adapt specific questions on DS- and DR-TB as worded in the WHO guidelines pertaining to TB treatment provided in an update to the 2016 and 2019 Joint Panel's guidelines on TB treatment. Subsequently, the Joint Panel used the same wording of questions as noted in WHO guidelines, except to refer to the standard of care (SoC) noted in the prior Joint Panel's guidelines as active comparators as opposed to active comparators from the SoC from prior WHO guidelines.

The Joint Panel chose through consensus to adapt the 2022 WHO guidelines on TB treatment on the basis of the relevance, rigor, quality of evidence, and GRADE methodology used in their development. In addition, the methodology team conducted a targeted literature search in three databases (Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials), using "tuberculosis" and "randomized clinical trial" as filters to confirm the absence of new clinical trial data pertinent to selected PICO questions since the publication of the WHO Guidelines in 2022.

14.3 Community-Acquired Pneumonia: 5-day Treatment Regimen

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the higher dose and shorter course of levofloxacin, 528 outpatient and hospitalized adults with clinically and radiologically determined mild to severe community-acquired pneumonia were evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, prospective, multicenter study comparing levofloxacin 750 mg, IV or orally, every day for five days or levofloxacin 500 mg IV or orally, every day for 10 days.

Clinical success rates (cure plus improvement) in the clinically evaluable population were 90.9% in the levofloxacin 750 mg group and 91.1% in the levofloxacin 500 mg group. The 95% CI for the difference of response rates (levofloxacin 750 minus levofloxacin 500) was [-5.9, 5.4]. In the clinically evaluable population (31 to 38 days after enrollment) pneumonia was observed in 7 out of 151 patients in the levofloxacin 750 mg group and 2 out of 147 patients in the levofloxacin 500 mg group. Given the small numbers observed, the significance of this finding cannot be determined statistically. The microbiological efficacy of the 5-day regimen was documented for infections listed in Table 13.

### Tigecycline (Tygacil) [^111SN1oZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.3 Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia

TYGACIL was evaluated in adults for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) in two randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multinational, multicenter studies (Studies 1 and 2). These studies compared TYGACIL (100 mg intravenous initial dose followed by 50 mg every 12 hours) with levofloxacin (500 mg intravenous every 12 or 24 hours). In Study 1, after at least 3 days of intravenous therapy, a switch to oral levofloxacin (500 mg daily) was permitted for both treatment arms. Total therapy was 7 to 14 days. Patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia who required hospitalization and intravenous therapy were enrolled in the studies. The primary efficacy endpoint was the clinical response at the test of cure (TOC) visit in the co-primary populations of the clinically evaluable (CE) and clinical modified intent-to-treat (c-mITT) patients. See Table 8. Clinical cure rates at TOC by pathogen in the microbiologically evaluable patients are presented in Table 9.

To further evaluate the treatment effect of tigecycline, a post-hoc analysis was conducted in CABP patients with a higher risk of mortality, for whom the treatment effect of antibacterial drugs is supported by historical evidence. The higher-risk group included CABP patients from the two studies with any of the following factors:

Age ≥ 50 years
PSI score ≥ 3
Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia

The results of this analysis are shown in Table 10. Age ≥ 50 was the most common risk factor in the higher-risk group.

COVACTA

COVACTA was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to evaluate intravenous ACTEMRA 8 mg/kg in combination with SoC for the treatment of adult patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The study randomized 452 patients who were at least 18 years of age with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by a positive RT-PCR result, had pneumonia confirmed by radiography, and had oxygen saturation of 93% or lower on ambient air or a ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen of 300 mmHg or less. At baseline, 3% of patients were not on supplemental oxygen, 28% were on low flow oxygen, 30% were on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen, 38% were on invasive mechanical ventilation, and 22% were on corticosteroids. The primary efficacy endpoint was clinical status on Day 28 assessed on a 7-category ordinal scale that ranged from "discharged" to "death". There were no statistically significant differences observed in the distributions of clinical status on the 7-category ordinal scale at Day 28 when comparing the ACTEMRA arm to the placebo arm.

Mortality at Day 28 was 19.7% in the ACTEMRA arm versus 19.4% in the placebo arm (weighted difference (ACTEMRA arm - placebo arm): 0.3% [95% CI, -7.6 to 8.2]).

### Cefepime [^114Eg562]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Pneumonia

Cefepime for injection is indicated in the treatment of pneumonia (moderate to severe) caused by susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, including cases associated with concurrent bacteremia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Enterobacter species.

1.2 Empiric Therapy for Febrile Neutropenic Patients

Cefepime for injection as monotherapy is indicated for empiric treatment of febrile neutropenic patients. In patients at high risk for severe infection (including patients with a history of recent bone marrow transplantation, with hypotension at presentation, with an underlying hematologic malignancy, or with severe or prolonged neutropenia), antimicrobial monotherapy may not be appropriate. Insufficient data exist to support the efficacy of cefepime monotherapy in such patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

1.3 Uncomplicated and Complicated Urinary Tract Infections (including pyelonephritis)

Cefepime for injection is indicated in the treatment of uncomplicated and complicated urinary tract infections (including pyelonephritis) caused by susceptible isolates of Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae, when the infection is severe, or caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Proteus mirabilis, when the infection is mild to moderate, including cases associated with concurrent bacteremia with these bacteria.

1.4 Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections

Cefepime for injection is indicated in the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) or Streptococcus pyogenes.

1.5 Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections (used in combination with metronidazole)

Cefepime for injection is indicated in the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (used in combination with metronidazole) in adults caused by susceptible isolates of Escherichia coli, viridans group streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter species, or Bacteroides fragilis [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

1.6 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of cefepime for injection and other antibacterial drugs, cefepime for injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116BXe7N]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pneumococcal vaccination — sequencing and series completion for people with HIV: If PCV15 is used, administer a dose of PPSV23 at least 8 weeks later (AII); no additional pneumococcal vaccine doses are recommended. For people with HIV who previously started or completed a pneumococcal vaccination series, there is no need to restart the series. Adults who received PPSV23 before the age of 65 can be administered PCV21 or PCV20 at least 5 years after the last pneumococcal vaccine dose, whereas adults who received PPSV23 at age 65 or older do not require further doses of PPSV23 and their pneumococcal vaccination can be considered complete. Shared clinical decision-making is recommended regarding administration of PCV21 or PCV20 for immunocompromised persons aged ≥ 65 years who completed their vaccine series with both PCV13 and PPSV23; if a decision to administer PCV21 or PCV20 is made, it should be given at least 5 years after the last pneumococcal vaccine dose (CIII). Adults who previously received only PCV13 may receive one dose of PCV21 or PCV20 at least 1 year later (BIII), and adults who previously received PPSV23 may receive PCV21 or PCV20 (or PCV15 if the former are not available) at least 1 year after their last PPSV23 dose to complete their pneumococcal vaccination series (BIII).

### Ceftobiprole medocaril sodium (Zevtera) [^116wpkJp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Trial Design

The efficacy of ZEVTERA in the treatment of adult patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) was demonstrated in a randomized, controlled, double-blind, multinational, multicenter study (Trial 3) (NCT00326287). 638 adults hospitalized with CABP and requiring IV antibacterial treatment for at least 3 days were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, comparing ZEVTERA 667 mg (equivalent to 500 mg of ceftobiprole) IV every 8 hours to ceftriaxone (2 grams IV every 24 hours) with optional linezolid (600 mg IV every 12 hours) for the coverage of resistant gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Randomization was stratified by Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team (PORT) classification I to III versus IV to V, and by the need for adjunctive treatment with linezolid or matching placebo. The treatment duration was 5–14 days. No adjunctive macrolide therapy was allowed. A switch to oral cefuroxime (500 mg every 12 hours) was allowed after at least 72 hours of IV study treatment for patients who met stringent protocol-specified criteria for improvement and were candidates for hospital discharge.

The study enrolled adult patients hospitalized with CABP based on clinical signs and symptoms, fever and/or leukocytosis/leukopenia, and new radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltrates. Patients with known bronchial obstruction, pulmonary malignancies, cystic fibrosis, lung abscess, pleural effusion as the primary source of infection, active tuberculosis, or pneumonia known or suspected to be caused by atypical bacteria, were excluded from study participation, as were patients with known or suspected extrapulmonary complications such as concomitant meningitis, endocarditis, septic arthritis, or osteomyelitis.

The ITT primary analysis population comprised all patients randomized. The clinically evaluable (CE) population comprised patients in the ITT population who received at least 48 hours of study medication and met protocol-defined criteria regarding clinical evaluability.

The protocol-specified primary efficacy analyses included clinical cure rates at TOC visit, 7 to 14 days after the end-of-treatment (EOT) in the co-primary ITT and CE populations. The ITT population comprised 638 patients (314 ZEVTERA, 324 ceftriaxone ± linezolid), in 103 centers in the USA, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. The CE population comprised 469 patients, and the microbiological ITT (mITT) population comprised 184 patients with at least one valid baseline pathogen.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^115z9gBG]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pneumococcal vaccination in people with HIV — PCV/PPSV sequencing, CD4 thresholds, and evidence: Patients with CD4 counts ≥ 200 cells/mm3 should receive a dose of PPSV23 at least 8 weeks later (AII). While individuals with HIV with CD4 counts < 200 cells/mm3 can also be offered PPSV23 at least 8 weeks after receiving PCV15 (CIII) (such as if there are concerns with retention in care), PPSV23 should preferably be deferred until after an individual's CD4 count increases to > 200 cells/mm3 while on ART (BIII). Clinical evidence supporting use of PPSV23 in persons with CD4 counts < 200 cells/mm3 appears strongest in patients who also have HIV RNA < 100,000 copies/mL; evidence also suggests benefit for those who start ART before receiving PPSV vaccination. People with HIV who have received PCV13 but have not completed their recommended pneumococcal vaccine series with PPSV23, one dose of PCV20 may be used if PPSV23 is not available. If PCV20 is used, their pneumococcal vaccinations are complete (CIII). No clinical data exist for the use of PCV20 in people with HIV. A randomized trial of 7-valent PCV (PCV7) among adults with HIV in Malawi demonstrated 74% efficacy against vaccine-type IPD, with clear evidence of efficacy in those with CD4 counts < 200 cells/mm3; however, participants had recovered from IPD and received two doses of PCV7 four weeks apart, and findings may not be directly applicable to adults with HIV infection.

### Correlation analysis between clinical characteristics of adult patients with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia and 23S rRNA A2063 gene in alveolar lavage fluid [^112ZXfLu]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) is a common pathogen that causes community-acquired pneumonia through acute upper and lower respiratory tract inflammation and extrapulmonary complications through adhesion to host cells and direct cytotoxic effects. In China, Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) accounts for 20.65% and 2.78% of community-acquired pneumonia in adolescents and adults, respectively. Furthermore, its prevalence continues to surge, as highlighted by recent research. Macrolide antibiotics are the primary therapeutic agents for addressing Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP). However, an increasing number of cases of refractory Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (RMPP) have been reported, which is closely related to the increased resistance of Mycoplasma pneumoniae to macrolide antibiotics. Therefore, early identification of macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MRMP) is a positive guide for clinical treatment and disease prevention. Globally, the incidence of macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MRMP) infections surged from 18.2% in 2000 to 76.5% in 2019, with 96.8% of these cases linked to the A2063G mutation in the ribosomal 23S rRNA V region, as revealed by Kim et al. in 2022. In contrast to patients infected with macrolide-sensitive Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MSMP), patients infected with MRMP have a prolonged duration of illness, exacerbation of clinical symptoms, and an increased incidence of extrapulmonary complications. Currently, there is a scarcity of clinical investigations concerning MRMP infection; in particular, data on MPP in adults are even more scarce. The specific clinical symptoms, laboratory test results and imaging manifestations of changes associated with MRMP infection are still controversial, impeding the early identification of this pathogen. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the relationship between 23S rRNA V region A2063G drug resistance gene mutations in the alveolar lavage fluid of adult patients with MPP and clinical symptoms, laboratory data and imaging alterations to explore the feasibility of early recognition of MRMP infection in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease and to provide references and bases for the treatment of clinical MPP.

### Description and characterization of pneumococcal community acquired pneumonia (CAP) among radiologically confirmed CAP in outpatients [^115bWPCD]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a frequent and potentially severe disease whose prognosis requires appropriate management as soon as possible after diagnosis –. The diagnosis of a CAP is complex, based on the combination of non-specific clinical symptoms, radiological criteria, and laboratory markers. Multiple pathogens, including bacteria and viruses can cause CAP, both as single agent or in combination. In France and USA chest X-ray (CXR) is currently recommended to establish CAP diagnosis in primary care.

Prior to the advent of antibiotic therapy, 95% of hospitalized pneumonias were attributed to Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) –. Despite a decrease in its proportion, SP is still considered as the main causal agent of CAP in ambulatory settings, as well as in hospital settings –. The reported proportion of hospitalized CAP due to SP ranges between 5% in the USand 19% in Europe, but differences in study populations, periods, and settings, as well as differences in diagnostic testing methods likely contribute to significant variation in the proportions of reported pneumococcal CAP. In contrast, few studies have evaluated the proportion of pneumococcal etiology of CAP in outpatients.

In general practice, CAP is most often diagnosed at an early stage and the clinical signs traditionally described in hospital-based studies are rarely found in their entirety. Considering its potential severity, especially when the suspected causal agent is SP, it is important to identify as early as possible patients with probable pneumococcal CAP as they require prompt antibiotic treatment. However, Musher et al. raised also the question of limiting treatment to symptoms in certain situations, as many CAPs are thought to be of viral etiology. They proposed a strategy limited to monitoring and symptomatic treatment for patients with clinical signs of CAP, without risk factors for bacterial infection, with symptoms of upper airway infection, and without biological signs of infection.

In the present study, we aimed to analyze the prevalence and describe the characteristics of outpatients with radiologically confirmed pneumococcal CAP, managed in general practice in France.

### Association of metabolic syndrome and prognosis in elderly patients with community-acquired pneumonia [^114CqBUT]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly among older adults. Globally, CAP affects approximately 5 to 11 out of every 1,000 adults annually, with the incidence rising significantly with age. The growing aging population and the high burden of chronic comorbidities further compound the clinical and public health challenges of managing CAP in older adults.

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of interconnected cardiometabolic risk factors, including abdominal obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. Its prevalence has increased dramatically over the past decades, especially in older populations. Data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) indicate that approximately 33.38% of Chinese adults meet the criteria for MetS, and prevalence increases with age, reflecting a substantial proportion of elderly individuals at increased risk for poor health outcomes.

Emerging evidence suggests that MetS may adversely affect the prognosis of acute infections. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms — such as chronic low-grade inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, impaired innate immunity, and altered metabolic homeostasis — may contribute to increased susceptibility to infections and worsened outcomes. However, despite these potential links, the relationship between MetS and short-term prognosis in elderly patients hospitalized with CAP remains understudied and poorly understood.

Understanding the prognostic impact of MetS in this population is critical for early risk stratification and personalized management strategies. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the association between MetS and short-term clinical outcomes in elderly patients hospitalized with CAP. We hypothesized that the presence of MetS would be independently associated with increased short-term mortality in this population. The primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay and 30-day all-cause mortality. These outcomes were chosen to reflect both survival and short-term clinical burden in elderly CAP patients with and without MetS.

Evidence-to-Decision Tables

The methodology team provided transcribed versions of the EtDs of the selected WHO guidelines in GDT. The terms, definitions of data, and evidence tables included in each EtD framework are derived from the published WHO consolidated guidelines on TB with the addition of data for the percentages of participants for each outcome and the treatment effect estimates derived from the evidence tables and EtD tables, respectively. The analyses documented in the published WHO guidelines' EtD tables were used for the GRADE-ADOLOPMENT process with inclusion of intervention and control population numbers from corresponding evidence tables. Joint Panel members without a CoI reviewed the EtD tables derived from WHO EtD tables from corresponding PICO questions and recommendations and voted on the recommendations. As part of the ADOLOPMENT process, the Joint Panel critically appraised and evaluated the WHO guidelines on TB treatment, particularly focusing on the relevance of the EtD judgments in the context of low TB burden, high-resource settings, in contrast to the WHO's focus on higher TB burden, low-resource settings (reassessed EtDs are provided in Tables E1–E4 in the data supplement). The Joint Panel and methodology team revised the EtD tables transcribed from the WHO EtDs to reflect the Joint Panel reassessments of the judgments for each PICO. Recommendations were formulated and rated as either "strong" or "conditional" as explicit statements of recommendation strength as per GRADE guidance (Table 3). The term "we recommend" is used for a "strong" recommendation; "we conditionally recommend" is used for a "conditional" recommendation, analogous to "we suggest" used in the Joint Panel's 2016 and 2019 guidelines. The Joint Panel's recommendations are based on the quality of evidence, the balance between benefits and harms, the certainty of the evidence, and other factors. Sequential observational evidence was considered when published randomized controlled trial evidence was not available. All panel members without a declared CoI reviewed the EtD tables and recommendations and voted on the Joint Panel's recommendations. The Joint Panel and methodology team drafted the adapted guidelines EtDs and the document manuscript.

Clinical Trials Experience in Adult Patients with Unapproved Use of Hospital-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia and Ventilator-Associated Bacterial Pneumonia

ZEVTERA was evaluated in an active-controlled, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, phase 3 trial in patients with hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia/ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP) [TRIAL 4]. Although HABP/VABP are included in the safety data, the safety and effectiveness of ZEVTERA for the treatment of HABP/VABP have not been established and ZEVTERA is not approved for HABP or VABP.

In TRIAL 4, 386 patients received ZEVTERA 667 mg (equivalent to 500 mg of ceftobiprole) every 8 hours as a 2-hour IV infusion, and 386 patients were treated with ceftazidime 2 grams every 8 hours as a 2-hour IV infusion with or without linezolid 600 mg every 12 hours as a 1-hr infusion. The dose of ZEVTERA and ceftazidime were adjusted based on renal function.

The median age of patients treated with ZEVTERA was 62.5 years (range 18–95) with approximately 47% aged 65 years or older. Approximately 81% of the patients were White, most were outside of the United States (88%) and 72% were male. Patients across treatment arms received treatment for a median duration of 8 days.

### Pneumococcal carriage and disease in adults in england, 2011–2019: the importance of adults as a reservoir for pneumococcus in communities [^114uTYxw]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is caused by infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) and includes pneumonia, septicemia, and meningitis. More than 100 serotypes of S pneumoniae (characterized by polysaccharide capsule differences) have been identified.

Vaccine-type IPD declined in the United Kingdom (UK) following the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) into the national childhood immunization program. PCV7, targeting 7 serotypes (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, 23F), was introduced in 2006 and by 2009–2010 had reduced vaccine-type IPD in England and Wales by 98% in children aged < 2 years and by 81% in adults aged ≥ 65 years. However, several non-vaccine serotypes increased in frequency ("serotype replacement"). In 2010, PCV13, which targets an additional 6 serotypes (1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, 19A), replaced PCV7. PCV13 led to a significant reduction in vaccine-type IPD among all ages and by 2016–2017, despite the increases in non-vaccine-type IPD, total IPD across all ages was 37% lower than the pre-PCV7 period.

Reductions in IPD have occurred via direct protection of vaccinated children and indirect protection of all age groups through the ability of PCVs to reduce vaccine-type carriage and hence transmission. However, reductions in PCV13 vaccine-type IPD have plateaued in adults since 2013–2014, and PCV13 vaccine-type pneumonia remains common despite vaccination of adults aged ≥ 65 years (∼70% coverage) with a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) since 2005.

PCV15 (containing PCV13 serotypes and serotypes 22F and 33F) and PCV20 (containing PCV15 serotypes and serotypes 8, 10A, 11A, 12F, and 15B) have been licensed for use in the UK, and in June 2023 the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation advised that either PCV20 or PPSV23 could be used for the adult pneumococcal program in the future.

The prevalent paradigm is that carriage occurs most commonly in young children and that transmission is almost entirely driven from this age cohort to other age cohorts. How carriage in children relates to carriage in adults, and adult IPD, is less well understood. We aimed to compare carriage and IPD serotype distributions for children and adults in England and relate these to IPD and estimated carriage serotype distributions in older adults, to better understand adult carriage and potential benefits of higher-valency PCV introduction to adults.

### Study design consideration in inhaled corticosteroid dose and adverse events [^1132yYku]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

We read with interest the article by Bloom and colleagues published in a recent issue of the Journal on the association between inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) and the frequency of adverse events, notably the significant risks associated with medium to high doses of ICSs, particularly concerning cardiovascular diseases and pneumonia. Although this study contributes valuable insights, several issues warrant further discussion.

First, the article defines high doses of ICSs as those exceeding 600 μg/d (0.6 mg/d). However, Lipworth's review highlights that marked adrenal suppression occurs at doses above 1.5 mg/d (0.75 mg/d for fluticasone propionate). It is unclear whether patients receiving high doses of ICSs in the study may have exceeded this threshold. Therefore, we recommend looking into doses that exceed 600 μg/d to ensure that adrenal suppression associated with high doses of ICSs are thoroughly investigated in the future research.

Second, the study does not address certain potential confounders that could significantly impact the findings. For instance, chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis are established risk factors for pneumonia. The omission of these conditions as confounding variables may introduce bias, potentially overestimating the association between ICSs and pneumonia.

Third, although ICSs are widely used in pediatric asthma management, this study focuses solely on adult populations, excluding patients under 18 years of age. Limited research has explored the association between ICS use and the frequency of cardiovascular and pulmonary adverse effects in children. A subgroup analysis could provide valuable insights into this area. The long-term safety implications of ICS use in pediatric patients, particularly concerning these adverse effects, warrant further investigation.

In conclusion, the article by Bloom and colleagues provides valuable insights into the frequency of potential adverse events associated with ICS use in adults, contributing to better asthma management. However, several issues remain unresolved, including the risk of adrenal suppression at high ICS doses, the association between ICS use and pneumonia without accounting for confounders such as chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis, and the potential cardiovascular and pulmonary adverse effects in pediatric asthma. We look forward to the authors addressing these important concerns in future research.

### Ritlecitinib (Litfulo) [^1119ivSp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Serious Infections

Serious infections have been reported in patients receiving LITFULO. The most frequent serious infections have been appendicitis, COVID-19 infection (including pneumonia), and sepsis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Among opportunistic infections, multi-dermatomal herpes zoster was reported with LITFULO.

Avoid use of LITFULO in patients with an active, serious infection. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating LITFULO in patients:

with chronic or recurrent infection
who have been exposed to TB
with a history of serious infection or an opportunistic infection
who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic TB or mycoses, or
with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection

Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with LITFULO. Interrupt LITFULO if a patient develops a serious or opportunistic infection. A patient who develops a new infection during treatment with LITFULO should undergo prompt and complete diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised patient, appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be initiated, and the patient should be closely monitored. LITFULO may be resumed once the infection is controlled.

Tuberculosis

Screen patients for tuberculosis (TB) before starting therapy. LITFULO should not be given to patients with active TB. Anti-TB therapy should be started prior to initiating therapy with LITFULO in patients with a new diagnosis of latent TB or previously untreated latent TB. In patients with a negative latent TB test, consider anti-TB therapy before initiating treatment with LITFULO in those at high risk and consider screening patients at high risk for TB during treatment with LITFULO.

Viral Reactivation

Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), was reported in clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. If a patient develops herpes zoster, consider interrupting treatment until the episode resolves.

Screening for viral hepatitis should be performed in accordance with clinical guidelines before starting therapy with LITFULO. Patients with evidence of HIV infection or hepatitis B or C infection were excluded from clinical trials.

5.2	Mortality

In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study of another JAK inhibitor in RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, a higher rate of all-cause mortality, including sudden cardiovascular death, was observed in patients treated with the JAK inhibitor compared with TNF blockers. Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with LITFULO.

### Unmet needs and research gaps in Still's disease across ages: proceedings from a pediatric and adult joint expert panel [^115WMXeB]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite all these similarities, there is still a wide variability in the diagnostic and therapeutic approach between pediatric and adult centers. It is crucial for clinicians to share their respective experiences in the management of children and adults with SD, in order to develop more effective and timely strategies.

To this end, an expert meeting, including pediatric and adult rheumatologists, was held in Rome, Italy, in February 2023. The following topics were discussed: (1) early recognition and diagnosis of SD; (2) pathogenetic pathways and possible biomarkers for diagnosis and response; (3) refractory disease and risk factors; and (4) treatment of SD and its complications. This manuscript reports the clinical experiences of clinicians who manage SD in pediatric and adult patients, based on the most recent literature updates and on the discussions over the course of this two-day meeting. The objective was to provide an overview of the major clinical challenges and unmet needs in SD across ages, with the goal of improving disease management in both the pediatric and adult setting.

### Evaluating the antibiotic spectrum index in a stewardship-focused clinical trial for childhood pneumonia [^115mBHxo]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute respiratory illness is the most common reason children receive antibiotics overall, and pneumonia, specifically, is responsible for more days of antibiotic use in U.S. children's hospitals than any other condition. – Despite national guidelines for pneumonia recommending narrow-spectrum amoxicillin for most children, broader-spectrum antibiotics are often prescribed. Pneumonia is an important target for initiatives promoting appropriate and judicious antibiotic use. A variety of interventions, including local practice guidelines, clinical decision support (CDS), care pathways, and formal antimicrobial stewardship programs and other activities have been studied with varying success. – These studies most often report stewardship outcome measures such as guideline-concordance or days of therapy (DOT) per 1000 patient days. – While useful, these measures may fail to capture important differences in the stewardship context.

The Antibiotic Spectrum Index (ASI) was developed specifically to evaluate antibiotic use through a stewardship lens. The ASI quantifies antibiotic exposure based on spectrum of activity against clinically important bacterial pathogens (scores ranging from 1–13 for each antibiotic). In their index publication, Gerber and colleagues demonstrated how ASI detected differences in prescribing resulting from a new stewardship intervention that was otherwise missed by DOT per 1000 patient days. To date, several constructs of the ASI have been applied in neonatal, pediatric, and adult populations, largely in retrospective studies. To our knowledge, the ASI has not been evaluated in the context of a clinical trial as a potential outcome measure.

The Improving Care for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (ICECAP) Antibiotic CDS Trial was a two-site pragmatic randomized, usual care-controlled clinical trial that tested the effectiveness of CDS for improving guideline-concordant antibiotic prescribing in children of all ages presenting to the emergency department (ED) with pneumonia. Our objective was to examine the ASI as an exploratory outcome measure using data previously collected from the ICECAP trial.

### Cost-effectiveness of rapid, ICU-based, syndromic PCR in hospital-acquired pneumonia: analysis of the INHALE WP3 multi-centre RCT [^116zmuHN]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is defined as pneumonia arising > 48 h after admission. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is pneumonia that arises over 48 h after endotracheal intubation. These infections occur in between 5 and 40% of ICU patients, leading to 10–50% increased mortality.

HAP and VAP can be caused by various bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Routine characterisation of these organisms takes 48 to 72 h. Until then, HAP/VAP patients are given broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics, refined once microbiology results become available. Rapid multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests can expedite this process, as well as offering improved sensitivity. In principle, these faster, more accurate, results might improve patient treatment and outcomes. They may also facilitate improved antibiotic stewardship. A growing literature indicates that these tests perform well in terms of identifying key pathogens and antibiotic resistance. However, further evidence of their impact in clinical practice is required to inform implementation decisions.

### All-cause and pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia hospitalizations among adults in Tennessee and Georgia [^115CZYDR]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Limitations

Our study findings need to be interpreted in light of several limitations. First, there was variability in incidence estimates between enrollment sites and across the study years. While the COVID-19 pandemic and the response to the pandemic likely played a partial role in the variations in hospitalizations for CAP and pneumococcal pneumonia over time, specific reasons for the differences in disease incidence observed between enrollment sites, including potential changes in recruitment activities or changes in health care seeking behaviors in the underlying populations, require additional examination. Second, incidence calculations were derived from enrollments performed at surveillance hospitals in large catchment areas and required assumptions about similarity of patients and hospitalizations between enrollment hospitals and other hospitals that provided health care to residents in the catchment areas. Third, determining the etiology of pneumonia remains challenging and the majority of adult pneumonias do not have a clear etiology determined. Although the project implemented systematic testing using novel urinary assays that allow detection of pneumococcal etiology through detection of a large number of specific pneumococcal serotypes, the assays did not cover all serotypes so the representation of pneumococcal etiology among patients with pneumonia remains incomplete. Furthermore, while available cultures of lower respiratory tract specimens and blood were included in the assessment of pneumococcal etiology overall, those were not included in serotype specific analyses. Few blood cultures could be serotyped and other positive cultures were not serotyped. Of note, when isolates were obtained and serotyped from blood cultures, those detections had a very high agreement with those from urinary assay detections. Finally, the study was conducted at large hospitals in urban centers in 2 US states with patients representing certain demographic, immunization and medical characteristics. Moreover, not all screened and eligible patients agreed to participate and enrolled in the study. Thus, extrapolation of our findings to other settings or populations needs to consider this potential caveat.

### Evaluating the antibiotic spectrum index in a stewardship-focused clinical trial for childhood pneumonia [^112hoV56]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective:

The antibiotic spectrum index (ASI) outcome quantifies antibiotic exposure based on spectrum of activity. Our objective was to examine ASI as an exploratory outcome in the context of a recent stewardship-focused, clinical trial in childhood pneumonia that originally used a binary guideline-concordant outcome.

Design:

Secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial.

Setting:

Two tertiary pediatric hospitals.

Methods:

Encounters were randomly assigned to clinical decision support (CDS) or usual care treatment arm. The ASI was calculated by summing daily ASI scores for each unique antibiotic administered. It was evaluated as a continuous and ordinal measure: No Antibiotics (ASI = 0), Narrow (1–2), Intermediate (3–4), Broad (5–7), and Very Broad (≥ 8). Proportional odds regression modeled the ordinal ASI outcome in the first 24 hours by treatment arm and compared to the guideline-concordance outcome. Results were stratified by emergency department (ED) disposition. We also conducted a longitudinal, descriptive analysis of day-to-day ASI for those with in-hospital dispositions.

Results:

We included 1027 encounters, 549 (53%) were randomized to CDS and 478 (47%) usual care respectively. ASI Category did not differ by treatment arm overall (Odds Ratio: 0.88[95% Confidence Interval: 0.70,1.09]), which mirrored binary guideline-concordance. Mean ASI was lower for concordant encounters (2.1 vs 8.4, P < 0.001) and across all ED dispositions. In the longitudinal analysis, there were 1137 day-to-day ASI comparisons, with only 7% representing spectrum escalations.

Conclusions:

The ASI outcome yielded similar results to a dichotomous concordance outcome. However, ASI provided more granular insights into antibiotic prescribing, suggesting ASI may be a useful outcome measure in future stewardship-focused trials.

### Patient information: community-acquired pneumonia… [^1173MLCC]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Dao TH, Jackson CD. What Is Community-Acquired Pneumonia. JAMA. 2025; 333:

442. doi: 10.1001/jama.2024.22251 Community-acquired pneumonia is a lung infection that is contracted outside of a hospital. In the US, CAP results in about 1. 4 million emergency department visits, 740 000 hospitalizations, and 41 108 deaths each year. Mortality after hospitalization for CAP is 2. 8% for adults younger than 60 years and
26. 8% for those aged 60 years or older who have multiple medical conditions.

1. Risk factors for CAP include older age, cigarette smoking, chronic lung diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and other chronic conditions, such as HIV, cancer, diabetes, and heavy alcohol use. CAP can be caused by a variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, although the pathogen is often not identified. Among hospitalized patients with CAP, the most common causes are viruses and the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Symptoms of CAP may include fever, chills, cough with or without sputum, shortness of breath, chest pain, confusion, and fatigue. Patients are diagnosed with CAP if they have signs and symptoms of CAP and chest imaging findings consistent with pneumonia. All patients with suspected CAP should have chest imaging. Chest x-ray is often the initial type of imaging, and if it does not reveal CAP, chest computed tomography should be considered. All patients with CAP should be tested for influenza and COVID-19 if these viruses are circulating in the community. Additional testing of sputum and blood cultures should be performed only in patients with severe CAP or those with risk factors for resistant bacteria.

For outpatients, suspected bacterial CAP is typically treated with a 3-day course of oral antibiotics or combination oral antibiotics for those with multiple medical conditions. Hospitalized patients with suspected bacterial CAP should receive intravenous antibiotics for at least 3 days. Hospitalized patients with severe CAP should also receive steroids. Patients with severe CAP should be closely monitored and treated in an intensive care unit. Those who develop respiratory failure may need mechanical ventilation. Medications to increase blood pressure should be used for patients with CAP who develop shock. People with a prior episode of CAP are at increased risk of CAP and should be advised about smoking and alcohol cessation and relevant vaccinations.

Vaccination for pneumococcal pneumonia, influenza, COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus can help prevent or decrease the severity of CAP, especially in older adults or those with chronic medical conditions such as heart disease, asthma, COPD, HIV, or cancer. People with prior CAP should also be advised to brush their teeth daily and have routine dental cleanings. Patients with swallowing problems should be counseled about behaviors to decrease the risk of aspiration, such as taking small bites of food and sitting upright while eating and for 30 minutes after meals.

### Tocilizumab (tocilizumab-anoh) [^116YGgia]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Serious Infections

Serious and sometimes fatal infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, protozoal, or other opportunistic pathogens have been reported in patients receiving immunosuppressive agents including tocilizumab products. The most common serious infections included pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cellulitis, herpes zoster, gastroenteritis, diverticulitis, sepsis and bacterial arthritis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, cryptococcus, aspergillosis, candidiasis, and pneumocystosis were reported with tocilizumab products. Other serious infections, not reported in clinical studies, may also occur (e.g., histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, listeriosis). Patients have presented with disseminated rather than localized disease, and were often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids which in addition to rheumatoid arthritis may predispose them to infections.

Do not administer Tocilizumab-anoh in patients with an active infection, including localized infections. The risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to initiating Tocilizumab-anoh in patients:

with chronic or recurrent infection;
who have been exposed to tuberculosis;
with a history of serious or an opportunistic infection;
who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or
with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection.

Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Tocilizumab-anoh, as signs and symptoms of acute inflammation may be lessened due to suppression of the acute phase reactants [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Patient Counseling Information (17)].

Hold Tocilizumab-anoh if a patient develops a serious infection, an opportunistic infection, or sepsis. A patient who develops a new infection during treatment with Tocilizumab-anoh should undergo a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an immunocompromised patient, initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and closely monitor the patient.

COVID-19

In patients with COVID-19, monitor for signs and symptoms of new infections during and after treatment with Tocilizumab-anoh. There is limited information regarding the use of tocilizumab products in patients with COVID-19 and concomitant active serious infections. The risks and benefits of treatment with Tocilizumab-anoh in COVID-19 patients with other concurrent infections should be considered.

### Dynamically monitoring pneumonia severity scores to predict the prognosis in patients with community-acquired pneumonia: an international, multicenter cohort study [^111CFSEU]. Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Traditional pneumonia severity scores are widely used at treatment initiation to stratify disease severity and predict prognosis. Although they can be reassessed during treatment to evaluate disease progression, their predictive accuracy remains suboptimal. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel machine learning algorithm that quantifies continuous disease progression, enhancing real-time evaluation of treatment efficacy and outcome prediction in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Methods

We analyzed 2052 CAP patients from China and 1862 from Japan. CURB-65 and pneumonia severity index (PSI) scores were recorded at admission and 72 h post-treatment. To quantify disease progression, we developed a new algorithm, Mortality Vector Optimization (MVO), which measures the similarity between a patient's condition and critical states within severity scoring systems. Model discrimination was assessed using the C-index and AUC, while calibration was evaluated with Brier scores. External validation was conducted using the GOSSIS-1-eICU and SCRIPT CarpeDiem datasets.

Results

MVO demonstrated superior predictive performance compared to nine established machine learning models. In the derivation cohort, MVO achieved a C-index of 0.734 and AUC of 0.825 for PSI, while in the GOSSIS-1-eICU dataset, it reached a C-index of 0.850 and AUC of 0.870. The trend score derived from MVO effectively captured disease progression, with hazard ratios of 2.63 (for CURB-65) and 2.50 (for PSI) in predicting in-hospital mortality.

Conclusion

The trend score provides a dynamic and reliable method for monitoring early treatment effectiveness in CAP. MVO offers enhanced predictive accuracy and holds potential for broader applications in disease prognosis assessment.

### Immunogenicity, safety and adverse events of sequential vaccination with a 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) and PPSV23 compared with PPSV23 alone in systemic lupus erythematosus [^113DAUGf]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with SLE have an immune dysfunction like lymphopenia, neutrophil function defects, reduced complement levels and altered cytokine profile. Due to immune dysregulation, patients with SLE are at an inherently increased risk of infections. In addition, most patients are on immunosuppressive treatment which further puts them at an increased risk of infections. Invasive pneumococcal infections have been shown to be more common in patients with SLE than the general adult population in studies from developed countries with an incidence rate of 201–236/100 000 person-years. In a recent Indian study of 1354 patients, 439 serious infections were recorded in 339 patients (61.6 per 1000 person-years' follow-up). Of these, 20 patients had infection due to Streptococcus pneumoniae. A recent nested case–control study from the UK has shown that pneumococcal vaccination in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases protects against hospitalisation and death due to pneumonia.

A systematic review and meta-analysis that included 14 studies on the immunogenicity of pneumococcal vaccine in patients with SLE suggested that there are only low-quality data on response to vaccine in patients with lupus. American College of Rheumatology/European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (ACR/EULAR) guidelines recommend universal pneumococcal vaccination in patients with SLE. The EULAR guidelines of 2019 recommend sequential vaccination with a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13), followed by a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23), while the ACR 2022 guidelines recommend following current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for adult vaccination.

In a large study from South India, in patients with invasive pneumococcal disease, a total of 408 isolates were obtained over a period of 11 years. Serotypes 1, 3, 5, 19F, 8, 14, 23F, 4, 19A and 6B were the common serotypes in invasive pneumococcal disease, with serotype 1 being the most common. Studies from India have shown the efficacy and immunogenicity of the sequential vaccine using a 13-valent conjugate vaccine in children aged 6–17 years and adults aged 50–65 years, as these groups are more susceptible to invasive pneumococcal disease.

Treatment of Hospital-acquired and Ventilator-associated Bacterial Pneumonia Caused by Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus Complex Organisms

A total of 177 hospitalized adults with documented Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex infections were randomized and treated in a multicenter, active-controlled, investigator-unblinded, independent assessor-blinded, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial (Trial 1, NCT03894046). Patients were treated with either XACDURO (1 g sulbactam and 1 g durlobactam, or renally adjusted dose) intravenously over 3 hours every 6 hours (n = 91) or colistin 2.5 mg/kg (or renally adjusted dose) intravenously over 30 minutes every 12 hours after an initial loading dose of colistin 2.5 to 5 mg/kg (n = 86). Both treatment arms also received 1 g imipenem/1 g cilastatin (or renally adjusted dose) intravenously every 6 hours as background therapy for potential HABP/VABP pathogens other than Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex. Patients received up to 14 days of therapy.

The primary efficacy endpoint for the study was 28-day all-cause mortality in the patients who received any amount of study medication with a confirmed baseline infection with carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex (CRABC microbiologically modified intent to treat (m-MITT) population). Among 128 patients in the CRABC m-MITT population, 125 patients who did not withdraw consent prior to assessment of survival status at Day 28 were assessed: 63 patients in the XACDURO group and 62 patients in the colistin group.

### All-cause and pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia hospitalizations among adults in Tennessee and Georgia [^115x6qaW]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Methods

This cross-sectional study is part of the ongoing Pneumococcal Pneumonia Epidemiology, Urine serotyping and Mental Outcomes (PNEUMO) program, a multicenter, prospective, active surveillance study designed to examine the epidemiology of hospitalizations for CAP among adults. PNEUMO is coordinated by Vanderbilt University Medical Center and encompasses the following enrolling hospitals: Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Nashville, Tennessee), Emory University Hospital (Atlanta, Georgia), and Emory Midtown Hospital (Atlanta, Georgia). The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional review boards of Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Emory University. This study report followed the recommendations of the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

Selection Criteria and Enrollment

The selection criteria and enrollment in the PNEUMO study have been previously described. In brief, at each participating hospital, adults hospitalized (inpatient or observation status) with clinical and radiographic evidence of CAP were prospectively identified and approached for enrollment. Trained study personnel enrolled adult patients aged 18 years old who provided informed consent to participate and who met eligibility criteria: hospitalized or in observation status with a clinical syndrome consistent with acute lower respiratory tract infection, radiographical evidence compatible with pneumonia, and ability to provide a urine sample. Patients who developed pneumonia 48 hours or later from hospital admission were excluded (enrollment and selection criteria details available in eMethods in Supplement 1).

Patients enrolled between September 1, 2018, and October 31, 2022, were included in this analysis. During the emergence of COVID-19, a temporary enrollment pause occurred at each site due to pandemic social distancing restrictions. The enrollment pause at Vanderbilt occurred between September 1, 2020, and October 31, 2020, and at the 2 Emory hospitals between March 11, 2020, and January 5, 2021. To enable the calculation of population-based incidence, this analysis was restricted to patients enrolled in the PNEUMO study who resided in defined catchment areas for each of the enrolling sites. For Vanderbilt, the catchment area was comprised of 9 Tennessee counties, including Davidson County, where Vanderbilt Hospital is located. For the Emory Hospitals, the catchment area was comprised of 8 Georgia counties, including DeKalb County, where the Emory surveillance hospitals are located (eMethods in Supplement 1).

### Guidelines development group for the British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the diagnosis and management of cholangiocarcinoma [^114qBjLE]. Gut (2025). Medium credibility.

We have recently published in Gut the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidelines for the diagnosis and management of cholangiocarcinoma. In the guidelines we recommended cisplatin plus gemcitabine (CisGem) chemotherapy as first-line systemic treatment in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC), and that immunotherapy may be added to CisGem chemotherapy if approved and available (Recommendation 39). A few weeks after the guidelines were published, the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence approved and recommended the use of durvalumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin as an option for treating locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic BTC in adults, and we believe this triple combination should be first line. This was also approved by the Scottish Medicines Consortium in November 2023 and thus represents a new standard of care for cholangiocarcinoma treatment, but this is not specifically mentioned in the latest published BSG guidelines.

Furthermore, at the time of publication of the BSG guidelines, there was little consensus as to the frequency of clinical follow-up following resection for cholangiocarcinoma. However, as patients are at risk of complications related to treatment, as well as the high rate of cholangiocarcinoma recurrence, follow-up is carried out in practice by most centres. Following the recent publication of the ESMO Guidelines Committee's Clinical Practice Guideline for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of BTC, we also now recommend that follow-up is undertaken following cholangiocarcinoma-resection, and this may consist of 3 to 6-monthly visits during the first 2 years and 6 to 12-monthly visits for up to 5 years, or as clinically indicated. A combination of clinical examination, laboratory investigations, tumour markers and CT scan of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis may be appropriate.

These updates have been endorsed by all authors on the guideline writing panel as well as the Liver Committee of the BSG. We request that these important updates, via this letter, be linked to the online BSG guidelines for the diagnosis and management of cholangiocarcinoma.

### Evaluating the antibiotic spectrum index in a stewardship-focused clinical trial for childhood pneumonia [^11412j1x]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Application of the ASI as an ordinal construct in a prior stewardship-focused clinical trial demonstrated similar overall results to the trial's primary dichotomous outcome, while also providing a more nuanced, semi-quantitative view of antibiotic use. The ASI is a potentially useful outcome measure for future clinical trials and antibiotic stewardship interventions.

Importantly, the ASI provided evidence of intervention effects that were obscured by the trial's concordance outcome. An example of this, we noted an increased proportion of narrow-spectrum antibiotic use in outpatient encounters compared to no antibiotic use, a difference only revealed after applying the ASI. This is attributed to the construction of our ordinal categories where we opted to include no antibiotics as its own treatment strategy opposed to guideline-concordance. Although guideline-concordant treatment for pneumonia includes no antibiotics as well as narrow spectrum, it does not inherently distinguish the difference between these two strategies.

An advantage of the ASI is its ability to quantify antibiotic exposure by spectrum within a single, ordinal, or continuous measure. For example, among guideline-concordant encounters in the trial, ASI captured important differences in prescribing by ED disposition, illustrating that outpatients most often received narrow-spectrum therapy or no antibiotics while those in the ICU were most often broad spectrum, despite all being considered guideline-concordant. Similarly, comparing ASI between concordant and discordant encounters provided insights not apparent in the concordance outcome. The ASI may be particularly useful, then, for measuring antibiotic use for specific conditions when treatment strategies are expected to vary due to differences across levels of care, institutions, or patient sub-populations.

The ASI appears advantageous when employed to evaluate a specific antibiotic indication in a stewardship context. This score lends itself well specifically to pneumonia because most cases of pneumonia can be safely treated with a beta-lactam (ASI 2) when the etiology is presumed to be bacterial or no antibiotics (ASI 0) when it is presumed to be viral. Only under certain scenarios would broader antibiotics be recommended such as ceftriaxone (ASI 5) or ampicillin-sulbactam (ASI 6). The ASI could be applied to other infectious etiologies with the first line treatment strategy favors narrower spectrum use such as acute otitis media, skin and soft tissue infections, and UTIs.

### Diagnostic stewardship of procalcitonin testing by implementation of computer-based decision support [^114fVdLR]. Laboratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Appropriate test utilization strategies are paramount in preventing the overuse of antibiotics, which can contribute to antimicrobial resistance. Biomarkers such as procalcitonin (PCT) are frequently ordered upon suspicion of infection, but current pneumonia and sepsis guidelines recommend against using PCT alone when initiating antibiotic therapy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of standardized, guideline-based computerized decision support in curbing the inappropriate ordering of PCT testing.

Methods

This study was a retrospective, single-center cohort of hospitalized adult patients with at least 1 available PCT serum level over a 27-month period. Secondary outcomes included the total number of PCT orders, the number of days on antibiotics, and the appropriate antibiotic response rate based on the PCT result.

Results

A total of 300 patients met our inclusion criteria for this study. The rate of appropriate PCT ordering increased in the postimplementation group (2% vs 10%), with an increased rate of appropriate ordering in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (4.3% vs 18.4%) and no change in patients with sepsis (0% vs 3.3%). Overall, PCT orders dropped by 78% after implementation of decision support.

Discussion

This study demonstrated that the addition of guideline-based computerized clinical decision support increased the rate of diagnostic stewardship for PCT orders.

### For clinicians and public… [^114MSieU]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What to know
- Respiratory infections caused by the bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniaehave increased in the United States, especially in young children.
- Healthcare providers should consider M. pneumoniaeas a cause of pneumonia and test when indicated.
- Macrolides are the first-line treatment for this infection. Some first-line antibiotics used to treat pneumonia, like penicillin, will not treat M. pneumoniae. Summary What CDC knows Bacterial infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae increased in the United States since late spring and have remained high. The proportion of patients discharged from emergency departments with a diagnosis of M. pneumoniae-associated pneumonia or acute bronchitis has been increasing over the past six months, peaking in late August. What CDC is doing CDC is closely tracking the recent rise in M.

pneumoniae infections using various surveillance tools to better understand any differences in demographics, severity of illness, and outcomes as compared to M. pneumoniae infections prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. CDC is also reaching out to healthcare providers and health departments to raise awareness of increasing M. pneumoniae infections and working to monitor for antibiotic resistance. M. pneumoniae are bacteria that may cause pneumonia Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of mild respiratory illness. Since late spring, the number of infections caused by M. pneumoniae has been increasing, especially among young children. This differs from published studies in previous years, when most infections were observed among school-aged children and adolescents. While uncommon, serious complications from infection can occur that require hospital care, including new or worsening asthma, severe pneumonia, and encephalitis. M.

pneumoniae is a common cause of bacterial infection among people who need hospital care due to community-acquired pneumonia. M. pneumoniae infections can occur at any age, but they most often occur among children ages 5–17 years and young adults. Younger children may have different symptoms. Diagnoses increased among all age groups, particularly young children M. pneumoniae infections are common, with an estimated 2 million infections occurring each year in the United States. However, the true number of people affected every year is unknown as there's no national reporting or dedicated surveillance system to track these infections. M. pneumoniae infections may occur more often in summer and early fall. In 2023, M. pneumoniae began to re-emerge globally, after a prolonged period of low incidence of infections since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

CDC routinely monitors emergency department care of people with pneumonia and other respiratory diseases. So far in 2024, CDC has seen an increase in the percentage of pneumonia-associated emergency department visits with a discharge diagnosis of M. pneumoniae. The M. pneumoniae discharge diagnosis data from March 31 through October 5, 2024, show an increase among all age groups across the United States, peaking in August, and remaining high. The increase, however, was highest among children. The percentage grew from 1. 0% to
7. 2% among children ages 2–4 years and from 3. 6% to
7. 4% among children ages 5–17 years in that time frame. The increase in children ages 2–4 years is notable because M. pneumoniae historically hasn't been recognized as a leading cause of pneumonia in this age group. CDC is also able to look at data showing how frequently patients are testing positive for. M. pneumoniae. These data show that test positivity for *M.

### Ceftazidime, avibactam (Avycaz) [^111XUcB4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AVYCAZ and it was not powered for a statistical analysis of efficacy. At the TOC visit, which occurred 8 to 15 days after the last dose of study drug, a favorable clinical response was defined as a resolution of all acute signs and symptoms of cUTI or improvement to such an extent that no further antimicrobial therapy was required. A favorable microbiological response at the TOC was defined as eradication of baseline uropathogen(s) from the urine culture.

A summary of clinical, microbiological and combined response at TOC by treatment group for the micro-ITT population is provided in Table 22.

The microbiologic response rate for E.coli, the most common uropathogen identified in the study, was 79.6% for patients treated with AVYCAZ and 59.1% for patients treated with cefepime.

14.3 Hospital-acquired Bacterial Pneumonia and Ventilator-ass ociat ed Bacterial Pneumonia

A total of 870 hospitalized adults with HABP/VABP were randomized and received trial medications in a multinational, multi-center, double-blind trial comparing AVYCAZ 2.5 grams (ceftazidime 2 grams and avibactam 0.5 grams) intravenously every 8 hours to meropenem 1 gram intravenously every 8 hours for 7 to 14 days of therapy. Study medication dosages were adjusted per renal function. The protocol allowed for administration of prior and concomitant systemic antibacterial therapy.

Clinical efficacy was evaluated in the intent-to treat (ITT) population, which included all randomized patients who received study drug. The median age was 66 years and 74.1% were male. The median APACHE II score was 14. The majority of patients were from China (33.1%) and Eastern Europe (25.5%). There were no patients enrolled within the United States. Less than 1.0% of patients were of Pacific Island or African descent. Overall, 379 (43.6%) patients were ventilated at enrollment, including 290 (33.3%) patients with VABP and 89 (10.2%) with ventilated HABP. Bacteremia at baseline was present in 4.8% of patients.

WARNING: RISK OF SERIOUS INFECTIONS

Patients treated with tocilizumab products including Tocilizumab-anoh are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids.

If a serious infection develops, interrupt Tocilizumab-anoh until the infection is controlled. Reported infections include:

Active tuberculosis, which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Patients, except those with COVID-19, should be tested for latent tuberculosis before Tocilizumab-anoh use and during therapy. Treatment for latent infection should be initiated prior to Tocilizumab-anoh use.
Invasive fungal infections, including candidiasis, aspergillosis, and pneumocystis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease.
Bacterial, viral and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens.

The risks and benefits of treatment with Tocilizumab-anoh should be carefully considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection.

Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Tocilizumab-anoh, including the possible development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
