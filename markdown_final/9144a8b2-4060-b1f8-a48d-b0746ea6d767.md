## Question

A patient filed a medical malpractice action against a hospital in federal court, alleging that hospital staff had failed to diagnose the patient's cancer based on an X-ray that had been taken at the hospital. The patient's cancer was diagnosed six months later, based on the same X-ray, when the patient sought a second opinion. In the interim, the cancer had spread. Fact and expert discovery have been completed in the action. The hospital has moved for summary judgment. In support of its motion, the hospital has submitted a memorandum identifying facts that it claims are not in dispute. It has also cited and attached supporting exhibits, including a report from the hospital's radiologist, who found no signs of cancer on the X-ray. What is the best way for the patient to raise a genuine dispute of material fact?

Answer Choices:
A. Submit a report from the patient's expert radiologist contradicting the findings in the report of the hospital's radiologist.
B. Submit an affidavit from the patient's attorney detailing his conversations with the patient's expert radiologist.
C. Submit an affidavit from the patient's expert radiologist with findings that contradict the report of the hospital's radiologist.
D. Submit the patient's medical records showing the patient's current cancer diagnosis.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option best creates a genuine dispute of material fact to defeat a hospital's motion for summary judgment in a failure-to-diagnose cancer case based on an allegedly missed finding on an X-ray. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the legal standard for summary judgment and what constitutes a "genuine dispute of material fact". Then, I should verify which evidentiary forms are admissible and persuasive in federal court for expert opinion. Next, I will examine how each answer choice fares against that standard, including hearsay, foundation, and materiality. Finally, I will confirm the best choice and briefly note why the alternatives fail, anchoring the analysis in federal civil procedure and expert testimony principles.

> Let me first confirm the legal standard. Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; a "genuine dispute" exists when the evidence would allow a reasonable jury to find for the nonmovant, and "material" means the fact could affect the outcome of the case, so I need to ensure the patient's response presents admissible evidence that creates a factual conflict on a point that matters to liability, such as whether the original radiologist breached the standard of care by missing a visible malignancy on the X-ray [^notfound].

> Next, I should review what kind of evidence is needed here. The central issue is a professional negligence claim requiring expert testimony on the standard of care, breach, and causation; lay evidence about the current diagnosis won't establish whether the original interpretation was negligent, so I need an expert radiologist's opinion that the cancer was detectable on the original X-ray and that a competent radiologist should have identified it, which directly disputes the hospital's assertion that no signs were present at the time [^75458f73] [^16a7b3d0].

> Now, I will examine Option A, a report from the patient's expert radiologist. Wait, let me verify admissibility: a standalone report is generally hearsay and lacks the foundation of personal knowledge unless the expert is available for cross-examination, so while the substance may be correct, it is vulnerable to objection on evidentiary grounds and may be excluded absent the expert's affidavit or testimony, which means it may not suffice to create a genuine dispute by itself in this posture [^notfound].

> I will now examine Option B, an attorney affidavit about conversations with the expert. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: an attorney's affidavit recounting what an expert said is double hearsay and not admissible to prove the truth of the expert's medical opinions, so this cannot create a genuine dispute of material fact on the merits of the radiologic interpretation [^notfound].

> Let me consider Option C, an affidavit from the patient's expert radiologist. This looks promising because an affidavit is a sworn statement subject to cross-examination, and it can present the expert's opinion that the original X-ray showed evidence of cancer that a reasonably prudent radiologist should have recognized, thereby directly contradicting the hospital's expert and creating a factual dispute on the key issue of breach of the standard of care; this is the classic way to oppose summary judgment in professional negligence cases [^75458f73] [^16a7b3d0].

> But wait, what about Option D, the patient's current medical records showing the cancer diagnosis? I should double-check: while the current diagnosis is material to damages, it does not by itself create a dispute about whether the original radiologist breached the standard of care or whether the delay worsened outcome; it lacks the expert opinion necessary to establish negligence and causation, so it does not create a genuine dispute on the liability elements at issue here [^75458f73] [^16a7b3d0].

> Putting this together, the best way to raise a genuine dispute of material fact is Option C, the expert radiologist's affidavit, because it provides admissible, expert opinion directly challenging the original interpretation and the hospital's claim that no signs were present, which is precisely the kind of evidence that can preclude summary judgment in a malpractice case; Options A and B fail on evidentiary grounds, and Option D does not address the standard-of-care question [^75458f73] [^16a7b3d0].

---

The best way for the patient to raise a genuine dispute of material fact is to **submit an affidavit from the patient's expert radiologist** (Option C) stating that the original X-ray showed signs of cancer that a competent radiologist should have identified, and that the delay in diagnosis worsened the patient's outcome. This directly contradicts the hospital's expert and creates a factual dispute on the standard of care and causation, which are material to the malpractice claim [^75458f73] [^16a7b3d0]. Options A and B are weaker because a report alone is less authoritative than an affidavit, and an attorney's affidavit is hearsay and not admissible expert testimony. The current diagnosis (Option D) does not address whether the original X-ray was misread or whether the delay caused harm.

---

## Legal standard for summary judgment

Summary judgment is appropriate only when there is **no genuine dispute as to any material fact** and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A genuine dispute exists when the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party. In medical malpractice cases, material facts typically include whether the defendant breached the standard of care and whether that breach caused the plaintiff's injury [^16a7b3d0].

---

## Analysis of the options

### Option A: Submit a report from the patient's expert radiologist

A report from the patient's expert radiologist contradicting the hospital's findings would introduce expert opinion evidence. However, a report alone may be less persuasive than an affidavit because it lacks the formal sworn statement and personal attestation that an affidavit provides. Additionally, courts may view an affidavit as more credible and reliable than a mere report, especially when the expert is available for cross-examination.

---

### Option B: Submit an affidavit from the patient's attorney

An affidavit from the patient's attorney detailing conversations with the patient's expert radiologist is **hearsay and not admissible as expert testimony**. Attorneys are not qualified to provide medical opinions, and their affidavits cannot substitute for expert medical testimony. Therefore, this option would not effectively raise a genuine dispute of material fact.

---

### Option C: Submit an affidavit from the patient's expert radiologist

An affidavit from the patient's expert radiologist stating that the original X-ray showed signs of cancer that a competent radiologist should have identified, and that the delay in diagnosis worsened the patient's outcome, is the most effective way to raise a genuine dispute of material fact. This approach provides:

- **Direct expert testimony**: The expert radiologist can offer a professional opinion on the standard of care and whether the hospital's radiologist breached that standard.

- **Contradiction of the hospital's evidence**: The expert's affidavit directly contradicts the hospital's radiologist report, creating a factual dispute.

- **Causation evidence**: The expert can testify that the delay in diagnosis caused the cancer to spread, establishing a causal link between the breach and the patient's injury [^75458f73].

---

### Option D: Submit the patient's medical records showing the current cancer diagnosis

While the patient's current medical records showing the cancer diagnosis are relevant to damages, they **do not address the central issues of the case**: whether the hospital's radiologist breached the standard of care and whether that breach caused the patient's injury. Therefore, this option alone would not raise a genuine dispute of material fact regarding liability.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The best way for the patient to raise a genuine dispute of material fact is to **submit an affidavit from the patient's expert radiologist** (Option C). This approach provides direct, expert testimony that contradicts the hospital's evidence and addresses the key issues of standard of care and causation. Options A and B are less effective due to evidentiary limitations, and Option D does not address liability.

### Error and discrepancy in radiology: inevitable or avoidable? [^34b21e55]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Definition of error/discrepancy

It was recently estimated that one billion radiologic examinations are performed worldwide annually, most of which are interpreted by radiologists. Most professional bodies would agree that all imaging procedures should include an expert radiologist's opinion, given by means of a written report. This activity constitutes much of the daily work of practising radiologists. We don't always get it right.

Although not always appreciated by the public, or indeed by referring doctors, radiologists' reports should not be expected to be definitive or incontrovertible. They represent clinical consultations, resulting in opinions which are conclusions arrived at after weighing of evidence; "opinion" can be defined as "a view held about a particular subject or point; a judgement formed; a belief". Sometimes it is possible to be definitive in radiological diagnoses, but in most cases, radiological interpretation is heavily influenced by the clinical circumstances of the patient, relevant past history and previous imaging, and myriad other factors, including biases of which we may not be aware. Radiological studies do not come with inbuilt labels denoting the most significant abnormalities, and interpreting them is not a binary process (normal vs abnormal, cancer vs "all-clear").

In this context, defining what constitutes radiological error is not straightforward. The use of the term "error" implies that there is no potential for disagreement about what is "correct", and indicates that the reporting radiologist should have been able to make the correct diagnosis or report, but did not. In real life, there is frequently room for legitimate differences of opinion about diagnoses or for "failure" to identify an abnormality that can be seen in retrospect. Expert opinion often forms the basis for deciding whether an error has been made, but it should be noted that "experts" themselves may also be subject to question ("An expert is someone who is more than fifty miles from home, has no responsibility for implementing the advice he gives, and shows slides". - Ed Meese, US Attorney General 1985–88).

### The role of radiologist in the changing world of healthcare: a white paper of the European Society of Radiology (ESR) [^d54c60f0]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Direct communication with patients is, quite appropriately, increasingly being sought by those to whom our services are delivered. Past models of care, whereby imaging findings were communicated between the radiologist and referrer, and management decisions were arrived at and acted upon, while the patient was a passive participant in the decision-making process, are no longer acceptable to most patients, nor are they appropriate. Patient-centred care implies patient involvement in all major decisions; such involvement is only meaningful if patients are fully-briefed on relevant information, including radiology findings. As radiologists, we adapt to patient expectations of being able to engage directly with us to discuss their procedures and findings; the era of radiologists being "the doctors' doctor", remote from direct patient contact, is consigned to the past. Our work practices are adapted to increasing direct patient engagement, whether face to face or through our digital reports, which may be enhanced by tools to improve lay communication via patient portals; meeting this growing expectation will enhance the lives of both patients and radiologists, and add significant value to the services we deliver.

Our communication responsibilities extend also to educating our referring colleagues, patients, the general public and policy-makers about the inherently uncertain nature of much of what we do. We understand the imperfection of our tools (and sometimes of our use of them), but the possibility that a radiologist may not make a correct diagnosis, or may not accurately understand or interpret abnormal findings, is often judged by members of the public or commentators to represent negligence or poor performance. As Osler wrote in 1904, "Errors in judgement must occur in the practice of an art which consists largely of balancing probabilities". Public education, led by radiologists, is required to explain the unavoidable nature of "radiological error" and the efforts we make to minimise it, while emphasising the great benefit of careful radiological practice to patients and society.

Common radiological error types

Diagnostic errors constitute a large and complex issue that needs to be addressed, as they can prevent proper patient management, and a delayed diagnosis could lead to important consequences. Different classifications have been proposed at various times for the classification of diagnostic errors to facilitate their comprehensibility. The most broadly accepted classification was developed by Kim and Mansfield. According to this classification, diagnostic errors are examined in 12 groups based on the cause of the error:
False-positive or over-reading error In this scenario, an abnormality is noticed during the radiological examination. However, this finding is given more clinical value than it deserves and may consequently cause unnecessary diagnostic/therapeutic effort (Fig. 3).
Faulty-reasoning error In this type of error, detected abnormal radiological findings are thought to be associated with a false clinical entity, mostly due to cognitive biases such as hindsight bias or attribution bias (Fig. 4).
Lack of knowledge error This error type occurs when a pathological finding is noticed but cannot be interpreted correctly due to lack of adequate knowledge or experience of the radiologist about the finding, despite the availability of adequate clinical information (Fig. 5).
Under-reading error This is the most common error type, in which an examination is reported as normal, although there is an undeniable and detectable abnormal finding. (Figs. 6, 7).
Poor communication-related error In this scenario, the abnormal finding is recognized and accurately reported. However, the diagnostic message is not delivered to the clinician because of communication-related problems. In some circumstances, referrers may not be aware of the importance of the reported findings in the radiology report due to individual failings in communication between radiologist and clinician or systemic issues such as lack of multidisciplinary meetings and teamwork, increased workload and understaffing. Poor communication errors may also result from referrers not understanding radiology reports, lack of knowledge about the meaning of radiological findings or their own biases. Last but not least, typing errors in the report may disrupt the communication between the radiologist and the referrer, irrespective of the quality of the information provided by radiologists or the competence of referrers (Fig. 8, 9) (Table 1).
Technique-related error This error occurs because of low technical quality, inaccuracies during the image acquisition process or selection of the wrong technique or modality, resulting in a decreased possibility of detecting abnormal findings and sometimes makes diagnosis impossible (Fig. 9)
Prior examination-related error The underlying cause of this error is skipping the "comparison with previous exams" step, which is indispensable during radiological evaluation. Each evaluation must be compared with previous examinations to increase the likelihood of detecting pathological findings. However, when doing this, one must be careful about the 'satisfaction of report' error that will be explained later (Fig. 10).
History-related error This error includes inaccurate reporting faults when the radiologist is not provided with adequate or correct information about the patient's clinical history (Fig. 11).
Location-related error Location-related error is characterized by the inability to recognize the pathological finding, which is seen within examination limits but falls outside the purposefully examined area, especially at the edges of the evaluated area (Fig. 12).
Satisfaction of search When the radiologist defines a pathological finding during the evaluation, other findings may be overlooked due to the satisfaction of the assessment and loss of motivation. Thus, accompanying findings may be under-read even if they are seen very clearly (Fig. 13).
Complication As a general description, complications are the conditions that occur during or after the procedures and are directly related to the nature of the procedure. They are unanticipated occurrences and may happen even under ideal conditions, making it controversial to define them as errors (Fig. 14). However, according to the Kim-Mansfield classification, the term "complication", as an error type, refers to an adverse event related to invasive radiological procedures (Fig. 15).
Satisfaction of report This results from having undue confidence in the patient's prior reports. As a result, if a wrong assessment has been made in the previous report, it will be repeated. This type of error is closely related to alliterative bias (Fig. 10).

the physician certifies that the benefits reasonably expected from treatment at another medical facility outweigh the increased risks to the individual's medical condition from the transfer, and the transfer is an "appropriate transfer" effected through "qualified" personnel and equipment. We affirm the ALJ's decision that Petitioner. certificate authorizing Mrs. Rivera's transfer, telling the nurse that "until DeTar Hospital pays my malpractice insurance, I will pick and choose those patients that I want to treat. " Almost two hours elapsed between this time and the time of Mrs. Rivera's transfer, during only part of which Petitioner was busy caring for another patient.

Petitioner specifically disputed only the portion of this finding to the effect that he should have re-examined Mrs. Rivera. He argued that it. would have been impractical for him to conduct a vaginal examination since Mrs. Rivera was no longer in the labor room, but in the hallway, and the ambulance was ready to begin transport.

He also argued that he reasonably relied on the vaginal examination performed by Nurse Nichols, whom he knew to be a qualified OB nurse, and whose examination was. consistent with both his and Nurse Kotzur's original examinations. The ALJ's finding that Petitioner should have re-examined Mrs. Rivera is related to FFCL #109, which states that "mall differences in measurement of the dilation of the cervix and the percentage of its effacement are subjective measurements, which can only be detected over. time by the same examiner. " This finding, which Petitioner did not dispute, means that, even if Nurse Nichols was a competent obstetrical nurse, she might not have detected a change in dilation from 3 cm. to 4 cm. which Petitioner might have detected. Accordingly, Petitioner. could not reasonably have relied on the results of her examination simply because they were the same as the results of prior examinations by him and Nurse Kotzur.

### Direct reporting of results to patients: the future of radiology? [^8e4ad6a3]. Academic Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

Radiologists have traditionally left relaying exam results to patients in the hands of clinicians. Recent editorials have reexamined radiologists' traditional position and questioned whether radiologists should continue to remain within the confines of the reading room or increase their contact with patients. The present study addressed this issue by surveying patients directly regarding their preferences.

Materials and Methods

A survey was given to all patients aged ≥ 21 years undergoing outpatient magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomographic examinations at an academic medical center and at an associated outpatient center. Responses were anonymous. Surveys were provided over a 4-week period in February and March 2011; 237 were returned.

Results

The majority of patients (73%-77%) continue to prefer the practice model already established, regardless of whether the results are normal or abnormal. However, the same percentage of patients preferred to hear the results of their exams from the experts interpreting the exams. The discrepancy in these results is likely reflected in the fact that there is persistent confusion as to the role of radiologists. Although most patients correctly defined a radiologist as a physician, 40% believed that a radiologist is a technician or a nurse. A large percentage of patients (64%) responded positively to wanting to meet the radiologists interpreting their exams.

Conclusions

As radiologists, we need to reevaluate the established model of communication for reporting radiology results and consider the positive impact on patient care, and on the vitality of the radiology profession, of directly communicating with patients.

With the advent of high-resolution computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasonography, the frequency of radiologists' serendipitous discovery of incidentalomas is increasing. If the radiologist believes an incidentaloma is of no clinical significance, then making mention of it in the radiological report may possibly lead to a cascade of tests, biopsies, and other surgical procedures, which occasionally can cause serious complications. But if the incidentaloma is not reported and it later turns out to be an early carcinoma or sign of other significant disease, the patient's health may be irreversibly jeopardized. In either case, medical malpractice litigation could well ensue.

### The spider model for clinical involvement in radiology [^dbc2049a]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Also, the perception by the general public of the work a radiologist does is very poor. Many think that radiologists are not doctors and have not received medical training. This brings up an important question: what, in the twenty-first century, is the added value of a radiologist for the hospital? Is the radiologist really seen by some as no more than a photographer? I am afraid this is true. Where does this come from? Why is the radiologist often not valued in the same way as specialists in other branches of medicine? To answer this question, we have to go back in history. In the past radiologists often had to work in dark and remote places, for example in the basement of a hospital. You had to know your way in the labyrinth of small corridors to find a radiologist. But, actually, there was no need to find the radiologist, as communication was solely through the request or order forms and the subsequent report. Both clinicians and radiologists were at that time generalists, overseeing their complete — though limited — field of speciality. Diagnostic radiology options were limited in those days and a radiology investigation was often no more than a picture to support or to reject an already standing diagnosis. This world has changed dramatically in recent decades. Clinicians have become subspecialised, with an increasing amount of knowledge about an often small part of medicine. Imaging modalities and options have been revolutionised and have become the most crucial cornerstone in diagnoses and treatment in any hospital. At the same time, demands on the radiologists have grown equally and it is no longer possible to oversee everything and to be an expert in radiology at large. It is also no longer the picture but all the diagnostic image investigations in the context of the whole clinical decision-making that is important. The key element in this now is multidisciplinary communication on the interpretation, not by report or wire, but real communication in patient discussions and teams. Margulis and Sunshine suggested in their millennium paper that teams of radiological subspecialist and clinical specialists should practice together, supporting each other. In 2010, the ESR was still undecided on how enthusiastically subspecialisation in radiology should be promoted. I think the time for hesitation has gone; it is now time to decide on which direction radiology should take in the next decade. Recently, we have seen a fast growth in subspecialty societies within the ESR. There is now also an ESR level III subspecialisation curriculum available.

### Medical X-ray imaging… [^06448333]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Benefits
- Risks Benefits The discovery of X-rays and the invention of CT represented major advances in medicine. X-ray imaging exams are recognized as a valuable medical tool for a wide variety of examinations and procedures. They are used to:

- noninvasively and painlessly help to diagnose disease and monitor therapy;
- support medical and surgical treatment planning; and
- guide medical personnel as they insert catheters, stents, or other devices inside the body, treat tumors, or remove blood clots or other blockages. Balancing benefits and risks While the benefit of a clinically appropriate X-ray imaging exam generally far outweighs the risk, efforts should be made to minimize this risk by reducing unnecessary exposure to ionizing radiation. To help reduce risk to the patient, all exams using ionizing radiation should be performed only when necessary to answer a medical question, treat a disease, or guide a procedure.

If there is a medical need for a particular imaging procedure and other exams using no or less radiation are less appropriate, then the benefits exceed the risks, and radiation risk considerations should not influence the physician's decision to perform the study or the patient's decision to have the procedure. However, the "As Low as Reasonably Achievable" principle should be followed when choosing equipment settings to minimize radiation exposure to the patient. Information for Patients X-ray imaging exams should be performed only after careful consideration of the patient's health needs. They should be performed only when the referring healthcare provider judges them to be necessary to answer a clinical question or to guide treatment of a disease. The clinical benefit of a medically appropriate X-ray imaging exam outweighs the small radiation risk. However, efforts should be made to help minimize this risk.
- Informing their healthcare provider if they are pregnant or think they might be pregnant.
- Asking the referring healthcare provider about the benefits and risks of imaging procedures, such as:

- How will the results of the exam be used to evaluate my condition or guide my treatment.
- Are there alternative exams that do not use ionizing radiation that are equally useful.
- **Asking the imaging facility**:
- If it uses techniques to reduce radiation dose, especially to sensitive populations such as children.
- About any additional steps that may be necessary to perform the imaging study.
- If the facility is accredited. Justification: The imaging procedure should be judged to do more good than harm to the individual patient. Therefore, all examinations using ionizing radiation should be performed only when necessary to answer a medical question, treat a disease, or guide a procedure. The clinical indication and patient medical history should be carefully considered before referring a patient for any X-ray examination. Optimization: X-ray examinations should use techniques that are adjusted to administer the lowest radiation dose that yields an image quality adequate for diagnosis or intervention). The technique factors used should be chosen based on the clinical indication, patient size, and anatomical area scanned; and the equipment should be properly maintained and tested. While the referring healthcare provider has the primary responsibility for justification and the imaging team (for example.

### The clinical and medicolegal implications of radiology results communication [^80d68aed]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Multiple guidelines and legal precedents have established the radiologist's duty to inform clinicians directly of critical findings, or findings that will greatly impact patient health in a timely manner [1]. While the number one cause for radiology malpractice cases is misdiagnosis, the literature shows a growing portion of lawsuits surrounding breakdowns in communication between radiologists and ordering providers [2,3]. As such, a review of guidelines related to the communication of imaging results is warranted. We will describe and provide our perspective on results communication as well as attempt to further define ideal communication practices in healthcare scenarios that fall outside of normal cases.

The author reviews the dilemmas posed by incidental radiologic findings and provides an analysis of factors that underlie how radiologists handle them. Particular attention is paid to professional standards that mediate clinical decision making and communication in the setting of risk. The author concludes that individual radiologists should report the incidental findings they detect and use existing evidence-based recommendations when possible. Such recommendations, however, face their own challenge in maintaining consistency with norms around risk-related decision making in other clinical realms.

Errors, discrepancies and confounding biases are inseparable parts of radiology practice with various clinical consequences.
Radiological errors can occur before, during or after the reporting periods.
Effective communication between radiologists, radiology technicians, patients and clinicians is the key to proper patient management
Being familiar with the types of errors and underlying biases is essential for radiologists to cope with them.

### Preliminary radiology report discordances and patient outcomes [^e83d563d]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

At our institution, resident and fellow radiologists issue preliminary reports for off-hours imaging studies, which are overread by attending radiologists the next day using structured discrepancy templates. In this study, we examined the impact on patient management and outcome of studies with major discordance.

Materials and Methods

For our retrospective observational study, preliminary reports between March and June 2017 that received major discordance were identified through report text search. Electronic medical records were reviewed for patient management change and patient outcome.

Results

Of the 199 cases, 52 cases (26%) had management change and 119 cases (60%) did not have management change. In 25 cases (13%), the preliminary report was proven correct on subsequent management. Three cases (2%) were lost to follow-up. In only one case was adverse outcome directly related to the discordant finding. In cases with patient management change, there was higher proportion of perceptual error compared with those without management change (73% versus 59%). In 47 cases (24%), the discordant finding or diagnosis was known to the clinical team, and better history could have avoided the major change.

Conclusion

Adverse outcome from the discordant imaging finding was low (0.5%). Major change in preliminary report could be reduced with better clinical history. Patient management change was more frequently seen with perceptual errors, placing greater emphasis on strategies to reduce them.

### Ultra-low-dose CT vs. chest X-ray in non-traumatic emergency department patients-a prospective randomised crossover cohort trial [^d7876ca9]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Compound reference standard and clinical relevance

All prospective imaging reports were transformed into dichotomous radiological report data after the elimination of synonyms, to enable binary comparison for further assessment.

Building of the compound reference standard (CompRS) was a complex, inter-disciplinary, multi-level process, visualized in Fig. 2 and provided in detail in the Supplements. Expert CT radiologists and expert emergency physicians assessed all imaging findings and clinical diagnoses and considered all other available imaging and clinical data up to six months after the end of recruitment to reach a conclusive consensus set of validated imaging findings and diagnoses for every patients initial emergency department visit. Imaging and clinical data after the initial emergency department visit were assessed only to validate or falsify the initial diagnoses in the case of findings and diagnoses that can only be verified over time, such as pulmonary nodules in contrast to acute inflammation. Notably, this CompRS contained radiological findings, as well as clinical diagnoses, including those undetectable by imaging methods. All CompRS elements were stratified with regard to their individual clinical relevance for every patient within the respective hospital visit. The rationale for these clinical relevance categories - similar to Goldman et al. but adapted to the clinical requirements of this trial - is explained in detail in the Supplementary Material. The categories ranged from the 'main diagnosis' that caused this ED visit, to 'important incidental diagnosis', 'strongly contributing', 'moderately contributing', and 'clinically irrelevant findings' for this ED visit. Within this trial, the same diagnosis or finding might be classified as a different clinical relevance category in different patients, since in clinical routine the relevance of a finding/diagnosis depends on the patients' individual reason for the specific emergency department visit. Two such examples are given in the Supplementary Material. However, the clinical relevance categories were mutually exclusive within each individual patient. To avoid overemphasis of exclusions of main referring diagnoses, such as 'no signs of pneumothorax', rule-outs were not classified as a 'main diagnosis', but only as a 'strongly contributing finding' or 'moderately contributing finding'. However, since the exclusion of frequent thoracic pathologies is one of the main purposes of CXR in emergency medicine, rule-outs of main referring diagnoses were also analysed.

### Communicating with patients in the age of online portals-challenges and opportunities on the horizon for radiologists [^f1ce00d4]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Direct communication between patients and radiologists: general aspects

In many European countries, direct contact between the patient and the radiologist is naturally inherent to many imaging procedures, e.g. ultrasonography, clinical mammography, fluoroscopy, paediatric radiology and in vascular and non-vascular interventional radiology. The availability of the medical imaging expert for patient's questions may also be desirable in the context of certain advanced cross-sectional imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT), since it helps to build and maintain trust, to reduce stress and to contribute to patient satisfaction. Direct communication has therefore been considered as a part of the radiologists' service to patients. However, this does not necessarily imply that all radiology results are routinely communicated to the patient by the radiologist. In the traditional model, which is still widely favoured by referring physicians and a majority of patients it is rather the referring physician who communicates the result to the patient. Therefore, many patients of today's generation may not even be aware of the radiologist's exact role in the diagnostic process. Despite the obvious advantage of discussing diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of the patient's problem at the same time and in continuity with the referring physician, there are also drawbacks to this model because it disregards some important facts. Firstly, patients' specific questions may be beyond the competence of many referrers, especially in the case of advanced imaging studies, e.g. CT and MRI. Secondly, a radiology report cannot be regarded in a similar fashion as a laboratory result because image interpretation is an opinion-based, operator-dependent process which is — at least in part — guided by the history and clinical context provided. Incomplete transmission or omission of relevant facts may lead to suboptimal interpretation of images, emphasising the importance of direct and detailed communication, especially in complex clinical situations. Thirdly, discrepancies between original and secondary readings as well as missed diagnostic findings may occur in radiology just like everywhere else in clinical practice. Active engagement of patients in the diagnostic process and direct communication with the responsible radiologist can not only help to reduce the above-described sources of errors but may also be helpful for patients' understanding of complex imaging findings. Finally, direct, honest disclosure of discrepancies and corrective measures regarding radiological findings are helpful for establishing and maintaining trust and avoiding confusion. This is especially true in complex oncologic settings, where it has been shown that discrepancies between primary and secondary interpretations commonly result in significant actionable differences with regard to treatment. Although there appears to be no single best way for communicating imaging results in all clinical settings, there are many good reasons for radiologists to be prepared and make themselves available to discuss their imaging findings with patients if requested to do so.

### The identity and role of the radiologist in 2020: a survey among ESR full radiologist members [^cd087d6d]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Providing results and breaking bad news

Although 51% have some opportunity to go through imaging results with a patient, only 25% feel that there is sufficient time to discuss radiology findings with patients, 45% sometimes have sufficient time and 24% usually do not have enough time. Over 70% do not have any specific time or reimbursement allocated in their job plans for communicating results to patients. Many respondents describe staying late or using break time/unpaid time to speak to patients when needed. Many describe this aspect of their work as important in delivering excellence of care, although others are unable to do so due to workload or due to clinicians preferring to discuss results with their patients. Only 14% of respondents have an appropriate room in their department dedicated for discussing results with patients.

Most (70%) consider that it would be useful to be able to go through images with patients in conjunction with their referring doctor. However, 30% (222 comments) feel that this would not be helpful, mainly due to a combination of logistical issues and shortage of time and staffing. There are substantial differences of opinion about who should discuss findings with the patient. Many challenges were highlighted, including difficulties arising from creating patient anxiety (particular in the case of very serious adverse findings), and inability to fully discuss treatment options (with the potential to create confusion due to different messages understood from the radiologist and the referrer). 43% feel there is potential for harm in providing findings directly to patients, though this depends on the individual patient and their outlook and wishes. Some suggest that discussion of imaging findings with the clinical team at MDT meetings is a good alternative.

Providing results to patients is usually via the referring clinician, only rarely via a secure patient portal (11%) and almost never by email. For "non-distressing" results, 61% of respondents prefer the result to be provided by the referring clinician, though this does depend on the type of investigation (e.g. US can be face-to-face); patient preference should also be considered.

Of the 57% who were happy not to discuss results with patients, 85% feel that this would be too time-consuming and 85% feel that the clinician should give the result, mainly as they can then discuss proposed treatment options. 40% feel that lack of re-imbursement is also a disincentive to committing time to direct patient interaction, with no provision in job plans for this.

### Integrative diagnostics: the time is now-a report from the international society for strategic studies in radiology [^fc60f664]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite digital imaging, widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs), and advances in precision medicine tools, diagnosis often remains a fragmented and frustrating process for clinicians and patients. Data are still gathered and presented asynchronously, and EHRs do little to organize and synthesize information. Although team practice, such as tumor boards, is increasing, routine physician interaction is limited by clinical workflow, high volumes, and IT boundaries. Despite an abundance of relevant diagnostic data, diagnoses may be incorrect, delayed, or never made. Allegations of diagnostic errors account for 28% of malpractice cases in the United States. Experts estimate a diagnostic error rate of 10% to 15%, with 40,000–80,000 preventable deaths each year. As physicians and diagnosticians, it is our responsibility to minimize these errors. Integrative diagnostics (ID) has been proposed as one means to reduce diagnostic errors.

### ACR practice parameter for communication of diagnostic imaging findings [^2e0d2908]. ACR (2025). High credibility.

ACR Practice Parameter — Preliminary reports in diagnostic imaging — When needed, a preliminary report precedes the final report and may be rendered for the purpose of directing immediate patient management or to meet the needs of a particular practice environment, and it very likely will contain limited or incomplete information and should not be expected to contain all the information subsequently found in the final report. Preliminary reports may be communicated in writing, electronically, or verbally, and the method of communication should be documented, and these preliminary communications should be reproduced into a permanent format as soon as practical and appropriately labeled as a preliminary report, distinct from the final report, and archived because clinical decisions may have been based on the preliminary report; the archived preliminary report should contain the name of the person or office that received the report, if applicable, and the date and time that the report was provided. As soon as possible, a significant variation in findings and/or conclusions between the preliminary and final interpretations should be reported in a manner that reasonably ensures receipt by the referring or treating physician/health care provider, particularly when such changes may impact patient care, and documentation of communication of any discrepancy should be incorporated into the final report.

### Assessment of actionable findings in radiology reports [^fc368100]. European Journal of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The American College of Radiology (ACR) Actionable Reporting Work Group defined three categories of imaging findings that require additional, nonroutine communication with the referring physician because of their urgency or unexpectedness. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of actionable findings in radiology reports, and to assess how well radiologists agree on the categorisation of actionable findings.

Method

From 124,909 consecutive radiology reports stored in the electronic health record system of a large university hospital, 1000 reports were randomly selected. Two radiologists independently annotated all actionable findings according to the three categories of urgency defined by the ACR Work Group. Annotation differences were resolved in a consensus meeting and a final category was established for each report. Interannotator agreement was measured by accuracy and the kappa coefficient.

Results

The prevalence of the three categories of actionable findings together was 32.5%. Of all reports, 10.9% were from patients seen in the emergency department. Prevalence of actionable findings for these patients (45.9%) was considerably higher than for patients in routine clinical care (30.9%). Interannotator agreement scores on the categorisation of actionable findings were 0.812 for accuracy and 0.616 for kappa coefficient.

Conclusions

The prevalence of actionable findings in radiology reports is high. The interannotator agreement scores are moderate, indicating that categorisation of actionable findings is a difficult task. To avoid unneeded increase in the workload of radiologists, in particular in routine practice, clinical context may need to be considered in deciding whether a finding is actionable.

### The interplay of physician awareness and reporting of incidentally found coronary artery calcium on the clinical management of patients who underwent noncontrast chest computed tomography [^c5799d35]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Studies have shown that coronary artery calcium (CAC) incidentally identified on a noncontrast chest computed tomography (NCCT) performed for noncardiac indications has diagnostic and prognostic value. The frequency by which radiologists report incidental CAC and its impact on patient management are unknown. This study included 204 consecutive patients (63 ± 17 years, 59% men) without a history of coronary artery disease referred for an NCCT for noncardiac indications. The presence of CAC was determined by an expert cardiologist and compared with the radiology report. For each patient, the medical record was reviewed for changes in medications. Physicians caring for these patients were surveyed regarding their awareness and the clinical importance of incidental CAC after their patients had been discharged from the hospital. There were 108 of 201 patients (53%) with a CAC score > 0 as determined by an expert reader. The interpreting radiologist reported the presence of CAC in 74 of 108 patients (69%). Of the 74 patients, there was an increase in stain and aspirin prescription of 4% and 5%, respectively. Of the 132 physicians surveyed, 54% of physicians surveyed believed that CAC on an NCCT scan was analogous to the presence of coronary artery disease, 23% were aware that incidental CAC was reported, and only 4% said they would make medical management decisions based on the finding of incidental CAC. In conclusion, incidental CAC is under-reported by the interpreting radiologists and suggests an integral role for a cardiovascular imaging specialist. When incidental CAC is reported, physicians are not cognizant of the meaning and importance of this finding. This lack of knowledge is reflected in the negligible impact reported incidental CAC has on clinical management decisions.

### Abdominal and pelvic CT scan interpretation of emergency medicine physicians compared with radiologists' report and its impact on patients' outcome [^df19d609]. Emergency Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

In this study, the impact of contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CT scan interpretations by emergency medicine team on patients' morbidity and mortality was evaluated and their interpretations were compared to radiologists' reports.

Methods

During a 3-month period, all patients who had undergone a contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CT scan at the emergency department enrolled in this study. All CT scans were interpreted blindly by the emergency medicine (ED) attending physicians and the patients were treated accordingly. Radiologists reported all the CT scans within 12 h. Radiologists' reports were put into the agreement or disagreement group retrospectively. A panel of experts further evaluated the disagreement groups' medical charts and placed them in clinically significant or insignificant group based on the follow-up for 28 days.

Results

In this study, 170 CT scans were interpreted. The agreement rate was 68.2%. In the clinically significant disagreement group, eight patients did not receive the required treatment and three patients were over treated. Although the overall mortality rate was 5, none could have been prevented by a prompt radiologist's report. The disagreement group had longer hospital stay (p = 0.006) and transfer to other wards (p = 0.035). The inter-rater reliability between emergency medicine attending physicians and attending radiologists was substantial (kappa = 0.77) and statistically significant (p < 0.0001).

Conclusion

Our findings support the cautious use of ED physicians' CT scan interpretations for patients' management. Ideally, the ED physicians should utilize a real-time radiologist interpretation in critical patients. This collaboration will result in better patient management.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2022). High credibility.

CAD-RADS 2.0 discussion — For coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) reporting, it is recommended that CCTA reporting use the CAD-RADS classification in addition and in conjunction with the impression of the report, while recognizing that the CAD-RADS classification alone will not always provide all the information which is necessary to convey to referring providers for the purposes of patient management; therefore, imagers should provide additional commentary, advice, and convey any degree of uncertainty whenever applicable. CAD-RADS has been developed based on scientific data, consensus guidance from cardiac imaging experts and a multi-disciplinary effort involving societies comprised of radiologists and cardiologists (SCCT, ACR, ACC and NASCI), has been extensively validated over the past 5 years, and is intended to be a "living document" that will undergo continuing development to provide up-to-date, evidence-based recommendations that allow imagers to communicate with providers and to convey concise findings using unambiguous and standardized terminology. Beyond its utilization in clinical reporting, CAD-RADS will allow reliable and reproducible data collection, storage and retrieval for future research trials and audits, and further, it can provide the framework for collecting outcome data in each of several sub-categories of CAD-RADS.

The situation in China

Z. Y. Jin, on behalf of the Chinese Society of Radiology (CSR), reported on the situation in China. He stated that China has taken multiple measures to combat COVID-19, benefitting from the valuable experience during the Manchurian plague from the previous century. Based on that experience the Chinese government and public health department promptly established an emergency response scheme in the very early stage of COVID-19, emphasizing early detection, early reporting, early isolation, and early treatment. A unified and effective commanding system, a series of law-based and science-driven strategies, the '4-Early' measure, the coordinated deployment of resources, the rapid improvement in treatment capacity, the application of high-tech measures, and international exchange and cooperation substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19 in China. Reporting on the activities of the CSR, Z. Y. Jin explained that in February 2020, the Chinese Society of Radiology organized members from different parts of China to help improve medical quality and security when diagnosing COVID-19. Experts in cardiothoracic branch published an expert recommendation in the Chinese Journal of Radiology entitled "The radiological diagnosis of novel coronavirus pneumonia: expert recommendation from the Chinese Society of Radiology (First edition)". Another message that the CSR sent is that chest CT findings can be not parallel to nucleic acid detection. The Chinese Society of Radiology strongly recommend that the physicians and radiologists should carefully consider the negative result from chest CT and nucleic acid test during the clinical procedure. Reporting on the Chinese experience in hospital environment preparedness for COVID-19, Z. Y. Jin stated that hospitals in China including Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) have heightened the security on the whole campuses, as screening is the first and fundamental step of the flow and that PUMCH urgently set up a series of separate cabinets with air conditioners for nasopharyngeal swab collection. The CSR therefore appeals to the global community for the manufacture, equipment, and utilization of integrated cabinets. Furthermore, the CSR emphasized that environmental services staff members need to be specially trained for professional cleaning of potentially contaminated surfaces after each high-risk patient contact. Radiology departments should contact their equipment vendors to find the safest disinfectant for each piece of equipment in use. Additionally, the CSR encourages the radiology departments to collaborate with the IT departments to construct a remote imaging system helping radiologists work at home. Moreover, a medical application on both iOS and Android smart phones can help patients receive their image reports. Z. Y. Jin also emphasized the importance of collaboration between the radiology community and local government in order to raise public awareness in disease control, stating that the CSR has published a free handbook on COVID-19 for the public. Finally, Z. Y. Jin commended the strong international collaboration between different radiological societies.

### How to prepare for a bright future of radiology in Europe [^d927d021]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Because artificial intelligence (AI)-powered algorithms allow automated image analysis in a growing number of diagnostic scenarios, some healthcare stakeholders have raised doubts about the future of the entire radiologic profession. Their view disregards not only the role of radiologists in the diagnostic service chain beyond reporting, but also the many multidisciplinary and patient-related consulting tasks for which radiologists are solicited. The time commitment for these non-reporting tasks is considerable but difficult to quantify and often impossible to fulfil considering the current mismatch between workload and workforce in many countries. Nonetheless, multidisciplinary, and patient-centred consulting activities could move up on radiologists' agendas as soon as AI-based tools can save time in daily routine. Although there are many reasons why AI will assist and not replace radiologists as imaging experts in the future, it is important to position the next generation of European radiologists in view of this expected trend. To ensure radiologists' personal professional recognition and fulfilment in multidisciplinary environments, the focus of training should go beyond diagnostic reporting, concentrating on clinical backgrounds, specific communication skills with referrers and patients, and integration of imaging findings with those of other disciplines. Close collaboration between the European Society of Radiology (ESR) and European national radiologic societies can help to achieve these goals. Although each adequate treatment begins with a correct diagnosis, many health politicians see radiologic procedures mainly as a cost factor. Radiologic research should, therefore, increasingly investigate the imaging impact on treatment and outcome rather than focusing mainly on technical improvements and diagnostic accuracy alone. Critical relevance statement Strategies are presented to prepare for a successful future of the radiologic profession in Europe, if AI-powered tools can alleviate the current reporting overload: engaging in multidisciplinary activities (clinical and integrative diagnostics), enhancing the value and recognition of radiologists' role through clinical expertise, focusing radiological research on the impact on diagnosis and outcome, and promoting patient-centred radiology by enhancing communication skills. Key points
- AI-powered tools will not replace radiologists but hold promise to reduce the current reporting burden, enabling them to reinvest liberated time in multidisciplinary clinical and patient-related tasks.• The skills and resources for these tasks should be considered when recruiting and teaching the next generation of radiologists, when organising departments and planning staffing.• Communication skills will play an increasing role in both multidisciplinary activities and patient-centred radiology.• The value and importance of a correct and integrative diagnosis and the cost of an incorrect imaging diagnosis should be emphasised when discussing with non-medical stakeholders in healthcare.• The radiologic community in Europe should start now to prepare for a bright future of the profession for the benefit of patients and medical colleagues alike.

### Breast imaging, standard of care, and the expert [^b3d3a58b]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Many radiologists have the opportunity to serve as experts in determining whether a colleague's actions are within standard of care. This is an important responsibility because, in large part, the fairness and success of the judicial system determining whether medical negligence has occurred is dependent on the opinion of the medical expert. Especially in the field of breast imaging, the physician acting as an expert often has to base opinions on judgments rather than incontestable facts. To make judgments of the highest quality, the expert must possess a clear understanding of the concept of standard of care. This article focuses on the role of experts in malpractice cases dealing with mammography and the delay of diagnosis of breast cancer.

### Radiologist-initiated double reading of abdominal CT: retrospective analysis of the clinical importance of changes to radiology reports [^ff7dc161]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2016). Medium credibility.

Clinically important changes were made more often to the reports from urgent investigations. This may be attributed to a higher frequency of new findings in these examinations or to a less favourable working environment of the on-call radiologist. Regardless it is worth considering urgent examinations especially for quality assurance.

This study was limited to the preliminary and final radiology reports, and did not consider any supplementary communication between radiologists and clinicians. Since there is a delay between the first and second reading, second readers may have gained information on patient development through clinical conferences or subsequent investigations, and some report changes may not result from the second reading only.

Another limitation of our study is that the actual impact of the report changes is unknown. It is questionable whether patient records can be relied on to establish this retrospectively. Records may be incomplete regarding decisions and their justifications, and courses of action may change before they are recorded. In the absence of a gold standard we cannot confirm that the second reading was the correct one. There are studies in which discrepancies between preliminary interpretations of residents and final interpretations of staff radiologists have been compared with those of consensus reference panels. The panels confirmed the second reading in 64%–85%, and were more likely to confirm a second reading pointing out false-positive than false-negative and false indeterminate preliminary reports. Accordingly, in some cases report changes may have resulted in increased costs or even harm without benefit to the patient. This underlines the importance of establishing a feedback system involving the first and second readers and of course the clinicians.

We conclude that a 14% rate of clinically important changes made during double reading suggest that some quality assurance of radiological interpretation is justified. Using expert second readers, and targeting urgent cases and radiologists reading outside their specialty may increase the yield of discrepant cases. Establishing additional objective selection criteria would require further studies.

### Lung cancer screening and incidental findings: a research agenda: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^b00efeee]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Knowledge gaps and research opportunities for incidental findings (IFs) in low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung cancer screening (LCS) emphasize the need for standardization: 'There is a lack of straightforward definitions of SIFs identified on LCS LDCT' and 'There is also a knowledge gap in how radiologists apply the directives of Lung-RADS relating to IFs, including the reporting of expected versus unexpected findings and the consistency with which the recommendations of the ACR white papers or other professional societal guidelines are provided by the radiologist to the ordering clinician'. The document underscores that 'Although the current literature identifies wide variation in IF reporting and use of the S modifier, it is impossible to know the extent of variation or to measure the quality of interventions if no universal standard exists', a problem 'further compounded by the lack of standardized severity scoring systems for conditions such as emphysema… or for conditions such as CAC, where several validated severity scoring systems exist but without a consensus as to which system should be used for LDCT done in the context of LCS'. Direction from societies includes 'a general definition of a "clinically significant" finding as having a major or adverse clinical impact or for which there is an established intervention that benefits the patient'. Accordingly, 'There is a pressing need for structured reporting of IFs that will clearly distinguish those that are potentially clinically significant from those that are not, improve the consistency and accuracy of reporting by radiologists, and provide clarity and direction for referring clinicians and patients', and 'Standardization of classification, reporting, and management of IFs has enormous potential to improve the clarity of written communication and clinical care. Moreover, establishing standards will help facilitate research to understand the potential benefits and value and the risks and harms of IFs identified during LCS'.

### Radiologist-initiated double reading of abdominal CT: retrospective analysis of the clinical importance of changes to radiology reports [^06d23e57]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2016). Medium credibility.

Clinical rating

All radiology reports with changes in content beyond simple corrections of misspelling and layout were submitted for clinical rating (figure 1). Two gastrointestinal surgeons independently rated the clinical importance of changes in content to the reports on an ordinal five-point scale. We designed the scale with the intention to be dichotomised in the statistical analysis (figure 2).

Figure 2
Clinical importance of rating scale.

Report changes given discrepant ratings of two or lower by both raters were classified as 'clinically not important' and not resolved further. All discrepancies rated three or higher by at least one rater were resolved by obtaining a clinical rating from a third surgeon, and clinical importance was classified according to the median of the three ratings.

The three raters were specialists in gastrointestinal surgery, all with > 10 years of surgical experience. They made their rating based on the radiology report with colour-coded changes, the referral and the patients' age and gender. To reduce bias, the source hospital of the reports were not disclosed to the raters and reports from the five hospitals were presented in a mixed sequence.

Clinical context

In addition to the rating, the surgeons made written comments about the assumed consequences of the changes they rated clinically important. With the aid of these comments we classified clinically important changes according to the clinical issues concerned. We also distinguished between increased, unchanged and decreased severity of the radiological findings resulting from clinically important changes. Changes considered an increase in severity were additional pathological findings or diagnostic suggestions leading to more comprehensive investigations or treatment. Changes considered a decrease in severity were removal or downgrading of initially reported pathological findings. Some changes could not be classified as either and were labelled unchanged severity.

We wished to explore the impact of reasons for referral on the frequency of clinically important changes. The first author reviewed referrals, and classified reasons for referral into four groups: acute presentations, non-acute presentations, follow-up and investigations after surgery or invasive procedures.

Radiologists

We classified the involved consultant radiologists based on experience as a consultant and subspecialty into four groups: inexperienced (< 3 years as a consultant), general radiologist (≥ 3 years, not working within a limited field of expertise), abdominal radiologist (≥ 3 years, working predominantly with abdominal imaging) and other subspecialist (≥ 3 years, working within any other limited field of expertise).

### ACR practice parameter for communication of diagnostic imaging findings [^0c681594]. ACR (2025). High credibility.

ACR practice parameter — third-party–referred patients explains that it is not unusual for patients to be referred for imaging studies by insurance companies, employers, federal benefits programs, and, in some instances, lawyers, with reports frequently communicated through the requesting entity to a licensed provider or directly to the third-party–designated licensed provider and results then communicated to the patient either directly by the third party or by its designated licensed provider. Regardless of the source of the referral, the interpreting physician should make every possible effort to ensure communication of unexpected or serious findings to the patient, and therefore, in certain situations, it should be considered reasonable for the interpreting physician to communicate the findings directly to the patient.

### Radiologist-initiated double reading of abdominal CT: retrospective analysis of the clinical importance of changes to radiology reports [^0e676a0e]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Misinterpretation of radiological examinations is an important contributing factor to diagnostic errors. Consultant radiologists in Norwegian hospitals frequently request second reads by colleagues in real time. Our objective was to estimate the frequency of clinically important changes to radiology reports produced by these prospectively obtained double readings.

Methods

We retrospectively compared the preliminary and final reports from 1071 consecutive double-read abdominal CT examinations of surgical patients at five public hospitals in Norway. Experienced gastrointestinal surgeons rated the clinical importance of changes from the preliminary to final report. The severity of the radiological findings in clinically important changes was classified as increased, unchanged or decreased.

Results

Changes were classified as clinically important in 146 of 1071 reports (14%). Changes to 3 reports (0.3%) were critical (demanding immediate action), 35 (3%) were major (implying a change in treatment) and 108 (10%) were intermediate (requiring further investigations). The severity of the radiological findings was increased in 118 (81%) of the clinically important changes. Important changes were made less frequently when abdominal radiologists were first readers, more frequently when they were second readers, and more frequently to urgent examinations.

Conclusion

A 14% rate of clinically important changes made during double reading may justify quality assurance of radiological interpretation. Using expert second readers and a targeted selection of urgent cases and radiologists reading outside their specialty may increase the yield of discrepant cases.

### Position statement and best practice recommendations on the imaging use of ultrasound from the European Society of Radiology ultrasound subcommittee [^9845a96c]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

This documentation describing the performance, findings, and outcome of the ultrasound study (the study report) must be filed as a formal part of the patient's permanent medical record, and must be available for consultation to all authorised practitioners involved in the patient's care.

In the case of normal findings, the archived images must show at least one or more suitable planes demonstrating the normal findings relevant to the clinical question. In case of pathological findings, the archived images should ideally show the abnormalities in two planes, or if this is not possible, clearly in one plane (only in B mode). The use of video clips can improve the visualisation of pathology, but at the expense of an increase in the data to be archived.

A question commonly encountered in clinical practice is whether radiologists should communicate the results of an ultrasound examination directly to the patient. There are several possible approaches to this issue, as discussed in the relevant literature. Although this practice may cause some controversy, and variations in practice exist among departments and settings, it is an act of responsibility and respect for radiologists to play a role in communicating imaging results to patients, especially given that we will be dealing with them face to face, if performing the ultrasound study. In order to ensure optimal patient management, such matters should be discussed in advance with referring physicians and a concerted approach should be offered.

### Direct communication between radiologists and patients improves the quality of imaging reports [^6c888229]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We investigate in what percentage of cases and to what extent radiological reports change when radiologists directly communicate with patients after imaging examinations.

Methods

One hundred twenty-two consecutive outpatients undergoing MRI examinations at a single center were prospectively included. Radiological reports of the patients were drafted by two radiologists in consensus using only the clinical information that was made available by the referring physicians. Thereafter, one radiologist talked directly with the patient and recorded the duration of the conversation. Afterwards, the additional information from the patient was used to reevaluate the imaging studies in consensus. The radiologists determined whether the radiological report changed based on additional information and, if yes, to what extent. The degree of change was graded on a 4-point Likert scale (1, non-relevant findings, to 4, highly relevant findings).

Results

Following direct communication (duration 170.9 ± 53.9 s), the radiological reports of 52 patients (42.6%) were changed. Of the 52 patients, the degree of change was classified as grade 1 for 8 patients (15.4%), grade 2 for 27 patients (51.9%), grade 3 for 13 patients (25%), and grade 4 for 4 patients (7.7%). The reasons leading to changes were missing clinical information in 50 cases (96.2%) and the lack of additional external imaging in 2 cases (3.8%).

Conclusions

Radiologists should be aware that a lack of accurate information from the clinician can lead to incorrect radiological reports or diagnosis. Radiologists should communicate directly with patients, especially when the provided information is unclear, as it may significantly alter the radiological report.

Key Points

- Direct communication between radiologists and patients for an average of 170's resulted in a change in the radiological reports of 52 patients (42.6%).
- Of the 42.6% of cases where the reports were changed, the alterations were highly relevant (grades 3 and 4) in 32.7%, indicating major changes with significant impact towards patient management.

### Double reading of current chest CT examinations: clinical importance of changes to radiology reports [^06bb2344]. European Journal of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Misinterpretation of radiological examinations is an important contributing factor to diagnostic errors. Double reading reduces interpretation errors and increases sensitivity. Consultant radiologists in Norwegian hospitals submit 39% of computed tomography (CT) reports for quality assurance by double reading. Our objective was to estimate the proportion of radiology reports that were changed during double reading and to assess the potential clinical impact of these changes.

Materials and Methods

In this retrospective cross-sectional study we acquired preliminary and final reports from 1023 consecutive double read chest CT examinations conducted at five public hospitals. The preliminary and final reports were compared for changes in content. Three experienced pulmonologists independently rated the clinical importance of these changes. The severity of the radiological findings in clinically important changes was classified as increased, unchanged, or decreased.

Results

Changes were classified as clinically important in 91 (9%) of 1023 reports. Of these: 3 were critical (demanding immediate action), 15 were major (implying a change in treatment) and 73 were intermediate (affecting subsequent investigations). More clinically important changes were made to urgent examinations and less to female first readers. Chest radiologist made more clinically important changes than other second readers. The severity of the radiological findings was increased in 73 (80%) of the clinically important changes.

Conclusion

A 9% rate of clinically important changes made during double reading may justify quality assurance of radiological interpretation. Using expert second readers and targeting a selection of urgent cases prospectively may increase the yield of discrepant cases and reduce harm to patients.

- Risks/Benefits
- Information for Patients
- Information for Professionals
- Laws, Regulations & Performance Standards
- Industry Guidance
- Other Resources. Description Medical radiography is a broad term that covers several types of studies that require the visualization of the internal parts of the body using x-ray techniques. For the purposes of this page radiography means a technique for generating and recording an x-ray pattern for the purpose of providing the user with a static image after termination of the exposure. It is differentiated from. fluoroscopy, mammography, and computed tomography which are discussed elsewhere. Radiography may also be used during the planning of radiation therapy treatment.

It is used to diagnose or treat patients by recording images of the internal structure of the body to assess the presence or absence of disease, foreign objects, and structural damage or anomaly. During a radiographic procedure, an x-ray beam is passed through the body. A portion of the x-rays are absorbed or scattered by the internal structure and the remaining x-ray pattern is transmitted to a detector so that an image may be recorded for later evaluation. The recoding of the pattern may occur on film or through electronic means. Uses Radiography is used in many types of examinations and procedures where a record of a static image is desired. Some examples include
- Dental examination
- Verification of correct placement of surgical markers prior to invasive procedures
- Mammography
- Orthopedic evaluations
- Spot film or static recording during fluoroscopy
- Chiropractic examinations.

Risks/Benefits Radiography is a type of x-ray procedure, and it carries the same types of risks as other x-ray procedures. The radiation dose the patient receives varies depending on the individual procedure, but is generally less than that received during fluoroscopy and computed tomography procedures. The major risks associated with radiography are the small possibilities of.
- developing a radiation-induced cancer or cataracts some time later in life, and
- causing a disturbance in the growth or development of an embryo or fetus when performed on a pregnant patient or one of childbearing age. When an individual has a medical need, the benefit of radiography far exceeds the small cancer risk associated with the procedure. Even when radiography is medically necessary, it should use the lowest possible exposure and the minimum number of images. In most cases many of the possible risks can be reduced or eliminated with proper shielding.

### ESUR consensus MRI for endometriosis: indications, reporting, and classifications [^268bff03]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Usefulness of drawings

Radiology is deeply integrated into the patient care pathway and plays a crucial role in shaping the patient experience. All experts have highlighted the importance and value of clear communication with patients. The traditional models of care, where imaging findings were communicated solely between the radiologist and the referring physician, and management decisions were made without patient input, are no longer viable. The concept of the patient as a passive participant in the decision-making process is increasingly unacceptable. Patient-centered care demands that patients be involved in all major decisions, but this involvement is only meaningful if patients are fully informed about all relevant information, including radiology findings.

"Patient-centered care" is a key dimension of quality care. Patients with confirmed endometriosis often express dissatisfaction with their medical support, and a lack of information is the most significant indicator of dissatisfaction with their overall patient experience. Communication, information, and education have been previously identified as critical areas for improvement in endometriosis clinics, as they are highly valued by patients and are frequently perceived negatively. Beyond procedural accuracy, patients place great importance on receiving information and having clear communication with their radiologist, including explanations of results and personal consultations. However, effective communication with patients can be challenging in busy radiology departments, where the focus is often on efficient and accurate diagnosis. Despite this, optimized communication between patients and radiologists is a vital component of delivering patient-centered and value-based care. Therefore, the availability of the radiologist, as well as the tools they use to explain the diagnosis, is of paramount importance and is integral to the concept of value-based radiology.

Furthermore, studies, such as those by Gutzeit et al, report that the opportunity for patients to discuss MRI findings before leaving the department significantly increases their confidence in the radiology service. Good communication with patients, as well as among the healthcare team, has the potential to improve care coordination, enhance safety and outcomes, increase patient satisfaction, and reduce healthcare costs.

In this setting, the role of drawings to illustrate disease mapping is crucial. These drawings significantly aid clinical counseling and, more importantly, surgical planning. They are invaluable for guiding surgeons during complex procedures, making it essential to highlight their importance. This was the main reason for including diagrams in reports.

Among the ESUR expert group, 9/20 experts (45%) use or agreed to use drawings in their report to improve communication with patients (user = 3/20, not yes but will 6/20) (Fig. 4).

### Isolated subsegmental pulmonary embolism identification based on international classification of diseases (ICD)-10 codes and imaging reports [^16a3269d]. Thrombosis Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Isolated subsegmental pulmonary embolism (issPE) is a commonly encountered diagnosis. Although the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes are used for research, their validity for identifying issPE is unknown. Moreover, issPE diagnosis is challenging, and the findings from radiology reports may conflict with those from expert radiologists.

Methods

Based on prespecified criteria, 1734 medical records of adult patients hospitalized within the Mass General Brigham health system (2016–2021) were selected in three equal groups: (1) patients with principal discharge diagnosis codes for PE, (2) patients with secondary discharge diagnosis codes for PE, and (3) patients with no PE codes. The accuracy of ICD-10 codes for issPE was verified by two independent physicians and weighted by total hospitalizations. In a randomly selected sample of 70 patients, the accuracy of initial radiology reports was determined through a blinded re-evaluation by two expert radiologists.

Results

In weighted estimates, ICD-10 codes in primary or secondary discharge positions, compared with chart reviews, showed a low sensitivity (7.0%) and positive predictive value (25.2%). Evaluation by two expert radiologists noted that initial radiology reports were sensitive (97.1%) for issPE but had a low specificity (40.0%). Two (3.6%) out of 55 patients with initial issPE reports did not have PE, while 19 (34.5%) had more proximal PE.

Conclusions

ICD-10 codes for issPE have poor sensitivity and positive predictive value and should not be used for research or quality improvement. Radiology reports for issPE may be inaccurate regarding the location or, less often, the presence of PE.

Objective

Radiology is the specialty of imaging-based diagnostic tests. Understanding the science behind evaluating diagnostic test performance is essential for radiologists because we provide care to patients and interact with our colleagues.

Conclusion

Here, we review the key terminology used and common pitfalls encountered in the literature and in day-to-day discussions of diagnostic test performance.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2019). High credibility.

TAVI/TAVR CT — incidental non-cardiac non-vascular findings: As TAVI/TAVR is increasingly performed in younger, lower-risk patients, incidental CT findings gain importance due to longer life expectancy. All imaging should be reviewed carefully for incidental findings, preferably by trained radiologists as a combined or separate report per local practice, and downstream management will vary by risk profile.

### Communicating with patients in the age of online portals-challenges and opportunities on the horizon for radiologists [^b1778337]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

The deployment of electronic patient portals increasingly allows patients throughout Europe to consult and share their radiology reports and images securely and timely online. Technical solutions and rules for releasing reports and images on patient portals may differ among institutions, regions and countries, and radiologists should therefore be familiar with the criteria by which reports and images are made available to their patients. Radiologists may also be solicited by patients who wish to discuss complex or critical imaging findings directly with the imaging expert who is responsible for the diagnosis. This emphasises the importance of radiologists' communication skills as well as appropriate and efficient communication pathways and methods including electronic tools. Radiologists may also have to think about adapting reports as their final product in order to enable both referrers and patients to understand imaging findings. Actionable reports for a medical audience require structured, organ-specific terms and quantitative information, whereas patient-friendly summaries should preferably be based on consumer health language and include explanatory multimedia support or hyperlinks. Owing to the cultural and linguistic diversity in Europe dedicated solutions will require close collaboration between radiologists, patient representatives and software developers; software tools using artificial intelligence and natural language processing could potentially be useful in this context. By engaging actively in the challenges that are associated with increased communication with their patients, radiologists will not only have the opportunity to contribute to patient-centred care, but also to enhance the clinical relevance and the visibility of their profession.

### ESUR consensus MRI for endometriosis: indications, reporting, and classifications [^59ebdf36]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To propose an update of ESUR endometriosis guidelines to reflect advances in MRI indications, reporting, and classifications.

Methods

The ESUR Research Committee appointed two chairs (I.T.N. L.M.) to supervise the development of the updated guidelines. Following literature research, a survey was delivered to 20 experts in gynecological imaging from 10 countries. Two rounds of surveys were conducted to obtain a consensus according to a Delphi process method. In this article, the results regarding MR indication, the use of standardized reports, and classifications are presented RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended when transvaginal ultrasonography is inconclusive in diagnosing endometriosis or negative, in a symptomatic patient, before surgery or interventional procedure, or after surgical treatment if symptoms persist. ESUR panelists consider the roles of an MR classification: to improve communication between radiologist and surgeon (100%, 20/20) and between the radiologist and the patient (45%, 9/20), to predict operating time if surgery is planned (70%, 14/20), to predict the length of hospital stay after surgery (40%, 8/20), and to predict postoperative complications (70%, 14/20). ESUR panelists strongly agree that using an MR classification is useful (19/20, 95%), especially the radiological score, deep-pelvic endometriosis index (dPEI). Among the ESUR expert group, 9/20 experts (45%) used or agreed to use drawings in their report to improve communication with patients.

Conclusion

Standardized MR reporting is crucial and should include the use of MR classification. Drawings are considered an option, knowing that communication with the patient and surgeon is of paramount importance.

Key Points

Question ESUR's endometriosis guidelines were last published in 2017; an update is provided to reflect advances in MRI indications, reporting, and classifications. Findings MRI is advised for inconclusive/negative transvaginal ultrasound in symptomatic patients, before surgery, or post-treatment if symptoms persist. A structured report enhances communication with surgeons and patients. Clinical relevance A standardized report based on a compartmental analysis of the location of endometriotic nodules, with optional drawings, is essential for comprehensive mapping and optimal communication with both patient and surgeon.

Communication with referrers

The provision of an accurate and timely radiological report is part of a process which requires reliable communication between the referrers, radiology department and reporting radiologists. All have duties in respect of clear communication.
Departmental responsibilities. Clear lines of communication must be inherent in the radiology system. This includes contact details for all referrers and clarity about who is responsible for the clinical care of the patients and how they may be contacted, including in an emergency. Departments (including administrative assistants/medical staff involved in booking/accepting an appointment) should ensure that referrer contact details are available for all patients referred for imaging or interventional procedures.
Referrer responsibility. Referrers have a duty to ensure that accurate patient information is available on the request card or electronic referral, with relevant clinical information and a clear indication of the reason for the investigation, together with their own contact details. The referrers also have a duty to alert radiology departments to safety issues which may affect the examination, such as MR safety hazards and contrast contraindications. Clear examination checklists and the teaching of junior staff can be helpful to promote this. If an individual refers a patient for a radiological test or procedure, this carries with it a duty to ensure that he or she reads the written report which is generated unless he or she has clearly delegated this task to someone else appropriate.
Radiologists' responsibilities Contactability. Radiologists must be contactable for queries related to the appropriateness of different imaging modalities and questions/clarifications related to their reports. It is not possible to always be available, but clear lines of communication within the radiology department, and who is responsible for answering queries, should be apparent to referrers. Direct verbal communication with referrers. This may be necessary in an emergency situation when imaging findings indicate that urgent action needs to be taken. Appropriate local protocols about the circumstances under which direct communication will be initiated, and how it is carried out will ensure that both radiologists and referrers are clear about what the radiologist will undertake as their duty of care. When a radiological finding is communicated verbally, the name of the person contacted should be recorded. A formal written report should still be issued, including details of how the report was verbally communicated and to whom. Clinical radiological meetings. Meetings between referrers/clinical teams can be very useful to focus discussions about patient management. These will often involve images which have already been reported being reviewed. The radiologists in the meeting will convey their own interpretation of the investigation. This may be identical to, or may differ from, the written report. Sometimes interpretation will be different because additional relevant clinical information is available and sometimes an error or misinterpretation in the original report will be revealed. Where there is a difference of opinion from the original report, appropriate action should be taken, such as adding an addendum to the report, or following the local protocol for dealing with error or discrepancy in the reporting opinion. Written communication. The ESR has issued broad guidelines on reporting. In summary, reports should be structured into sections on clinical details, technique, imaging findings and conclusion. It is not possible to detail the 'perfect' report because this will depend on referrer expectation as well as radiologists' varying opinions, but there is evidence that long free text reports which do not reach a clear conclusion are those that are least favoured by referrers.

### ACR practice parameter for communication of diagnostic imaging findings [^3af62e0f]. ACR (2025). High credibility.

ACR practice parameter — communication of diagnostic imaging findings emphasizes that Practice Parameters and Technical Standards are not inflexible rules or requirements of practice and are not intended, nor should they be used, to establish a legal standard of care. It permits professional judgment, noting that a conscientious practitioner may responsibly adopt a course of action different from that set forth in this document and that a practitioner who employs an approach substantially different from the guidance in this document may consider documenting in the patient record information sufficient to explain the approach taken. Therefore, it should be recognized that adherence to the guidance in this document will not assure an accurate diagnosis or a successful outcome. The introduction underscores core principles: Effective communication is a critical component of diagnostic imaging, and Quality patient care can only be achieved when study results are conveyed in a timely fashion to the patient and to those responsible for treatment decisions. An effective method of communication should 1) promote optimal patient care and support the referring physician/ health care provider in this endeavor, 2) be tailored to satisfy the need for timeliness, and 3) minimize the risk of communication errors, while recognizing that various factors and circumstances unique to a clinical scenario may influence the methods of communication between interpreting physicians and referring physicians/health care providers.

### A comparison of the accuracy of ultrasound and computed tomography in common diagnoses causing acute abdominal pain [^21a13be0]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Comparisons of CT accuracy between residents and radiologists or between CT reading after hours and during daytime were not considered meaningful, because residents were always supervised by a radiologist during daytime. The diagnosis recorded on the case record form by the supervised resident, for both CT and ultrasound, can be considered as a consensus diagnosis. CT scans of patients evaluated after hours were always re-evaluated the next day by a radiologist. For radiologists inter-observer agreement for abdominal CT is known to be good.

This study was aimed at evaluating ultrasound and CT in daily practice in six institutions. A considerable number of observers contributed, with a wide variety of experience. Although one could object that this may have negatively influenced accuracy, our study probably reflects daily practice better than studies where all patients were evaluated by one or two very experienced observers. It is a well known phenomenon that the diagnostic accuracy reported in the literature can be higher than that in an average hospital, not only because tests in research settings are often evaluated by experienced observers, but also because standardised record forms are used in studies to minimise the number of indeterminate findings.

With this study no specific set of criteria was provided to the observers from which a diagnosis was supposed to be made. Instead the observers assigned their ultrasound or CT diagnoses based on imaging findings in combination with the clinical information provided by the treating physician. This way of evaluating imaging examinations reflects daily practice.

We relied on an expert panel to assign the final diagnoses. This clinical reference standard may imply a form of incorporation bias, as the experts had access to all available information, including imaging findings. In this study population, with a wide variety of possible diagnoses, it is impossible to use a single reference standard, and the use of a panel is an appropriate alternative in a setting with multiple possible underlying diseases. Our experts had access to extensive clinical information, including follow-up. A final diagnosis of acute appendicitis was based on histopathology in 95% of the cases, while the remaining 5% had undergone conservative therapy or percutaneous drainage of peri-appendiceal abscess.

### Justification of CT for individual health assessment of asymptomatic persons: a World Health Organization consultation [^23c55246]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Social Ethics, Public Health, and Resource Considerations

Ethics and resource considerations are important, as are concerns about false positives and incidental findings and the aspiration that radiological IHA should yield a social dividend. The principles of ICRP (particularly justification and optimization) must be implemented taking due account of the values noted in Table 1. For example, the importance of Beneficence/Nonmaleficence arises immediately in IHA. This provides a transparent basis for judgment. It must be balanced against the importance of giving appropriate weight to the dignity and autonomy of the presenter, particularly if the presenter is among the worried well.

Patient autonomy and physician paternalism will be important counterpoints in shaping the future of radiological IHA. Respect for both "patient rights" and "physician duties" are essential. Physicians have many duties, including duty of care, fiduciary duty, duty to obtain consent, and duty to disclose without being specifically questioned. Radiological medical practitioners' duties include, in addition, an obligation to provide CT services in a regulated environment, and a duty of care in respect of the technical performance of examinations. Radiological practitioners must, ideally, make every effort to ensure the right image is obtained at the right dose for the right patient, even in IHA. Sometimes the right image may be no image, when there is no foreseeable benefit to the procedure. Many ultimately feel the value of do no harm trumps individual autonomy, as the latter can lead to unnecessary and/or inappropriate risk of probable harm.

The other values in Table 1 also have an impact. For example, prudence creates a requirement to review the risks and benefits to both the individual and society. Likewise, there are imperatives from justice, particularly in respect of a fair distribution of services. Where a practitioner has a conflict of interest related to their IHA practice, it must be disclosed to presenters.

More generally, justice and honesty require that the resources committed to IHA, and the consequences of conducting it, especially in respect of incidental/equivocal findings and false positives, must be reviewed. The charges involved may not arise in the clinic in which the IHA was conducted and may be diverted into the general health care system, often in the public sector. Thus, follow-up of IHA can potentially divert resources from more needy patients and add to inequality, often with little gain in real health outcomes.

### The role of radiologist in the changing world of healthcare: a white paper of the European Society of Radiology (ESR) [^3fc484b9]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Radiology as a specialty has been enormously successful since its beginnings, moving over time from an adjunct to clinical decision-making to a crucial component of multidisciplinary patient care. However, this increased centrality of radiology and reliance on our services carries within it dangers, prominent among them being the danger of our being viewed as deliverers of a commodity, and the risk of our becoming overwhelmed by increasing workload, unable to interact sufficiently with patients and referrers due to pressure of work. With this White Paper, the Board of Directors of the European Society of Radiology (ESR) seeks to briefly explain the position of the radiologist in the modern healthcare environment, considering our duties and contributions as doctors, protectors, communicators, innovators, scientists and teachers. This statement is intended to serve as a summary of the breadth of our responsibilities and roles, and to assist radiologists in countering misunderstanding of who we are and what we do.

### Why don't we inform patients about the risk of diagnostic errors? [^6b54bb7b]. European Journal of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The principles of autonomy and informed consent dictate that patients who undergo a radiological examination should actually be informed about the risk of diagnostic errors. Implementing such a policy could potentially increase the quality of care. However, due to the vast number of radiological examinations that are performed in each hospital each day, financial constraints, and the risk of losing trust, patients, and income if the requirement for informed consent is not imposed by law on a state or national level, it may be challenging to inform patients about the risk of diagnostic errors. Future research is necessary to determine if and how an informed consent procedure for diagnostic errors can be implemented in clinical practice.

Results

Pathology distribution

The analysis of pathology distribution at the UKE was extracted by manually annotating 600 CXR reports from August 2016 to February 2019 by an expert radiologist (i.e. 5 years of CXR reporting). These CXRs include all kinds of study types and different degrees of disease manifestation. Due to a mainly stationary patient collective from a large care hospital (i.e. larger institution with more than 1000 beds), the portion of CXR without pathological findings was only 31%. The prevalence of the most critical finding "pneumothorax" was around 3.8%. Results are demonstrated in Table 1.

CXR generation and reporting time analysis

We used the metadata of 1408 examinations (i.e. including all kinds of CXR studies) from the UKE to determine a discrete distribution of CXR generation and a radiologist's reporting speed. The examinations were from two different and non-consecutive weeks from Monday 00:00 AM until Sunday 00:00 PM. For CXR generation speed, we used the creation timestamp of two consecutive CXRs to calculate the delta between their creations. The delta represents the acquisition rate of CXRs at the institution. We employed the same method for the reporting speed. Here, we used the report finalization timestamp to determine the delta between two CXRs. Afterwards, we removed all deltas greater than 2 h 30 min, to ensure outliers are only found in one of the two distributions.

Hospital's report turnaround time analysis

The average RTAT for a CXR, measured over two different and non-consecutive weeks (1408 examinations), was 80 min with a range between 1 and 1041 min. Assuming that a CXR report by an experienced radiologist will only take several minutes, this range in reporting time can be explained by different external influences, such as night shifts, change of shifts, working breaks, or backlogs.

### Making the best value of clinical radiology: iRefer guidelines, 8th edition [^3b147fa7]. Clinical Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

New uses of medical imaging as well as over-diagnosis and wasteful imaging have led to a 10% per annum growth in computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Personalised value to the patient will be helped by referral guidelines for the best test first, adding evidence-based technical value to the investigation to answer the clinical question, thus providing allocative value to the commissioners of medical imaging. Appropriate imaging is driven by the need for effective decisions, radiation safety, and cost awareness. The eighth edition of The Royal College of Radiologists' iRefer guidelines addresses 270 common clinical settings providing imaging referral advice, particularly for primary care practitioners. There is a new section addressing asymptomatic individuals for screening and health assessment. Multiple formats, including print and web formats, will be augmented by a clinical decision support tool to bring guidance closer to referrers. Established evidence identified a reduction in requested examination numbers by typically 20%, with more recent studies showing appropriate imaging in 80–90% of cases, correctly allowing some flexibility for individual circumstances. The perceived value of referral guidance may be judged by the mandated use in the USA, the requirement for availability in Europe, and the wish by many elsewhere to avail their patients of best imaging practice.

### The role of chest imaging in patient management during the COVID-19 pandemic: a multinational consensus statement from the Fleischner society [^154138e6]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Fleischner Society COVID-19 chest imaging consensus — conclusion states that this statement is intended to offer guidance to physicians on the use of thoracic imaging across a breadth of health care environments and represents the collective opinions and perspectives of thoracic radiology, pulmonology, intensive care, emergency medicine, laboratory medicine, and infection control experts practicing in 10 countries. It notes that the evidence base supporting the use of imaging across the scenarios presented is scant and that the advice may undergo refinement through rigorous scientific investigation, and also states that at the time of writing no therapy has been confirmed to alter the course of COVID-19, there is no known cure, and there is no vaccine for prevention. It adds that as effective treatments are developed, thoracic imaging may find new roles by establishing treatment response or characterizing patients as likely responders to novel therapies.

### Performance of AI to exclude normal chest radiographs to reduce radiologists' workload [^fd759724]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Ethics approval statement

Ethical approval will be waived as this is retrospective use of clinically acquired data (local institution review board approval number 2023–16333). Radiographs and reports were anonymized before analysis. This manuscript was prepared according to the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies checklist.

Study population

All consecutive chest radiographs and their radiological reports between 1st October 2016 and 14th October 2016 were retrospectively collected from an academic hospital (Radboudumc, Nijmegen, The Netherlands) and a large community hospital (Jeroen Bosch Hospital, 's Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands). The study population included inpatient, outpatient, and emergency chest radiographs. Only the first initial exam in our inclusion period for each patient was included to prevent bias of multiple exams from the same patient. Patients could have had prior exams before the inclusion period. Bedside radiographs, pediatric and incomplete visualized chests, as well as the radiographs imported from other hospitals were excluded, based on DICOM tags or visual inspection.

Reference standard

The reference standard was set by three chest radiologists (S.S. 9 years of experience; B.G. 12 years of experience; L.P.B. 20 years of experience) who independently reviewed the exams with both the PA and lateral radiograph (when available). In this setup there was no access to AI results, prior and follow-up CXR and/or chest CT exams. However, the radiologists had access to the original report, including medical history and indication. No AI software has been used at the time of original reporting of the chest radiographs included in this study.

The radiologists categorized the chest radiographs into the following clinical categories: normal, clinically irrelevant findings (e.g. medical devices), clinically relevant findings (e.g. cardiomegaly), urgent findings (e.g. air space consolidation), and critical findings (e.g. pneumothorax). The majority vote was used to assign the clinical categories to the chest radiographs. When no majority was reached, the mean category (where normal represents a score of 1, and critical findings a score of 5) of the three raters was used. All findings and their corresponding clinical category can be found in Table 1.

### Types of evidence needed to assess the clinical value of diagnostic imaging [^9e564b0f]. NEJM Evidence (2024). Medium credibility.

AbstractThe evidence underlying the use of advanced diagnostic imaging is based mainly on diagnostic accuracy studies and not on well-designed trials demonstrating improved patient outcomes. This has led to an expansion of low-value and potentially harmful patient care and raises ethical issues around the widespread implementation of tests with incompletely known benefits and harms. Randomized clinical trials are needed to support the safety and effectiveness of imaging tests and should be required for clearance of most new technologies. Large, diverse cohort studies are needed to quantify disease risk associated with many imaging findings, especially incidental findings, to enable evidence-based management. The responsibility to minimize the use of tests with unknown or low value requires engagement of clinicians, medical societies, and the public.

### Evaluation of radiologist interpretive performance using blinded reads by multiple external readers [^dd8f2d4f]. Investigative Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To demonstrate a method of assessing radiologic diagnostic agreement utilizing multiple blinded external readers.

Methods

Six body CT studies interpreted by one reader (primary reader) at the host institution were compiled with patient identifiers removed. Brief clinical histories that were available to the primary reader were provided. Radiologists at 22 centers participated and the interpretations were analyzed in aggregate with the consensus majority that served as the surrogate gold standard for each case.

Results

A total of 31 radiologists formed the group of secondary readers with two-thirds in academic practice averaging 8 years of experience (range: 1–25 years). The average findings per reader for cases A to F include: 1.9 (range: 1–5), 6.3 (range: 2–10), 10.4 (range: 7–14), 5.7 (range: 3–10), 4.2 (range: 2–8), and 3.8 (range: 1–7), respectively. There was agreement of the primary interpretation and the surrogate gold standard for each case.

Conclusions

The results of our study demonstrate a wide range of interpretation, with wider ranges observed in more complex cases and with vague clinical complaints. Comparison to the primary reader required the use of aggregate analysis and an agreement percentage cutoff to minimize bias and the limitations of this type of study. An intensive evaluation of radiologist performance such as this could be considered in various settings such as a quality assurance program, intense scrutiny of an individual radiologist whether competency is in question, or for medicolegal purpose to ascertain standard of care.

### ESUR consensus MRI for endometriosis: indications, reporting, and classifications [^74b01da4]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To propose an update of ESUR endometriosis guidelines to reflect advances in MRI indications, reporting, and classifications.

Methods

The ESUR Research Committee appointed two chairs (I.T.N. L.M.) to supervise the development of the updated guidelines. Following literature research, a survey was delivered to 20 experts in gynecological imaging from 10 countries. Two rounds of surveys were conducted to obtain a consensus according to a Delphi process method. In this article, the results regarding MR indication, the use of standardized reports, and classifications are presented

Results

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended when transvaginal ultrasonography is inconclusive in diagnosing endometriosis or negative, in a symptomatic patient, before surgery or interventional procedure, or after surgical treatment if symptoms persist. ESUR panelists consider the roles of an MR classification: to improve communication between radiologist and surgeon (100%, 20/20) and between the radiologist and the patient (45%, 9/20), to predict operating time if surgery is planned (70%, 14/20), to predict the length of hospital stay after surgery (40%, 8/20), and to predict postoperative complications (70%, 14/20). ESUR panelists strongly agree that using an MR classification is useful (19/20, 95%), especially the radiological score, deep-pelvic endometriosis index (dPEI). Among the ESUR expert group, 9/20 experts (45%) used or agreed to use drawings in their report to improve communication with patients.

Conclusion

Standardized MR reporting is crucial and should include the use of MR classification. Drawings are considered an option, knowing that communication with the patient and surgeon is of paramount importance.

Key Points

Question ESUR's endometriosis guidelines were last published in 2017; an update is provided to reflect advances in MRI indications, reporting, and classifications.

Findings MRI is advised for inconclusive/negative transvaginal ultrasound in symptomatic patients, before surgery, or post-treatment if symptoms persist. A structured report enhances communication with surgeons and patients.

Clinical relevance A standardized report based on a compartmental analysis of the location of endometriotic nodules, with optional drawings, is essential for comprehensive mapping and optimal communication with both patient and surgeon.

### Best practices guidelines for trauma center recognition of child abuse, elder abuse, and intimate partner violence [^363eff4c]. ACS (2019). High credibility.

Child abuse — interpretation of imaging findings notes that PCA patients are often treated at pediatric trauma centers after imaging is performed and evaluated at a referring facility. Be sure to document the results of imaging studies performed at outside hospitals, including the source of the image interpretation (radiology report from referring hospital, neurosurgeon interpretation at the trauma center, or the health professional's own interpretation). Formal reads by a pediatric radiologist are recommended to avoid questions of reliability raised by different interpretations.

### Summary of the proceedings of the international forum 2016: "Imaging referral guidelines and clinical decision support-how can radiologists implement imaging referral guidelines in clinical routine? " [^d12d64c0]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The need for the implementation of imaging referral guidelines in clinical routine is recognized among the radiology community worldwide, and the process is most advanced in the USA and the European Union.

The expected benefits are improved appropriateness in medical imaging referrals, reduction in unnecessary radiation exposure, a more reliable justification process, better accountability through a structured workflow, and a streamlined clinical workflow. The educational benefits will be obtained through the feedback on appropriateness of selected exams and new insights through data collection and reporting. The system will help to demonstrate the utility of imaging equipment and will potentially highlight a lack in quality or availability.

### Radiologists' responses to inadequate referrals [^b1fb60da]. European Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate radiologists' responses to inadequate imaging referrals.

Methods

A survey was mailed to Norwegian radiologists; 69% responded. They graded the frequencies of actions related to referrals with ambiguous indications or inappropriate examination choices and the contribution of factors preventing and not preventing an examination of doubtful usefulness from being performed as requested.

Results

Ninety-five percent (344/361) reported daily or weekly actions related to inadequate referrals. Actions differed among subspecialties. The most frequent were contacting the referrer to clarify the clinical problem and checking test results/information in the medical records. Both actions were more frequent among registrars than specialists and among hospital radiologists than institute radiologists. Institute radiologists were more likely to ask the patient for additional information and to examine the patient clinically. Factors rated as contributing most to prevent doubtful examinations were high risk of serious complications/side effects, high radiation dose and low patient age. Factors facilitating doubtful examinations included respect for the referrer's judgment, patient/next-of-kin wants the examination, patient has arrived, unreachable referrer, and time pressure.

Conclusions

In summary, radiologists facing inadequate referrals considered patient safety and sought more information. Vetting referrals on arrival, easier access to referring clinicians, and time for radiologists to handle inadequate referrals may contribute to improved use of imaging.

### Postprocedure radiologist's interpretation of ERCP X-ray films: a prospective outcomes study [^fa27a389]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To prospectively determine if the current practice of radiologists' interpretation of post-ERCP spot images sent by endoscopists resulted in discrepancies in interpretation, affected subsequent management of patients, and resulted in additional costs.

Methods

A prospective analysis of 145 consecutive patients who underwent ERCP over the course of 4 months was performed. A separate endoscopist, not involved in the patient's care, reviewed the radiologist's report of the ERCP x-ray films to determine whether there was either concordance or discordance with the procedural findings. All patients' clinical courses were prospectively followed for a minimum of 6 months to determine whether clinical decision-making was affected by the radiologists' interpretation of the x-ray films. Secondarily, the cost of the current practice of postprocedure interpretation of ECRP radiographs was measured.

Setting

This study took place at University Hospitals of Cleveland, which is a tertiary care facility.

Results

In total, there were 61 (47%) discordant interpretations of 130 cholangiograms and 27 (38%) discordant interpretations of 72 pancreatograms, with an overall discordance between an endoscopist and a radiologist in 80 (55%) of the 145 cases. Clinical management was subsequently affected in 3 (2.1%) cases, all of which involved a discordant reading. In each of the 3 cases, further testing validated the gastroenterologist's initial findings at the time of the procedure. Radiologists were reimbursed $5395 for interpretation of ERCP x-ray films. Extrapolated over the course of a year, the reimbursement at this single tertiary care hospital would be greater than $16,000. Additional testing based on discordant reports resulted in $2510 of reimbursement for 3 patients.

Limitation

The limitation of this study is that it reflects data from only one academic institution.

Conclusions

Radiologists' interpretation of postprocedure ERCP films were inadequate, with a 47% discordance rate among cholangiograms and a 38% discordance rate among pancreatograms. The routine practice of postprocedure ERCP x-ray film interpretation by radiologists altered clinical practice in 2.1% of cases; subsequent care did not confirm radiologists' findings and imparted increased risk to the patients. This practice proved to be a misallocation of resources and should not be continued.

### Optimizing advanced imaging of the pediatric patient in the emergency department: technical report [^ed6a5696]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric subspecialty consultation — Patients often receive advanced imaging and are subsequently transferred to have their diagnostic imaging studies reviewed by a pediatric radiologist or other pediatric medical subspecialist (for example, plastic surgery or otolaryngology), and because many imaging findings may not be clinically significant, referring facilities could partner with pediatric hospitals to allow near real-time review of outside images.

### Smart chest X-ray worklist prioritization using artificial intelligence: a clinical workflow simulation [^78d102b4]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Unlike previous publications, we included in- as well as outpatients, as in the daily reporting routine at the UKE, all CXRs are sorted into one worklist. Furthermore, we observed substantially shorter backlogs of unreported examinations compared to published data from the UK.

In healthcare systems where patients and referring physicians are waiting for reports up to days or weeks, or have limited access to expert radiologists, the benefit of a smart worklist prioritization could obviously be greater than in countries with a well-developed health system. The longer the reporting backlogs, the more likely it is that referring physicians will try to rule out critical findings in CXRs themselves. This poses the risk that subtle findings with potentially large clinical impact (e.g. pneumothorax) are overlooked and that the discovery by a radiologist is postponed for a negligently long time period.

One limitation of our study is that the Open-i dataset, which our CNN was trained on, mainly included outpatients in contrast to the predominantly stationary patient collective of the hospital. Therefore, the performance of our algorithm, which was already strong compared to other publications, cannot be directly transferred to our hospital-specific patient collective and will most likely decrease. However, we note that the priority-based scheduling algorithm developed in this work is generic and can use any CNN that classifies chest X-ray pathologies. If the CNN classifier is improved, the scheduling algorithm will be directly benefited.

In the future, we want to include more pathologies and different degrees of manifestation to further improve the gain of a smart worklist prioritization. While we only focused on the eight most common findings in a CXR at the UKE and ranked them accordingly, a large atelectasis, for example, can put patients' health more at risk than a small pleural effusion. Furthermore, we want to investigate other clinical workflows where pre-prioritization is done according to inpatient, outpatient, and accident and emergency.

Overall, the application of smart worklist prioritization by artificial intelligence shows great potential to optimize clinical workflows and can significantly improve patient safety in the future. Our clinical workflow simulations suggest that triaging tools should be customized on the basis of local clinical circumstances and needs.

### Steps to misdiagnosis: dissecting an emergency visit [^464a2e17]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Despite the common sense that we learn from our mistakes, an error is an unwelcome event when we deal with patients. Diagnostic error is common, costly, and the leading cause of malpractice litigation. Yet, errors occur occasionally in a lifetime of practice, and the consequences of these faults are significant for patients and physicians. If someone would have told me that I would miss a brain tumor in my first years of practice, in a patient presenting to my care with several cranial nerve signs, I would not have believed it. Here is how it happened.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of sacroiliitis in children: frequency of findings and interobserver reliability [^2636f4ba]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

There is limited discussion about the need for more standardised reporting. As these MRIs are frequently performed in patients with JIA with no symptoms of sacroiliitis, radiologists' reports influence management decisions. We suspect that current practice is to overcall findings and overdiagnose sacroiliitis on MRI in children. Using a pictorial reporting pro forma, which categorizes MRI features of sacroiliitis by the appropriate sequence as used in this study may help improve consistency in reporting and would allow internal and external inter-reader agreement in greater numbers of reporters across hospitals. In the absence of a gold standard, radiologists must improve reliability based on agreed criteria. In addition, consensus and expert groups should create strict imaging definitions to improve agreement.

Limitations

Despite a 3-year study period, there was a low number of positive MRI cases. However, to the best of our knowledge, the patient cohort was one of the largest in the literature. The low frequency of cases reflects the expected frequency of sacroiliitis in this patient group. The Cohen kappa was used to calculate interobserver agreement. Using the Randolph free marginal kappa to account for the low frequency of positive cases was considered, but it was decided that agreement on large numbers of negative scans would falsely increase interobserver agreement. Finally, the retrospective nature of the study and lack of clinicopathological correlation with MRI findings is a universal limitation of determining the accuracy of MRI for diagnosing sacroiliitis. As there is no gold standard for diagnosis, the possibility of overdiagnosis in this study is also possible. MRI findings were not correlated with clinical findings because these are considered unreliable and would not be standardised as part of a retrospective study. These factors make determination of reliability of MRI findings even more important.

### Learning from medical litigation | JCO oncology practice… [^870ebba0]. ASCO (2023). Medium credibility.

Similar trends are being seen in China where medical malpractice claims in grade A tertiary hospitals have increased since 2008, a trend which accelerated in 2014 and was mirrored by a continuously rising average payment per claim. 12 How are these trends impacting cancer care. A number of specialties are often seen as classically high-risk for malpractice claims, obstetrics and gynecology, surgery, and emergency medicine. Breast cancer is the most common malignancy involved in malpractice claims in the United States. 17Breast cancer claims have been found to arise most often from delay in diagnosis and most commonly involve radiologists, followed by general surgeons, and the median award amounts varied from $978, 858 to $1, 800, 000. 17-20A 20-year review of US colorectal cancer cases highlighted that diagnostic error was the commonest cause for litigation. Primary care physicians were most commonly named, followed by gastroenterologists and general surgeons.

21In dermatological, head and neck, oral, and oropharyngeal malignancies failure to diagnose was again the most commonly alleged reason for litigation. 22, 23. Although under or delayed diagnosis is a significant medicolegal risk, fear of litigation can also lead to defensive medical practices. Surveys of pathologists have shown that concerns regarding malpractice increased their likelihood of diagnosing malignancy in equivocal lesions such as breast or pigmented skin lesions. 24, 25Defensive medicine is hypothesized to be a major cause of unnecessary diagnostic testing and subsequent overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer. 26A review of malpractice in pancreaticoduodenectomy cases found that the most common cause of alleged negligence was unnecessary surgery and often also alleging misdiagnosis.
27. Malpractice litigation has a profound impact on the feasibility of cancer screening programmes.

Wilson and Jungner's 281968 principles of screening remain the foundation of many global screening programmes. One of the 10 principles states that "the cost of casefinding should be economically balanced in relation to possible expenditure on medical care as a whole. " Balancing this cost is difficult, and the growing financial burden of malpractice claims threatens the viability of cancer screening programmes. Mammography is one of the most common areas of medical litigation among adults, and this is affecting breast cancer screening negatively because of its increasing costs and its deterrent impact on recruitment of radiologists. Survey-based studies have found that one in three radiologists is considering withdrawing from mammogram interpretation because of medical malpractice concerns. 29-32In Ireland, there have been more than 360 claims filed against the National Cervical Cancer Screening Programme, CervicalCheck.

33 Consequently, owing to concerns that both erosion of public trust and litigation pose a threat to the viability of screening services globally, the International Agency for Research on Cancer is conducting a review into Ireland's cancer screening programmes. 34 Aside from the financial consequences of medical litigation on cancer care, the adversarial nature of the legal process can have profound effects on both the plaintiff and medical practitioner. For the former, the process can cause upset, distress, pain, anger, disappointment, and anxiety. One Irish lawyer commented that they had never seen "a plaintiff when they win… I don't think I've ever seen a plaintiff come out and say. 'That was really worth it. '". 35For the medical professional, the emotional and psychological impact can progress from initial shock and worry to profound numbness, guilt, and isolation.

### Extraurinary incidental findings on CT for hematuria: the radiologist's role and downstream cost analysis [^f8532ad0]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The purposes of this study of patients who underwent CT for hematuria were to understand how radiologists' recommendations regarding incidental findings affect their management, assess long-term outcomes from important incidental findings, and calculate estimates of downstream costs.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective analysis was performed of 1295 patients who underwent CT for hematuria from 2004 to 2006 at our institution. Incidental findings outside the urinary tract were recorded and imaging reports categorized on the basis of recommendations, interpretations, and actions of radiologists. Patients with important incidental findings were followed for 6–8 years. Costs related to incidental findings were estimated and tallied.

Results

Two hundred fourteen important findings were found in 143 of 1295 patients, with 93 patients undergoing clinical follow-up, including 30 patients who underwent invasive procedures leading to 154 hospital days and 16 operations (group 1). In 63 patients, no invasive procedures were performed (group 2). Costs were higher in group 1 than in group 2, and the average per-patient cost for all 1295 patients was $385. In group 1, 95% of recommendations were followed compared with 80% in group 2. There was probable therapeutic benefit in 25 of 143 (17%) patients. There were serious complications in six of 143 (4.2%) patients, including death in two of 143 (1.4%).

Conclusion

Radiologists' recommendations were generally followed for important incidental findings. These recommendations can direct the most cost-efficient and effective care for incidental findings. Although some patients with incidental findings had probable benefit, others incurred morbidity or mortality. A small number of invasive procedures resulted in substantial costs in this symptomatic population. Costs averaged over the entire population were higher than have been previously reported.

### Improving justification of medical exposures using ionising radiation: considerations and approaches from the European Society of Radiology [^20b8fe21]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

There will however be circumstances where it becomes apparent that some imaging procedures within a care pathway do not provide useful information for a specific patient and the imaging investigation should not be performed. Examples include patients whose clinical condition is resolved before the end of the pathway, either by cure or by a failure to respond as expected.

In such cases, actively reviewing or de-justifying exposures within a pathway may become an important activity, saving radiation exposure, reducing interventions for individual patients and freeing up resources for others. This would require radiologist input or agreement and would mark a significant difference in the way justification processes are seen today. In most cases, changes to initial justification of individual exposures within a pre-agreed series would require medical knowledge and could be performed and documented when considering individual imaging requests or preferably as part of multi-disciplinary meetings attended by a range of medical specialists involved in the care of a specific patient. The role of radiologists in such meetings is well established in most of Europe and even mandatory in Cancer care in some countries (in France for example).

Dependency of clinicians on radiologists: radiography

40.6% of clinicians indicated to interpret more than half of radiographs completely by themselves (i.e. without consulting a radiologist or reading the radiology report). In addition, 9.0% reported to never consult a radiologist or read a radiology report for the interpretation of a radiograph (Table 3). Clinicians working in surgical specialties (β coefficient of 1.238, 95% CI: 0.602 to 1.875, p < 0.001) and clinicians working in Asia (β coefficient of 1.304, 95% CI: 0.506 to 2.101, p = 0.001) were significantly less dependent on radiologists in interpreting radiographs than those working in non-surgical specialties and those working in Europe.

For each patient it is essential to ensure the following:
The patient has the right information to make a decision;
The information has been presented in a way that the patient can understand;
The patient has shared in the process of decision making and agrees with the outcome.

There are a number of considerations to take account of when obtaining consent as highlighted in Fig. 1.

Legal Issues The patient must be in possession of all the information to make the decision and to be able to do this voluntarily without pressure from external sources.
Advocacy It is important that patients have access to the right support to enable them to make their decision. A HCP has the responsibility to identify when a patient may require support and for someone to 'speak on their behalf'.
Shared decision-making The process of consent should be flexible to suit the patient's needs; it is not a rigid process and time must be allowed for patients to assimilate information prior to being asked to make a decision. The process must be personalised to meet the individual's needs.
Capacity Every person has the right to make a decision and it must be assumed that they have the capacity to do so. Where decisions need to be taken on behalf of an individual this must be done with the interests of the individual being at the centre. It is essential that each professional undertaking the process of obtaining consent is up to date with the national laws in their country and hospital processes with regard to this.
Communication of risk and benefit The involved healthcare professionals must inform the individual (or, where appropriate, their carer) of the risks and benefits of the examination and in doing so explain the risks of not having the imaging examination, in a form understandable to the patient. Where possible, patients should be given sufficient time to consider this information fully, before proceeding. Practitioners must respect the patient's wishes. Many radiological examinations carry a risk. The risks related to radiation exposure and other risks depending upon the examination, for example invasive techniques, should be explained in an understandable form for the patient (e.g. comparative information about the proposed investigation radiation dose in relation to background radiation compared to when flying in an aeroplane). Written information is valuable and can be used by the patient in discussion with their families and carers prior to consenting to the process.
Practicalities of the consent process Professionals must follow their hospital and national laws in relation to the practicalities of the consent process. Consent can take verbal and written forms and must take account of paperless systems. Details of the consent process must be fully recorded. Obtaining consent for procedures is a shared responsibility, involving the referring clinician and radiology department personnel; the balance of responsibilities will depend on specific circumstances and working arrangements.

### Balancing the legal risk to the clinician with the medical interests of the patient [^f4eff93e]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

The balance between risk of missing serious disease and potential harms from over testing involves knowledge of the literature, familiarity of clinical guidelines, incorporation of clinical decision tools where appropriate, use of metacognition to be aware of cognitive decisions to respond and use of shared decision-making in the context of a patient's presentation and with the guidance of the clinician.

### The patient is in: patient involvement strategies for diagnostic error mitigation [^c4fc37dc]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2013). Medium credibility.

Although healthcare quality and patient safety have longstanding international attention, the target of reducing diagnostic errors has only recently gained prominence, even though numerous patients, families and professional caregivers have suffered from diagnostic mishaps for a long time. Similarly, patients have always been involved in their own care to some extent, but only recently have patients sought more opportunities for engagement and participation in healthcare improvements. This paper brings these two promising trends together, analysing strategies for patient involvement in reducing diagnostic errors in an individual's own care, in improving the healthcare delivery system's diagnostic safety, and in contributing to research and policy development on diagnosis-related issues.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^ecd6a65a]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation strength interpretation — language cues and definitions: Strong and moderate recommendations are associated with "should" and "should not" statements, whereas a weak recommendation may be recognized by "may" or "need not". A strong recommendation means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms (or, for a strong negative recommendation, the harms clearly exceed the benefits) and the supporting evidence quality is excellent; clinicians are advised to follow such guidance unless a clear and compelling rationale for acting in a contrary manner is present. A moderate recommendation means the committee believes benefits exceed harms (or harms exceed benefits for a negative recommendation) but the evidence on which the recommendation is based is not as strong, and clinicians are encouraged to follow such guidance while remaining alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. A weak recommendation means the existing evidence quality is suspect or well-designed, well-conducted studies have shown little clear advantage to one approach versus another, offering clinicians flexibility in decision-making, although boundaries on alternatives may be set.

### Navigating malpractice: guide for U.S. radiologists [^16a7b3d0]. Radiographics (2025). Medium credibility.

The majority of radiologists will face litigation in their careers, yet it remains an uncommon topic for training programs and educational conferences. The authors explore the landscape of radiology malpractice litigation to equip radiologists with essential knowledge before and in the event of a lawsuit. Radiologists should understand the four components necessary to be found liable for medical negligence: patient duty, breach of standard of care, injury, and proximate causality between the breach of standard of care and the injury. The authors introduce the mechanics of a lawsuit, common causes of lawsuits, and factors affecting risk. Many current radiologic norms and standards derive from legal precedent; examining these precedents and their effects on current practice through the context of prior litigated cases can help radiologists understand their evolving roles and responsibilities. Ultimately, 63% of malpractice claims are dismissed or dropped, 28% reach settlement agreements, and the remaining claims proceed to trial, where most result in defense wins. Radiologists should be familiar with common practices that may affect their legal risk, as well as potential misunderstandings regarding the discoverability of morbidity and mortality conferences, tumor boards, and other interdisciplinary conferences. Although litigation may not always be preventable, radiologists who understand the U.S. malpractice and medicolegal environment will be better positioned to mitigate unfavorable patient and legal outcomes. © RSNA, 2025.

### Evaluating biparametric versus multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for diagnosing clinically significant prostate cancer: an international, paired, noninferiority, confirmatory observer study [^9959798f]. European Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Patients and methods

The retrospective use of anonymized patient data was approved by review boards at each contributing center (identifiers: REK 2017/576; CMO 2016–3045, project 20011; IRB 2018–597; ZGT23–37) exempting the need to obtain informed consent. The study was conducted following the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) reporting guideline was followed.

2.1. Study design

This observer study was part of the Prostate Imaging — Cancer Artificial Intelligence (PI-CAI) challenge, a large confirmatory study with the primary objective of assessing the noninferiority of an artificial intelligence (AI) system in detecting csPCa compared with a panel of radiologists. PI-CAI comprised a large consortium of researchers and a multidisciplinary scientific advisory board with experts across prostate radiology, urology, and AI (Supplementary material). PI-CAI's study protocol was registered on. Its main outcomes have been detailed elsewhere, and its methods are summarized here.

2.2. Population

Examinations were obtained between 2015 and 2021 across four European care centers (Radboud University Medical Center, Ziekenhuisgroep Twente, Prostaat Centrum Noord-Nederland, and St. Olav's Hospital). All examinations were from men with a suspicion of PCa, with elevated serum PSA (≥ 3 ng/ml) levels and/or abnormal findings on digital rectal examination. Patients with prior prostate treatment or prior csPCa findings were excluded. Extended details on patients included and excluded on a per-center basis have been described elsewhere. Additionally, examinations were assessed for image quality through a two-round review process conducted by key investigators and an expert radiologist (12 yr of experience), excluding examinations with considerable misalignment between sequences and severe artifacts induced by, for example, prostheses, rectal gas, and patient motion (refer to Supplementary Fig. 1 for examples). Image quality–based exclusions were minimized to resemble real-world data closely. From this cohort, a random sample of 400 examinations was included in the observer study. In a post hoc analysis, the image quality of these examinations was assessed by an expert radiologist (refer to the Supplementary material for quality scores and examples of image quality).

Appropriate use definition — applied across technologies and procedures — is described as follows. The document states, "A consistent definition of appropriate use that includes consideration of risks and benefits is applied across technologies and procedures". It defines that "An appropriate diagnostic or therapeutic procedure is one in which the expected clinical benefit exceeds the risks of the procedure by a sufficiently wide margin, such that the procedure is generally considered acceptable or reasonable care". For diagnostic imaging, "benefits include incremental information, which when combined with clinical judgment, augments efficient patient care", and "These benefits are weighed against the expected negative consequences (risks include the potential hazard of missed diagnoses, radiation, contrast, and/or unnecessary downstream procedures)". It also notes, "The risks and benefits correspond with the different classes of cardiovascular services".

### Standard magnetic resonance imaging is inadequate for patients with refractory focal epilepsy [^af352645]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

Patients with intractable epilepsy may benefit from epilepsy surgery especially if they have a radiologically demonstrable cerebral lesion. Dedicated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols as performed at epilepsy surgery centres can detect epileptogenic abnormalities with great sensitivity and specificity. However, many patients with epilepsy are investigated with standard MRI sequences by radiologist outside epilepsy centres ("non-experts"). This study was undertaken to compare standard MRI and epilepsy specific MRI findings in patients with focal epilepsy.

Methods

Comparison of results of standard MRI reported by "non-expert" radiologists, standard MRI evaluated by epilepsy "expert" radiologists, and epilepsy specific MRI read by "expert" radiologists in 123 consecutive patients undergoing epilepsy surgery evaluation between 1996 and 1999. Validation of radiological findings by correlation with postoperative histological examination.

Results

Sensitivity of "non-expert" reports of standard MRI reports for focal lesions was 39%, of "expert" reports of standard MRI 50%, and of epilepsy dedicated MRI 91%. Dedicated MRI showed focal lesions in 85% of patients with "non-lesional" standard MRI. The technical quality of standard MRI improved during the study period, but "non-expert" reporting did not. In particular, hippocampal sclerosis was missed in 86% of cases. Neuropathological diagnoses (n = 90) were predicted correctly in 22% of "non-expert" standard MRI reports but by 89% of dedicated MRI reports.

Conclusions

Standard MRI failed to detect 57% of focal epileptogenic lesions. Patients without MRI lesion are less likely to be considered candidates for epilepsy surgery. Patients with refractory epilepsy should be referred to an MRI unit with epileptological experience at an early point.

Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

College of American Pathologists (CAP) Pathology and Laboratory Quality Center — scope and limitations are described as the CAP developed the Pathology and Laboratory Quality Center (the CAP Center) as a forum to write and maintain evidence-based guidelines and consensus statements, and the CAP Center aims to develop guidelines that reduce risks for patients, while facilitating the efficient use of resources for timely and accurate diagnosis. Practice guidelines and consensus statements reflect the best available evidence and majority expert agreement supported in practice, but this manuscript and its recommendations are meant only to address the topics within the scope of the guideline or consensus statement and they are not applicable to interventions, diseases, or stages of diseases not specifically identified. Furthermore, guidelines and consensus statements cannot account for individual variation among patients and cannot be considered inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other treatments, and accordingly, adherence to any guideline or consensus statement is voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding its application to be made by the physician in light of each patient's individual circumstances and preferences. The CAP and ADASP assume no responsibility for any injury or damage to persons or property arising out of or related to any use of the CAP/ADASP guidelines or consensus statements or for any errors or omissions.

### The impact of an early-morning radiologist work shift on the timeliness of communicating urgent imaging findings on portable chest radiography [^b377b8e6]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to assess the potential impact of staggered radiologist work shifts on the timeliness of communicating urgent imaging findings that are detected on portable overnight chest radiography of hospitalized patients.

Methods

The authors conducted a retrospective study that compared the interval between the acquisition and communication of urgent findings on portable overnight critical care chest radiography detected by an early-morning shift for radiologists (3 am to 11 am) with historical experience with a standard daytime shift (8 am to 5 pm) in the detection and communication of urgent findings in a similar patient population a year earlier.

Results

During a 4-month period, 6,448 portable chest radiographic studies were interpreted on the early-morning radiologist shift. Urgent findings requiring immediate communication were detected in 308 (4.8%) studies. The early-morning shift of radiologists, on average, communicated these findings 2 hours earlier compared with the historical control group (P < .001).

Conclusion

Staggered radiologist work shifts that include an early-morning shift can improve the timeliness of reporting urgent findings on overnight portable chest radiography of hospitalized patients.

### Incidental pulmonary nodules reported on CT abdominal imaging: frequency and factors affecting inclusion in the hospital discharge summary [^c61cc73a]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Incidental imaging findings require an assessment of risk and clinical relevance, as well as consideration of further evaluation. Incidental findings are common on imaging obtained in the hospital, with pulmonary nodules being among the most frequent findings that may require additional evaluation. We conducted a retrospective study to determine the factors associated with documentation of incidental findings in the hospital discharge summary, using pulmonary nodules reported on abdominal computed tomography (CT) as an example of incidental findings with well-defined follow-up guidelines. Between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2014, 7173 patients underwent in-patient abdominal CT without concurrent chest CT; of these patients, 62.2% were ≥ 60 years old, 50.6% were men, and 45.5% were current or former smokers. Incidental pulmonary nodules were reported in 402 patients (5.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.1%-6.2%). Based on nodule size, reported size stability, and patients' smoking status, 208 patients (2.9%; 95% CI, 2.5%-3.3%) required follow-up surveillance, per the 2005 Fleischner Society guidelines. Of these 208 patients, 48 (23%) received discharge summaries that included documentation of the incidental findings, with 34 summaries including a recommendation for nodule follow-up and 19 summaries including a time frame for repeat CT. Three factors were positively associated with the inclusion of the pulmonary nodule in the discharge summary: mention of the pulmonary nodule in the summary headings of the radiology report (P ≤ 0.001), radiologist recommendations for further surveillance (P ≤ 0.001), and medical discharging service (P = 0.016). These findings highlight the need for a multidisciplinary systems-based approach to incidental pulmonary nodule documentation and surveillance. Journal of Hospital Medicine 2017;12:454–457.

### Artificial intelligence for the detection of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest CT using multinational datasets [^e70864cd]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Methods

COVID-19 study population

Patients with COVID-19 infection confirmed by RT-PCR undergoing CT evaluation for diagnosis or evaluation of infection were identified for study inclusion at four international centers: (1) 700 patients from The Xiangyang NO.1 People's Hospital Affiliated Hospital of Hubei University of Medicine in Hubei Province, China, (2) 147 patients from the Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital, Tokyo, Japan, (3) 130 patients from San Paolo Hospital, Milan, Italy, and (4) 16 patients from Cà Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Milano, Milan, Italy. Study inclusion criteria included positive findings for COVID-pneumonia by expert radiologist interpretation and minimum technical requirements. Summary characteristics of each institutional cohort of patients meeting study criteria are provided in Table 1. The timing of CT scan acquisition in relation to onset of COVID-19 symptoms and/or diagnosis varied and was highly dependent on regional/national standard of care. In Hubei Province, China, CT scans were routinely obtained on the same day as a positive RT-PCR in an acute setting where patients with symptoms reported for clinical assessment, as well as patients with exposure and/or travel history to high prevalence regions. In Italy, the practice and use of CT varied by hospital. Patients in the larger Milan cohort underwent CT in more of a screening-like setting at acute presentation with symptoms or exposure history at the point of care. The smaller Milan cohort of 15 patients were largely obtained in an inpatient setting. The most diverse cohort was in Japan, where patients had a mixture of incidental exposures or community acquired COVID-19. In addition, the CT acquisition parameters varied by center and within centers (Supplementary Table 3). CTs underwent a centralized evaluation by two expert radiologists for confirmation of COVID-19 associated lung disease. Local IRB and ethics and research board approvals for retrospective evaluation were obtained at each site, along with 2 way data-sharing agreements with NIH. (1) First Affiliated Hospital of Hubei University of Medicine local ethics approval #20200702150947, (2) Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital IRB #01–014, and (3) University of Milan (both cohorts from Italian hospitals) IRB #562–2020. Due to the nature of the retrospective observational study, individual informed consent was waived.

### Summary of the proceedings of the international forum 2016: "Imaging referral guidelines and clinical decision support-how can radiologists implement imaging referral guidelines in clinical routine? " [^21283565]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

The use of high-tech diagnostic imaging procedures, like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), and nuclear cardiology tests, has seen double-digit increases annually in the last decade. While remarkable technological advances have enabled precise imaging of many complex physiologies and often ensure more accurate diagnostics, concerns are being raised that the sharp increase in these tests does not necessarily correspond proportionately to improved patient outcomes.

The ACR Appropriateness Criteria®, in existence for more than 20 years, define guidelines for the most appropriate medical imaging exam for a patient's condition, if any imaging is needed at all. These comprehensive criteria cover 215 topics and more than 1080 clinical indications. Appropriateness criteria use has been shown to improve quality, reduce unnecessary imaging and lower costs. They are widely accepted because they are created and continually updated by panels of physician experts from many different medical specialties. Implementation of a CDS system (CDSS) in the USA is needed because of the legal obligations, but the interest is considerable in other parts of the world.

The development of European guidelines started at the end of 2014, with the scientific review of ACR Select™ content by ESR experts and the adaptation of ACR appropriateness criteria to European standards of practice was performed. The process in Europe is developing quite fast. In the other parts of the world, the situation is diverse, but radiologists generally recognize advantages of imaging referral guidelines and CDS in clinical practice, but are also aware of potential drawbacks.

11-29-2007 Brackenridge Hospital, Texas, agreed to pay $25, 000 to resolve allegations that it failed to provide stabilizing treatment to an adult male who presented to its emergency department with complaints of having a severe headache for four days. A CT scan revealed a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Brackenridge's ED physician determined that the patient needed to be seen by a neurosurgeon. The ED physician called its on-call neurosurgeon. The on-call neurosurgeon refused to go to the ED to examine or treat the patient, stating that she would only see pediatric patients. The patient was transferred to a hospital nearly 66 miles away and was hospitalized for three days.

07-30-2007 Regional Medical Center of San Jose, California, agreed to pay $20, 000 to resolve allegations that it failed to provide stabilizing treatment within the capabilities of its staff and facilities and improperly transferred a critically injured two-year-old child that presented to its emergency department after being struck by a car. The ED physician diagnosed the patient as having a right hip and thigh contusion and did not conduct any lab work, x-rays, or a CT scan. The patient was given an anti-inflammatory and discharged. The patient protested leaving the ED, informed a nurse that she was in extreme pain and could not walk. Hospital staff told the patient to leave the hospital and threatened to call the police. The patient was then placed in a wheelchair and escorted to her relative's car by hospital security.

The patient presented to another hospital's ED where an x-ray revealed that she had a dislocated right hip and a CT scan of the hip revealed an acetabular fracture that prevented relocation of the hip without surgery. 06-27-2007. Homestead Hospital, Inc, Florida, agreed to pay $15, 000 to resolve allegations that it failed to provide an appropriate medical screening examination to a patient who was 41 weeks pregnant with regular contractions. HHI allegedly asked the patient if she had Medicaid or any other type of health insurance. After the patient advised that she did not have insurance, HHI's staff directed her to another hospital. 06-06-2007 Intermountain Healthcare d/b/a American Fork Hospital, a small hospital in Utah, agreed to pay $25, 000 to resolve two allegations of patient dumping.

In the first incident, the OIG alleged that AFH failed to provide an appropriate medical screening examination to a 15-year-old girl that presented to AFH's emergency department complaining of severe abdominal pain and nausea. She was seen in the ED the day before and returned in a worsened condition. Before evaluating the condition of the patient, the hospital told the patient's father that his co-pay would be 70% versus the 10% he was charged the previous day. The father took his daughter to another hospital where she was given morphine and phenegran and underwent surgery the next day. While the patient expressed an interest in being treated by her doctors at another hospital, the risks of her being transferred in very serious condition were not discussed with her or her family member. Upon arrival to the next hospital, she was admitted and remained in the hospital's ICU for 9 days. 05-30-2007.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of diabetic foot osteomyelitis: imaging accuracy in biopsy-proven disease [^945647da]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the recommended diagnostic imaging technique for diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO). The gold standard to diagnose osteomyelitis is bone biopsy with a positive culture and/or histopathology finding consistent with osteomyelitis. The purpose of this study is to assess the accuracy of MRI readings in biopsy-proven diabetic foot osteomyelitis with a second read done by a blinded, expert musculoskeletal radiologist. A retrospective chart review of 166 patients who received a bone biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of a suspected DFO at a large county hospital between 2010 and 2014. A second, blinded musculoskeletal radiologist reviewed the images for accuracy, once the official reading was recorded. Imaging results were correlated with the final diagnosis of osteomyelitis determined by bone biopsy. In 17 of 58 patients (29.3%), the diagnosis of DFO by MRI was not confirmed by bone biopsy. There were 12 false positives and 5 false negatives. After the second expert read, there were 5 false positives and 4 false negatives. The overall accuracy was 84% for the second read. Our study demonstrated results comparable to the previously reported meta-analysis findings. There is a clear variation on the read of MRI that could lead to an incorrect diagnosis of DFO. An integrated approach with evaluation of clinical findings, communication with radiologist about the MRI results when indicated, and bone biopsy is warranted for accurate diagnosis management of DFO.

### CIRSE clinical practice manual [^9d62c781]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

People usually file a lawsuit because of an unexpected bad outcome, but not every negative outcome rises to the level of medical malpractice, and most patients are not in a position to determine whether or not true malpractice has occurred. Medical malpractice is any act or omission by a physician during the treatment of a patient that deviates from accepted norms of practice in the medical community and causes an injury to the patient. Medical malpractice's liability is normally based on the laws of negligence. To show that medical negligence occurred, the aggrieved patient must show that:
a duty of professional care existed
such duty was breached when the physician deviated from the standard of care (negligence)
injury resulted from such breach
such injury is measurable in damages that the court can use to calculate the redress owed to the plaintiff.

These legal elements of a medical malpractice case must be proven by the patient suing the doctor to the applicable standard of proof required by law.

Errors in medicine happen commonly, even when the physician performing the procedure is experienced and knowledgeable. Fortunately, most do not result in patient harm, and only a few errors constitute medical malpractice. The Institute of Medicine reported that 90% of medical errors result from systemic problems rather than individual factors. A critical analysis of the different types of errors may help a radiologist undertake corrective measures and standardised interventional procedures with protocols to avoid future medico-legal issues. A quality management programme is an effective way to minimise the number of complications and medical errors (see " Quality Management in IR " section). Proper communication with the patient and other professionals (see " Communication " section) as well as an adequate informed consent process as integral parts of IR practice also help to minimise negative consequences and medico-legal issues from interventional procedures.

Informed consent is more than signing a consent form; it is the process of involving the patient in the decision-making process. It is mandatory not only for legal reasons — it also improves the quality of practice and helps to minimise medico-legal consequences for interventional radiologists.

Medico-legal, adverse event, complication and medical errors need to be differentiated. With appropriate patient selection, meticulous pre-procedural evaluation, obtaining the patient's informed consent, and post-procedural follow-up, errors in IR can be kept low and malpractice can be avoided.

### Clinical imaging guidelines part 1: a proposal for uniform methodology [^9f4b3141]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Inappropriate imaging can lead to unnecessary medical radiologic exposures and cost and may not answer the clinical question. Imaging referral guidelines inform the justification of radiologic procedures and facilitate the choice of the best test first, but their acceptance by referrers, use, and value may be limited by shortcomings in the methodology of development. Focusing on common, essential elements of methodology will help guideline developers. In 2012 and 2013, the International Atomic Energy Agency hosted Technical Meetings on Radiation Protection of Patients Through the Development of Appropriateness Criteria in Diagnostic Imaging. Participants identified and agreed on issues concerning development of imaging referral guidelines. Items based on the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II instrument were amended with additional items including development and consensus group composition. Consensus was sought on 28 items, 18 of which were agreed should be uniform, and 10 should allow for regional differences. Further work is required to encourage, provide, and identify higher quality evidence and to agree on a grading system for recommendations. Many key areas are common to guideline developers globally, opening the way for international collaboration to help demystify, simplify, and justify.
