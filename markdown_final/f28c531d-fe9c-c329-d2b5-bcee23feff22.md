Colon cancer

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about colon cancer screening. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and burden of disease to frame why screening matters. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence and how different guidelines grade benefits and harms. Next, I will examine age-based recommendations for average-risk adults, followed by modality-specific options and their trade-offs. After that, I need to check special populations and risk stratification, including family history, race/ethnicity, and inflammatory bowel disease. Finally, I will integrate implementation and quality considerations, and close with a concise, clinically actionable summary that aligns with major guidelines and evidence syntheses.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and burden. Colorectal cancer remains the third leading cause of cancer death in the U.S., with an estimated 52,980 deaths projected in 2021, and it is most frequently diagnosed in adults aged 65–74 years, while incidence in adults 40–49 has increased by nearly 15% over recent decades, which helps explain the shift toward earlier screening initiation in some guidelines [^114yMWPa] [^114bDcft]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify screening uptake because underuse limits mortality gains. Indeed, in 2016 about 26% of eligible adults had never been screened, and in 2018 about 31% were not up to date, underscoring the need to optimize both access and adherence [^114yMWPa] [^114bDcft].

> Next, I should review the strength of evidence and guideline convergence. The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that screening adults aged 50–75 years yields substantial net benefit, with moderate certainty for ages 45–49, and moderate certainty for selective screening in previously screened adults 76–85 years, which anchors the age-based framework many U.S. clinicians adopt [^114yMWPa] [^113RVoqH]. Wait, let me verify the evidentiary base behind colonoscopy specifically; while no randomized trials of screening colonoscopy exist, multiple observational studies and meta-analyses suggest large reductions in incidence and mortality, including meaningful protection in the proximal colon, though the magnitude is smaller than in the distal colon and quality-dependent, which is why colonoscopy remains a first-tier option in several guidelines despite the absence of RCTs [^111M1kUu] [^111Dn5rY] [^111prQQg]. I should also confirm that modeling and comparative effectiveness reviews support the expansion to age 45 and the comparative value of stool-based strategies, which they do, albeit with calls for more head-to-head trials [^114yMWPa] [^112N6J8d].

> I will now examine age-based recommendations for average-risk adults. For ages 50–75, screening is recommended for all by USPSTF with an A grade, reflecting substantial net benefit across modalities, and this is echoed by multisociety and primary care guidelines, which also emphasize shared decision-making and patient preference [^114yMWPa] [^113CAVX9] [^115qeYYf]. For ages 45–49, USPSTF gives a B recommendation based on modeling and epidemiology showing a moderate net benefit, while ESMO and some U.S. societies also support considering screening from 45 in average-risk adults, particularly given rising incidence in this group [^114yMWPa]. For ages 76–85, I should confirm that the balance shifts; USPSTF advises selective screening based on prior screening history, comorbidity, and preferences, with diminishing returns after age 75 in those already adequately screened, and AAFP similarly recommends individualized decisions in this range [^11498s5o] [^115yGYSN]. But wait, what if the patient has never been screened at 77? In that scenario, a one-time colonoscopy may still yield benefit if life expectancy exceeds about 10 years, which aligns with multisociety guidance to consider screening up to 85 in never-screened individuals [^116e8niw].

> Now, I need to check modality-specific options and their trade-offs. Colonoscopy every 10 years is a first-tier option with high sensitivity for cancer and precancerous lesions, one-session diagnosis and treatment, and long negative-test intervals; observational data suggest roughly 40–60% reductions in incidence and mortality, with stronger effects distally and more modest protection proximally, reinforcing the need for high-quality exams and adequate prep [^111prQQg] [^111M1kUu]. FIT annually is a noninvasive first-tier option with good sensitivity and specificity, strong cost-effectiveness, and favorable adherence in mailed programs; it primarily detects cancer rather than preventing it, so colonoscopy follow-up for positives is essential to realize mortality benefits [^114ktQWu] [^115zJxgZ]. Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5–10 years reduces distal CRC incidence and mortality by about 30–45% in RCTs, with limited proximal benefit; combining with annual FIT improves right-colon coverage, and it remains a reasonable alternative when colonoscopy is not preferred or available [^114F84VF] [^115zHqg5]. CT colonography every 5 years offers comparable sensitivity to colonoscopy for adenomas ≥ 6 mm but requires bowel prep and colonoscopy for positives; extracolonic findings and radiation exposure are considerations, and long-term mortality data are limited, so shared decision-making is key [^112N6J8d] [^113xPBtF]. Multitarget stool DNA (sDNA-FIT) every 1–3 years improves sensitivity over FIT alone at the cost of specificity and false positives; USPSTF includes it among acceptable options but notes the need for more outcome data and careful counseling about positive results and colonoscopy follow-up [^114yMWPa] [^1121dFe4].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and risk stratification. For family history, guidelines converge on starting 10 years before the youngest affected first-degree relative or at age 40, whichever is earlier, with colonoscopy preferred in high-risk pedigrees; for example, ACG recommends colonoscopy every 5 years in those with a first-degree relative diagnosed before 60 or with multiple affected relatives, and AGA advises colonoscopy as the strategy of choice in increased-risk individuals [^1168rbtn] [^115LYQoM]. For African American patients, several societies note higher incidence and mortality and support considering earlier initiation, with USPSTF acknowledging disparities and calling for systems-level interventions; while the Task Force did not issue a race-specific start age, clinicians may individualize based on risk and access considerations [^112bsoWu] [^112W5byy]. For inflammatory bowel disease, colonoscopic surveillance is recommended to reduce CRC-associated mortality, with interval tailored to disease extent and duration, and this applies across BSG and related guidance [^116TqQDm]. I should double-check that these align with NCCN and primary care updates, which they do, reinforcing the need to document family history and apply risk-adapted strategies [^111HK8rL] [^112Ta6ws].

> Next, I should review implementation and quality considerations that determine real-world impact. Adherence and program quality are pivotal; even excellent tests underperform if patients do not complete screening and follow-up, so mailed FIT outreach, reminder systems, and navigation improve uptake and outcomes [^115zJxgZ] [^115bHbkV]. Colonoscopy quality metrics matter, including cecal intubation rate, withdrawal time, adenoma detection rate, and polyp retrieval; high ADR correlates with lower post-colonoscopy CRC and better protection, particularly in the proximal colon where miss rates are higher [^113NjfMU]. Let me reconsider surveillance intervals after negative exams; a normal, high-quality colonoscopy supports repeating in 10 years, whereas patients with hyperplastic polyps limited to the rectum/sigmoid generally return to routine intervals, and those with advanced adenomas require shorter surveillance per multisociety guidance [^115DfSGJ] [^114x3TMG]. I need to ensure we also address barriers such as colonoscopy access, sedation logistics, and patient preferences, which is why offering a menu of acceptable options and supporting completion of follow-up are core to effective programs [^115zJxgZ].

> I should confirm emerging technologies and research gaps so I don't overstate unproven tools. Blood-based assays are under active evaluation and one is commercially available as a laboratory-developed test, but evidence for mortality impact and longitudinal performance remains limited; modeling and early studies suggest potential to improve adherence if accuracy and cost-effectiveness prove favorable, but they are not yet substitutes for established modalities [^115zJxgZ]. Colon capsule endoscopy shows promise in comparative studies for significant neoplasia detection but still requires bowel prep and has lower specificity than CTC; its role is evolving and best positioned as an alternative when standard options are unsuitable or declined [^113wDBjw]. USPSTF explicitly highlights gaps needing head-to-head trials of strategies, better data in adults younger than 50, and interventions to close racial disparities, which should temper premature adoption of unproven tests [^117NQTX5] [^112W5byy].

> Let me synthesize a practical, clinically actionable approach while keeping the evidence hierarchy in mind. For average-risk adults, offer screening from age 45–75, with strong preference for ages 50–75; present colonoscopy every 10 years and annual FIT as co–first-line options, and consider flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5–10 years with annual FIT, CTC every 5 years, or sDNA-FIT every 1–3 years based on patient values, comorbidity, and local resources, ensuring colonoscopy follow-up for any positive noninvasive test [^114yMWPa] [^115qeYYf] [^112aGeQw]. For adults 76–85, individualize decisions to prior screening, life expectancy, and preferences, recognizing small net benefit in previously screened patients and potentially meaningful benefit in never-screened individuals with reasonable life expectancy [^11498s5o] [^116e8niw]. For increased risk due to family history, start at 40 or 10 years before the youngest affected relative and use colonoscopy as the preferred strategy, adjusting intervals to risk category and findings [^1168rbtn] [^115LYQoM]. Throughout, embed shared decision-making, address disparities, and monitor quality to translate evidence into mortality reduction at the population level [^115zJxgZ] [^113NjfMU].

---

Colon cancer is **highly preventable** through screening, which detects precancerous polyps and early-stage cancers when treatment is most effective [^112Uepnz]. The USPSTF recommends screening for average-risk adults aged 45–75 years [^114yMWPa], with colonoscopy every 10 years or annual FIT as preferred options [^115qeYYf]; flexible sigmoidoscopy, CT colonography, and stool DNA tests are alternatives [^113xPBtF]. Screening reduces incidence and mortality [^111M1kUu], but **uptake remains suboptimal** [^114bDcft]; addressing barriers and offering patient-centered options can improve adherence [^115bHbkV]. For high-risk patients (family history, IBD, hereditary syndromes), earlier and more intensive screening is advised [^1168rbtn] [^116TqQDm].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

Colon cancer is the **third most common cancer** and the **second leading cause of cancer death** in the US [^114yMWPa], with approximately 153,020 new cases and 52,980 deaths expected in 2024 [^notfound]. Incidence rises with age, peaking at 65–74 years, and about 10.5% of cases occur in adults younger than 50 [^114yMWPa]. Major risk factors include:

- **Age**: Incidence increases sharply after 50 [^114yMWPa].
- **Family history**: First-degree relatives with colorectal cancer or advanced adenomas increase risk [^111HK8rL].
- **Hereditary syndromes**: Lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis confer high risk [^111HK8rL].
- **Inflammatory bowel disease**: Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease increase risk [^notfound].
- **Lifestyle factors**: Diet high in red/processed meats, obesity, physical inactivity, smoking, and heavy alcohol use increase risk [^notfound].

---

## Screening guidelines and recommendations

Screening is the **most effective public health strategy** to reduce colon cancer incidence and mortality [^112Uepnz]. The USPSTF recommends screening for average-risk adults aged 45–75 years [^114yMWPa], with colonoscopy every 10 years or annual FIT as preferred options [^115qeYYf]. Alternative tests include flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5–10 years, CT colonography every 5 years, and stool DNA testing every 1–3 years [^113xPBtF] [^1121dFe4]. For adults 76–85, screening should be individualized based on health, prior screening, and preferences [^11498s5o].

---

## Screening modalities and effectiveness

| **Modality** | **Interval** | **Effectiveness** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Colonoscopy | 10 years | High sensitivity for cancer and polyps; allows polypectomy | Invasive; requires bowel prep; rare complications |
| FIT | Annual | Noninvasive; good sensitivity/specificity | Requires repeat testing; colonoscopy if positive |
| Flexible sigmoidoscopy | 5–10 years | Reduces distal CRC incidence/mortality | Limited proximal colon coverage |
| CT colonography | 5 years | Noninvasive; full colon evaluation | Radiation; colonoscopy if positive |
| Stool DNA | 1–3 years | Noninvasive; higher sensitivity than FIT | False positives; colonoscopy if positive |

---

Colonoscopy and FIT are **first-line** because of their high sensitivity and strong evidence for mortality reduction [^115qeYYf] [^111M1kUu]. Flexible sigmoidoscopy, CT colonography, and stool DNA are reasonable alternatives when first-line tests are unsuitable or declined [^1127oGLR].

---

## Benefits and limitations of screening

Benefits include **early detection** of curable cancers and prevention through polyp removal, reducing incidence and mortality [^111M1kUu]. Limitations include false positives/negatives, procedural risks (e.g. perforation, bleeding), and adherence challenges [^112N6J8d].

---

## Barriers to screening and strategies to improve uptake

Despite proven benefits, **uptake remains suboptimal** [^114bDcft], with 26% of eligible adults never screened and 31% not up to date in 2018 [^114yMWPa]. Barriers include lack of awareness, fear, logistical challenges, and disparities by race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status [^115bHbkV]. Effective strategies to improve uptake include:

- **Patient education**: Decision aids and culturally tailored messaging [^115bHbkV].
- **Provider reminders**: System prompts and performance feedback [^notfound].
- **Access improvements**: Mailed FIT, mobile screening, extended hours [^115zJxgZ].
- **Shared decision-making**: Aligning tests with patient preferences [^116gDpDC].

---

## Special considerations

High-risk individuals (family history, IBD, hereditary syndromes) require **earlier initiation, shorter intervals, and colonoscopy** as the preferred modality [^1168rbtn] [^116TqQDm]. Emerging technologies such as blood-based tests and colon capsule endoscopy are under evaluation but are not yet standard [^115zJxgZ].

---

Colon cancer screening is a **cornerstone of prevention**, with multiple effective options and strong evidence for mortality reduction [^111M1kUu]. Optimizing uptake through patient-centered, equitable approaches is essential to realize these benefits [^115zJxgZ].

Screening has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality related to colorectal cancer. However, the optimal strategy for population screening for colorectal cancer has been a topic of heated debate. Recent studies have challenged the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of current population screening practices. Novel approaches to improve the assessment of an individual's colorectal cancer risk and advances in technology are changing our approach to colorectal screening. This review covers current guidelines for screening for colorectal cancer, recent advances in cancer risk assessment, and the role of endoscopy, virtual colonoscopy, and fecal DNA testing in colorectal cancer screening.

### Strategies for colorectal cancer screening [^112Uepnz]. Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is increasing worldwide. CRC has high mortality when detected at advanced stages, yet it is also highly preventable. Given the difficulties in implementing major lifestyle changes or widespread primary prevention strategies to decrease CRC risk, screening is the most powerful public health tool to reduce mortality. Screening methods are effective but have limitations. Furthermore, many screen-eligible people remain unscreened. We discuss established and emerging screening methods, and potential strategies to address current limitations in CRC screening. A quantum step in CRC prevention might come with the development of new screening strategies, but great gains can be made by deploying the available CRC screening modalities in ways that optimize outcomes while making judicious use of resources.

### Screening for colorectal cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^115K7wtm]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 2002 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement on screening for colorectal cancer.

Methods

To update its recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned 2 studies: 1) a targeted systematic evidence review on 4 selected questions relating to test characteristics and benefits and harms of screening technologies, and 2) a decision analytic modeling analysis using population modeling techniques to compare the expected health outcomes and resource requirements of available screening modalities when used in a programmatic way over time.

Recommendations

The USPSTF recommends screening for colorectal cancer using fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy in adults, beginning at age 50 years and continuing until age 75 years. The risks and benefits of these screening methods vary. (A recommendation). The USPSTF recommends against routine screening for colorectal cancer in adults 76 to 85 years of age. There may be considerations that support colorectal cancer screening in an individual patient. (C recommendation). The USPSTF recommends against screening for colorectal cancer in adults older than age 85 years. (D recommendation). The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the benefits and harms of computed tomographic colonography and fecal DNA testing as screening modalities for colorectal cancer. (I statement).

### Screening for colorectal cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114yMWPa]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death for both men and women, with an estimated 52 980 persons in the US projected to die of colorectal cancer in 2021. Colorectal cancer is most frequently diagnosed among persons aged 65 to 74 years. It is estimated that 10.5% of new colorectal cancer cases occur in persons younger than 50 years. Incidence of colorectal cancer (specifically adenocarcinoma) in adults aged 40 to 49 years has increased by almost 15% from 2000–2002 to 2014–2016. In 2016, 26% of eligible adults in the US had never been screened for colorectal cancer and in 2018, 31% were not up to date with screening.

Objective

To update its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for colorectal cancer in adults 40 years or older. The review also examined whether these findings varied by age, sex, or race/ethnicity. In addition, as in 2016, the USPSTF commissioned a report from the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network Colorectal Cancer Working Group to provide information from comparative modeling on how estimated life-years gained, colorectal cancer cases averted, and colorectal cancer deaths averted vary by different starting and stopping ages for various screening strategies.

Population

Asymptomatic adults 45 years or older at average risk of colorectal cancer (ie, no prior diagnosis of colorectal cancer, adenomatous polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease; no personal diagnosis or family history of known genetic disorders that predispose them to a high lifetime risk of colorectal cancer [such as Lynch syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis]).

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 50 to 75 years has substantial net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 45 to 49 years has moderate net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 76 to 85 years who have been previously screened has small net benefit. Adults who have never been screened for colorectal cancer are more likely to benefit.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends screening for colorectal cancer in all adults aged 50 to 75 years. (A recommendation) The USPSTF recommends screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 45 to 49 years. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 76 to 85 years. Evidence indicates that the net benefit of screening all persons in this age group is small. In determining whether this service is appropriate in individual cases, patients and clinicians should consider the patient's overall health, prior screening history, and preferences. (C recommendation).

### Screening, surveillance, and prevention of colorectal cancer [^115GXkgR]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Colon cancer screening can be effective, but only with a high-quality program that assures adherence to all elements of the program. There is evidence in the United States of greater acceptance of screening and decreased incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer. Patient education is a key element of any effective screening program. It is hoped that future screening will develop better risk-stratification tools and enable targeting of screening to high-risk individuals.

Screening for Colorectal Cancer

US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement

IMPORTANCE

Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death for both men and women, with an estimated 52,980 persons in the US projected to die of colorectal cancer in 2021.

### Colorectal cancer screening [^115cdW9W]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

During the past decade we have seen dramatic advances in colon cancer screening. Reduction in mortality in average risk screening for colorectal cancer has now been shown in multiple trials. Efforts to increase public awareness and compliance with evidence-based screening guidelines are underway. Recent guidelines have incorporated family history, as it has been identified as a common risk factor. The genes responsible for the inherited syndromes of colon cancer have been identified and genetic testing is available. Currently, screening the average risk population over the age of 50 would reduce mortality from colon cancer by 50%. Future advances will likely include improved screening tests, and the development of familial genetic testing.

### Committee opinion no 609: colorectal cancer screening strategies [^113YCiHc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Each year, more than 24,000 women die from colorectal cancer, which makes it the third leading cause of cancer death in women after lung cancer and breast cancer. However, screening tests are underused for many segments of the population and are ordered in a manner inconsistent with guidelines. The primary goal of colorectal cancer screening is to reduce mortality through the reduction of advanced disease. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening every 10 years for average-risk women beginning at age 50 years and at age 45 years for African American women. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends colonoscopy every 10 years as the most effective screening modality. Every screening method has advantages and limitations, which ultimately depend on the quality of the screening test, patient adherence, screening guidelines, and access to timely and appropriate follow-up. Colorectal cancer screening methods should be discussed with patients to identify the method they are most likely to accept and complete.

### Colorectal cancer screening: the time to act is now [^1173skEe]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the fourth most common cause of cancer deaths globally, accounting for approximately 1.4 million new cases and 700,000 deaths every year. Incidence is particularly high in developed countries; in Europe, CRC is the second most common cancer. With approximately 450,000 new cases per year, case numbers are only slightly lower than those of breast cancer patients. There is meanwhile overwhelming evidence from both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and epidemiological studies that a large proportion of CRC cases and deaths could be prevented by screening with early detection and removal of colorectal adenomas or early stage CRC. There is also overwhelming evidence that CRC screening by either faecal occult blood test (FOBT), flexible sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy is both effective and cost-effective, even though uncertainty remains about which of the screening options would be the most cost-effective one. Nevertheless, CRC screening programmes continue to be offered in a minority of countries only, and where they are offered there is often much room for enhancing screening offers and adherence. The aim of this article is to review potential reasons for this major translational gap, and to discuss implications for further research and practice.

### Screening for colorectal cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112W5byy]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF colorectal cancer screening — research needs and gaps: The statement identifies key gaps including the need for randomized trials that directly compare different colorectal cancer screening strategies (including hybrid strategies that switch between modalities over time) to reduce colorectal cancer mortality, studies on screening effectiveness in adults younger than 50 years and whether strategies should be tailored in these populations, and more research to understand and address factors contributing to increased colorectal cancer incidence and mortality in Black adults, such as access to and availability of care and characteristics of systems providing health care, followed by testing interventions designed to mitigate these differences.

### Colorectal cancer screening [^117LGDYz]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The review will summarize the state of the art in colon cancer screening. Recently published screening guidelines will be reviewed so physicians can understand them and how to deal with the differences. Each screening modality presently in use will then be reviewed with emphasis on efficacy and problems.

Recent Findings

During the past two decades research has clearly demonstrated colon cancer screening to be effective. New modalities such as virtual colonoscopy and stool DNA screening have been introduced and are recommended by some organizations but not others. Ages to discontinue screening have also been suggested. Fecal immunochemical testing exhibits some advantages over guaiac-based testing. Problematic issues with the effectiveness of colonoscopy have arisen, particularly in the proximal colon. Both technical and biological reasons have been suggested for this decrease in effectiveness.

Summary

Colon cancer screening is effective and continues to improve. Refinements of guidelines as well as refinements in each screening modality have occurred. Several screening tools are newly available and quality studies and efforts for present and new tests are imperative.

### What constitutes evidence? Colorectal cancer screening and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^113uJwQ8]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The United States Preventive Services Task Force is perhaps America's best-known source of evidence-based medicine (EBM) recommendations. This paper reviews aspects of the history of one such recommendation-screening for colorectal cancer (CRC)-to explore how the Task Force evaluates the best available evidence to reach its conclusions. Although the Task Force initially believed there was inadequate evidence to recommend CRC screening in the 1980s, it later changed its mind. Indeed, by 2002, it was recommending screening colonoscopy for those aged 50 and older, "extrapolating" from the existing evidence as there were no randomized controlled trials of the procedure. By 2016, due in part to the use of an emerging analytic modality known as modeling, the Task Force supported four additional CRC screening tests that lacked randomized data. Among the reasons the Task Force gave for these decisions was the desire to improve adherence for a strategy-screening healthy, asymptomatic individuals-that it believed saved lives. During these same years, the Task Force diverged from other organizations by declining to advocate screening otherwise healthy Black patients earlier than age 50-despite the fact that such individuals had higher rates of CRC than the general population, higher mortality from the disease and earlier onset of the disease. In declining to extrapolate in this instance, the Task Force underscored the lack of reliable data that proved that the benefits of such testing would outweigh the harms. The history of CRC screening reminds us that scientific evaluation relies not only on methodological sophistication but also on a combination of intellectual, cognitive and social processes. General internists-and their patients-should realize that EBM recommendations are often not definitive but rather thoughtful data-based advice.

### Implementation of colon cancer screening: techniques, costs, and barriers [^111H6ya6]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer and breast cancer are the only cancer sites for which evidence on the efficacy of screening is available from randomized trials. The trials on colon cancer screening in the United States and Europe used the fecal occult blood test as the primary screen, but randomized trial data are not yet available on endoscopy (flexible sigmoidoscopy to 60 cm), and no randomized, controlled trials of colonoscopy as a screening test are in progress. This article reviews colorectal cancer screening from an epidemiologist's perspective to provide the theoretic evidence-based underpinning for the role of the gastroenterologist in colorectal screening.

---

### Progress and challenges in colorectal cancer screening and surveillance [^114o1EV9]. Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer death throughout the world. There is evidence that screening of average-risk individuals can result in mortality reduction with early cancer detection and cancer prevention by detection and removal of cancer precursor lesions. The optimal form of screening is not clear. Fecal screening tests can be performed at home at low initial cost, but current versions lack high sensitivity for cancer precursor lesions, and tests need to be repeated at regular intervals. Adherence to repeat testing for negative tests and referral for colonoscopy for positive tests are important elements of program effectiveness. Structural examinations of the colon are more invasive and may result in detection of both early cancer and cancer precursor lesions. Every screening program has advantages and limitations, but each program ultimately depends on quality and patient adherence.

USPSTF Assessment of Magnitude of Net Benefit

The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concludes with high certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 50 to 75 years has substantial net benefit.

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 45 to 49 years has moderate net benefit.

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 76 to 85 years who have been previously screened has small net benefit. Adults who have never been screened for colorectal cancer are more likely to benefit.

This assessment of net benefit applies to stool-based tests with high sensitivity, colonoscopy, computed tomography (CT) colonography, and flexible sigmoidoscopy. See Table 1 for characteristics of recommended screening strategies. The USPSTF recommendation for screening for colorectal cancer does not include serum tests, urine tests, or capsule endoscopy for colorectal cancer screening because of the limited available evidence on these tests and because other effective tests (ie, the recommended screening strategies) are available.

See Figure 1, Table 2, and the eFigure in the Supplement for more information on the USPSTF recommendation rationale and assessment. For more details on the methods the USPTSF uses to determine net benefit, see the USPSTF Procedure Manual.⁷

Practice Considerations

Patient Population Under Consideration

This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults 45 years or older who are at average risk of colorectal cancer (ie, no prior diagnosis of colorectal cancer, adenomatous polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease; no personal diagnosis or family history of known genetic disorders that predispose them to a high lifetime risk of colorectal cancer [such as Lynch syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis]).

Colon cancer needs better screening and treatment options. Its incidence in the young population is rising. Recent changes in guidelines recommend beginning screening for colon cancer at the age of 45. Circulating tumor DNA presents an opportunity to select patients for administration of adjuvant chemotherapy. Immunotherapy is an option for patients with a deficiency in mismatch repair proteins. However, its efficacy outside of this group of patients remains a challenge. Targeted therapies such as BRAF inhibitors are an option for patients with poor prognosis, for whom cytotoxic chemotherapy is not as effective. This review presents the recently published evidence regarding screening and treating patients with colon cancer.

### Colon cancer screening and surveillance controversies [^1165xAjz]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To discuss new colorectal cancer screening tests and highlight controversies regarding colon screening and surveillance.

Recent Findings

New screening guidelines were published in 2008. Tests that primarily detect early cancer include sensitive guaiac fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test. Tests that can detect both early cancer and cancer precursor lesions include sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy. One guideline endorses the use of computed tomographic colonography. Limitations of each test are highlighted in the new guidelines. Controversies include age to start screening, age to stop screening, and appropriate interval after a negative screening colonoscopy. New work has raised some doubt about the protective effect of colonoscopy in the proximal colon. Finally, there is new emphasis on the quality of screening programs.

Summary

Colorectal cancer screening can reduce both incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer if performed with high quality. New work should focus on improving the quality of all screening programs.

Research Needs and Gaps

Although the benefits of screening for colorectal cancer are well established, the following important evidence gaps that need to be addressed by additional research persist.

- Randomized trials that directly compare the effectiveness of different colorectal cancer screening strategies (including hybrid strategies that switch between modalities over time) to reduce colorectal cancer mortality are needed.
- Studies are needed on screening effectiveness in adults younger than 50 years and whether screening strategies should be tailored in these populations.
- More research is needed to understand the factors that contribute to increased colorectal cancer incidence and mortality in Black adults, such as access to and availability of care and characteristics of systems providing health care. Once these factors are identified, more research is needed to test interventions designed to mitigate these differences for Black adults.

### Screening and surveillance for the early detection of colorectal cancer and adenomatous polyps, 2008: a joint guideline from the American cancer society, the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer, and the American college of radiology [^116G32uY]. CA (2008). Low credibility.

In the United States, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer diagnosed among men and women and the second leading cause of death from cancer. CRC largely can be prevented by the detection and removal of adenomatous polyps, and survival is significantly better when CRC is diagnosed while still localized. In 2006 to 2007, the American Cancer Society, the US Multi Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer, and the American College of Radiology came together to develop consensus guidelines for the detection of adenomatous polyps and CRC in asymptomatic average-risk adults. In this update of each organization's guidelines, screening tests are grouped into those that primarily detect cancer early and those that can detect cancer early and also can detect adenomatous polyps, thus providing a greater potential for prevention through polypectomy. When possible, clinicians should make patients aware of the full range of screening options, but at a minimum they should be prepared to offer patients a choice between a screening test that is effective at both early cancer detection and cancer prevention through the detection and removal of polyps and a screening test that primarily is effective at early cancer detection. It is the strong opinion of these 3 organizations that colon cancer prevention should be the primary goal of screening.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in men and women in the United States. CRC screening efforts are directed toward removal of adenomas and sessile serrated lesions and detection of early-stage CRC. The purpose of this article is to update the 2009 American College of Gastroenterology CRC screening guidelines. The guideline is framed around several key questions. We conducted a comprehensive literature search to include studies through October 2020. The inclusion criteria were studies of any design with men and women age 40 years and older. Detailed recommendations for CRC screening in average-risk individuals and those with a family history of CRC are discussed. We also provide recommendations on the role of aspirin for chemoprevention, quality indicators for colonoscopy, approaches to organized CRC screening and improving adherence to CRC screening. CRC screening must be optimized to allow effective and sustained reduction of CRC incidence and mortality. This can be accomplished by achieving high rates of adherence, quality monitoring and improvement, following evidence-based guidelines, and removing barriers through the spectrum of care from noninvasive screening tests to screening and diagnostic colonoscopy. The development of cost-effective, highly accurate, noninvasive modalities associated with improved overall adherence to the screening process is also a desirable goal.

### Screening for colorectal cancer: updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^112N6J8d]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States.

Objective

To systematically review the effectiveness, diagnostic accuracy, and harms of screening for CRC.

Data Sources

Searches of MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for relevant studies published from January 1, 2008, through December 31, 2014, with surveillance through February 23, 2016.

Study Selection

English-language studies conducted in asymptomatic populations at general risk of CRC.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two reviewers independently appraised the articles and extracted relevant study data from fair- or good-quality studies. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Colorectal cancer incidence and mortality, test accuracy in detecting CRC or adenomas, and serious adverse events.

Results

Four pragmatic randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating 1-time or 2-time flexible sigmoidoscopy (n = 458,002) were associated with decreased CRC-specific mortality compared with no screening (incidence rate ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.66–0.82). Five RCTs with multiple rounds of biennial screening with guaiac-based fecal occult blood testing (n = 419,966) showed reduced CRC-specific mortality (relative risk [RR], 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84–0.98, at 19.5 years to RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65–0.93, at 30 years). Seven studies of computed tomographic colonography (CTC) with bowel preparation demonstrated per-person sensitivity and specificity to detect adenomas 6 mm and larger comparable with colonoscopy (sensitivity from 73% [95% CI, 58%-84%] to 98% [95% CI, 91%-100%]; specificity from 89% [95% CI, 84%-93%] to 91% [95% CI, 88%-93%]); variability and imprecision may be due to differences in study designs or CTC protocols. Sensitivity of colonoscopy to detect adenomas 6 mm or larger ranged from 75% (95% CI, 63%-84%) to 93% (95% CI, 88%-96%). On the basis of a single stool specimen, the most commonly evaluated families of fecal immunochemical tests (FITs) demonstrated good sensitivity (range, 73%-88%) and specificity (range, 90%-96%). One study (n = 9989) found that FIT plus stool DNA test had better sensitivity in detecting CRC than FIT alone (92%) but lower specificity (84%). Serious adverse events from colonoscopy in asymptomatic persons included perforations (4/10,000 procedures, 95% CI, 2–5 in 10,000) and major bleeds (8/10,000 procedures, 95% CI, 5–14 in 10,000). Computed tomographic colonography may have harms resulting from low-dose ionizing radiation exposure or identification of extracolonic findings.

Conclusions and Relevance

Colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, CTC, and stool tests have differing levels of evidence to support their use, ability to detect cancer and precursor lesions, and risk of serious adverse events in average-risk adults. Although CRC screening has a large body of supporting evidence, additional research is still needed.

### Communicating benefits and risks of screening for prostate, colon, and breast cancer [^1174Uy1F]. Family Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Screening for cancer has become a standard of practice in contemporary health care. Screening tests are often ordered routinely, without discussion of risks and benefits. For clinicians who want to inform patients and undertake shared decision-making, the goal of effective communication presents a number of challenges. To begin with, the probabilities to be discussed are small. For each screening test done, the chance of finding and effectively treating an early cancer is quite low. Likewise, the chance of causing harm, such as a false positive screen followed by an invasive test resulting in complications, is also very unlikely but possible. Using accurate terms that patients can understand is only the first step, however, as the decision-making process should take into account the patient's perceptions, values, and preferences. This paper briefly reviews the current state of evidence for prostate, colon, and breast cancer screening, then outlines several strategies toward effective clinical communication. The concepts of absolute risk, relative risk, and number needed to screen are reviewed. Natural frequency presentation, a relatively new method for portraying benefits and harms, is introduced and encouraged, as recent evidence suggests that natural frequencies are better understood and are more concordant with patients' values than alternative formats.

### Colon cancer treatment-NCI… [^114SGs9D]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Stage II colon cancer Stage II colon cancer is divided into stages IIA, IIB, and IIC.
- **Stage IIA**: Cancer has spread through the muscle layer of the colon wall to the serosa of the colon wall.
- **Stage IIB**: Cancer has spread through the serosa of the colon wall to the tissue that lines the organs in the abdomen.
- Stage IIC: Cancer has spread through the serosa of the colon wall to nearby organs. In stage IIIC, cancer has spread:

- through the serosa of the colon wall to the tissue that lines the organs in the abdomen. Cancer has spread to four to six nearby lymph nodes; or
- through the muscle layer of the colon wall to the serosa of the colon wall or has spread through the serosa to the tissue that lines the organs in the abdomen. Cancer has spread to seven or more nearby lymph nodes; or.
- through the serosa of the colon wall to nearby organs. Cancer has spread to one or more nearby lymph nodes, or cancer cells have formed in tissue near the lymph nodes. If the cancer has spread to the liver and cannot be removed by surgery, a total hepatectomy and liver transplant after chemotherapy may be done. Total hepatectomy and liver transplant is the removal of the entire liver by surgery, followed by a transplant of a healthy liver from a donor.
- local excision for tumors that have recurred
- resection with or without anastomosis
- surgery to remove parts of other organs, such as the liver, lungs, and ovaries, where the cancer may have recurred or spread
- radiation therapy or chemotherapy, as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.

BRAFgene
- immunotherapy Treatment of cancer that has spread to the liver may also include:

- chemotherapy given before surgery to shrink the tumor, after surgery, or both before and after
- radiofrequency ablation or cryosurgery, for patients who cannot have surgery
- chemoembolization of the hepatic artery
- liver transplant after chemotherapy for patients with liver metastases that cannot be removed by surgery.

### Fecal occult blood test screening for colorectal cancer [^114iECfG]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

In summary, high-quality scientific studies indicate that the use of the FOBT for colorectal cancer screening has a number of important advantages. The test is capable of detecting most early colorectal cancers and many advanced adenomas. It has been shown in randomized, controlled trials to reduce substantially colorectal cancer mortality and incidence. The FOBT is feasible, widely available, and acceptable to most individuals. It has a low up-front cost and is highly cost-effective. Combining annual FOBT with periodic flexible sigmoidoscopy seems to be an especially effective screening option. Limitations of FOBT screening include its low sensitivity for polyps, especially smaller ones. Some of the trials report a relatively low sensitivity for detecting cancers located in the distal colon. The test has a relatively low specificity, so there are many false-positive screens; and for it to be most effective, repetitive screening is necessary. Balancing these advantages and disadvantages, the evidence-based screening guidelines have concluded that FOBT screening has a major role to play in colorectal cancer control and a program of annual FOBT plus flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years is a preferred option for screening the asymptomatic, average-risk population for colorectal cancer. Short of doing direct colonoscopy screening for the entire at-risk population, the FOBT currently is the best available method of identifying asymptomatic, average-risk people most likely to benefit from colonoscopy.

### Current and future colorectal cancer screening strategies [^115zJxgZ]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Despite strong evidence of effectiveness, colorectal cancer (CRC) screening remains underused. Currently, there are several options for CRC screening, each with its own performance characteristics and considerations for practice. This Review aims to cover current CRC screening guidelines and highlight future blood-based and imaging-based options for screening. In current practice, the leading non-invasive option is the faecal immunochemical test (FIT) based on its high specificity, good sensitivity, low cost and ease of use in mailed outreach programmes. There are currently five blood-based CRC screening tests in varying stages of evaluation, including one that is currently sold in the USA as a laboratory-developed test. There are ongoing studies on the diagnostic accuracy and longitudinal performance of blood tests and they have the potential to disrupt the CRC screening landscape. Imaging-based options, including the colon capsule, MR colonography and the CT capsule, are also being tested in active studies. As the world attempts to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and adapts to the start of CRC screening among people at average risk starting at age 45 years, non-invasive options will become increasingly important.

### Safe, efficient, and effective screening colonoscopy [^113NjfMU]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Colorectal cancer continues to be one of the most common causes of cancer-related death. Widespread dissemination of screening colonoscopy in the United States has led to a significant reduction in the incidence and mortality. Here we review current literature with an aim to highlight recent improvements in the safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of screening colonoscopy.

Recent Findings

Colon capsule endoscopy is an emerging noninvasive method to capture images of colonic mucosa for select patients with appreciable sensitivity for polyp detection. Recent literature supports the use of the novel oral anticoagulant apixaban over other anticoagulants to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding related to colonoscopy. Cold snare polypectomy for smaller lesions and prophylactic clipping following resection of large polyps in the proximal colon may reduce the rate of delayed bleeding. Novel methods and devices for improving bowel preparation continue to emerge. Mechanical attachment devices and artificial intelligence represent recent innovations to improve polyp detection.

Summary

Clinicians should be aware of relevant data and literature that continue to improve the quality and safety of screening colonoscopy and incorporate these findings into their clinical practice.

### Colon cancer: detection and prevention [^115pUjT1]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Recent data have advanced our ability to detect, survey, and manage patients with colonic neoplasia. Current studies and consensus statements increasingly support the role of colonoscopic screening over less invasive testing such as FOBT or FS for appropriately selected individuals. There are many issues, however, that remain unresolved. What is the appropriate surveillance of an individual with a single family member who had colon cancer at an early age? How should family members of suspected HNPCC kindreds be managed? There has yet to be a prospective cohort validation of the Bethesda criteria in directing clinical practice, with the endpoint of mortality reduction. Questions regarding prophylaxis with dietary supplements and medications are exciting areas that are currently under study. As newer technologies become clinically available for molecular diagnostics and screening, and virtual colonoscopy with computed tomography and magnetic resonance disseminates, there will undoubtedly be new questions to be answered regarding their ability to aid in the detection and management of colon cancer.

EVIDENCE ASSESSMENT

The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 50 to 75 years has substantial net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 45 to 49 years has moderate net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 76 to 85 years who have been previously screened has small net benefit. Adults who have never been screened for colorectal cancer are more likely to benefit.

### Using quality improvement techniques to increase colon cancer screening [^115bHbkV]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Screening has been shown to be effective and cost-effective in reducing the incidence of, and mortality from, colorectal cancer. Despite its demonstrated efficacy, colon cancer screening remains underused, with fewer than 60% of age-eligible adults reporting being up to date with recommended screening tests. Several factors account for the low rates of utilization, including patient, provider and system-related issues. Several interventions have been shown to be effective in overcoming these barriers, including the use of patient decision aids. Patient decision aids are tools designed to provide information to patients about screening options, help them consider the pros and cons of the alternatives, and assist them to reach a decision consistent with their values. The use of decision aids in clinical practice can increase screening rates by up to 14 percentage points. Mailing the decision aids to patients in advance of office visits appears to be a cost-effective means of implementation.

Burden and screening gaps — key epidemiology: Colorectal cancer "is the third leading cause of cancer death for both men and women, with an estimated 52 980 persons in the US projected to die of colorectal cancer in 2021". It "is most frequently diagnosed among persons aged 65 to 74 years", and "It is estimated that 10.5% of new colorectal cancer cases occur in persons younger than 50 years". Among adults 40–49 years, incidence "has increased by almost 15% from 2000–2002 to 2014–2016". Screening uptake remains suboptimal: "In 2016, 25.6% of eligible adults in the US had never been screened for colorectal cancer and in 2018, 31.2% were not up to date with screening".

### Screening for cancer: evaluating the evidence [^113hPzJ7]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Many patients expect to undergo screening tests for cancer. In evaluating screening procedures, physicians must take into account the known effects of lead time, length and screening biases, all of which can result in an overestimation of the benefits of screening. The gold standard by which a screening test is evaluated remains the prospective, randomized controlled trial, demonstrating reduced morbidity and mortality. The magnitude of benefit from screening is best expressed in terms of the number of patients needed to screen. This value ranges from approximately 500 to 1,100 for proven screening interventions. These concepts are illustrated by controversies in current screening recommendations for cancers of the cervix, lung, colon, breast and prostate, which together account for more than 50 percent of cancer deaths in the United States.

Flexible sigmoidoscopy for CRC screening — effect sizes and intervals are as follows: Randomized controlled trials confirm reductions in distal colon or rectosigmoid cancer incidence and/or mortality of 29% to 76% with flexible sigmoidoscopy, and it can prevent a small fraction (14%) of proximal colon cancers if liberal criteria are used to indicate colonoscopy based on flexible sigmoidoscopy findings. Flexible sigmoidoscopy when used is often recommended at 5-year intervals; there is no clear reason why flexible sigmoidoscopy should not be recommended at 10-year intervals, similar to the recommendation for colonoscopy. The MSTF considers that either 5- or 10-year intervals are acceptable but favors 10-year intervals.

### Design and evaluation of a colon cancer mobile application [^113YkQu8]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Although CRC incidence and mortality have declined steadily over the past few decades among adults over 65 years of age, an opposite trend has occurred in adults younger than 50 years, for whom routine screening is not recommended. The alarming increase in young adults combined with the continuing burden of disease in the general population indicates the need to develop new prevention strategies to complement screening. Due to the preventable nature of the disease, the need for public awareness about prevention and early diagnosis with existing screening methods is very important. Early detection is a critical public health strategy in all settings, especially in high-risk populations. CRC is one of the cancers whose mortality can be reduced by 9–32% with regular screening.

Given the slow progression of the disease from detectable precancerous lesions and the much better prognosis of patients diagnosed at an early stage, the potential to reduce the disease burden with early detection is significant. To improve the detection and prevention of this disease, finding more accurate, non-invasive and tolerable CRC screening tests has become an urgent need. In cancer prevention and control, the term screening includes the use of evidence-based tests for asymptomatic patients with the aim of identifying early manifestations of neoplastic processes before life-threatening conditions. CRC screening is essential and recommended for all people over 50 years of age. Although, from the point of view of patients, serum testing is better than stool testing, most patients also prefer to avoid colonoscopy, which is very uncomfortable. The effectiveness of screening programs is measured by cancer grade, mortality, survival, and disease incidence (if screening leads to the detection of precancerous lesions, for example, adenomas in CRC), and other factors include acceptability of interventions, quality of life, and affordability is the whole plan.

### Effect of screening sigmoidoscopy and screening colonoscopy on colorectal cancer incidence and mortality: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and observational studies [^111M1kUu]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Objectives To review, summarise, and compare the evidence for effectiveness of screening sigmoidoscopy and screening colonoscopy in the prevention of colorectal cancer occurrence and deaths.

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and observational studies.

Data sources PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. Two investigators independently extracted characteristics and results of identified studies and performed standardised quality ratings.

Eligibility criteria Randomised controlled trials and observational studies in English on the impact of screening sigmoidoscopy and screening colonoscopy on colorectal cancer incidence and mortality in the general population at average risk.

Results For screening sigmoidoscopy, four randomised controlled trials and 10 observational studies were identified that consistently found a major reduction in distal but not proximal colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. Summary estimates of reduction in distal colorectal cancer incidence and mortality were 31% (95% confidence intervals 26% to 37%) and 46% (33% to 57%) in intention to screen analysis, 42% (29% to 53%) and 61% (27% to 79%) in per protocol analysis of randomised controlled trials, and 64% (50% to 74%) and 66% (38% to 81%) in observational studies. For screening colonoscopy, evidence was restricted to six observational studies, the results of which suggest tentatively an even stronger reduction in distal colorectal cancer incidence and mortality, along with a significant reduction in mortality from cancer of the proximal colon. Indirect comparisons of results of observational studies on screening sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy suggest a 40% to 60% lower risk of incident colorectal cancer and death from colorectal cancer after screening colonoscopy even though this incremental risk reduction was statistically significant for deaths from cancer of the proximal colon only.

Conclusions Compelling and consistent evidence from randomised controlled trials and observational studies suggests that screening sigmoidoscopy and screening colonoscopy prevent most deaths from distal colorectal cancer. Observational studies suggest that colonoscopy compared with flexible sigmoidoscopy decreases mortality from cancer of the proximal colon. This added value should be examined in further research and weighed against the higher costs, discomfort, complication rates, capacities needed, and possible differences in compliance.

Discussion

This systematic review of randomised controlled trials and observational studies on the impact of lower gastrointestinal endoscopy on colorectal cancer incidence and mortality underlines the strong potential of lower gastrointestinal endoscopy screening to reduce the incidence and mortality from colorectal cancer. Evidence from randomised controlled trials is restricted to screening sigmoidoscopy. The four randomised controlled trials available so far suggest a reduction of total colorectal cancer incidence and mortality by approximately 20–30% in intention to screen analysis and 30–45% in per protocol analyses, with substantially stronger reductions for distal colorectal cancer and no or at best modest reductions for cancer of the proximal colon. Meta-analyses of the identified 10 observational studies on screening sigmoidoscopy suggest similarly strong or even stronger risk reductions than meta-analyses of the randomised controlled trials' per protocol estimates. Still stronger reductions in colorectal cancer incidence and mortality were seen in the six observational studies on screening colonoscopy, even though the difference between studies on screening sigmoidoscopy and screening colonoscopy was statistically significant for mortality from cancer of the proximal colon only in indirect comparisons.

Comparison with other studies

During the work on this manuscript two meta-analyses exclusively focusing on the randomised controlled trials on screening sigmoidoscopies were published. Despite some differences in inclusion criteria and analyses presented, the main results were consistent. To our knowledge, ours is the first systematic review and meta-analyses of observational studies. Given the lack of randomised controlled trial results for screening colonoscopy, systematic, joint presentation of results from both types of studies is required to enable the most comprehensive summary of the evidence available to date.

In general, randomised controlled trials are considered the gold standard for estimating screening effects, as they are less prone to several biases than observational studies, such as bias by self selection of screening participants, confounding, and recall bias. It is therefore reassuring that suggestions for the effectiveness of lower gastrointestinal endoscopy screening, which have been raised by multiple case-control and cohort studies since the beginning of the 1990s and which have led to the inclusion of endoscopic examinations in colorectal cancer screening recommendations and offers in several countries, have been consistently supported by results from the four sigmoidoscopy randomised controlled trials that have become available since 2009.

### Screening and surveillance of colorectal cancer [^113VqMpc]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Although colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, it is preventable. Screening modalities include fecal occult blood testing, flexible sigmoidoscopy, double-contrast barium enema, and colonoscopy. Colonoscopy allows effective detection and removal of precursor adenomatous polyps and is the dominant CRC screening modality. Emerging technologies include CT and MR colonography and fecal DNA tests. Effective and cost-effective surveillance after polypectomy and curative CRC resection requires balancing the protective effect of polypectomy while maximizing intervals between examinations; thus, estimation of the risk of recurrence determines the intensity of surveillance for individual patients.

### Screening for colorectal cancer: a guidance statement from the American College of Physicians [^116gDpDC]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Description

Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths for men and women in the United States. The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guidance statement for clinicians by assessing the current guidelines developed by other organizations on screening for colorectal cancer. When multiple guidelines are available on a topic or when existing guidelines conflict, ACP believes that it is more valuable to provide clinicians with a rigorous review of the available guidelines rather than develop a new guideline on the same topic.

Methods

The authors searched the National Guideline Clearinghouse to identify guidelines developed in the United States. Four guidelines met the inclusion criteria: a joint guideline developed by the American Cancer Society, the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer, and the American College of Radiology and individual guidelines developed by the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and the American College of Radiology. GUIDANCE STATEMENT 1: ACP recommends that clinicians perform individualized assessment of risk for colorectal cancer in all adults. GUIDANCE STATEMENT 2: ACP recommends that clinicians screen for colorectal cancer in average-risk adults starting at the age of 50 years and in high-risk adults starting at the age of 40 years or 10 years younger than the age at which the youngest affected relative was diagnosed with colorectal cancer. GUIDANCE STATEMENT 3: ACP recommends using a stool-based test, flexible sigmoidoscopy, or optical colonoscopy as a screening test in patients who are at average risk. ACP recommends using optical colonoscopy as a screening test in patients who are at high risk. Clinicians should select the test based on the benefits and harms of the screening test, availability of the screening test, and patient preferences. GUIDANCE STATEMENT 4: ACP recommends that clinicians stop screening for colorectal cancer in adults over the age of 75 years or in adults with a life expectancy of less than 10 years.

Implications for research and practice

Notwithstanding the undoubted importance of RCTs in demonstrating the principle effectiveness of medical interventions in general and screening in particular, the examples given above challenge the predominant or even exclusive reliance on evidence from RCTs as a basis for further progress in CRC screening. A complementary differentiated research agenda is required that should include, as a guideline, the following key elements:
Studies evaluating the diagnostic performance of novel biomarkers for non-invasive or minimally invasive early detection of colorectal adenomas and preclinical CRC, such as blood-, stool-, or urine-based biomarkers. Ideally, such studies should be conducted in a true screening setting among the target population of CRC screening, and include as reference a diagnostic gold standard and established non-invasive tests, such as gFOBT and FIT, for comparison. Examples include studies conducted among participants of screening colonoscopy with biospecimen collection prior to colonoscopy (e.g.).
Modelling studies evaluating the expected short- and long-term impact, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of various screening options in specific target populations for screening. Microsimulation models based on the natural history of CRC development are a particularly useful approach in this context. Apart from modelling overall effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of various screening methods, such approaches allow for comparative evaluation of specific design options of screening programmes, such as the start and end of screening offers at various ages, various screening intervals and follow-up schemes for surveillance after detection of colorectal adenomas, or various risk-adapted screening strategies based on a priori risk stratification. In an era of rapidly increasing cancer treatment costs, demonstration of cost-effectiveness or even cost-savings of CRC screening strategies could be particularly helpful for closing the translational gap between scientific evidence and practice of CRC screening.
Timely and close monitoring of process quality and outcomes of existing and newly introduced CRC screening programmes. Guidelines for quality assurance have been worked out in great detail. Key components include monitoring of adherence to screening and surveillance offers, positivity rates, and diagnostic performance of screening tests, follow-up, and management of positive results, stage-specific detection rates, and outcomes of colorectal adenomas and preclinical CRC, but also potential complications associated with screening-induced diagnostic measures such as colonoscopy (e.g.).
Timely and close monitoring of sex- and age-specific CRC incidence and mortality in the target population of screening based on data from population-based cancer registries and mortality statistics (e.g.). Both time trend analyses assessing trends prior to and after implementation of screening programmes in specific populations as well as comparative analyses of CRC incidence and mortality between populations with differential screening coverage are of particular interest in this context, along with studies with direct linkage of screening and cancer registries.

### Screening for colorectal cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115ZPVf2]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF colorectal cancer screening initiation and cessation — the USPSTF recommends offering colorectal cancer screening starting at age 45 years. Although the absolute risk of developing colorectal cancer in adults younger than 50 years is lower, rates are 20.0 new colorectal cancer cases per 100 000 persons aged 40 to 49 years, 47.8 new cases per 100 000 persons aged 50 to 59 years, and 105.2 new cases per 100 000 persons 60 years or older, and modeling suggests that starting colorectal cancer screening at age 45 years may moderately increase life-years gained and decrease colorectal cancer cases and deaths compared with beginning screening at age 50 years. In adults aged 76 to 85 years, the age at which the balance of benefits and harms becomes less favorable and screening should be stopped varies based on health status, prior screening status, and individual preferences; modeling studies estimate that generally, few additional life-years are gained when screening is extended past age 75 years among average-risk adults who have previously received adequate screening; and in adults 86 years or older, evidence on benefits and harms is lacking and competing causes of mortality likely preclude any survival benefit that would outweigh the harms of screening.

### Study protocol: population screening for colorectal cancer by colonoscopy or CT colonography: a randomized controlled trial [^113JnE3W]. BMC Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

The optimal screening test is still under debate. Stool-based tests and FS are considered as suboptimal tests. DCBE and capsule endoscopy are not recommended for CRC screening, because of its inferior diagnostic sensitivity.

Colonoscopy and CT colonography are the most accurate colonic exams and screening options by which inspection of the entire colon is allowed. Prospective data on the effectiveness (CRC mortality reduction) of population based screening programmes by colonoscopy and CT colonography are lacking. The effectiveness of a screening programme is directly influenced by the participation rate. It is expected that the participation rate of CT colonography screening is higher than with colonoscopy screening, because of the lower burden of the procedure. However, all CT colonography positives will need colonoscopy for confirmation and therapy or need surveillance which can lower the participation rate to the total CT colonography programme. It is not known to what extent this would influence participation rate.

This study will evaluate the efficacy of a colorectal cancer screening programme in the Netherlands using colonoscopy and CT colonography as a screening method. It will show whether participants are well-informed about the screening programme and what factors would influence (non-)participation. If this study shows that a prior consultation by telephone instead of a prior consultation at the outpatient clinic in colonoscopy screening has a positive effect on the participation rate, this would contribute to the effectiveness of future screening programmes.

This study will provide information on the uptake of a population screening by colonoscopy and CT colonography and on factors influencing the uptake. Furthermore, this study will give insight into concerns on CT colonography and especially on colonoscopy screening including burden of the procedures, risks and costs. As other screening options have already been investigated, this study will enable to determine the most cost-effective screening method for CRC in the Netherlands.

Background

What is known?
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer death worldwide and the second in Europe. The introduction of minimally invasive methods for colorectal cancer diagnosis is recommended in order to increase patient's adherence.
Colon capsule endoscopy and CT colonography are two minimally invasive techniques with high sensitivity and specificity in detecting colorectal cancer. No comparative and prospective studies have been done between both tests so far.

What is new here?
Colon capsule endoscopy detected more patients with any neoplastic lesion (regardless of size).
Colon capsule endoscopy is superior to CT colonography for detecting patients with significant lesions (i.e. ≥ 6 mm in size at colonoscopy), with a slightly lower specificity.
Colon capsule endoscopy and CTC are well-accepted, useful and safe strategies, with similar performance in terms of advanced neoplasm detection rate. However, CCE may benefit from a higher sensitivity for detecting small, flat, sessile and serrated lesions. The impact of these results in terms of overall effectiveness deserves further investigation.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer death worldwide and the second in Europe. Over the last decade, mortality has decreased due to the introduction of new treatments and screening programmes. Indeed, clinical guidelines recommend screening in average-risk (individuals over the age of 50 who have no additional risk factors) and high-risk (i.e. hereditary CRC syndromes, individuals with first-degree relatives with CRC, or patients with inflammatory bowel disease) populations.

There are different strategies for CRC screening, but the most extensively accepted are colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy and faecal occult blood testing (i.e. faecal immunochemical tests [FIT]). Other screening methods include CT colonography (CTC), colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) and DNA tests. In a randomised, controlled trial conducted by our group, subjects randomised to FIT were more likely to participate in screening than those randomised to colonoscopy. Moreover, on the baseline screening exam, a similar number of patients with CRC were detected in each study arm, but more adenomas were identified in the colonoscopy group.

Strategy 8 — research on earlier colorectal cancer (CRC) screening states to "support research to better characterize the benefits and risks of initiating colorectal cancer screening at a younger age". "Studies should focus on the cost effectiveness of screening younger patients, the performance characteristics of screening tests in specific cohorts of younger people, and how factors such as BMI, lifestyle, and family history impact risk in younger patients", and "There is also a need for studies to address adherence to different screening test methods by younger patients, as well as their likelihood of screening participation and compliance with recommended surveillance intervals". It further notes that "The increasing incidence of CRC in people younger than age 50 years may be secondary to changes in dietary patterns, activity levels, the gut microbiome, or other factors", and that effects "could be measured with novel assays that assess the colon mucosa for field cancerization or protumorigenic early changes in cancer development".

### Effect of screening sigmoidoscopy and screening colonoscopy on colorectal cancer incidence and mortality: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and observational studies [^111Dn5rY]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

In both randomised controlled trials and observational studies on screening sigmoidoscopy the reduction of colorectal cancer incidence and mortality was much stronger or even confined to distal colorectal cancer, which is consistent with expectations given the limited reach of the sigmoidoscope. With a lack of randomised controlled trials and only six observational studies, evidence for the effect of screening colonoscopy is still rather limited, even though it has been substantially strengthened by four most recent studies from the United States, Germany, and Switzerland published in 2012 and 2013. Despite some heterogeneity in results, which was to a large extent due to a less rigorous earlier study, meta-analyses suggest a substantially stronger reduction of colorectal cancer incidence and mortality by screening colonoscopy than by screening sigmoidoscopy, in particular for cancer of the proximal colon. Nevertheless, protection from cancer ofthe proximal colon seems to be less pronounced than for distal colorectal cancer even in cases of screening colonoscopy, which might be explained by lower detection rates of proximal compared with distal neoplasmsas well as differences in tumour biology. Major differences between proximal and distal cancers have also been found in studies not differentiating between screening and other colonoscopies (which were not included in our review), several of which had not found a protective effect of colonoscopy for proximal cancers. Given the still limited data on screening colonoscopy, its impact and relative effectiveness compared with screening sigmoidoscopy should be tackled in further studies. Also, further research is needed in which the incremental effectiveness of screening colonoscopy compared with sigmoidoscopy is weighed against the higher costs, complexity, discomfort, complication rates, and capacities needed compared with screening sigmoidoscopy. Furthermore, effectiveness of screening colonoscopy may strongly depend on qualification of endoscopists. Performing high quality screening with colonoscopy is challenging and requires major resources in terms of colonoscopy capacity, training, and quality assurance that may not be available or may be difficult to establish in many healthcare systems.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for colon cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, high-risk individuals, PSC, BSG 2019 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining less frequent 5-year colonoscopies, or earlier in the advent of new symptoms, in patients with PSC without IBD.

Response to Public Comments

A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from October 27, 2020, to November 23, 2020. Many comments were received on the USPSTF's new B recommendation to screen adults aged 45 to 49 years; some supported the new recommendation, others requested that screening begin at an even younger age, and still others disagreed with starting screening before age 50 years. The USPSTF appreciates the various perspectives that were shared. Although future research could further strengthen the USPSTF's understanding about the benefits and harms of colorectal cancer screening in adults aged 45 to 49 years, based on the USPSTF's assessment of the available empirical, modeling, and epidemiologic data, the USPSTF finds adequate evidence that screening this age group provides a moderate net benefit. Several comments requested clarification about how frequently sDNA-FIT is being recommended. The USPSTF has clarified that screening every 1 to 3 years with sDNA-FIT would be reasonable. Comments were also received requesting that the USPSTF provide a tiered or ranked list of screening strategies. Because no direct evidence compares different screening tests, and because local resources or patient factors may influence feasibility of different screening strategies, the USPSTF is unable to determine which tests are unequivocally "better" or "worse". The USPSTF added language to the Practice Considerations section to clarify this.

- More studies evaluating the direct effectiveness of screening with sDNA-FIT on colorectal cancer mortality outcomes and studies that report outcomes of patients who receive abnormal sDNA-FIT results but subsequently negative colonoscopy results are needed.
- More studies evaluating the direct effectiveness of screening with CT colonography on colorectal cancer mortality are needed, as well as more studies that report on long-term consequences of identifying extracolonic findings on colorectal cancer screening.
- More research is needed to understand the uptake of and adherence to individual screening tests (such as adherence to repeated screening colonoscopy after 10 years and repeated stool tests annually) and the effect adherence has on the overall benefits of a screening program. Similarly, more research is needed on the accuracy and effectiveness of emerging screening technologies such as serum- and urine-based colorectal cancer screening tests and capsule endoscopy tests to potentially improve acceptance and adherence to colorectal cancer screening, if found to be accurate and effective.
