## Question

A 36-year-old primigravid woman comes to the physician for a prenatal visit at 14 weeks' gestation. She has had episodic headaches over the past month. At home, blood pressure measurements have ranged from 134/82 mm Hg to 148/94 mm Hg. Today, her blood pressure is 146/91 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 13-week gestation. Serum creatinine is 0.8 mg/dL, serum ALT is 17 U/L, and platelet count is 320,000/mm³. Urinalysis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Chronic hypertension
B. Gestational hypertension
C. Eclampsia
D. Isolated systolic hypertension

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which diagnosis best classifies hypertension at 14 weeks' gestation in a 36-year-old primigravida. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which diagnostic categories are valid at this gestational age. Then, I should verify how each option is defined by major guidelines and whether it can be applied here. Next, I will review the provided laboratory and symptom data to exclude overlapping syndromes. Finally, I will reconcile the timing and diagnostic implications to select the most likely diagnosis and note uncertainties that warrant follow-up and management considerations.

> Let me first confirm the key diagnostic framework and thresholds. Chronic hypertension in pregnancy is diagnosed when hypertension exists before pregnancy or is first detected before 20 weeks' gestation, typically defined as sustained office systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic ≥ 90 mmHg on two occasions at least 4 hours apart, and it usually persists beyond 6 weeks postpartum, whereas gestational hypertension is de novo hypertension beginning at or after 20 weeks without proteinuria or other end-organ dysfunction, and preeclampsia requires hypertension after 20 weeks with proteinuria or specific end-organ features, and eclampsia is the occurrence of seizures in the setting of preeclampsia, which this patient does not have [^116iUymJ] [^1166neFi] [^114vMbkd].

> Wait, let me verify the timing here before jumping to labels. At 14 weeks' gestation, the pathophysiologic and guideline distinctions used to separate chronic from gestational hypertension are anchored to the 20-week boundary, so new-onset hypertension at 14 weeks cannot be classified as gestational hypertension or preeclampsia by standard criteria, and that means I should be cautious not to misapply those categories too early in gestation [^116iUymJ] [^11177e8M].

> Now, I will examine the data for organ dysfunction that would suggest preeclampsia even if the gestational age were ≥ 20 weeks. I need to check for proteinuria, thrombocytopenia, renal insufficiency, and hepatic dysfunction. The urinalysis is negative for protein, platelets are normal at 320,000/mm³, serum creatinine is 0.8 mg/dL within nonpregnant reference ranges, and ALT is normal at 17 U/L, so there is no evidence of end-organ involvement; moreover, there are no seizures to indicate eclampsia, so these findings do not meet criteria for preeclampsia or eclampsia even if the gestational age were compatible, reinforcing that preeclampsia and eclampsia are not applicable here [^115xkmu9] [^1166neFi].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about isolated systolic hypertension as a diagnosis category. Isolated systolic hypertension is a descriptive pattern rather than a formal classification in pregnancy; clinically we still categorize based on chronic versus gestational onset and look for superimposed preeclampsia when appropriate, so labeling this as isolated systolic hypertension would obscure the more fundamental question of whether this is chronic hypertension diagnosed during early pregnancy or something else entirely, and I should confirm that we are applying the standard chronic-versus-gestational schema correctly at 14 weeks [^116iUymJ] [^11177e8M].

> Let me consider the possibility of white-coat hypertension or transient elevations, but I should double-check the pattern. The patient has documented home and office readings in the 134/82 to 148/94 mmHg range over the past month, which suggests persistent elevation rather than a single transient spike; however, to confirm chronic hypertension in pregnancy, guidelines advise verifying with repeated measurements using validated devices and appropriate intervals, so I should ensure that the diagnosis is confirmed with at least two properly spaced measurements before finalizing the label, even though the timing already points toward chronic hypertension given the pre-20-week onset [^112B6BFP] [^114vMbkd].

> I should confirm the most likely diagnosis now. Because hypertension is present at 14 weeks' gestation, this fits the definition of chronic hypertension in pregnancy, and the absence of proteinuria and end-organ dysfunction excludes preeclampsia at this time; I need to ensure we continue surveillance for superimposed preeclampsia as gestation advances, but the current classification is chronic hypertension, and I should document that the diagnosis is provisional pending confirmation with repeat measurements and postpartum reassessment to distinguish it definitively from antenatally unclassifiable hypertension that resolves postpartum [^116iUymJ] [^11177e8M].

> Next, I should review management implications briefly to ensure the plan aligns with evidence. For chronic hypertension in pregnancy, current guidance supports initiating or intensifying antihypertensive therapy to achieve a blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg when sustained ≥ 140/90 mmHg, using agents such as labetalol or extended-release nifedipine, and avoiding ACE inhibitors, ARBs, atenolol, direct renin inhibitors, and MRAs; I should also counsel on preeclampsia risk and consider low-dose aspirin for prevention in appropriate risk profiles, while arranging closer prenatal surveillance for superimposed preeclampsia and ensuring validated blood pressure monitoring throughout pregnancy [^111rgRUN] [^112D6Tvk].

> But wait, what if the blood pressure normalizes later in pregnancy or was only mildly elevated at baseline. I should confirm that the classification can be revisited postpartum; if hypertension resolves within 6 weeks after delivery, the diagnosis may be reconsidered as antenatally unclassifiable hypertension rather than true chronic hypertension, which underscores the importance of postpartum follow-up and reassessment of blood pressure trajectory and long-term cardiovascular risk after a hypertensive pregnancy [^116iUymJ] [^113RicbT].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **chronic hypertension** because the patient has elevated blood pressure (134–148/82–94 mm Hg) at 14 weeks' gestation, which is before 20 weeks and therefore not gestational hypertension [^116iUymJ]. There is **no proteinuria or organ dysfunction**, ruling out preeclampsia, and no seizures, ruling out eclampsia [^1166neFi]. Isolated systolic hypertension is not a recognized pregnancy diagnosis. Management should include **close monitoring**, lifestyle measures, and antihypertensive therapy if needed to maintain blood pressure below 140/90 mm Hg [^111rgRUN] [^117LLKnN].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Key characteristics of chronic and gestational hypertension:

| **Aspect** | **Chronic hypertension** | **Gestational hypertension** |
|-|-|-|
| Definition | Hypertension present before pregnancy or diagnosed before 20 weeks' gestation, typically persistent beyond 12 weeks postpartum [^11177e8M] | New-onset hypertension after 20 weeks' gestation without proteinuria or organ dysfunction [^11177e8M] |
| Clinical features | Persistent elevated BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg without proteinuria or organ dysfunction | Elevated BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg after 20 weeks, resolving postpartum |
| Diagnosis | Elevated BP documented before 20 weeks on at least two occasions ≥ 4 hours apart [^114vMbkd] | Elevated BP after 20 weeks without proteinuria or organ dysfunction |
| Management | Target BP < 140/90 mm Hg; use labetalol, nifedipine, or methyldopa; avoid ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and atenolol [^111rgRUN] [^112D6Tvk] | Close monitoring; treat severe hypertension (≥ 160/110 mm Hg) to prevent maternal complications [^111rgRUN] |

---

### Preeclampsia

Preeclampsia is new-onset hypertension after 20 weeks with **proteinuria or organ dysfunction** (thrombocytopenia, impaired liver function, renal insufficiency, pulmonary edema, or neurologic symptoms) [^11177e8M]. Diagnosis requires elevated BP after 20 weeks with proteinuria or organ dysfunction. Management includes magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis, antihypertensives for severe hypertension, and delivery when indicated [^112641ko].

---

### Eclampsia

Eclampsia is **new-onset seizures** in a patient with preeclampsia, in the absence of other seizure etiologies [^1166neFi]. Diagnosis is based on seizures with preeclampsia features. Management includes magnesium sulfate for seizure control and prevention, antihypertensives, and supportive care [^111kc4Xt].

---

### Isolated systolic hypertension

Isolated systolic hypertension is not a recognized diagnostic category in pregnancy; hypertension is defined as **≥ 140/90 mm Hg** [^112XDdo6].

---

## Analysis of the patient's clinical presentation

| **Attribute** | **Findings** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| Gestational age | 14 weeks | - Before 20 weeks <br/> - Excludes gestational hypertension and preeclampsia |
| Blood pressure | 134–148/82–94 mm Hg | - Persistent elevation <br/> - Consistent with chronic hypertension |
| Proteinuria | Absent | Excludes preeclampsia |
| Organ dysfunction | Absent (normal platelets, ALT, creatinine) | Excludes preeclampsia |
| Seizures | Absent | Excludes eclampsia |

---

Given elevated BP before 20 weeks, absent proteinuria, and no organ dysfunction or seizures, the most likely diagnosis is **chronic hypertension**.

---

## Management implications

- **Monitoring**: Regular BP checks, urine protein screening, and fetal surveillance.
- **Lifestyle**: Sodium restriction, weight management, and moderate physical activity.
- **Pharmacologic therapy**: Initiate if BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg; use labetalol, nifedipine, or methyldopa; avoid ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and atenolol [^111rgRUN] [^112D6Tvk].
- **Delivery planning**: Timing individualized based on BP control and maternal-fetal status.

---

The most likely diagnosis is **chronic hypertension** because the patient has elevated BP before 20 weeks without proteinuria or organ dysfunction, excluding gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and eclampsia. Management should include close monitoring, lifestyle modifications, and antihypertensive therapy if indicated [^111rgRUN].

Gestational hypertension — risk and treatment evidence: It is the de novo development of hypertension after 20 weeks' gestation in the absence of new proteinuria or target organ damage and is associated with increased maternal and fetal/neonatal adverse events, with up to 30% of women ultimately developing preeclampsia. Following delivery, affected individuals have an increased risk of future hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The highest-quality randomized trial of nonproteinuric hypertension compared tight versus less-tight DBP targets (85 mm Hg and 100 mm Hg, respectively) and showed a reduction in severe maternal hypertension with tight control, with no other significant differences in maternal, fetal, or neonatal complications or pregnancy loss between groups. Post-hoc analyses associated development of severe hypertension with increased risks of pregnancy loss, neonatal intensive care unit admission, preterm delivery, and low birthweight.

USPSTF — Screening for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy recommends that pregnant persons be screened with blood pressure measurements throughout pregnancy (Grade: B). This applies to all pregnant women and pregnant persons of all genders without a known diagnosis of a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy or chronic hypertension. Implementation specifies that blood pressure measurements should be obtained during each prenatal care visit throughout pregnancy, that an elevated reading should be confirmed with repeated measurements, and that to achieve the benefit of screening, it is important that persons who screen positive receive evidence-based management of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. While risk continues into the immediate postpartum period and there is little evidence regarding screening during this period, a pragmatic approach would be counseling at hospital discharge regarding signs and symptoms of preeclampsia and for patients with hypertensive disorders to have subsequent blood pressure checks.

### Gestational hypertension and "severe" disease: time for a change [^116TkRaG]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Our understanding and management of gestational hypertension and its variants are substantially hindered by a reliance on antiquated terminology and on practice recommendations based largely on tradition rather than outcomes-based evidence. Unsurprisingly, gestational hypertension remains a major contributor to maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality rates, with little improvement seen over the past half century except as it relates to better newborn care. Reliance on a binary classification of vastly disparate types and degrees of organ dysfunction (severe or not severe) and the use of nonphysiological and largely arbitrary gestational age cutoffs are particularly problematic. If this situation is to improve, it will be necessary to abandon current misleading terminology and non-evidence-based traditional practice patterns and start again, building on management approaches validated by outcomes-based data.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^116iUymJ]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 — hypertension in pregnancy prevalence and classification are outlined as follows: Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy affect 5–10% of pregnancies worldwide. The definition of hypertension in pregnancy is based on office BP values, SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg, and is classified as mild (140–159/90–109 mmHg) or severe (≥ 160/110 mmHg). Pre-eclampsia is gestational hypertension with significant proteinuria (> 0.3 g/24 h or ≥ 30 mg/mmol ACR). Pre-existing hypertension pre-dates pregnancy or develops before 20 weeks of gestation and usually persists for more than 6 weeks post-partum, while gestational hypertension develops after 20 weeks and usually resolves within 6 weeks post-partum. Antenatally unclassifiable hypertension refers to BP first recorded after 20 weeks of gestation, with reassessment 6 weeks post-partum to distinguish pre-existing from gestational hypertension.

### Future cardiovascular disease risk for women with gestational hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113xoGC9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Gestational hypertension (GH), also known as pregnancy‐induced hypertension, is defined as the onset of high blood pressure (at least 140 mm Hg systolic or 90 mm Hg diastolic) without proteinuria on 2 occasions at least 4 hours apart in an ordinarily normotensive pregnant woman after 20 weeks of gestation. 1, 2 Rates of GH vary between countries, with 1% to 6% of pregnancies complicated by GH in Western countries. 3, 4

Pregnancy‐induced hypertension is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for subsequent cardiovascular disease (CVD) in women. 5 In particular, pre‐eclampsia, characterized by GH with proteinuria, is associated with a markedly higher CVD risk 6, 7, 8 and has been incorporated in the American Heart Association guidelines for the assessment of CVD risk in women. 9 It is unclear if GH and pre‐eclampsia are manifestations of different severities of the same pathophysiological mechanism or represent separate pathologies. 10 Therefore, the raised CVD risk in women with a history of pre‐eclampsia may not be representative of the risk associated with GH.

Studies that have assessed the CVD risk associated with GH have found mixed results. Results have ranged from no raised risk 11, 12, 13 to more than twice the risk of some cardiovascular events. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 This lack of clarity about the long‐term cardiovascular risk for women who have had GH without proteinuria is further underscored by calls for further research into this area by the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. 19 Consequently, we conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis of prospective studies to evaluate the risk of a range of cardiovascular events for women after 1 or more pregnancies complicated by GH.

### Future cardiovascular disease risk for women with gestational hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111RUBeR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Background Inconsistent findings have been found among studies evaluating the risk of cardiovascular disease for women who have had pregnancies complicated by gestational hypertension (the new onset of high blood pressure without proteinuria during pregnancy). We provide a comprehensive review of studies to quantify the association between gestational hypertension and cardiovascular events in women. Methods and Results We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science in March 2019 for studies examining the association between gestational hypertension and any cardiovascular event. Two reviewers independently assessed the abstracts and full-text articles. Study characteristics and the relative risk (RR) of cardiovascular events associated with gestational hypertension were extracted from the eligible studies. Where appropriate, the estimates were pooled with inverse variance weighted random-effects meta-analysis. A total of 21 studies involving 3601192 women (127913 with gestational hypertension) were identified. Gestational hypertension in the first pregnancy was associated with a greater risk of overall cardiovascular disease (RR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.17–1.80) and coronary heart disease (RR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.23–1.73), but not stroke (RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.96–1.65) or thromboembolic events (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.73–1.07). Women with 1 or more pregnancies affected by gestational hypertension were at greater risk of cardiovascular disease (RR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.42–2.31), coronary heart disease (RR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.33–2.51), and heart failure (RR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.47–2.13), but not stroke (RR, 1.50; 95% CI, 0.75–2.99). Conclusions Gestational hypertension is associated with a greater risk of overall cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, and heart failure. More research is needed to assess the presence of a dose-response relationship between gestational hypertension and subsequent cardiovascular disease.

### Practical guide for the management of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy [^117GrEjK]. Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and eclampsia, are a worldwide health problem. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy affect more than 10% of pregnancies and are associated with increased mortality and morbidity for both mother and fetus. Although patients' outcomes and family's experience will always be the primary concern regarding hypertensive complications during pregnancy, the economic aspect of this disease is also worth noting. Compared with normotensive pregnancies, those related with hypertension resulted in an excess increase in hospitalization and healthcare cost. Hence, the focus of this review is to analyze hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and to present practical tips with clear instructions for the clinical management of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. This overview offers a detailed approach from the diagnosis to treatment and follow-up of a pregnant women with hypertension, evidence based, to support these instructions.

### Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia: ACOG practice bulletin summary, number 222 [^116V7BJT]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy constitute one of the leading causes of maternal and perinatal mortality worldwide. It has been estimated that preeclampsia complicates 2–8% of pregnancies globally (). In Latin America and the Caribbean, hypertensive disorders are responsible for almost 26% of maternal deaths, whereas in Africa and Asia they contribute to 9% of deaths. Although maternal mortality is much lower in high-income countries than in developing countries, 16% of maternal deaths can be attributed to hypertensive disorders (). In the United States, the rate of preeclampsia increased by 25% between 1987 and 2004 (). Moreover, in comparison with women giving birth in 1980, those giving birth in 2003 were at 6.7-fold increased risk of severe preeclampsia (). This complication is costly: one study reported that in 2012 in the United States, the estimated cost of preeclampsia within the first 12 months of delivery was $2.18 billion ($1.03 billion for women and $1.15 billion for infants), which was disproportionately borne by premature births (). This Practice Bulletin will provide guidelines for the diagnosis and management of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Gestational hypertension — defined as the de novo development of hypertension after 20 weeks' gestation in the absence of new proteinuria or target organ damage — is associated with increased adverse outcomes, and up to 30% of women with gestational hypertension ultimately develop preeclampsia. Most RCTs of BP targets in this population have been small and of poor to moderate quality; the highest-quality randomized trial in nonproteinuric hypertension compared tight versus less-tight DBP targets (85 mm Hg and 100 mm Hg, respectively) and demonstrated a reduction in severe maternal hypertension with tight DBP control, with no other significant differences in maternal, fetal, or neonatal complications or pregnancy loss. In post-hoc analyses, development of severe hypertension was associated with increased risk of pregnancy loss, neonatal intensive care unit admission, preterm delivery, and low birthweight.

### Short-term postpartum blood pressure self-management and long-term blood pressure control: a randomized controlled trial [^113RicbT]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including both gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, affect 10% of pregnanciesand have significant impacts on maternal and fetal health during the peripartum period. Additionally, one-third of women develop chronic hypertension within 10 yearsand, over their lifetime, have a 2-fold to 4-fold increased risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and renal dysfunction. As a result, the US and European guidelines, advise that women should be informed of this higher incidence of disease after pregnancy and advise annual blood pressure (BP) monitoring, but, beyond routine risk factor management, no specific additional interventions are currently available to reduce long-term risk.

Prior research shows that persistently high BP 6 weeks after a hypertensive pregnancy is associated with a greater increase in BP over the next 5 to 10 years. This is independent of BP levels during early pregnancy, or at time of delivery, and is evident both in those with more severe hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, such as early-onset preeclampsia and later onset, milder disease. A plausible explanation might be that BP at 6 weeks postpartum is merely a marker of BP trajectory over the life course for that individual. However, without intervention, BP remains unstable for up to 50% of women for several months after a hypertensive pregnancy. An alternative explanation is that uncontrolled BP in the puerperium directly affects the cardiac and vascular remodeling, known to occur in the weeks after a hypertensive pregnancy in both mother and child. – In turn, this may lead to a long-term persistence of elevated BP, accelerating a lifelong trajectory of increased vascular risk.

To test this hypothesis required a randomized controlled trial of BP optimization after a hypertensive pregnancy. Trials of self-management, outside of pregnancy, have repeatedly demonstrated improved BP control. – In the SNAP-HT trial (Self-Management of Postnatal Hypertension), our group confirmed that postpartum self-management was feasible and that it improved BP control, with a more rapid return to normal BP ranges within 6 weeks of delivery, when compared with usual care. In addition, 6 months later, those randomized to postpartum self-management had a persistent 4.5-mm Hg reduction in diastolic BP. We have now performed a long-term follow-up of this cohort (SNAP-HT Extension Study), to formally test the hypothesis that interventions to improve BP over the first few months following a hypertensive pregnancy result in long-term reprogramming of BP in the mother.

### Effect of self-monitoring of blood pressure on blood pressure control in pregnant individuals with chronic or gestational hypertension: the BUMP 2 randomized clinical trial [^114ACbif]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Inadequate management of elevated blood pressure is a significant contributing factor to maternal deaths. The role of blood pressure self-monitoring in pregnancy in improving clinical outcomes for the pregnant individual and infant is unclear.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of blood pressure self-monitoring, compared with usual care alone, on blood pressure control and other related maternal and infant outcomes, in individuals with pregnancy hypertension.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Unblinded, randomized clinical trial that recruited between November 2018 and September 2019 in 15 hospital maternity units in England. Individuals with chronic hypertension (enrolled up to 37 weeks' gestation) or with gestational hypertension (enrolled between 20 and 37 weeks' gestation). Final follow-up was in May 2020.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to either blood pressure self-monitoring using a validated monitor and a secure telemonitoring system in addition to usual care (n = 430) or to usual care alone (n = 420). Usual care comprised blood pressure measured by health care professionals at regular antenatal clinics.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary maternal outcome was the difference in mean systolic blood pressure recorded by health care professionals between randomization and birth.

Results

Among 454 participants with chronic hypertension (mean age, 36 years; mean gestation at entry, 20 weeks) and 396 with gestational hypertension (mean age, 34 years; mean gestation at entry, 33 weeks) who were randomized, primary outcome data were available from 444 (97.8%) and 377 (95.2%), respectively. In the chronic hypertension cohort, there was no statistically significant difference in mean systolic blood pressure for the self-monitoring groups vs the usual care group (133.8 mm Hg vs 133.6 mm Hg, respectively; adjusted mean difference, 0.03 mm Hg [95% CI, -1.73 to 1.79]). In the gestational hypertension cohort, there was also no significant difference in mean systolic blood pressure (137.6 mm Hg compared with 137.2 mm Hg; adjusted mean difference, -0.03 mm Hg [95% CI, -2.29 to 2.24]). There were 8 serious adverse events in the self-monitoring group (4 in each cohort) and 3 in the usual care group (2 in the chronic hypertension cohort and 1 in the gestational hypertension cohort).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among pregnant individuals with chronic or gestational hypertension, blood pressure self-monitoring with telemonitoring, compared with usual care, did not lead to significantly improved clinic-based blood pressure control.

### Treatment for mild chronic hypertension during pregnancy [^117LLKnN]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

The benefits and safety of the treatment of mild chronic hypertension (blood pressure, < 160/100 mm Hg) during pregnancy are uncertain. Data are needed on whether a strategy of targeting a blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg reduces the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes without compromising fetal growth.

Methods

In this open-label, multicenter, randomized trial, we assigned pregnant women with mild chronic hypertension and singleton fetuses at a gestational age of less than 23 weeks to receive antihypertensive medications recommended for use in pregnancy (active-treatment group) or to receive no such treatment unless severe hypertension (systolic pressure, ≥ 160 mm Hg; or diastolic pressure, ≥ 105 mm Hg) developed (control group). The primary outcome was a composite of preeclampsia with severe features, medically indicated preterm birth at less than 35 weeks' gestation, placental abruption, or fetal or neonatal death. The safety outcome was small-for-gestational-age birth weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age. Secondary outcomes included composites of serious neonatal or maternal complications, preeclampsia, and preterm birth.

Results

A total of 2408 women were enrolled in the trial. The incidence of a primary-outcome event was lower in the active-treatment group than in the control group (30.2% vs. 37.0%), for an adjusted risk ratio of 0.82 (95% confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.92; P < 0.001). The percentage of small-for-gestational-age birth weights below the 10th percentile was 11.2% in the active-treatment group and 10.4% in the control group (adjusted risk ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.31; P = 0.76). The incidence of serious maternal complications was 2.1% and 2.8%, respectively (risk ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.26), and the incidence of severe neonatal complications was 2.0% and 2.6% (risk ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.30). The incidence of any preeclampsia in the two groups was 24.4% and 31.1%, respectively (risk ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.89), and the incidence of preterm birth was 27.5% and 31.4% (risk ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77 to 0.99).

Conclusions

In pregnant women with mild chronic hypertension, a strategy of targeting a blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg was associated with better pregnancy outcomes than a strategy of reserving treatment only for severe hypertension, with no increase in the risk of small-for-gestational-age birth weight.

Pregnant individuals with SBP ≥ 160 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 110 mm Hg confirmed on repeat measurement within 15 minutes should receive antihypertensive medication to lower BP to < 160/ < 110 mm Hg within 30 to 60 minutes to prevent adverse events (COR 1, LOE B-R). Pregnant individuals with chronic hypertension should receive antihypertensive therapy to achieve BP < 140/90 mm Hg to prevent maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality (COR 1, LOE B-R). Chronic hypertension in pregnancy is defined as a preexisting diagnosis of hypertension or SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg on 2 occasions at least 4 hours apart before 20 weeks' gestation. Individuals with hypertension who are planning a pregnancy or who become pregnant should not be treated with atenolol, ACEI, ARB, direct renin inhibitor, or MRA to avoid fetal harm (COR 3: Harm, LOE C-LD).

### Chronic hypertension in pregnancy: new concepts for classification and management [^113Mqrie]. American Journal of Perinatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic hypertension in pregnancy is traditionally classified according to degree of blood pressure (BP) elevation. Alternatively, stratifying women as high or low risk based on the etiology of hypertension, baseline work-up, and comorbid medical conditions will better inform clinicians about thresholds to initiate antihypertensive therapy, target BPs, frequency of antepartum visits, and timing of delivery. Women classified as high-risk chronic hypertension as described here require stricter BP management and more frequent follow-up visits as their associated rates of adverse maternal and/or fetal/neonatal outcomes appear higher than women classified as low-risk chronic hypertension. The latter group can in most cases be managed similarly to the general obstetric population.

### Are early pregnancy blood pressure patterns a crystal ball for predicting preeclampsia and gestational hypertension? [^111mFWhs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

In the United States, hypertension is responsible for more cardiovascular disease deaths than any other modifiable cardiovascular disease risk factor. Much has been debated about the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, which define normal blood pressure (BP) as systolic < 120 mm Hg and diastolic < 80 mm Hg. For most clinical practitioners, controlling BP within this range has become an attainable goal. The obstetrical community, however, has been required to confront how the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines would impact the definitions and therapeutic recommendations for pregnancy‐associated hypertensive conditions, considering that disease classifications in the pregnant population have been based on different BP cut‐offs.

During the last century, the definitions for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) have changed several times, with the most recent guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists published in 2013. According to these recommendations, HDP is diagnosed when BPs are ≥ 140 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 90 diastolic mm Hg on 2 occasions at least 4 hours apart after 20 weeks of gestation in a pregnant person with a previously normal BP. Unsurprisingly, and in contrast to the general population, the threshold for initiating antihypertensive therapy during pregnancy continues to be debated. Unlike other specialties, obstetricians are frequently challenged to balance maternal and fetal risks simultaneously. For example, maternal BP should be therapeutically lowered to prevent serious risks (such as maternal stroke, myocardial infarction, or placental abruption) and maintain an adequate placental–fetal blood flow during gestation (which decreases significantly when maternal BPs reach severe elevations due to vasoconstriction); however, antihypertensive use in pregnancy can confer risks such as fetal growth restriction through direct exposure of the fetus to medication or poor placental perfusion.

### Influence of gestational age at initiation of antihypertensive therapy: secondary analysis of CHIPS trial data (control of hypertension in pregnancy study) [^116SHUc1]. Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Main Findings

In this secondary, exploratory analysis of the CHIPS trial of less-tight (versus tight) control of nonsevere pregnancy hypertension, significant differences in outcomes were found according to the gestational age at randomization. At no gestational age at which randomization to treatment occurred were overall outcomes better if a strategy of less-tight (versus tight) BP control was pursued. This finding held true when considering women overall or for those with either chronic or gestational hypertension.

Less-tight (versus tight) control commenced before 24 weeks was associated with fewer babies born with birth weight < 10th centile but more babies born at < 37 weeks; importantly, there was no overall effect on the primary outcome of pregnancy loss or high-level neonatal care for > 48 hours. In the subgroups by type of hypertension, the findings were apparent only among women with chronic (not gestational) hypertension, among which there was no gestational age interaction; of note, by definition, women with gestational hypertension could be diagnosed only from 20 weeks.

For the mother, less-tight (versus tight) control was associated with more severe maternal hypertension at all gestational ages (as reported in the main trial publication), but this was particularly so when women were randomized before 28 weeks; a nonsignificant similar trend was seen in preeclampsia, and the effects were not obviously different by type of hypertension. Also, less-tight (versus tight) control seemed to be associated with more serious maternal complications after 28 weeks and particularly among women with gestational hypertension.

### Hypertension in pregnancy [^113eoHZR]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The hypertensive diseases of pregnancy commonly refer to a group of disorders whose definitions have changed over time within and among professional organizations. Pre-eclampsia, either mild or severe, is managed best with a policy of delivery at or beyond 37 and 34 weeks' gestation, respectively. Similarly, chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, and chronic hypertension with superimposed pre-eclampsia are conditions wherein it is difficult to justify expectant management beyond 37 weeks' gestation. The approach to management before these gestational ages is subject to interpretation of a limited body of literature.

### Risk of post-pregnancy hypertension in women with a history of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: nationwide cohort study [^115U71iw]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Most studies assessing hypertension risk after a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy have reported risks averaged over follow-up periods ranging from a few years to decades (eg). Apart from one study examining hazard ratios for hypertension in five year intervals after delivery, studies have not focused on hypertension risk specifically by time since a pregnancy complicated by a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy — that is, on the timing of hypertension onset and how the risk of hypertension changes over time. Our work indicates that the immediate postpartum years are important: the increased risks of hypertension associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy already exist shortly after an affected pregnancy. Furthermore, for women aged more than 30 years, gestational hypertension was more strongly associated with post-pregnancy hypertension than was pre-eclampsia, which is consistent with findings from some, but not all, previous studies and is thought to reflect aetiological differences between gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia. Hypertension during and after pre-eclampsia might be a marker of wider multiorgan system disruption, whereas the mechanisms underlying gestational hypertension may be more narrowly focused. An excess of undetected prepregnancy hypertension in women with gestational hypertension could also explain higher rates of hypertension immediately after an affected pregnancy, but differential detection of prepregnancy hypertension depending on later type of hypertensive disorder of pregnancy seems implausible. Furthermore, such an excess would not explain why risks remained larger for gestational hypertension than for pre-eclampsia decades after delivery.

### Severe maternal morbidity associated with chronic hypertension, preeclampsia, and gestational hypertension [^116Rn5Zj]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension complicating pregnancy is among the leading causes of maternal-fetal morbidity and mortality, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease after pregnancy. In US women of reproductive age, chronic hypertension has been steadily increasing during pregnancy, in step with maternal obesity. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and the American Heart Association define chronic hypertension during pregnancy as systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 140 mm Hg or greater and/or diastolic BP (DBP) of 90 mm Hg or greater prior to pregnancy or diagnosed before 20 weeks' gestation. This condition affects approximately 3% to 5% of pregnancies. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including preeclampsia and gestational hypertension, affect 8% to 10% of patients without chronic hypertension, while superimposed preeclampsia affects 20% to 40% of patients with chronic hypertension. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy combined with pregestational comorbidities substantially exacerbate maternal morbidity and mortality. Because chronic hypertension is relatively uncommon in female individuals of reproductive age, studies of severe maternal morbidity (SMM) have rarely evaluated risk for patients with chronic hypertension before or during pregnancy or did not exclude preexisting diseases and relied on limited administrative or vital statistics data. Thus, the risk of maternal morbidity outcomes for patients with chronic hypertension, complicated or not by preeclampsia and in the absence of other preexisting disease, remains unclear.

### Nonsevere hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and oral antihypertensive medications: an argument in favor of use [^117UizKc]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a common complication of pregnancy and a major contributor to both immediate and long-term morbidity and mortality. Recent data support the treatment of chronic hypertension during pregnancy to a blood pressure goal of < 140/90 mmHg. Treatment of severe range blood pressures (≥ 160/110 mmHg) in the setting of gestational hypertension is recommended to prevent severe morbidity and mortality; however, there remains clinical equipoise regarding treatment of gestational hypertension with blood pressures ≥ 140/90 but < 160/110. While there is limited data to support the treatment of gestational hypertension, we believe that treatment of gestational hypertension to a blood pressure of < 140/90, similar to the recommendations for chronic hypertension, will lead to a reduction in severe maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality related to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. In this expert review, we summarize the available data regarding the treatment of gestational hypertension and offer recommendations for the treatment of gestational hypertension based on our clinical experience.

### American college of cardiology and American Heart Association blood pressure categories-a systematic review of the relationship with adverse pregnancy outcomes in the first half of pregnancy [^1176odur]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Higher blood pressure (BP) measurements are associated with more adverse outcomes outside of and during pregnancy. To stratify risk management and justify additional investigations and interventions, a systolic BP (sBP) ≥ 140 mmHg and diastolic BP (dBP) ≥ 90 mmHg have long been categorized as hypertension. In pregnancy, hypertension has been regarded as chronic if hypertension is recorded at < 20 weeks gestation and as gestational if hypertension first appears ≥ 20 weeks gestation. When gestational hypertension occurs with proteinuria, another maternal end-organ complication, or uteroplacental dysfunction, the criteria are met for classification as preeclampsia, the hypertensive disorder of pregnancy associated with the highest maternal and perinatal risks.

AJOG at a Glance

In 2017, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) recommended lowering the BP thresholds for diagnosis of hypertension outside of pregnancy based on the association of these lower BP values with elevated cardiovascular risk. BP was considered to be normal if < 120/80 mmHg, and the traditional definition of hypertension (sBP ≥ 140 mmHg and diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg) has been termed stage 2 hypertension. Two new BP categories were created, namely elevated BP (sBP, 120–129 mmHg and dBP < 80 mmHg) and stage 1 hypertension (sBP, 130–139 mmHg and dBP, 80–89 mmHg).

Since 2017, the diagnostic criteria for hypertension from a sBP ≥ 140 mmHg and a diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg have not been changed in any of the pregnancy hypertension guidelines. In 2019, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) called for investigation into the consequences of adopting the 2017 ACC-AHA BP criteria. Many studies have been published, evaluating the association between preeclampsia (and other adverse pregnancy outcomes) and elevated BP, stage 1 hypertension, or a combination of both, particularly when BP was measured < 20 weeks gestation.

### Hypertension: sex-related differences in drug treatment, prevalence and blood pressure control in primary care [^116iahCa]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypertension in pregnancy

Management of hypertension in pregnancy poses a unique challenge for both the expecting women and their physicians. This is the case when treating both gestational hypertension, which is defined as newly developed hypertension after 20 weeks of gestation, and preexisting hypertension, which is defined as hypertension that either precedes the pregnancy or has developed within the first 20 weeks of it. The challenge is in part due to the narrower arsenal of available drugs, but the delicate balancing act of weighing potential advantages of treatment for the mother to potential risks for the fetus is also a major part. European guidelines from 2018 recommend initiation of pharmacological treatment when blood pressure is ≥ 140/90 mmHg in three groups of pregnant women: (1) those with gestational hypertension; (2) those with preexisting hypertension who develop superimposed gestational hypertension, i.e. women with preexisting hypertension who exhibit blood pressure values ≥ 140/90 mmHg after week 20 of pregnancy; and (3) those with signs of hypertension-mediated organ damage or symptoms suggestive of pre-eclampsia. In all other cases, the treatment threshold is ≥ 150/95 mmHg during pregnancy. Both American and European guidelines recommend methyldopa, nifedipine or labetalol when treating hypertension in pregnancy. The scientific basis for treatment benefits of hypertension in pregnancy is, however, decidedly weaker than that in non-pregnant adults. Recently, a large, randomized, controlled trial which compared a blood pressure target of < 140/90 mmHg to that of < 160/105 mmHg in pregnant women with preexisting hypertension showed a lower risk of maternal, pre-eclampsia related outcomes for the intervention group (mean blood pressure 130/79 mmHg), compared to the control group (mean blood pressure 133/82 mmHg). Furthermore, there was no difference in fetal safety outcomes, which could serve as a compelling argument for more active antihypertensive therapy in pregnant women with preexisting hypertension. Whether the results from this study will impact future guideline-recommended treatment targets for pregnant women with preexisting hypertension remains to be seen.

### A new definition of gestational hypertension? New-onset blood pressures of 130 to 139 / 80 to 89 mm Hg after 20 weeks of gestation [^114aKMZW]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Diagnostic criteria for hypertensive disorders in pregnancy have historically been based on the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology's definition of hypertension, previously defined as a blood pressure of ≥ 140/90 mm Hg. With the recent redefinition of hypertension, blood pressures of 130 to 139/80 to 89 mm Hg are now considered abnormal.

Objective

In this study, we aimed to test whether the new-onset blood pressure elevations of 130 to 139/80 to 89 mm Hg after 20 weeks of gestation in previously normotensive women are associated with increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, specifically the development of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy.

Study Design

We performed a retrospective cohort study at a single tertiary care center of all women who delivered singleton gestations after 20 weeks of gestation from January 01, 2014, to June 08, 2016. Normotensive patients were defined as having maximum blood pressure of < 130/80 mm Hg before 20 weeks of gestation and no previous diagnosis of chronic hypertension. Patients who remained normotensive for the remainder of pregnancy were then compared with patients who developed new-onset blood pressure elevations of 130 to 139/80 to 89 mm Hg after 20 weeks of gestation before delivery admission. The primary outcome was the development of a hypertensive disorder in pregnancy at hospital admission or during delivery. Clinical outcomes were assessed using χ² test and multivariable logistic regression.

Results

Of the 2090 normotensive women from our cohort who were analyzed, 1318 (63.0%) remained normotensive for their entire antenatal course before delivery admission and 772 (37.0%) had new-onset blood pressure elevations between 130 and 139/80 and 89 mm Hg. Women with new-onset blood pressure elevations between 130 and 139/80 and 89 mm Hg after 20 weeks of gestation have a significantly increased risk for developing a hypertensive disorder in pregnancy at admission or during delivery (adjusted relative risk, 2.41; 95% confidence interval, 2.02–2.85) including an almost 3-fold increased risk for preeclampsia with severe features, even after adjusting for confounders. There were no differences in other secondary obstetrical outcomes.

Conclusion

Normotensive women with new-onset blood pressures elevations between 130 and 139/80 and 89 mm Hg after 20 weeks of gestation are more likely to experience hypertensive disorders in pregnancy and preeclampsia with severe features at or during their delivery hospitalization. These more modest blood pressure elevations may be an early indicator of disease and call into question our current blood pressure threshold for diagnosis of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy.

### Guidelines-similarities and dissimilarities: a systematic review of international clinical practice guidelines for pregnancy hypertension [^112641ko]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to review pregnancy hypertension clinical practice guidelines to inform international clinical practice and research priorities.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Relevant national and international clinical practice guidelines, 2009–19, published in English, French, Dutch or German.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

Following published methods and prospective registration (CRD42019123787), a literature search was updated. CPGs were identified by 2 authors independently who scored quality and usefulness for practice (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II instrument), abstracted data, and resolved any disagreement by consensus.

Results

Of note, 15 of 17 identified clinical practice guidelines (4 international) were deemed "clinically useful" and had recommendations abstracted. The highest Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II scores were from government organizations, and scores have improved over time. The following were consistently recommended: (1) automated blood pressure measurement with devices validated for pregnancy and preeclampsia, reflecting increasing recognition of the prevalence of white-coat hypertension and the potential usefulness of home blood pressure monitoring; (2) use of dipstick proteinuria testing for screening followed by quantitative testing by urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio or 24-hour urine collection; (3) key definitions and most aspects of classification, including a broad definition of preeclampsia (which includes proteinuria and maternal end-organ dysfunction, including headache and visual symptoms and laboratory abnormalities of platelets, creatinine, or liver enzymes) and a recognition that it can worsen after delivery; (4) preeclampsia prevention with aspirin; (5) treatment of severe hypertension, most commonly with intravenous labetalol, oral nifedipine, or intravenous hydralazine; (6) treatment for nonsevere hypertension when undertaken, with oral labetalol (in particular), methyldopa, or nifedipine, with recommendations against the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors; (7) magnesium sulfate for eclampsia treatment and prevention among women with "severe" preeclampsia; (8) antenatal corticosteroids for preterm birth but not hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome; (9) delivery at term for preeclampsia; (10) a focus on usual labor and delivery care but avoidance of ergometrine; and (11) an appreciation that long-term health complications are increased in incidence, mandating lifestyle change and risk factor modification. Lack of uniformity was seen in the following areas: (1) the components of a broad preeclampsia definition (specifically respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, fetal manifestations, and biomarkers), what constitutes severe preeclampsia, and whether the definition has utility because at present what constitutes severe preeclampsia by some guidelines that mandate proteinuria now defines any preeclampsia for most other clinical practice guidelines; (2) how preeclampsia risk should be identified early in pregnancy, and aspirin administered for preeclampsia prevention, because multivariable models (with biomarkers and ultrasonography added to clinical risk markers) used in this way to guide aspirin therapy can substantially reduce the incidence of preterm preeclampsia; (3) the value of calcium added to aspirin for preeclampsia prevention, particularly for women with low intake and at increased risk of preeclampsia; (4) emerging recommendations to normalize blood pressure with antihypertensive agents even in the absence of comorbidities; (5) fetal neuroprotection as an indication for magnesium sulfate in the absence of "severe" preeclampsia; and (6) timing of birth for chronic and gestational hypertension and preterm preeclampsia.

Conclusion

Consistent recommendations should be implemented and audited. Inconsistencies should be the focus of research.

### Impact of antihypertensive treatment on maternal and perinatal outcomes in pregnancy complicated by chronic hypertension: a Systematic review and meta-analysis [^1137xWTp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The potential effects of "less‐tight control" on long‐term maternal morbidity and mortality have recently been highlighted. 19, 20 The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial stopped recruitment early due to the significant 25% reduction seen in a composite cardiovascular outcome (stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiac failure) with tighter control of systolic hypertension to a target of 120 mm Hg rather than the standard treatment target of 140 mm Hg; however, this was coupled with a significant increase in serious adverse events such as hypotension, syncope, and acute kidney injury. 77 Women of reproductive age with chronic hypertension are at substantially increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. 78 Reducing the incidence of severe hypertension and maintaining tighter blood pressure control in pregnancy might contribute to lowering their long‐term cardiovascular risk and warrant further investigation.

Earlier systematic reviews have focused on magnitude of initial hypertension rather than the underlying condition causing the hypertension. However, separating chronic and gestational hypertension, given the differing pathophysiological pathways and implications of treatment, allows focus on optimizing treatment for each condition and is much more relevant to clinical practice. 12, 13 Advances in the understanding of the mechanisms behind the exacerbation of hypertension in pregnancy and the associated increased risk of superimposed pre‐eclampsia should be complemented with randomized controlled trials that examine how antihypertensive treatment may need to be tailored to the underlying pathophysiology. The International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy guidelines classifying subtypes of hypertension in pregnancy have been refined over time, and head‐to‐head randomized controlled trials comparing antihypertensive agents specifically for the treatment of chronic hypertension in pregnancy using these definitions are urgently needed. 79

### Severe maternal morbidity associated with chronic hypertension, preeclampsia, and gestational hypertension [^115SbZnN]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

This study fills an important evidence gap in showing that the absolute SMM risk for individuals with chronic hypertension who avoided preeclampsia was only modestly higher compared with individuals who remained normotensive. It also adds to the evidence to advance precision medicine to improve risk stratification for preeclampsia that is called for by professional organizations. Lastly, preeclampsia is the major driver of maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality. These findings underscore the urgency of prevention and control of chronic hypertension before and during pregnancy as an important strategy to mitigate morbidity due to preeclampsia in pregnancy.

Abbreviations: ACC/AHA, American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association; ACOG, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists; BMI, body mass index; NICU, neonatal intensive care unit.

Women with gestational hypertension by both ACOG and ACC/AHA criteria experienced the highest rates of adverse fetal/neonatal events (Figure 3, Table 2; eFigure 3 in the Supplement). The increased event rate in this group was predominantly driven by a greater number of preterm births compared with never hypertensive women (adjusted RR, 3.38; 95% CI, 3.17–3.61). The use of lower BP thresholds improved the estimation of risk of an adverse fetal/neonatal outcome by 3.8% for the composite end point, ranging from an NRI of 1.4% for small for gestational age to 5.5% for preterm birth.

### Estimated prevalence of risk factors for preeclampsia among individuals giving birth in the US in 2019 [^113kNs1o]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

The risk of gestational hypertension or eclampsia increased with the number of moderate-risk factors (Table 1). Birth records meeting 2021 USPSTF criteria to definitively recommend LDA accounted for 196 377 (65.3%) pregnancy-related hypertension, while records with only a single moderate-risk factor accounted for another 81 383 of 300 080 (27%) cases. The absolute number of gestational hypertension cases is similar among patients with no risk factors (23 188 of 300 080 [7.7%]) and patients with 1 or more high-risk factors (25 348 of 300 080 [8.4%]) (Figure). The recorded incidence of gestational hypertension in individuals with at least 2 moderate-risk factors (277 760 of 3 166 241 [8.8%]) is similar to the incidence used to estimate threshold NNT for the USPSTF guidelines. Assuming a relative risk of 0.85 used in the 2021 USPSTF guidelines, the NNT for 1 or more high-risk factors or 2 or more moderate-risk factors is 63 (95% CI, 38–190). Individuals with only 1 moderate-risk factor accounted for another 81 383 [27%]) of cases, with a pregnancy-related hypertension incidence of 6.3%. The NNT when LDA is recommended for any moderate- or high-risk factor is 76 (95% CI, 46–228). In the setting of universal LDA the NNT is 82 (95% CI, 49–246) (Table 2).

### Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy [^111akAT7]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

The National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy has defined four categories of hypertension in pregnancy: chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension. A maternal blood pressure measurement of 140/90 mm Hg or greater on two occasions before 20 weeks of gestation indicates chronic hypertension. Pharmacologic treatment is needed to prevent maternal end-organ damage from severely elevated blood pressure (150 to 180/100 to 110 mm Hg); treatment of mild to moderate chronic hypertension does not improve neonatal outcomes or prevent superimposed preeclampsia. Gestational hypertension is a provisional diagnosis for women with new-onset, nonproteinuric hypertension after 20 weeks of gestation; many of these women are eventually diagnosed with preeclampsia or chronic hypertension. Preeclampsia is the development of new-onset hypertension with proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation. Adverse pregnancy outcomes related to severe preeclampsia are caused primarily by the need for preterm delivery. HELLP (i.e., hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) syndrome is a form of severe preeclampsia with high rates of neonatal and maternal morbidity. Magnesium sulfate is the drug of choice to prevent and treat eclampsia. The use of magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis in women with mild preeclampsia is controversial because of the low incidence of seizures in this population.

### Combining biomarkers to predict pregnancy complications and redefine preeclampsia: the angiogenic-placental syndrome [^113gK8nE]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Superimposed Preeclampsia, Chronic Hypertension, and Gestational Hypertension

Overview and Diagnosis

Gestational hypertension is characterized by elevated blood pressure during the second half of pregnancy in previously normotensive women, whereas superimposed preeclampsia (SPE) is the development of preeclampsia in women with preexisting (ie, chronic) hypertension. Preeclampsia occurs 3 to 5× more frequently in women with preexisting hypertension compared with women who are normotensive at conception. However, diagnosis of SPE based on current recommendations is challenging, as women already have hypertension and may already exhibit proteinuria.

sFlt-1/PlGF Ratio for SPE or Gestational Hypertension Prediction

The sFlt-1/PlGF ratio is a reliable tool for discriminating between pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders. Patients with preeclampsia or hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome have a significantly increased sFlt-1/PlGF ratio compared with patients with normal pregnancy outcomes or chronic and gestational hypertension (P < 0.001). A higher sFlt-1/PlGF ratio can facilitate diagnosis of early-onset SPE but is less predictive of late-onset SPE where angiogenic imbalance is less prominent. For example, in women with preexisting chronic hypertension, the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio is higher before clinical diagnosis at 20 weeks' gestation in individuals who subsequently developed early-onset SPE between 28 and 34 weeks, compared with levels in those who never developed preeclampsia (P = 0.001) or who developed late-onset SPE (P = 0.001). Furthermore, addition of the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio to a model comprising information on systolic blood pressure, serum uric acid, and plasma renin activity can improve predictive accuracy.

### Tests for predicting complications of pre-eclampsia: a protocol for systematic reviews [^114nBRPs]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is a common medical complication of pregnancy, affecting about 6–8% of all pregnancies. Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy consist of a group of disorders that include pre-eclampsia, latent or chronic essential hypertension, a variety of renal diseases, and transient (gestational) hypertension. The definitions used to distinguish these disorders differ, leading to uncertainty about their prevalence, natural history and response to treatment. Pre eclampsia is associated with several complications and remains one of the largest single cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity. They have been reported to account for 14% of direct maternal deaths and 18% of fetal or infant deaths.

Once the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia is established, timely management is of the essence to avoid or minimise mortality and morbidity. Clinical prediction of disease complications using a combination of patients' characteristics, symptoms, physical signs and investigations all of which we consider tests, forms the basis of clinical care in these situations. Therefore, there is a need for guidance regarding the best testing strategies with which to predict the development of complications in pre-eclampsia. As well as allowing clinicians to avoid unnecessary interventions in low risk groups, this would allow high-risk groups to benefit from monitoring of disease severity, use of antihypertensive therapy, administration of anticonvulsants, and antenatal corticosteroids.

### The 2017 American college of cardiology and American Heart Association blood pressure categories in the second half of pregnancy-a systematic review of their association with adverse pregnancy outcomes [^111jhHE8]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

A relationship between the 2017 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association blood pressure thresholds and adverse pregnancy outcomes has been reported, but few studies have explored the diagnostic test properties of these cutoffs when used within pregnancy.

Data Sources

Electronic databases were searched (2017–2021) for measurements of blood pressure in pregnancy at > 20 weeks, classified according to the 2017 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association criteria, and their relationship with pregnancy outcomes. Blood pressure was categorized as "normal" (systolic blood pressure of < 120 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of < 80 mm Hg), "elevated blood pressure" (systolic blood pressure of 120–129 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of < 80 mm Hg), "stage 1 hypertension" (systolic blood pressure of 130–139 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure of 80–89 mm Hg), and "stage 2 hypertension" (systolic blood pressure of ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure of ≥ 90 mm Hg).

Study Eligibility Criteria

Studies recording blood pressure at or above 20 weeks gestation were included.

Methods

Meta-analyses were used to investigate the strength of the association between blood pressure cutoffs and adverse outcomes, and the diagnostic test properties were calculated accounting for gestation.

Results

There were 12 included studies. The American College of Cardiology or American Heart Association blood pressure categories were determined from peak blood pressures at any point from 20 weeks of gestation and at specific gestational ages (20–27, 28–32, or 33–36 weeks of gestation), as available. A higher (vs normal) blood pressure category was consistently associated with adverse outcomes. The strength of association between blood pressure categories and adverse outcomes was the greatest with "stage 2 hypertension" (blood pressure of ≥ 140/90 mm Hg). The results were similar when peak blood pressure was reported either at any time from 20 weeks of gestation or within gestational age groups (as above). No blood pressure category was useful as a diagnostic "rule-out test" for adverse outcomes, as all negative likelihood ratios were ≥ 0.2. Only "stage 2 hypertension" was useful as a "rule in-test", with positive likelihood ratios of ≥ 5.0, for maximum blood pressure at > 20 weeks of gestation for preeclampsia and blood pressure within any gestational age groups for preeclampsia, eclampsia, stroke, maternal death, and stillbirth.

Conclusion

From 20 weeks of gestation, blood pressure thresholds of 140 mm Hg (systolic) and 90 mm Hg (diastolic) were useful in identifying women at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, irrespective of the specific gestational age at blood pressure measurement. Lowering the blood pressure threshold for abnormal blood pressure at > 20 weeks of gestation would not assist clinicians in identifying women at heightened maternal or perinatal risk. No American College of Cardiology or American Heart Association blood pressure threshold can provide reassurance that women are unlikely to develop adverse outcomes.

Introduction

Hypertension is the most common medical comorbidity encountered during pregnancy, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes for both mother and fetus. In 2017, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) released an updated clinical practice guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in adults. This guideline changed the criteria for diagnosing hypertension in nonpregnant adults to a blood pressure (BP) of 130/80 mm Hg or higher, lower than the previous cutoff of 140/90 mm Hg or higher. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) did not adopt the lower threshold and continues to define hypertension in pregnancy as 140/90 mm Hg or higher. Several prior studies have reported that, as expected, the application of lower diagnostic thresholds for hypertension is associated with an increased prevalence of chronic hypertension (between 8.5% and 10.0% higher). To our knowledge, this is the first US-based study to examine the application of the lower threshold to women throughout the duration of pregnancy, rather than only prior to 20 weeks' gestation.

The objectives of this investigation were to estimate changes in diagnostic information that may result from applying the 2017 ACC/AHA BP guideline criteria to pregnant women and their offspring. The first goal was to establish the impact of using this standard on the prevalence of chronic and gestational hypertension in pregnancy. The second goal was to quantify how reclassification was associated with estimates of maternal and fetal/neonatal outcomes, including preeclampsia and eclampsia, preterm birth, small for gestational age, and admission to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) within 28 days of delivery.

The clinical calculator "ACOG criteria for preeclampsia" for preeclampsia and hypertension in pregnancy.

The ACOG diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia is a clinical calculator developed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. It is specifically designed for pregnant women and is used to diagnose preeclampsia, a potentially dangerous pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure.

The clinical utility of this calculator is to aid in the early detection and management of preeclampsia, which can help prevent severe complications such as eclampsia, organ damage, and preterm birth. The ACOG criteria for preeclampsia include factors such as blood pressure measurements, proteinuria, and signs of organ dysfunction.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the ACOG diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia. However, it is important to note that this calculator is only applicable to pregnant women and should not be used in non-pregnant individuals or for diagnosing other conditions.

The ACOG criteria for preeclampsia calculator determines if a patient meets the diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia by assessing three key metrics: blood pressure, proteinuria, and symptoms associated with new-onset hypertension. Each of these factors is evaluated using specific conditions that are assigned points reflecting their clinical importance.

For blood pressure, two conditions are examined:

- A systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or higher, or a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or higher (based on two measurements at least four hours apart in a patient with previously normal blood pressure, after 20 weeks of gestation) scores 3 points.
- A more severe case, where the systolic blood pressure is 160 mmHg or higher, or the diastolic blood pressure is 110 mmHg or higher, scores 20 points.

Proteinuria, the presence of excess protein in urine, is assessed using different methods:

- No proteinuria scores 0 points.
- A level of 300 mg or more in a 24-hour urine collection, a protein/creatinine ratio of 0.3 mg/dL or more, or 2+ on a dipstick (in circumstances where other methods aren't available) each score 2 points.

The presence of new-onset hypertension combined with any one of the following conditions also affects the score:

- Thrombocytopenia, indicated by platelet counts less than 100×10⁹/L, scores 2 points.
- Renal insufficiency, evident either by a serum creatinine level higher than 1.1 mg/dL or the serum creatinine concentration doubling without other renal issues, adds 2 points.
- Impaired liver function, noted by elevated liver transaminases to twice their normal concentration, scores an additional 2 points.
- Pulmonary edema scores 2 points.
- New-onset headaches that don't respond to medication and can't be explained by other conditions, or visual symptoms, both add 2 points.

Scores from these categories are summed to get a total. In interpreting this total score:

- A score of 5 or more indicates the diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia are met.
- If the score reaches 22 or more, it suggests the criteria for severe preeclampsia are met.
- A score below 5 suggests that the diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia are not fulfilled.

This systematic approach helps clinicians make informed decisions about the presence and severity of preeclampsia, guiding effective patient care.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy — risk factors and inequities: Other factors associated with increased risk of preeclampsia and gestational hypertension include nulliparity, high prepregnancy body mass index, family history of preeclampsia, multifetal gestation, and the pregnant individual being 35 years or older, and risk factors also include maternal comorbid conditions such as type 1 or type 2 diabetes prior to pregnancy, gestational diabetes, chronic hypertension, kidney disease, and autoimmune diseases. The higher prevalence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and the increased risk for severe complications seen in Black persons may be due to their disproportionate burden of social and clinical risk factors, which largely result from historical and current manifestations of structural racism that influence environmental exposures, access to health resources, and overall health status.

Definitions of Hypertension

The criteria used to determine outpatient BP and hypertension diagnosis in this cohort have been previously described. Briefly, hypertension was defined as any of the following: (1) office BP meeting or exceeding the ACOG or ACC/AHA diagnostic threshold on 2 or more days within 30 days of one another; (2) an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code for hypertension (eTable 2 in the Supplement) and at least 1 prescription fill for an antihypertensive medication; (3) at least 1 office BP measurement meeting or exceeding the diagnostic threshold and at least 1 prescription fill for an antihypertensive medication; or (4) at least 1 office BP measurement meeting or exceeding the diagnostic threshold and an ICD-9 or ICD-10 diagnosis code for hypertension (eTable1 in the Supplement). The ACOG diagnostic threshold was defined as an office systolic BP (SBP) of 140 mm Hg or higher and/or a diastolic BP (DBP) of 90 mm Hg or higher, and the ACC/AHA diagnostic threshold was defined as an office SBP of 130 mm Hg or higher and/or a DBP of 80 mm Hg or higher. Chronic and gestational hypertension were defined according to standard definitions. Hypertension that predated pregnancy or occurred prior to 20 weeks' gestation was classified as chronic hypertension, and hypertension that occurred at 20 weeks' gestation or later was classified as gestational hypertension. In instances when the diagnostic criteria spanned 20 weeks of gestation (ie, an office BP that met or exceeded the diagnostic threshold occurred at 18 weeks, but the prescription fill occurred at 21 weeks), the case was classified as chronic hypertension if the second qualifying event occurred within 6 weeks of the initial criteria being met. All women were categorized as having no hypertension, chronic hypertension, or gestational hypertension by both the ACOG and the ACC/AHA criteria. Finally, women were cross-classified by their ACOG and ACC/AHA group into 1 of 6 categories describing the change, if any, from ACOG to ACC/AHA criteria: new chronic hypertension (ie, ACOG no hypertension and ACC/AHA chronic hypertension), gestational to chronic hypertension (ACOG gestational hypertension and ACC/AHA chronic hypertension), new gestational hypertension (ACOG no hypertension, ACC/AHA gestational hypertension), always chronic hypertension (ACOG and ACC/AHA chronic hypertension), always gestational hypertension (ACOG and ACC/AHA gestational hypertension), and never hypertension (no ACOG or ACC/AHA hypertension) (Figure 1).

Maternal and Fetal/Neonatal Outcomes

Compared with women who were never hypertensive, women with ACOG gestational hypertension who were reclassified with chronic hypertension using ACC/AHA criteria had the highest rate of preeclampsia/eclampsia (adjusted relative risk [RR], 13.58; 95% CI, 12.49–14.77) (Figure 3 and Table 2). Women with chronic hypertension by both criteria had the next highest rate of preeclampsia/eclampsia (adjusted RR, 12.54; 95% CI, 11.65–13.49) followed by women with gestational hypertension by both criteria (adjusted RR, 10.54; 95% CI, 9.78–11.35). Women newly diagnosed with gestational and chronic hypertension by ACC/AHA criteria also had statistically significantly higher rates of preeclampsia/eclampsia than never hypertensive women, which persisted after adjustment (new gestational: adjusted RR, 5.11; 95% CI, 4.74–5.50; new chronic: adjusted RR, 3.92; 95% CI, 3.60–4.26). Using the ACC/AHA guideline to reclassify women with hypertension at a lower BP threshold resulted in an NRI-assessed 20.8% improvement in the appropriate identification of women with preeclampsia.

### Summary of the NHLBI working group on research on hypertension during pregnancy [^1155EPqF]. Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

A Working Group on Research in Hypertension in Pregnancy was recently convened by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to determine the state of knowledge in this area and suggest appropriate directions for research. Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, especially preeclampsia, are a leading cause of maternal death worldwide and even in developed countries increase perinatal mortality rates 5-fold. Much has been learned about preeclampsia, but gaps in the knowledge necessary to direct therapeutic strategies remain. Oxidative stress is a biologically plausible contributor to the disorder that may be amenable to intervention. Hypertension that antedates pregnancy (chronic hypertension) bears many similarities to hypertension in nonpregnant women, but the special setting of pregnancy demands information to guide evidence-based therapy. The recommendations of the Working Group are to attempt a clinical trial of antioxidant therapy to prevent preeclampsia that is be complemented by mechanistic research to increase understanding of the genetics and pathogenesis of the disorder. For chronic hypertension, clinical trials are recommended to direct choice of drugs, evaluate degree of control, and assess implications to the mother and fetus. Recommendations to increase participation in this research are also presented.

### Blood pressure thresholds in pregnancy for identifying maternal and infant risk: a secondary analysis of community-level interventions for pre-eclampsia (CLIP) trial data [^116t9V3p]. The Lancet: Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension in pregnancy has traditionally been defined as a systolic blood pressure (sBP) of at least 140 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure (dBP) of at least 90 mm Hg, or both. Hypertension defined in this way identifies pregnant women at increased risk of pre-eclampsia and other maternal and fetal or neonatal complications, including death, and these women are recommended to receive enhanced antenatal care and monitoring worldwide.

In 2017, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association recommended lowering the blood pressure thresholds for diagnosing hypertension outside of pregnancy, classified as: elevated blood pressure (or elevated sBP; defined as sBP 120–129 mm Hg and dBP < 80 mm Hg), stage 1 hypertension (sBP 130–139 mm Hg or dBP 80–89 mm Hg, or both), and stage 2 hypertension (sBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or dBP ≥ 90 mm Hg, or both). Although the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and WHO have retained a definition of blood pressure greater than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg for hypertension in pregnancy, several studies have reported a dose-response relationship between increasing blood pressure and adverse pregnancy outcomes, across gestational ages;, these findings provide potential support for the redefinition of hypertension in pregnancy. However, despite use of blood pressure as an essential screening test in pregnancy, no studies have yet reported the diagnostic test properties (such as sensitivity and specificity) of various blood pressure thresholds for hypertension diagnosis.

### Management of hypertensive crisis: British and Irish hypertension society position document [^113UVj1Q]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (ACOG) practice guidelines define, acute onset severe HTN associated with pregnancy with a cut off SBP ≥ 160 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 110 mmHg. The goal of treatment is to achieve a range of 140–150/90–100 mmHg. For severe preeclampsia or eclampsia, the target SBP is < 140 mmHg during the first hour. ESC guidelines define SBP ≥ 170 mmHg or DBP ≥ 110 mmHg in a pregnant woman, as an emergency and BP ≥ 160/110 mmHg is considered severe HTN. A consensus position to lower BP to < 160/105 mmHg is described. NICE guidelines (NG 133) recommend a tighter target of 135/85 mmHg for all hypertensive pregnancies whilst acknowledging that the evidence base is weak. This BP target may be appropriate in many patients with preeclampsia and eclampsia where the baseline (pre-pregnancy and/or BP during the course of pregnancy) BP is near normal, however, it is difficult to apply this to other hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, namely gestational HTN, and chronic HTN, unless accompanied by superimposed preeclampsia, and/or adverse features due to associated concomitant EOD. The effects of reduction of BP in severe HTN in the context of preeclampsia is different from chronic severe HTN. There is no evidence that intensive lowering of BP in mild to moderate gestational and/or chronic HTN impacts upon pregnancy outcomes. The Control of HTN in Pregnancy (CHIPs) trial compared 'less tight' DBP target of 100 mmHg and 'tight' DBP target of < 85 mmHg and found no difference in the primary outcome. A post hoc secondary analysis unsurprisingly showed a tight target reduced the incidence of 'severe HTN'. This is in keeping with the Cochrane review findings of moderate evidence for BP control resulting in reduction in rates of severe HTN without impact on maternal or foetal clinical outcomes. Overall, the benefit versus risk of a tight prescriptive target for reducing the risk of a 'risk factor' is unknown. As with RCTs undertaken in ICH, most trials undertaken in pregnant women, have excluded patients with severe HTN with SBP ≥ 220 mmHg.
