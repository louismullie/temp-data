## Question

What did the CRESCENT trial show about a tiered cardiac CT-first strategy compared with functional testing for outpatients with suspected stable coronary artery disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the CRESCENT trial showed about a tiered cardiac CT-first strategy compared with functional testing for outpatients with suspected stable coronary artery disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the trial design and the exact tiered CT protocol. Then, I should verify the primary and key secondary outcomes, including diagnostic efficiency, downstream testing, costs, radiation, and clinical events. Next, I will examine sex-specific findings and reconcile them with broader evidence. After that, I should consider limitations and how results fit with contemporary guidelines and larger trials. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable conclusion with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the trial design and intervention details so I don't misstate anything. CRESCENT was a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial that enrolled 350 outpatients with stable angina and intermediate pretest probability, randomizing them 2:1 to a tiered cardiac CT strategy versus functional testing. The CT arm started with coronary artery calcium scoring, proceeded to coronary CT angiography only if calcium was between 1 and 400, and then considered further functional assessment if obstructive disease was found, while the functional arm used standard stress testing modalities, predominantly exercise ECG, with subsequent care per usual practice [^a41b6a4a] [^52940558].

> Wait, let me verify the primary endpoint and its definition because different summaries cite it differently. Some summaries describe a composite of clinical effectiveness, but the pivotal results consistently show that the tiered CT strategy reduced downstream diagnostic testing from 53% to 25% and accelerated time to final diagnosis, with lower cumulative diagnostic costs and fewer anginal complaints at 1 year, alongside higher event-free survival at 1.2 years, which functionally captures clinical effectiveness in this context [^a41b6a4a] [^52940558].

> I should double-check the efficiency metrics next. The CT-first arm required fewer additional tests, achieved a faster final diagnosis, and reduced diagnostic costs by about 16% at 1 year, while radiation exposure was slightly higher overall but mitigated by the calcium gatekeeper that spared about 40% of patients from CCTA entirely. Importantly, the proportion of invasive angiograms without obstructive disease was lower in the CT strategy, indicating more appropriate selection for catheterization [^a41b6a4a] [^52940558] [^1f1ba8a2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about hard outcomes. I initially thought mortality differed, but wait, I should verify the event definitions. The trial was not powered for mortality; instead, event-free survival at 1.2 years favored CT (96.7% vs 89.8%), driven largely by fewer unstable angina and related events rather than a mortality difference, and adverse event rates were low and similar between groups, which aligns with the modest sample size and follow-up duration [^a41b6a4a] [^52940558].

> Next, I should review sex-specific findings because the subanalysis is often cited. Women benefited more from the CT strategy in terms of time to diagnosis and reduction in downstream testing, likely reflecting the lower prevalence of obstructive CAD and higher rates of inconclusive exercise ECG in women. However, overall clinical outcomes at 1 year did not differ by sex, so the advantage is in efficiency and diagnostic yield rather than hard outcomes in this timeframe [^491b56bb].

> I need to ensure I contextualize these results within the broader evidence base. Compared with PROMISE, which showed no difference in a composite clinical outcome but fewer catheterizations showing no obstructive disease with CTA, CRESCENT's smaller size and gatekeeper design likely amplified efficiency signals. SCOT-HEART, with longer follow-up, showed a reduction in coronary death or nonfatal MI with CTA added to standard care, supporting the prognostic value of anatomic clarity and preventive therapy intensification, though CRESCENT itself was underpowered for such outcomes [^f034b847] [^b39fecc3].

> Let me consider limitations carefully so I don't overstate generalizability. The trial was open-label and relatively small, with short follow-up and low event rates, so bias and chance cannot be excluded. The functional arm relied heavily on exercise ECG, which has lower diagnostic yield than stress imaging, potentially inflating downstream testing in that arm. Finally, the calcium gatekeeper approach may not be as impactful in very high-calcium patients or those with prior testing, and contemporary practice often layers CT-FFR or CT perfusion to address functional uncertainty after CCTA [^a41b6a4a] [^397471d8] [^a021c6e1].

> I should confirm how these findings align with guidelines and newer strategies. Contemporary guidance supports CCTA as a first-line option in stable chest pain, and CRESCENT's tiered approach foreshadowed precision strategies that defer testing in very low-risk patients and add functional CT tools for intermediate lesions, as tested in PRECISE, which showed improved clinical efficiency with similar safety at 1 year. This reinforces the principle that matching test intensity to pretest probability and leveraging CT-derived physiology can optimize yield and cost [^ec5cf1f8] [^bdc21515] [^2b1f3e99].

> Putting this together, I should conclude succinctly. CRESCENT demonstrated that a tiered cardiac CT-first strategy with calcium scoring as a gatekeeper improved diagnostic efficiency, reduced downstream testing and costs, and was associated with better event-free survival at 1.2 years compared with functional testing, with the most pronounced efficiency gains in women. These benefits came with slightly higher cumulative radiation but were offset by the calcium-first approach that avoided CCTA in many patients, and the trial's limitations mean that mortality effects remain uncertain and results should be integrated with larger, longer-term studies and guideline-directed use of CT-FFR or CT perfusion when appropriate [^a41b6a4a] [^52940558] [^491b56bb] [^397471d8].

---

The CRESCENT trial showed that a tiered cardiac CT-first strategy (calcium scoring followed by selective CCTA) **reduced downstream testing** and **diagnostic costs** versus functional testing in stable outpatients with suspected CAD, while achieving a **faster final diagnosis** and fewer angina complaints at 1 year [^a41b6a4a]. Event-free survival was higher with CT (96.7% vs 89.8%), but **radiation exposure was slightly higher** and the trial was underpowered for hard outcomes; thus, CT is a more efficient diagnostic approach, though functional testing remains reasonable when CT is unavailable or unsuitable [^52940558] [^a41b6a4a] [^72cc2f8d].

## Study design and methodology

- **Design**: Multicenter, randomized, open-label trial.
- **Population**: 350 outpatients with stable angina and intermediate CAD probability.
- **Intervention**: Tiered CT (CAC, then CCTA if CAC 1–400) vs functional testing (exercise ECG, stress echo, or SPECT).
- **Outcomes**: Downstream testing, diagnostic costs, time to diagnosis, angina, event-free survival, radiation, and safety [^a41b6a4a].

---

## Key findings

| **Outcome** | **Tiered ct strategy** | **Functional testing strategy** | **P-value** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Downstream testing | 25% | 53% | < 0.0001 |
| Diagnostic costs | €369 | €440 | < 0.0001 |
| Time to final diagnosis | Shorter | Longer | < 0.0001 |
| Angina complaints at 1 year | Lower | Higher | 0.012 |
| Event-free survival at 1.2 years | 96.7% | 89.8% | 0.011 |
| Radiation exposure | Slightly higher | Lower | < 0.0001 |

---

## Clinical implications

- **Efficiency**: CT reduced downstream testing and costs and sped diagnosis.
- **Symptoms**: Fewer angina complaints at 1 year with CT.
- **Outcomes**: Higher event-free survival with CT, but the trial was underpowered for hard events.
- **Radiation**: CT exposure was modestly higher; CAC gatekeeping mitigated this.
- **Guidelines**: CT is a reasonable first-line option when available; functional testing remains appropriate when CT is not suitable [^ec5cf1f8] [^72cc2f8d].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Power**: Underpowered for mortality/MI; event-free survival difference should be interpreted cautiously.
- **Radiation**: Higher with CT, though CAC-first reduced unnecessary CCTA.
- **Generalizability**: Results apply to intermediate-risk, stable outpatients; not high-risk or acute settings.

---

## Conclusion

CRESCENT demonstrates that a tiered CT-first strategy improves diagnostic efficiency and reduces costs in stable outpatients with suspected CAD, with faster diagnosis and fewer angina complaints, and a signal toward better event-free survival. Radiation was slightly higher, and **hard-outcome evidence is limited**, so test selection should be individualized to patient risk, local expertise, and availability [^a41b6a4a] [^52940558].

Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiac computed tomography (CT) represents an alternative diagnostic strategy for women with suspected coronary artery disease, with potential benefits in terms of effectiveness and cost-efficiency.

Methods and Results

The CRESCENT trial (Calcium Imaging and Selective CT Angiography in Comparison to Functional Testing for Suspected Coronary Artery Disease) prospectively randomized 350 patients with stable angina (55% women; aged 55±10 years), mostly with an intermediate coronary artery disease probability, between cardiac CT and functional testing. The tiered cardiac CT protocol included a calcium scan followed by CT angiography if the Agatston calcium score was between 1 and 400. Patients with test-specific contraindications were not excluded from study participation. Sex differences were studied as a prespecified subanalysis. Enrolled women presented more frequently with atypical chest pain and had a lower pretest probability of coronary artery disease compared with men. Independently of these differences, cardiac CT led in both sexes to a fast final diagnosis when compared with functional testing, although the effect was larger in women (P interaction=0.01). The reduced need for further testing after CT, compared with functional testing, was most evident in women (P interaction=0.009). However, no sex interaction was observed with respect to changes in angina and quality of life, cumulative diagnostic costs, and applied radiation dose (all P interactions≥0.097).

Conclusions

Cardiac CT is more efficient in women than in men in terms of time to reach the final diagnosis and downstream testing. However, overall clinical outcome showed no significant difference between women and men after 1 year.

### Comprehensive cardiac CT with myocardial perfusion imaging versus functional testing in suspected coronary Artery disease: the multicenter, randomized CRESCENT-II trial [^a021c6e1]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to assess the effectiveness, efficiency, and safety of a tiered, comprehensive cardiac computed tomography (CT) protocol in comparison with functional testing.

Background

Although CT angiography accurately rules out coronary artery disease (CAD), incorporation of CT myocardial perfusion imaging as part of a tiered diagnostic approach could improve the clinical value and efficiency of cardiac CT in the diagnostic work-up of patients with angina pectoris.

Methods

Between July 2013 and November 2015, 268 patients (mean age 58 years; 49% female) with stable angina (mean pre-test probability 54%) were prospectively randomized between cardiac CT and standard guideline-directed functional testing (95% exercise electrocardiography). The tiered cardiac CT protocol included a calcium scan, followed by CT angiography if calcium was detected. Patients with ≥50% stenosis on CT angiography underwent CT myocardial perfusion imaging.

Results

By 6 months, the primary endpoint, the rate of invasive coronary angiograms without a European Society of Cardiology class I indication for revascularization, was lower in the CT group than in the functional testing group (2 of 130 [1.5%] vs. 10 of 138 [7.2%]; p = 0.035), whereas the proportion of invasive angiograms with a revascularization indication was higher (88% vs. 50%; p = 0.017). The median duration until the final diagnosis was 0 (0 of 0) days in the CT group and 0 (0 of 17) in the functional testing group (p < 0.001). Overall, 13% of patients randomized to CT required further testing, compared with 37% in the functional testing group (p < 0.001). The adverse event rate was similar (3% vs. 3%; p = 1.000), although the median cumulative radiation dose was higher for the CT group (3.1 mSv [interquartile range: 1.6 to 7.8] vs. 0 mSv [interquartile range: 0.0 to 7.1]; p < 0.001).

Conclusions

In patients with suspected stable CAD, a tiered cardiac CT protocol with dynamic perfusion imaging offers a fast and efficient alternative to functional testing. (Comprehensive Cardiac CT Versus Exercise Testing in Suspected Coronary Artery Disease 2 [CRESCENT2]; NCT02291484).

### Calcium imaging and selective computed tomography angiography in comparison to functional testing for suspected coronary artery disease: the multicentre, randomized CRESCENT trial [^a41b6a4a]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Aims

To compare the effectiveness and safety of a cardiac computed tomography (CT) algorithm with functional testing in patients with symptoms suggestive of coronary artery disease (CAD).

Methods and Results

Between April 2011 and July 2013, 350 patients with stable angina, referred to the outpatient clinic of four Dutch hospitals, were prospectively randomized between cardiac CT and functional testing (2 : 1 ratio). The tiered cardiac CT protocol included a calcium scan followed by CT angiography if the Agatston calcium score was between 1 and 400. Patients with test-specific contraindications were not excluded from study participation. By 1 year, fewer patients randomized to cardiac CT reported anginal complaints (P = 0.012). The cumulative radiation dose was slightly higher in the CT group (6.6 ± 8.7 vs. 6.1 ± 9.3 mSv; P < 0.0001). After 1.2 years, event-free survival was 96.7% for patients randomized to CT and 89.8% for patients randomized to functional testing (P = 0.011). After CT, the final diagnosis was established sooner (P < 0.0001), and additional downstream testing was required less frequently (25 vs. 53%, P < 0.0001), resulting in lower cumulative diagnostic costs (€369 vs. €440; P < 0.0001).

Conclusion

For patients with suspected stable CAD, a tiered cardiac CT protocol offers an effective and safe alternative to functional testing. Incorporating the calcium scan into the diagnostic workup was safe and lowered diagnostic expenses and radiation exposure.

### Calcium imaging and selective computed tomography angiography in comparison to functional testing for suspected coronary artery disease: the multicentre, randomized CRESCENT trial [^52940558]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The study CRESCENT was published by Marisa Lubbers and colleagues in 2016 in the journal Eur Heart J. This study is related to the following diseases: Coronary artery disease. In the CRESCENT study, the trial question was: what is the role of tiered cardiac CT protocol in patients with suspected stable coronary artery disease? In the CRESCENT study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the CRESCENT study, the population was: 350 patients (111 female, 239 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with suspected stable coronary artery disease. The key exclusion criteria were known coronary artery disease; invasive angiography; stress testing performed within the last year. In the CRESCENT study, the interventions were: n=242 tiered cardiac CT protocol (a calcium scan followed by CTA if the Agatston calcium score is 1-400) n=108 functional testing (standard diagnostic management, including stress testing and/or invasive angiography). In the CRESCENT study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in clinical effectiveness (39% vs. 25%; RR 1.56, 95% CI 0.34 to 2.78). In the CRESCENT study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in diagnostic yield of invasive angiography (72% vs. 58%; AD 14%, 95% CI -23.13 to 51.13) Significant decrease in downstream testing (25% vs. 53%; ARD -28, 95% CI -41.99 to -14.01) Significant increase in the rate of event-free survival at 1.2 years (96.7% vs. 89.8%; AD 6.9%, 95% CI 1.58 to 12.22). In the CRESCENT study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina, non-fatal stroke. significant difference in total adverse events (3% vs. 10%). In the CRESCENT study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with suspected stable coronary artery disease, tiered cardiac CT protocol was superior to functional testing with respect to clinical effectiveness.

### Combination of computed tomography angiography with coronary artery calcium score for improved diagnosis of coronary artery disease: a collaborative meta-analysis of stable chest pain patients referred for invasive coronary angiography [^c61c4fb3]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

We showed that combining the CAC score with CCTA findings improved the diagnostic performance in detecting obstructive CAD in comparison to CCTA alone, which was also reflected in a better net benefit over almost all threshold values for the combined tests, which will improve clinical decision-making in the different clinical scenarios. Furthermore, the improvement in the diagnostic performance was consistent across all clinically important subgroups, especially in patients with typical chest pain symptoms and patients older than 65 years. Finally, obtaining information on CAC scores in the routine diagnostic workup of suspected CAD could contribute to a better assessment of the patient’s prognosis and better adjustment of the therapeutic regimen.

Furthermore, another algorithm was studied in the multicentre CRESCENT Trial, where CAC scoring was done first with the sequential addition of CCTA if CAC was positive, demonstrating that fewer patients randomized to cardiac CT reported anginal complaints (p = 0.012). After 1.2 years, event-free survival was 96.7% for patients randomized to CT and 89.8% for patients randomized to functional testing (p = 0.011). CT afforded faster diagnosis (p < 0.0001), and additional downstream testing was required less frequently (25 vs. 53%, p < 0.0001), resulting in lower diagnostic costs (€369 vs. €440; p < 0.0001).

Stable chest pain—economic and downstream testing effects show similar costs for coronary computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and functional testing over follow‑up, with differences in subsequent testing patterns: In the near‑term, there were no differences in cost between patients randomized to CTA versus functional testing, with a mean difference of $254; induced costs did not result from additional outpatient or inpatient services or medication use, and higher antiplatelet and statin use following CTA has not translated into significantly higher costs; in CRESCENT, referral to exercise electrocardiography produced nearly half of patients undergoing additional diagnostic testing compared with only 1 in 4 in the CTA arm (p < 0.0001), and nearly 42% of the CTA‑strategy arm avoided follow‑up CTA based on coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring; overall, randomized evidence states CTA costs are similar to stress testing with only minimal differences through 2–3 years.

### Comparison of an initial risk-based testing strategy vs usual testing in stable symptomatic patients with suspected coronary artery disease: the PRECISE randomized clinical trial [^bdc21515]. JAMA Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this pragmatic randomized clinical trial, we sought to address remaining critical questions in the initial evaluation of participants with stable symptoms and suspected CAD but without known coronary disease. A strategy using deferred testing for minimal risk and cCTA with or without FFR-CT for others increased clinical efficiency as assessed by catheterization without obstructive disease at 1 year. Death or MI events were infrequent and not statistically different in the 2 arms, although MI events were numerically higher in PS. These results were obtained while reducing testing use, increasing diagnostic yield, and increasing preventive medical therapy use. Additional randomized clinical trials are needed to verify these findings, including safety, and to fully evaluate current guideline recommendations for initial testing in these patients.

### Outcomes of non-invasive diagnostic modalities for the detection of coronary artery disease: network meta-analysis of diagnostic randomised controlled trials [^72cc2f8d]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Economic resources are becoming more constrained while healthcare demands are increasing in this clinical setting. Therefore, it is important to assess the comparative effectiveness of such diagnostic strategies not only in terms of safety and diagnostic accuracy, but also in terms of efficiency and cost. To this effect, we found no difference in rates of overall downstream testing between anatomical and functional based strategies, while a standard of care approach was the strategy with the highest rates of downstream testing. This result could be attributed to the fact that doctors make the final decision to refer patients for further invasive testing on the basis of factors other than initial non-invasive imaging, such as clinical presentation, persistence of symptoms, repeated clinical encounters, and patient preference.A functional testing strategy might provide important cost benefits, owing to fewer referrals for invasive coronary angiography and revascularisation and lower radiation and contrast agent exposure while resulting in similar clinical outcomes.Such benefits could reduce healthcare expenditure in this common clinical scenario in appropriately selected patients with low risk acute coronary syndrome. However, the availability and rapid access to functional imaging modalities (such as stress echocardiography or cardiovascular magnetic resonance) in the acute coronary syndrome setting might be limited.

Implications for patients with suspected stable coronary artery disease

For outpatients with suspected stable angina, our comprehensive synthesis of diagnostic randomised controlled trials indicates that an initial strategy based on functional testing might be preferable, resulting in fewer referrals for invasive coronary angiography and revascularisation. However—as was the case for the group with acute coronary syndrome—our estimates for the risk of myocardial infarction and death were imprecise, and wide 95% confidence intervals again cannot rule out relevant increases or reductions in the risk of myocardial infarction or death associated with functional testing.

Guidelines published in 2012 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association recommend functional testing as the initial strategy.However, a concurrent use of functional and anatomical testing has been proposed on the basis of findings from two landmark trials (PROMISEand SCOT-HEART) that evaluated the role of coronary CT angiography in patients with suspected stable coronary artery disease.Our results agree with these guidelines, but contradict the recently updated guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). The NICE guidelines advise a non-invasive anatomical approach (coronary CT angiography) as first line diagnostic strategy with subsequent functional testing only in case of inconclusive results of the initial diagnostic test, without considering the individual pretest probability of coronary artery disease.

### The effectiveness of coronary computed tomography angiography and functional testing for the diagnosis of obstructive coronary artery disease: results from the individual patient data collaborative meta-analysis of cardiac CT (COME-CCT) [^c48a281f]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Moreover, the SCOT-HEART and the CRESCENT trial (Calcium imaging and selective CTA in comparison to functional testing for suspected CAD), both comparing CTA with functional cardiac tests, found a reduction in cardiac events for the CTA group after a median follow-up of 1.7 years or 1.2 years. The improvement is likely due to the change in preventive therapy regimens through CTA, such as prescription of statins, aspirin and smoking cessation, especially in the large patient group with non-obstructive CAD. Interestingly, a post-hoc analysis of the SCOT-HEART trial revealed an association of exercise-ECG with revascularisation procedures and future risk of adverse coronary events, but to a lower extent than CTA while CTA also offers information about undetected CAD and improves clinical decision-making.

In a sensitivity analysis excluding two trials (CRESCENTand PROMISE) that randomised the patients to a non-specific functional test, the obtained estimates did not allow for any clear discrimination between the individual diagnostic strategies (appendix 11). By comparison of functional with anatomical testing in terms of risk of myocardial infarction, the number needed to harm was 480. The 95% confidence interval indicated that results were compatible with a beneficial effect of a strategy based on functional compared with anatomical testing, resulting in a number needed to treat to prevent one event of 1289 or more. The confidence interval also indicated that results were compatible with a harmful effect of functional testing, resulting in a number needed to harm to cause one event of 155 or more (table 2).

In a tiered strategy in CRESCENT I using CAC as the index test with follow-up CCTA only for detectable CAC or high pretest risk, nearly 40% of patients did not undergo CCTA, overall 1-year costs were significantly lower in the CAC tiered testing protocol (16% cost savings; P<0.0001), and 1-year MACE-free survival was higher in the CAC-guided testing arm (97%) compared with exercise ECG (90%; HR: 0.32; P=0.011).

Data synthesis and analysis

We performed the predefined analyses separately for each group of study population as defined according to clinical presentation, and for each outcome according to established meta-analytical methods.The detailed analysis plan is available in PROSPERO (CRD42016049442). Study specific odds ratios were synthesised by use of random effects pairwise and network meta-analysis.A treatment hierarchy was obtained according to ranking probabilities summarised with the surface under the cumulative ranking curve.We estimated a common heterogeneity by using restricted maximum likelihood and evaluated its magnitude by comparing the estimated variance (𝜏 2) to its empirical distribution for pharmacological interventions and semiobjective outcomes. According to the empirical distribution, the median is 0.04 (interquartile range 0-1.58).Estimates around 0.04, 0.16, and 0.36 can be considered to represent a low, moderate, and high degree of heterogeneity, respectively.To evaluate the assumption of consistency,we compared the direct and indirect evidence within each loop of evidenceand used a design by treatment test.In case of important heterogeneity or inconsistency, we planned to explore sources using potential effect modifiers as described in the protocol, but this was not possible owing to the low number of trials.

In primary analyses, we considered each individual diagnostic strategy separately as applied in each trial. Two trials, CRESCENTand PROMISE,randomised patients to an anatomical versus a functional diagnostic strategy using functional tests that are widely available in clinical practice (exercise electrocardiograms, stress echocardiography, and single photon emission CT-myocardial perfusion imaging). For the primary analysis, these trials were assigned as having randomised the patients to exercise electrocardiogramsand to single photon emission CT-myocardial perfusion imaging,which were the most frequently used tests in each trial.

In secondary analyses, we grouped traditional functional tests in a single node and compared them with coronary CT angiography as a purely anatomical test and cardiovascular magnetic resonance as an advanced imaging modality. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance was not included in the node of functional tests because of the different nature and availability of this advance imaging modality. This merging of tests is expected to increase the power of the analysis.Finally, we did a sensitivity analysis by excluding the two trialsthat did not randomise the patients to an individual diagnostic strategy.

Randomized controlled trials of coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) in patients with stable chest pain—For diagnosis, CTA was superior to functional testing or standard of care, with the SCOT-HEART trial reporting a 2-fold increase in diagnostic certainty. In SCOT-HEART 5-year follow-up, early increases in invasive angiography and revascularization were offset and by 5 years there was no difference; beyond the first year CTA was associated with less invasive coronary angiography (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.95; p = 0.022) and less coronary revascularization (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.90; p = 0.015). For symptoms, CAPP and CRESCENT reported reduced angina after 12 months, with similar improvements in SCOT-HEART especially among those with normal coronary arteries or those with obstructive disease who underwent coronary revascularization. For clinical outcomes, although there was no difference in the primary composite, CTA appeared to be associated with a lower rate of death or myocardial infarction at 12 months, and meta-analysis reported reduced myocardial infarction with CTA (hazard ratio, 0.69 [95% confidence intervals, 0.49 to 0.98]) but no effect on overall mortality.

Coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) and coronary artery calcium (CAC) scanning—cost-value: In outpatients, long-term costs were generally similar between CCTA and stress testing with minimal differences at 2 to 3 years; in CONSERVE, 823 patients were randomized and cumulative diagnostic costs were $1183 for selective CCTA-guided referral versus $2755 for direct referral (57% lower costs); in CRESCENT I, CAC-first tiering meant nearly 40% did not undergo CCTA and overall 1-year costs were lower (16% cost savings; P<0.0001) with higher 1-year MACE-free survival in the CAC-guided arm (97%) versus exercise ECG (90%; HR: 0.32; P=0.011).

CTA specificity and value-added modalities: CTA has lower specificity and positive predictive value, similar to stress imaging, but CT-FFR and CTP may significantly minimize this disadvantage. Evidence supports CT-FFR for diagnosing CAD in stable chest pain with diagnostic rates comparable to invasive FFR, and early CT perfusion data suggest a similar gain. Tiered testing as in CRESCENT I and II showed advantages in early discharge and safe outcomes in small randomized trials; however, robust evidence-based recommendations await well conducted prospective studies, and hybrid CTA–PET approaches are being developed to improve the predictive value of a positive CTA.

Symptomatic patients—pretest probability models and coronary artery calcium (CAC) evidence: “There are several pretest probability scores for use in symptomatic patients with suspected CAD.” “The CAD Consortium models include basic (age, sex, symptoms, and hospital setting); clinical (basic model + risk factors: diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking); and extended (clinical model + CAC) versions.” “Among symptomatic patients, a CAC score of zero identifies a low-risk cohort of patients who may not require additional diagnostic testing; most events occur among patients with detectable CAC (eg, 84% in the PROMISE trial).” “From the CRESCENT I (Comprehensive Cardiac CT Versus Exercise Testing in Suspected Coronary Artery Disease) trial, 350 symptomatic patients were randomized to CAC scanning versus exercise ECGs.” “Only patients with detectable CAC or high pretest risk (141/242) underwent follow-up CCTA.” “At 1 year, the CAC arm was associated with a reduction in cardiovascular disease events when compared with those who underwent exercise testing alone (P=0.011).” “Using this approach, there was no significant difference in CAD death or hospitalization for an ACS or heart failure, with either test, but exercise testing alone provided significant cost savings.”

### Functional compared to anatomical imaging in the initial evaluation of patients with suspected coronary artery disease: an international, multi-center, randomized controlled trial (IAEA-SPECT / CTA study) [^87c88060]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In the initial evaluation of patients with suspected CAD, a strategy of functional testing with stress-rest MPI compared to CCTA, may result in less downstream testing, but with a small increase in radiation exposure to patients. These results must be taken into consideration when choosing the initial test for the evaluation of patients with suspected CAD.

### Evaluation of computed tomography in patients with atypical angina or chest pain clinically referred for invasive coronary angiography: randomised controlled trial [^ae42d2dd]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Clinical context

The significantly shorter length of stay in the CT group might help reduce costs when CT is used in properly selected patients with atypical presentation.Detailed analysis using data from the current and other randomised controlled trialscould allow estimation of the relative cost effectiveness of CT versus invasive anatomical or functional tests for specific patient groups.CT resulted in a similar radiation dose in the CT group and coronary angiography group. Personalised adjustment of X-ray tube output to individual patient sizes, and novel model based iterative reconstruction might further reduce the radiation dose of CT.In our study, overall radiation dose was reduced by individual adjustment of anatomical coverage of CT angiography using previous coronary calcium scanning.The recent CRESCENT (Computed Tomography vs. Exercise Testing in Suspected Coronary Artery Disease) trial used a zero calcium score to exclude coronary artery disease and defer CT angiography,and our findings confirm the potential of this approach as only one of 71 patients with a zero calcium score had obstructive coronary artery disease (see supplementary table 2 in appendix B). Performing diagnostic tests also has psychologically mediated effects. In a randomised study, the investigators showed that even tests with no diagnostic value can reduce short term disability and increase satisfaction.Although the two tests performed in our study have diagnostic value, it is still likely that patients’ expectations influence disability and preference, whereas procedural complications and events are unlikely to be affected. Importantly, more than three quarters of our patients indicated a preference for CT over coronary angiography for future imaging which, according to their assessment, should ideally be performed non-invasively, over a short period, and in an outpatient setting.

Implementation issues

CT is an accurate non-invasive alternative to coronary angiography. Its conduct is well standardised in guidelinesand based on an international survey,and thus there is no barrier to implementation. However, easier access to CT might result in lower thresholds for non-invasive than for invasive imaging and could thereby increase subsequent invasive procedures. This undesired effect can be avoided if cardiac CT is carefully implemented and used in the right patients and at the right time.Identifying the right patients is not trivial in routine practice, and our study showed that clinical approaches to estimate pretest probabilityrelevantly overestimate the true prevalence of coronary artery disease in patients with atypical angina or chest pain clinically referred for invasive coronary angiography. Therefore, optimised tools for predicting the probability of obstructive coronary artery disease are clinically desired.

### Comparison of an initial risk-based testing strategy vs usual testing in stable symptomatic patients with suspected coronary artery disease: the PRECISE randomized clinical trial [^35d9178e]. JAMA Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Limitations

Several limitations of the trial should be considered. The PS addresses choices often considered simultaneously in real-world decision-making, as they are in the PRECISE trial: risk stratification, deferred testing, and use of cCTA with selective FFR-CT as the initial test. The separate effects of each choice cannot be determined. The pragmatic trial design precludes evaluation of different UT choices or close monitoring of trial recommendations to use optimal medical treatment in all participants. Interaction testing indicated a point estimate of 0.71 for the primary end point in the noninvasive arm, but the CI upper bound is 1.09, indicating that this potentially favorable subgroup estimate lacks sufficient precision to exclude the null effect. Uncertainty remains regarding the prognostic effects of the PS beyond 1-year follow-up of the PRECISE trial, particularly regarding the revascularization rates and beneficial effects of greater preventive medication use, which are likely underestimated at 1 year.Similarly, nonfatal periprocedural and type 2 MIs account for much of the difference between arms and may have variable prognostic importance., Costs/resource use will be reported separately.

### Comparison of an initial risk-based testing strategy vs usual testing in stable symptomatic patients with suspected coronary artery disease: the PRECISE randomized clinical trial [^65866dbd]. JAMA Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

A noteworthy advantage of PS is higher use of lipid-lowering (50.0% vs 41.8%) and antiplatelet (35.7% vs 27.1%) medications at 1 year compared with UT, despite less frequent use of catheterization (135 vs 177). These findings closely replicate previous trials, and show that the detailed anatomic and physiological data provided by cCTA with or without FFR-CT enhance the use of prognostically beneficial preventive medical therapies. Importantly, in the SCOT-HEART trial, the 40% reduction in MIs in the CTA arm was fully attributable to higher preventive medication use.

Crucially, the PRECISE cohort was similar in risk burden and symptoms to other large trials of initial testing in stable symptoms and suspected CAD. Given the PRECISE trial’s pragmatic design, management including medical therapy and decisions regarding revascularization in both arms was site directed, thereby improving the generalizability of results. Site decisions resulted in total catheterizations being less frequent in PS and revascularization more frequent, reflecting real-world practice where revascularization is commonly used for hemodynamically significant obstructive disease. This finding is similar to that of the TARGET trial(although invasive catheterization was performed per protocol for any positive FFR-CT or functional test) and complementary to, not in conflict with, the International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches (ISCHEMIA) trial. Indeed, the physiologic discipline that FFR-CT imposes on cCTA anatomic results, by downgrading anatomically significant stenoses and identifying hemodynamic significance in more modest lesions,appears to have protected PRECISE participants from excess cardiac catheterization seen in earlier cCTA-only trials.Importantly, the nearly 2-fold greater number of participants with high-risk anatomy who underwent revascularization in the precision arm suggests that, given our randomized cohort, there may have been underdetection of this group with usual testing. However, the greater rates of revascularization in the precision arm do not translate into fewer MIs and cardiovascular hospitalizations, which were numerically higher in the precision arm.

### Sex associations and computed tomography coronary angiography-guided management in patients with stable chest pain [^2cbd10c3]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We have undertaken an analysis by sex of the main findings in the SCOT-HEART trial. Compared with men, women had differences in the typicality of their anginal symptoms, a higher likelihood of having normal coronary arteries, and more frequent diagnostic and therapeutic changes with CTCA-guided management. In particular, CTCA modified apparent over-diagnosis and treatment of women who had been incorrectly diagnosed with CHD and angina due to CHD. Both women and men appear to benefit equally from the addition of CTCA to standard care with no evidence of an interaction between sex and health outcomes identified.

In line with prior reports,women reported less typical anginal symptoms making clinical assessment more challenging. This diagnostic uncertainty, and lower prevalence of obstructive CHD, led to an over-diagnosis of CHD and angina. Exercise electrocardiography testing has limited sensitivity and specificity for the presence of coronary artery disease, especially in womenwhich may have contributed to misdiagnosis. Indeed, women were more likely to have downstream non-invasive stress testing cancelled, and antianginal therapies reduced following reclassification by CTCA. On the other hand, ischaemia and no obstructive coronary artery disease (INOCA) caused by small vessel disease more commonly affects women.We suggest that CTCA-guided diagnosis and management is helpful in women for the diagnosis of angina due to CHD, but less so for INOCA. These findings extend the sex subanalysis of the CRESCENT (Calcium Imaging and Selective CT Angiography in Comparison to Functional Testing for Suspected Coronary Artery Disease) trial.

Effect on radiation exposure and costs

Advances in CT scanner design and improved protocols for image acquisition and analysis have reduced radiation exposure to patients. Expectedly, the median ERD in the CCTA arm was substantially less than that with MPI. However, this difference was attenuated by the greater need for further testing in the CCTA arm by 6 months. But as only a minority of patients in such a cohort are likely to undergo further testing or revascularization by PCI, the distribution of radiation exposure is likely to be complex, and the median ERD may not be a representative measure. Nevertheless, cumulative ERD data from our study are similar to that reported in PROMISE, although the ERD was greater in the CCTA arm in that study.

There were no significant differences in costs between the two strategies. Two previous studies reporting on comparative costs found initial evaluation with CCTA to be cost saving,,but the initial functional test in these analyses was exercise ECG with its inherently high rate of inconclusive results mandating further testing for decision making.

Limitations

Our study has several limitations. First, it was prematurely stopped with only 60% of the planned sample recruited and the large effect size seen may therefore reflect a “random-high.” However, our estimates remained stable on adjustment and are likely to indicate a true effect. Second, even though we made efforts to minimize bias both at the design and analysis stage, it is impossible to rule out its effect on physician-driven outcomes in an open-label study. Third, we did not use a central core lab and relied on site-reported test results. Fourth, our study was not powered to detect differences in clinical outcomes which could potentially result from the differences in the rates of downstream testing. Finally, we did not capture information relating to changes in symptom status or medical therapy during the course of follow-up, which may have provided additional insights into the utility of either of the two strategies.

In both panels, the inset shows the same data on an enlarged y-axis. The hazard ratios were adjusted for age, sex, risk equivalent of CAD (history of diabetes, peripheral arterial disease, or cerebrovascular disease), and the prespecified intended functional test if the patient were to be randomly assigned to the usual testing (UT) group. A, The adjusted hazard ratio for the primary end point for the precision strategy (PS), as compared with UT, was 0.29 (95% CI, 0.20-0.41). B, The adjusted hazard ratio for death or nonfatal MI for the PS, as compared with UT, was 1.57 (95% CI, 0.76-3.27).

Primary results were consistent in prespecified subgroups including age, sex, race, geographic region, CAD equivalent, pretest probability, 10-year ASCVD risk, and PMRS risk strata (Figure 3). A significant interaction term by intended first test stratum suggests a greater effect in the planned invasive arm. There were 3 SARS-CoV-2–related deaths (1 PS, 2 UT); excluding these events did not change the primary end point.

New Knowledge Gained

### Comparison of an initial risk-based testing strategy vs usual testing in stable symptomatic patients with suspected coronary artery disease: the PRECISE randomized clinical trial [^2b1f3e99]. JAMA Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Trials showing equivalent or better outcomes with initial evaluation using coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA) compared with stress testing in patients with stable chest pain have informed guidelines but raise questions about overtesting and excess catheterization.

Objective

To test a modified initial cCTA strategy designed to improve clinical efficiency vs usual testing (UT).

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a pragmatic randomized clinical trial enrolling participants from December 3, 2018, to May 18, 2021, with a median of 11.8 months of follow-up. Patients from 65 North American and European sites with stable symptoms of suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) and no prior testing were randomly assigned 1:1 to precision strategy (PS) or UT.

Interventions

PS incorporated the Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for the Evaluation of Chest Pain (PROMISE) minimal risk score to quantitatively select minimal-risk participants for deferred testing, assigning all others to cCTA with selective CT-derived fractional flow reserve (FFR-CT). UT included site-selected stress testing or catheterization. Site clinicians determined subsequent care.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Outcomes were clinical efficiency (invasive catheterization without obstructive CAD) and safety (death or nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI]) combined into a composite primary end point. Secondary end points included safety components of the primary outcome and medication use.

Results

A total of 2103 participants (mean [SD] age, 58.4[11.5] years; 1056 male [50.2%]) were included in the study, and 422 [20.1%] were classified as minimal risk. The primary end point occurred in 44 of 1057 participants (4.2%) in the PS group and in 118 of 1046 participants (11.3%) in the UT group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.35; 95% CI, 0.25-0.50). Clinical efficiency was higher with PS, with lower rates of catheterization without obstructive disease (27 [2.6%]) vs UT participants (107 [10.2%]; HR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.16-0.36). The safety composite of death/MI was similar (HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 0.73-3.15). Death occurred in 5 individuals (0.5%) in the PS group vs 7 (0.7%) in the UT group (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.23-2.23), and nonfatal MI occurred in 13 individuals (1.2%) in the PS group vs 5 (0.5%) in the UT group (HR, 2.65; 95% CI, 0.96-7.36). Use of lipid-lowering (450 of 900 [50.0%] vs 365 of 873 [41.8%]) and antiplatelet (321 of 900 [35.7%] vs 237 of 873 [27.1%]) medications at 1 year was higher in the PS group compared with the UT group (both P<.001).

Conclusions and Relevance

An initial diagnostic approach to stable chest pain starting with quantitative risk stratification and deferred testing for minimal-risk patients and cCTA with selective FFR-CT in all others increased clinical efficiency relative to UT at 1 year. Additional randomized clinical trials are needed to verify these findings, including safety.

### Outcomes of non-invasive diagnostic modalities for the detection of coronary artery disease: network meta-analysis of diagnostic randomised controlled trials [^d2c46a2e]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Main findings

This study assesses the available evidence derived from diagnostic randomised controlled trials of strategies to detect coronary artery disease in a systematic and comprehensive way in two different clinical settings. Firstly, among patients with low risk acute coronary syndrome not required to undergo early invasive assessment, initial functional testing in terms of stress echocardiography or cardiovascular magnetic resonance was most strongly associated with a reduction of referrals for downstream invasive coronary angiography and revascularisation procedures, compared with anatomical testing using coronary CT angiography. No diagnostic strategy had an apparent effect on the subsequent risk of myocardial infarction, although estimates were imprecise.

Secondly, among patients with symptoms suggestive of stable coronary artery disease, no clear discrimination was seen across individual diagnostic strategies for the primary outcome of invasive coronary angiography referrals, mainly because of the limited number of trials contributing to each comparison. Stress echocardiography and single photon emission CT-myocardial perfusion imaging resulted in less overall downstream testing than coronary CT angiography, whereas exercise electrocardiograms required the most further downstream testing. After grouping of widely available functional tests, a functional testing approach yielded fewer referrals for invasive coronary angiography and subsequent revascularisations than anatomical testing. Again, estimates were imprecise for the outcome of myocardial infarction, and any differences could not be ruled out.

### Functional compared to anatomical imaging in the initial evaluation of patients with suspected coronary artery disease: an international, multi-center, randomized controlled trial (IAEA-SPECT / CTA study) [^58e8c5ef]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that, in the initial evaluation of patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD), stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) would result in less downstream testing than coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA).

Methods

In this international, randomized trial, mildly symptomatic patients with an intermediate likelihood of having CAD, and asymptomatic patients at intermediate risk of cardiac events, underwent either initial stress-rest MPI or CCTA. The primary outcome was downstream noninvasive or invasive testing at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included cumulative effective radiation dose (ERD) and costs at 12 months.

Results

We recruited 303 patients (151 MPI and 152 CTA) from 6 centers in 6 countries. The initial MPI was abnormal in 29% (41/143) and CCTA in 56% (79/141) of patients. Fewer patients undergoing initial stress-rest MPI had further downstream testing at 6 months (adjusted OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.28-0.91, P = 0.023). There was a small increase in the median cumulative ERD with MPI (9.6 vs. 8.8 mSv, P = 0.04), but no difference in costs between the two strategies at 12 months.

Conclusion

In the management of patients with suspected CAD, a strategy of initial stress MPI is substantially less likely to require further downstream testing than initial testing with CCTA.

### Impact of machine-learning CT-derived fractional flow reserve for the diagnosis and management of coronary artery disease in the randomized CRESCENT trials [^925d7279]. European Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the potential impact of on-site CT-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) on the diagnostic efficiency and effectiveness of coronary CT angiography (CCTA) in patients with obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) on CCTA.

Methods

This observational cohort study included patients with suspected CAD who had been randomized to cardiac CT in the CRESCENT I and II trials. On-site CT-FFR was blindly performed in all patients with at least one ≥50% stenosis on CCTA and no exclusion criteria for CT-FFR. We retrospectively assessed the effect of adding CT-FFR to the CT protocol in patients with a stenosis ≥50% on CCTA in terms of diagnostic effectiveness, i.e., the number of additional tests required to determine the final diagnosis, reclassification of the initial management strategy, and invasive coronary angiography (ICA) efficiency, i.e., ICA rate without ≥50% CAD.

Results

Fifty-three patients out of the 372 patients (14%) had at least one ≥50% stenosis on CCTA of whom 42/53 patients (79%) had no exclusion criteria for CT-FFR. CT-FFR showed a hemodynamically significant stenosis (≤0.80) in 27/53 patients (51%). The availability of CT-FFR would have reduced the number of patients requiring additional testing by 57%-points compared with CCTA alone (37/53 vs. 7/53, p<0.001). The initial management strategy would have changed for 30 patients (57%, p<0.001). Reserving ICA for patients with a CT-FFR ≤0.80 would have reduced the number of ICA following CCTA by 13%-points (p=0.016).

Conclusion

Implementation of on-site CT-FFR may change management and improve diagnostic efficiency and effectiveness in patients with obstructive CAD on CCTA.

Key Points

• The availability of on-site CT-FFR in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with obstructive CAD on CCTA would have significantly reduced the number of patients requiring additional testing compared with CCTA alone. • The implementation of on-site CT-FFR would have changed the initial management strategy significantly in the patients with obstructive CAD on CCTA. • Restricting ICA to patients with a positive CT-FFR would have significantly reduced the ICA rate in patients with obstructive CAD on CCTA.

### Deferred testing in stable outpatients with suspected coronary artery disease: a prespecified secondary analysis of the PRECISE randomized clinical trial [^efaef62d]. JAMA Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Guidelines recommend deferral of testing for symptomatic people with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) and low pretest probability. To our knowledge, no randomized trial has prospectively evaluated such a strategy.

Objective

To assess process of care and health outcomes in people identified as minimal risk for CAD when testing is deferred.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized, pragmatic effectiveness trial included prespecified subgroup analysis of the PRECISE trial at 65 North American and European sites. Participants identified as minimal risk by the validated PROMISE minimal risk score (PMRS) were included.

Intervention

Randomization to a precision strategy using the PMRS to assign those with minimal risk to deferred testing and others to coronary computed tomography angiography with selective computed tomography-derived fractional flow reserve, or to usual testing (stress testing or catheterization with PMRS masked). Randomization was stratified by PMRS risk.

Main Outcome

Composite of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), or catheterization without obstructive CAD through 12 months.

Results

Among 2103 participants, 422 were identified as minimal risk (20%) and randomized to deferred testing (n=214) or usual testing (n=208). Mean age (SD) was 46 (8.6) years; 304 were women (72%). During follow-up, 138 of those randomized to deferred testing never had testing (64%), whereas 76 had a downstream test (36%) (at median [IQR] 48 [15-78] days) for worsening (30%), uncontrolled (10%), or new symptoms (6%), or changing clinician preference (19%) or participant preference (10%). Results were normal for 96% of these tests. The primary end point occurred in 2 deferred testing (0.9%) and 13 usual testing participants (6.3%) (hazard ratio, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.03-0.66; P=.01). No death or MI was observed in the deferred testing participants, while 1 noncardiovascular death and 1 MI occurred in the usual testing group. Two participants (0.9%) had catheterizations without obstructive CAD in the deferred testing group and 12 (5.8%) with usual testing (P=.02). At baseline, 70% of participants had frequent angina and there was similar reduction of frequent angina to less than 20% at 12 months in both groups.

Conclusion and Relevance

In symptomatic participants with suspected CAD, identification of minimal risk by the PMRS guided a strategy of initially deferred testing. The strategy was safe with no observed adverse outcome events, fewer catheterizations without obstructive CAD, and similar symptom relief compared with usual testing.

### Randomised trial of stable chest pain investigation: 3-year clinical and quality of life results from CE-MARC 2 [^31815605]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

The near identical outcomes for CMR and SPECT patients were not expected. The similar specificities and superior sensitivities for CMR versus SPECT observed in the CE-MARC trial suggested we might see better disease detection in participants undergoing CMR, and so reduced MACE and better QoL.The numbers of patients undergoing ICA within 12 months in these two arms were similar and the numbers of patients with an ICA free from any obstructive disease were almost identical. Despite this, a greater proportion of SPECT patients had ICA due to a clinician referring for ICA despite a negative SPECT result, and a lower proportion of patients with a positive SPECT were subsequently referred for ICA, suggesting that overall clinician confidence in the SPECT result was lower than that for CMR.

Several randomised trials have evaluated non-invasive cardiac imaging for the management of patients with stable suspected cardiac chest pain, with predefined secondary endpoints of patient-reported QoL measures. These have predominantly involved CTCA versus standard care or versus functional testing (comprising a mixture of exercise ECG and functional imaging). The conclusions from the CE-MARC 2 QoL analysis are in line with other trials. The PROMISE trial randomised 10 003 patients to either functional testing or CTCA and found no difference in the composite outcome measure, EQ-5D-3L and SAQ after median 2.5 years’ follow-up.CRESCENT randomised 350 patients to CTCA or functional testing and found significant improvements in the SAQ Angina Frequency domain for CTCA versus functional testing at 12 months, but not in any other domain, or in EQ-5D or SF36.The follow-up CRESCENT-II trial of 268 patients found no differences in SAQ domain, EQ-5D or SF36 at 12 months.The SCOT-HEART trial of standard care (exercise stress ECG only and no additional testing) versus standard care+CTCA in 4146 patients reported, after median clinical follow-up of 4.8 years, an HR of 0.59 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.84) for the primary composite endpoint of CAD death or non-fatal MI in favour of standard care+CTCA.Despite a clinical strategy of coronary artery imaging for all patients, surprisingly, the CTCA strategy did not reduce the likelihood of undergoing ICA. Since CTCA involves ionising radiation, the strategy effectively doubles the number of tests involving ionising radiation in the referral population (most relevant in younger patients, especially females). The patient population for SCOT-HEART appears to have similar baseline SAQ scores and clinical characteristics to CE-MARC 2. However, in SCOT-HEART, CTCA was associated with less improvements in physical limitation, angina frequency and QoL at 6 months compared with standard care alone,though these absolute differences were small (<5-point difference) and no adjustment for multiple comparisons was performed. The reasons for this finding are complex, but likely include the possibility that an increase in the diagnosis of mild and moderate non-obstructive CAD detected by CTCA labels the patient with a life-long medical condition, creating anxiety and stress. Furthermore, in SCOT-HEART, medication for symptoms was discontinued in patients with no obstructive CAD, and this may have led to a deterioration in symptoms and QoL in patients with microvascular angina and/or vasospastic angina. This is one reason that the term ‘unnecessary angiography’ is no longer favoured, as the cardiology community embrace the more inclusive description of ischaemia with non-obstructive coronary arteries.

### Outcomes of anatomical versus functional testing for coronary artery disease [^f034b847]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Many patients have symptoms suggestive of coronary artery disease (CAD) and are often evaluated with the use of diagnostic testing, although there are limited data from randomized trials to guide care.

Methods

We randomly assigned 10,003 symptomatic patients to a strategy of initial anatomical testing with the use of coronary computed tomographic angiography (CTA) or to functional testing (exercise electrocardiography, nuclear stress testing, or stress echocardiography). The composite primary end point was death, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, or major procedural complication. Secondary end points included invasive cardiac catheterization that did not show obstructive CAD and radiation exposure.

Results

The mean age of the patients was 60.8±8.3 years, 52.7% were women, and 87.7% had chest pain or dyspnea on exertion. The mean pretest likelihood of obstructive CAD was 53.3±21.4%. Over a median follow-up period of 25 months, a primary end-point event occurred in 164 of 4996 patients in the CTA group (3.3%) and in 151 of 5007 (3.0%) in the functional-testing group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.83 to 1.29; P=0.75). CTA was associated with fewer catheterizations showing no obstructive CAD than was functional testing (3.4% vs. 4.3%, P=0.02), although more patients in the CTA group underwent catheterization within 90 days after randomization (12.2% vs. 8.1%). The median cumulative radiation exposure per patient was lower in the CTA group than in the functional-testing group (10.0 mSv vs. 11.3 mSv), but 32.6% of the patients in the functional-testing group had no exposure, so the overall exposure was higher in the CTA group (mean, 12.0 mSv vs. 10.1 mSv; P<0.001).

Conclusions

In symptomatic patients with suspected CAD who required noninvasive testing, a strategy of initial CTA, as compared with functional testing, did not improve clinical outcomes over a median follow-up of 2 years.

Methods

There are no plans to make a deidentified data set publicly available at present.

Overview of PRECISE Design and Primary Clinical Results

Details of the PRECISE trial rationale and design have been published.Between December 3, 2018, and May 18, 2021, the trial randomized 2103 patients (53.5% United States) with stable chest pain and a clinical recommendation to test for suspected CAD to either an investigational precision diagnostic testing strategy or a usual diagnostic testing strategy. Patients randomized to the precision strategy underwent a risk assessment using the PROMISE Minimal Risk Tool,and the 20% at lowest risk were assigned to an initial strategy of guideline-recommended care with deferred testing. Patients randomized to the precision strategy who had elevated risk or known nonobstructive plaque were assigned to undergo diagnostic testing using cCTA with selective use of computed tomography–derived fractional flow reserve (FFR CT). Patients randomized to the usual testing arm underwent functional testing or went directly to catheterization. The trial's primary end point was a composite of major adverse cardiovascular events (all-cause death and nonfatal myocardial infarction) or invasive cardiac catheterization free of evidence of significant CAD (coronary stenosis ≥50%, FFR ≤0.80, or other actionable cardiac pathology).

We advocate an evidence-based discussion for a patient first philosophy when considering "the right test for the right patient." Numerous test options exist for the evaluation of symptoms of possible stable ischemic heart disease. Major guidelines have traditionally focused on functional testing with or without imaging to clarify symptoms, diagnose ischemia, stratify prognosis, and guide management. Recently, industry advocates have emphasized modality-specific approaches such as computed tomography (CT First) as an initial test strategy for possible stable CAD. We review the key evidence to demonstrate that current best practice would focus on a patient first approach rather than a modality-specific approach.

### Comparison of an initial risk-based testing strategy vs usual testing in stable symptomatic patients with suspected coronary artery disease: the PRECISE randomized clinical trial [^781c33ca]. JAMA Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Coronary artery disease (CAD) commonly presents with stable symptoms, often requiring multiple diagnostic tests.Previous randomized clinical trials including the Scottish Computed Tomography of the Heart (SCOT-HEART) and Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for the Evaluation of Chest Pain (PROMISE) have shown similar or better clinical outcomes using coronary computed tomographic angiography (cCTA) as the initial or subsequent evaluation. Significant questions remain regarding unneeded testing in low-risk patients and excess referral to invasive catheterization using cCTA.

The American Heart Association(AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines are agnostic regarding testing modalities, rating both cCTA and stress imaging as class 1 based on randomized clinical trials showing an excellent prognosis with both. Further, the evaluation of lesion-specific ischemia in intermediate (40%-90%) stenoses using noninvasive cCTA-derived fractional flow reserve (FFR-CT) is recommended as class 2a and may simplify the clinical care pathway. Current data suggest that the use of FFR-CT may improve catheterization yield in initial testing,, and compared with use of functional stress testing (predominantly stress electrocardiogram) as a second test in patients with intermediate lesions on cCTA.

Risk-based determination of the need for testing in low-risk patients is accepted in the AHA/ACC,European Society of Cardiology,and National Institute for Health and Care Excellenceguidelines, but implementation into routine practice remains limited.,,, Risk algorithms to assess pretest likelihood of disease have been derived from multiple cohorts,,, but none have been prospectively validated for the purpose of selecting patients for deferred testing in a randomized clinical trial.

The Prospective Randomized Trial of the Optimal Evaluation of Cardiac Symptoms and Revascularization (PRECISE) study was designed to address unresolved concerns raised by the SCOT-HEART and PROMISE trials regarding the effects of a cCTA-based initial strategy on low-benefit referrals to invasive catheterization and to assess the opportunity to avoid all testing in select low-risk patients.

PROMISE trial—among 10,003 symptomatic outpatients randomized to anatomical testing with CTA or functional testing, after 25 months of follow-up there was no difference between groups in the primary outcome; however, subset analysis showed higher discriminatory ability for CTA than functional testing to predict subsequent events (c-index 0.72; 95% CI 0.68 to 0.76 versus 0.64; 0.59 to 0.69; p = 0.04), mostly due to detection of prognostically important non-obstructive disease.

### Design and rationale of "a pragmatic approach to the investigation of stable chest pain: a UK, multicenter, randomized trial to assess patient outcomes, quality of life and cost effectiveness (CE-MARC 3) " [^1b99aae1]. American Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

The optimal noninvasive diagnostic imaging strategy for patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) is widely debated. Computed Tomography Coronary Angiography (CTCA) and functional imaging are both guideline-recommended, although comparative effectiveness in patients with intermediate-high pretest likelihood (PTL) is limited. Primary Hypothesis: We aim to establish if a personalized investigation strategy compared to CTCA first-line for allcomers, leads to improved patient outcomes.

Design

In a multi-center, randomized trial, 4,000 patients newly referred for the investigation of suspected cardiac chest pain will be recruited and randomized (1:1) to either personalized care (first-line CTCA or functional imaging based on PTL) or CTCA first-line for allcomers. The primary endpoint is time to a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or unobstructed coronary arteries on invasive angiography. Follow up will occur at 6 and 12 months and then annually for up to 4 years for symptoms, quality of life, and guideline directed medical therapy usage. A cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed capturing impacts on health, measured in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) using the EQ-5D-5L, and costs (including investigations, procedures, procedural complications, medical treatment costs and any future hospital admissions) calculated. It will be possible for the whole trial pathway to be conducted remotely with the option to perform non-face-to-face consent, randomization, and follow-up data collection including health-related quality of life.

Sites

About 20 UK sites.

Enrolment

First site opened April 2022 and recruitment is due to complete by July 2025, with an average recruitment of 135 patients a month to date.

Current Status

About 3,407 patients recruited and randomized by the end of February 2025 CONCLUSION: This trial will address whether, in patients with suspected cardiac chest pain, a strategy of personalized investigation according to pretest likelihood (PTL), compared to CTCA for allcomers, leads to improved patient outcomes, quality of life and cost-effectiveness.

### Functional compared to anatomical imaging in the initial evaluation of patients with suspected coronary artery disease: an international, multi-center, randomized controlled trial (IAEA-SPECT / CTA study) [^1b299d5e]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The results of this diagnostic randomized trial suggest that in patients with an intermediate likelihood of having CAD, and in those at intermediate or high risk of coronary events, initial evaluation with stress MPI results in substantially less downstream non-invasive and invasive testing before decisions regarding management can be made. There was no difference in costs between the two approaches, but patients evaluated with initial stress-rest MPI received a small but significantly greater cumulative exposure to radiation at 1-year. These results are based on a multi-ethnic population of patients, with a large proportion drawn from emerging economies.

We believe that the validity of these results is enhanced by two important considerations. First, decision-making regarding downstream test use was standardized and pre-specified, and effect-estimates were adjusted for physician preference (for either of the diagnostic modalities), thereby minimizing bias in this diagnostic randomized trial. Second, investigators used contemporary diagnostic equipment and adhered to currently recommended guidelines while performing and reporting test results, thereby reflecting current best practice.

Increased downstream testing with CCTA

The results of our study are consistent with those from the previous observational and randomized studies. In a systematic review, Nielsen et alidentified 6 observational studies and one small randomized trialwhich compared initial functional and anatomical evaluation and reported on downstream test utilization. Combining these results in a meta-analysis, these authors showed that a strategy of initial coronary CTA resulted in greater use of further downstream testing and coronary angiography compared to initial testing with either MPI or exercise ECG (24.4% vs. 18.5%; OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.33-1.43; P = 0.0001). The tendency for patients evaluated initially by CCTA to increase the likelihood of downstream coronary angiography (and revascularization) has also been observed in the context of low-risk patients with acute chest pain.However, a more recent randomized trial comparing exercise ECG with CCTA in patients with stable chest pain showed a greater use of downstream non-invasive testing in the exercise ECG arm.This was attributable to the large number of inconclusive exercise ECG results (66/245, 27%). The diagnostic performance of exercise ECG is inferior to stress MPIand is perhaps not the modality of choice in a comparative evaluation between anatomical and functional testing.

### Quality of life outcomes with a risk-based precision testing strategy versus usual testing in stable patients with suspected coronary disease: results from the PRECISE randomized trial [^eb20444a]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2025). Medium credibility.

See Editorial by

Chest pain remains one of the most common reasons for patients to seek medical care and one of the most challenging for clinicians to manage.Because the clinical history details often do not provide a reliable guide to the underlying cause of those symptoms, clinicians typically rely on a variety of diagnostic tests to help assess possible etiologies and guide initial therapy. In recent years, 2 main noninvasive testing strategies have evolved, 1 based on direct assessment of the coronary arteries using coronary computed tomographic angiography (cCTA; anatomic) and the other based on indirect assessment of the adequacy of coronary artery blood flow using one of several forms of stress testing (functional).Several large clinical trials have compared initial anatomic strategies with initial functional testing strategies to determine whether either approach provides clinical outcome advantages in patients presenting with nonacute chest discomfort and not known to have coronary artery disease (CAD). In theory, direct visualization of the coronary arteries as the initial test might be expected to lead to more confident reassurance and efficient triage of the patients without significant CAD and more effectively targeted therapy for those with significant CAD, with associated benefits in symptom relief, quality of life (QOL), and patient satisfaction. Both the PROMISE (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain) trial and the SCOT-HEART (Scottish Computed Tomography of the Heart) trial found that an initial anatomic cCTA-based strategy was associated with a small absolute increase in the early use of invasive coronary angiography and coronary revascularization. – However, neither of these 2 well-powered trials detected clinically meaningful differences in either short- or long-term symptom and QOL outcomes according to the initial testing strategy used.

The PRECISE (Prospective Randomized Trial of the Optimal Evaluation of Cardiac Symptoms and Revascularization) trial was designed to test an investigational risk-based testing strategy (Precision Strategy) using deferred testing for the lowest-risk patients and cCTA for the remainder, augmented with selective use of functional assessment in the form of computed tomography fractional flow reserve (FFR CT) calculation for intermediate stenoses. The comparison arm (Usual Testing) involved the use of noninvasive stress testing or catheterization with the choice of testing modality made by the patient’s clinician. Comparison of QOL outcomes was a major secondary objective of the PRECISE research program.

### Quality-of-life outcomes with anatomic versus functional diagnostic testing strategies in symptomatic patients with suspected coronary artery disease: results from the PROMISE randomized trial [^8b9ae6e4]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain (PROMISE) trial found that initial use of ≥64 detector-row computed tomography angiography versus standard functional testing strategies (exercise ECG, stress nuclear methods, or stress echocardiography) did not improve clinical outcomes in 10003 stable symptomatic patients with suspected coronary artery disease requiring noninvasive testing. Symptom burden and quality of life (QOL) were major secondary outcomes.

Methods and Results

We prospectively collected a battery of QOL instruments in 5985 patients at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months postrandomization. The prespecified primary QOL measures were the Duke Activity Status Index and the Seattle Angina Questionnaire frequency and QOL scales. All comparisons were made as randomized. Baseline variables were well balanced in the 2982 patients randomly assigned to computed tomography angiography testing and the 3003 patients randomly assigned to functional testing. The Duke Activity Status Index improved substantially in both groups over the first 6 months following testing, but we found no evidence for a strategy-related difference (mean difference [anatomic - functional] at 24 months of follow-up, 0.1 [95% confidence interval, -0.9 to 1.1]). Similar results were seen for the Seattle Angina Questionnaire frequency scale (mean difference at 24 months, -0.2; 95% confidence interval, -0.8 to 0.4) and QOL scale (mean difference at 24 months, -0.2; 95% confidence interval, -1.3 to 0.9). None of the secondary QOL measures showed a consistent strategy-related difference.

Conclusions

In symptomatic patients with suspected coronary artery disease who required noninvasive testing, symptoms and QOL improved significantly. However, a strategy of initial anatomic testing, in comparison with functional testing, did not provide an incremental benefit for QOL over 2 years of follow-up.

Conclusions

Coronary CTA improves the diagnostic assessment of patients with suspected obstructive CAD based on stable chest pain when compared with functional stress testing. Diagnostic benefits of CTA over cardiac stress testing are seen across a wide range of clinical pretest probabilities and CTA should become widely adopted in patients with intermediate pretest probability.

### The prospective randomized trial of the optimal evaluation of cardiac symptoms and revascularization: rationale and design of the PRECISE trial [^3a253d60]. American Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinicians vary widely in their preferred diagnostic approach to patients with non-acute chest pain. Such variation exposes patients to potentially avoidable risks, as well as inefficient care with increased costs and unresolved patient concerns.

Methods

The Prospective Randomized Trial of the Optimal Evaluation of Cardiac Symptoms and Revascularization (PRECISE) trial (NCT03702244) compares an investigational "precision" diagnostic strategy to a usual care diagnostic strategy in participants with stable chest pain and suspected coronary artery disease (CAD).

Results

PRECISE randomized 2103 participants with stable chest pain and a clinical recommendation for testing for suspected CAD at 68 outpatient international sites. The investigational precision evaluation strategy started with a pre-test risk assessment using the PROMISE Minimal Risk Tool. Those at lowest risk were assigned to deferred testing (no immediate testing), and the remainder received coronary computed tomographic angiography (cCTA) with selective fractional flow reserve (FFR CT ) for any stenosis meeting a threshold of ≥30% and <90%. For participants randomized to usual care, the clinical care team selected the initial noninvasive or invasive test (diagnostic angiography) according to customary practice. The use of cCTA as the initial diagnostic strategy was proscribed by protocol for the usual care strategy. The primary endpoint is time to a composite of major adverse cardiac events (MACE: all-cause death or non-fatal myocardial infarction) or invasive cardiac catheterization without obstructive CAD at 1 year. Secondary endpoints include health care costs and quality of life.

Conclusions

PRECISE will determine whether a precision approach comprising a strategically deployed combination of risk-based deferred testing and cCTA with selective FFR CT improves the clinical outcomes and efficiency of the diagnostic evaluation of stable chest pain over usual care.

### Comparison of an initial risk-based testing strategy vs usual testing in stable symptomatic patients with suspected coronary artery disease: the PRECISE randomized clinical trial [^3ef1962c]. JAMA Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

For the first time, to our knowledge, the PRECISE study demonstrates in a large randomized clinical trial that a novel initial care pathway of risk-guided patient-specific testing deferral for minimal-risk patients combined with cCTA with selective FFR-CT for the remaining patients improves clinical efficiency (catheterization without obstructive CAD) with no statistically significant adverse effect on safety (death or MI) at 1 year.

The PRECISE trial was designed to test patient selection and refinements of cCTA-based evaluation strategies in patients with stable chest pain who were previously tested in 2 large randomized clinical trials. Those trials clearly demonstrated equivalent or better outcomes for cCTA compared with usual stress testing but a propensity for initial cCTA testing to lead to over testing and unnecessary catheterization referral. The PRECISE PS was designed to improve these 2 weak points: (1) to reduce excess testing in the lowest-risk patients where diagnostic yield is extremely low and (2) to reduce excess referral to catheterization. The use of a validated risk score in the PS addressed the former problem, whereas the selective use of FFR-CT addressed the latter. Of note, the PRECISE trial cannot address alternative approaches not tested in the trial. The PS tested in this trial is concordant with current AHA/ACC Chest Pain guideline recommendationsand extends the evidence base supporting them for management of stable chest pain.

Both the PROMISE and SCOT-HEART trials confirmed excellent prognosis in the population of patients with stable chest pain while also highlighting unresolved inefficiencies in noninvasive and invasive testing. The PROMISE trial showed a low rate of the composite end point of death, nonfatal MI, unstable angina hospitalization, and major procedural complications of 1.5% per year, with no difference between arms.However, the trial has been criticized for testing very low-risk patients and a 50% higher rate of catheterization in the cCTA arm.The initial report of the SCOT-HEART trial also showed a low rate of cardiovascular death or MI (2% per year) and a borderline difference which became significant by 5 years.The SCOT-HEART trial also noted higher initial new referrals to catheterization in the cCTA arm (94 vs 8) with higher late referrals with standard care.The PRECISE trial provides a pragmatic pathway addressing both concerns, providing randomized evidence in support of a quantitative algorithm for deferred testing and for the use of cCTA with selective FFR-CT as the initial test. Our findings provide practical data addressing the recognized need to improve the evaluation of patients with chest pain.

### Comparative effectiveness of initial computed tomography and invasive coronary angiography in women and men with stable chest pain and suspected coronary artery disease: multicentre randomised trial [^fb84272e]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

What this study adds

The proportion of patients in whom obstructive CAD was found was similar with either a CT or ICA strategy, both in women (19.7% and 18.2%) and in men (33.5% and 35.3%)
In men, CT as the initial diagnostic test instead of initial ICA was associated with a lower risk of the expanded MACE composite (2.8% v 5.3%)
In women, initial CT was associated with a lower frequency of major procedure-related complications compared with initial ICA (0.3% v 2.1%)

### Functional compared to anatomical imaging in the initial evaluation of patients with suspected coronary artery disease: an international, multi-center, randomized controlled trial (IAEA-SPECT / CTA study) [^aafcdcf2]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Functional testing by stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) and anatomical imaging by coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) are often used interchangeably in the initial evaluation of patients suspected to have coronary artery disease (CAD). In patients with an intermediate likelihood of having CAD, the results of functional testing provide important diagnostic and prognostic information. This information is usually sufficient to determine the need for further invasive testing and revascularization.Coronary CTA provides accurate anatomical information regarding the extent and severity of CAD.But this often needs to be supplemented by the documentation of typical symptoms, or the objective demonstration of ischemia by further testing, before management decisions can be made. Moreover, the mere identification of anatomical stenosis may often lead to revascularization without the assessment of its functional significance.Therefore, a strategy of initial evaluation by CCTA may result in greater downstream testing and revascularization, resulting in increased healthcare costs.On the other hand, CCTA may also detect the presence of hemodynamically insignificant coronary lesions which may be prognostically important,and although unproven, may potentially benefit from intensive medical treatment. Data from randomized controlled trials comparing stress MPI and CCTA as initial tests in this patient population are only recently becoming available,,and current practice guidelines do not strongly prefer one modality of testing over the other.

We performed an international, multi-centric, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of initial testing with stress MPI or CCTA on the use of further downstream testing in patients with suspected CAD. We also compared the costs of the two strategies and the effective radiation dose to patients. Our primary hypothesis was that the initial use of stress-rest MPI would result in less additional noninvasive and invasive testing in the short term.

### Comparative effectiveness trials of imaging-guided strategies in stable Ischemic heart disease [^c1a1afc1]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

The evaluation of patients with suspected stable ischemic heart disease is among the most common diagnostic evaluations with nearly 20 million imaging and exercise stress tests performed annually in the United States. Over the past decade, there has been an evolution in imaging research with an ever-increasing focus on larger registries and randomized trials comparing the effectiveness of varying diagnostic algorithms. The current review highlights recent randomized trial evidence with a particular focus comparing the effectiveness of cardiac imaging procedures within the stable ischemic heart disease evaluation for coronary artery disease detection, angina, and other quality of life measures, and major clinical outcomes. Also highlighted are secondary analyses from these trials on the economic findings related to comparative cost differences across diagnostic testing strategies.

What is already known on this topic

Compared with men, women presenting with chest pain have more symptoms but less severe myocardial ischaemia and less extensive epicardial coronary artery disease
Computed tomography (CT) can rule out obstructive coronary artery disease in patients with low to intermediate pre-test probability of CAD, but possibly less accurately in women than men
The comparative effectiveness of CT and invasive coronary angiography in the diagnosis and clinical management of CAD in women versus men in terms of clinical outcome is uncertain

### The effectiveness of coronary computed tomography angiography and functional testing for the diagnosis of obstructive coronary artery disease: results from the individual patient data collaborative meta-analysis of cardiac CT (COME-CCT) [^9785e7bc]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patients

Seven-thousand eight-hundred thirteen patients with stable chest pain and suspected CAD were included in the COME-CCT Consortium with a clinical indication for ICA, who were also prospectively enrolled to undergo cardiac CT. The study protocol of the COME-CCT collaborators was previously published including detailed information on search strategy, inclusion, and exclusion criteria for this individual patient data (IPD) data meta-analysis. Patients with stents or bypasses, unstable angina, and non-diagnostic were excluded as well as patients with incomplete information for pretest probability calculation. Data was available on the per-patient level. The study was prospectively registered in the PROSPERO Database for Systematic Reviews (CRD42012002780). Obstructive CAD was defined as at least diameter stenosis of ≥ 50% by ICA with 81% of patients receiving quantitative coronary analysis (QCA). Specifically important for the present subgroup analysis, studies were excluded if datasets did not include results on either exercise-ECG or SPECT for at least 5% of the patients. All participants gave written informed consent to participate in the local studies, which were approved by the local ethics committees of the participating centres. For quality assessment and comparability, an additional questionnaire regarding exercise-ECG and SPECT was sent to all participating sites. For this subanalysis, for those studies eligible for inclusion, patients with data on functional testing were included, but studies with < 5% of patients receiving functional testing with regard to the site cohort were excluded from further analysis to avoid inclusion bias.

### Primacy of coronary CT angiography as the gatekeeper for the cardiac catheterization laboratory [^afeeead7]. American Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Determining the underlying etiology of chest pain remains a mainstay of modern cardiological practice and is focused on identifying coronary artery disease to improve both symptoms and prognosis. In the current age of multi-modality imaging, the expanding repertoire of tests has subjected clinicians to a tyranny of choices. In whom should we perform further investigations? What non-invasive modality should be used? Which test is the best gatekeeper for invasive coronary angiography? In this week's American Heart Journal, Houssany-Pissot and colleagues present real-world data from a large French cohort of patients who present with suspected stable coronary artery disease undergoing invasive coronary angiography. Their findings demonstrate that compared to functional testing, coronary computed tomography angiography is associated with fewer normal invasive coronary angiograms and more patients with actionable disease. Moreover, this was apparent irrespective of the pre-test probability of obstructive coronary artery disease. The consistency of this study with data from randomised trials and observational registries leads us to agree that computed tomography has primacy as gatekeeper for the cardiac catheter laboratory irrespective of the level of pre-test probability. This latest addition to the growing and large body of evidence does beg the question of why guidelines do not now recommend CCTA as the first line test of choice for the non-invasive investigation of all patients with stable coronary artery disease?

### Clinical effectiveness of cardiac noninvasive diagnostic testing in outpatients evaluated for stable coronary artery disease [^1b4e7e7d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In a large, population‐based study of outpatients with chest pain in Ontario, Canada, we observed a ≈25% reduction in the hazard of the composite outcome of unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular mortality associated with NIT. Our findings were consistent among all 3 constituents of the composite outcome and were robust across different physician diagnostic codes and in those patients aged 65 years and older.

Despite recent advances in care, CAD remains a major public health problem. The 2010 American Heart Association Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics Update reported that there are ≈18 million people in the United States who have been diagnosed with CAD. 29 CAD is the second leading cause of death in Canada and is responsible for ≈30% of all deaths worldwide in people aged 35 and above and ≈17% of total deaths. 30, 31, 32 A common presentation for CAD is stable angina, also known as stable CAD, which affects more than 8 million people in the United States each year. 33, 34 Two large randomized controlled trials evaluated the efficacy of different NIT options among patients being assessed for stable CAD. The PROMISE trial randomly assigned 10 003 outpatients being evaluated for suspected stable CAD to either CCTA or functional stress testing. The primary end point of MACE (all‐cause mortality, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, or major cardiovascular procedural complication) did not significantly differ between the 2 groups. 9 The SCOT‐HEART trial enrolled 4146 patients with stable chest pain to “usual care” (including a GXT) or “usual care” plus CCTA. While the initial results, based on median follow‐up of 1.7 years, reported that there was no significant difference between the 2 arms in terms of the clinical composite outcome of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction, the subsequently published 5‐year results reported a reduction in the composite outcome associated with usual care plus CCTA. 2, 10, 35 Interestingly, the event rates were lower than originally expected in both the anatomical and functional arms of the PROMISE and SCOT‐HEART trials. For example, the annual rate of all‐cause mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction averaged between both studies was ≈1.4%. 2, 9, 10 Given the low event rate, experts in the field have raised a further question of whether any testing leads to improved clinical outcomes when compared with no testing in real‐world populations. 2 As far as we are aware, there are currently no data comparing outcomes with and without testing among outpatients being evaluated for stable CAD. The utility of cardiac NIT for chest pain is also questioned in other, related patient populations. For example, Natsui et al recently conducted a retrospective study of 24 459 patients who presented with chest pain to the emergency department of 13 sites across southern California and were subsequently discharged. They reported that there were very low rates of MACE, and there was no significant difference in MACE between those undergoing testing and those who did not. Specifically, there were no deaths and only ≈1.3% of all patients in their cohort developed either unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction within their follow‐up period. 36

### Coronary computed tomography angiography vs functional stress testing for patients with suspected coronary artery disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^6dd1a220]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is a new approach for the diagnosis of anatomical coronary artery disease (CAD), but it is unclear how CCTA performs compared with the standard approach of functional stress testing.

Objective

To compare the clinical effectiveness of CCTA with that of functional stress testing for patients with suspected CAD.

Data Sources

A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed and MEDLINE for English-language randomized clinical trials of CCTA published from January 1, 2000, to July 10, 2016.

Study Selection

Researchers selected randomized clinical trials that compared a primary strategy of CCTA with that of functional stress testing for patients with suspected CAD and reported data on patient clinical events and changes in therapy.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two reviewers independently extracted data from and assessed the quality of the trials. This analysis followed the PRISMA statement for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses and used the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias in randomized trials. The Mantel-Haenszel method was used to conduct the primary analysis. Summary relative risks were calculated with a random-effects model.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality, cardiac hospitalization, myocardial infarction, invasive coronary angiography, coronary revascularization, new CAD diagnoses, and change in prescription for aspirin and statins.

Results

Thirteen trials were included, with 10 315 patients in the CCTA arm and 9777 patients in the functional stress testing arm who were followed up for a mean duration of 18 months. There were no statistically significant differences between CCTA and functional stress testing in death (1.0% vs 1.1%; risk ratio [RR], 0.93; 95% CI, 0.71-1.21) or cardiac hospitalization (2.7% vs 2.7%; RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.79-1.21), but CCTA was associated with a reduction in the incidence of myocardial infarction (0.7% vs 1.1%; RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.53-0.96). Patients undergoing CCTA were significantly more likely to undergo invasive coronary angiography (11.7% vs 9.1%; RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.12-1.59) and revascularization (7.2% vs 4.5%; RR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.43-2.43). They were also more likely to receive a diagnosis of new CAD and to have initiated aspirin or statin therapy.

Conclusions and Relevance

Compared with functional stress testing, CCTA is associated with a reduced incidence of myocardial infarction but an increased incidence of invasive coronary angiography, revascularization, CAD diagnoses, and new prescriptions for aspirin and statins. Despite these differences, CCTA is not associated with a reduction in mortality or cardiac hospitalizations.

### Outcomes in patients with a first episode of chest pain undergoing early coronary CT imaging [^0145dfa3]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Longitudinal studies of employing cardiac CT imaging including both coronary calcium scoring (CACS) and cardiac CT angiography (CCTA) in patients presenting with chest pain have demonstrated incremental prognostic value compared with traditional risk profiling algorithms.Higher CACS is associated with mortalityand has added value to the Framingham Risk Score for predicting cardiovascular events.The introduction of CCTA showed even greater promise as a tool to define risk of myocardial infarctionand coronary revascularisationcompared with CACS. Prospectively randomised trials showed that CCTA was superior to functional cardiac testing for cardiovascular endpoints.

Until the results of the SCOT-HEART (Scottish COmputed Tomography of the HEART Trial) study were published,CCTA was only adopted by the guidelines of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK.The SCOT-HEART study randomised patients presenting with chest pain in the cardiology outpatient clinic to either CCTA initiated, the so-called CT-first strategy, or routine clinical care. Patients randomised to the CCTA arm showed only about half of the fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarctions after a 5-year follow-up,although these results were not in line with the previously published PROMISE-trialand multiple registry studies.Nevertheless, these results prompted the European Society of Cardiology to accord CCTA a class I recommendation for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) in symptomatic patients in the renewed European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines of 2019.

### Diagnosis of obstructive coronary artery disease using computed tomography angiography in patients with stable chest pain depending on clinical probability and in clinically important subgroups: meta-analysis of individual patient data [^fdc93d2b]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

The main clinical strength of coronary CTA is its high NPV, and this is supported by our findings, which show that CTA can also detect both obstructive and non-obstructive CAD and therefore is a suitable imaging modality to guide subsequent management.This may make patient management more efficient and can also lower costs, not least by reducing the high rate of negative coronary angiographies performed annually. Recently published randomised clinical trials support these assumptions. Although the PROMISE trial—which compared CTA with an initial functional testing strategy in the evaluation of chest pain—did not show a reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (defined as death, myocardial infarction, and unstable angina needing hospital admissions, or a major procedural complication), subsequent invasive coronary angiography was more effective in the CTA group.

The SCOT-HEART trial prospectively compared standard care with standard care plus CTA for the diagnosis of CAD in patients with recent onset chest pain.In the trial, CTA was found to increase diagnostic certainty, increase the identification of obstructive and non-obstructive CAD, and eliminate the need for further downstream stress imaging tests.Furthermore, the five year clinical outcome analysis of SCOT-HEART showed that standard care plus CTA resulted in a halving of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction without increasing the five year rate of coronary revascularisations but initiating more targeted preventive and anti-anginal treatments.However, some controversy remains about the use of coronary CTA as the first line diagnostic test in patients with stable chest pain and suspected CAD,and our IPD meta-analysis provides insights about in which patients CTA has highest predictive values.

Our IPD meta-analysis data can thus help physicians in better identifying the patients for whom coronary CTA is the most appropriate diagnostic test. Whether CTA can further improve clinical effectiveness in patients with a clinical indication for coronary angiography is an important question. The CAD-Man study showed that coronary CTA can reduce the need for invasive coronary angiography by up to 80% and can reduce procedural complications.A similar safety profile with non-inferiority of CTA versus invasive coronary angiography in terms of major cardiovascular events at one year was found in the CONSERVE trial.However, coronary CTA still has to be analysed in a multicentre study of patients with a clinical indication for invasive coronary angiography, and the randomised DISCHARGE trial will provide more data in this regard.

### Comparison of an initial risk-based testing strategy vs usual testing in stable symptomatic patients with suspected coronary artery disease: the PRECISE randomized clinical trial [^4442e841]. JAMA Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Outcomes and Follow-Up

The centrally adjudicated primary end point was a composite of clinical efficiency as a gatekeeper to invasive testing (catheterization without obstructive CAD) and safety (death, nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI]) at 1 year. Catheterization without obstructive disease has been used as a primary,, secondary, or component end pointin other studies. Obstructive CAD was defined as any angiographic stenosis with invasive FFR of 0.80 or less or instantaneous wave-free ratio of 0.89 or less, or, if not performed, any stenosis of 50% or greater on quantitative coronary angiography, in a vessel 2 mm or larger in diameter (eMethods in Supplement 4). Prespecified secondary safety end points included a win-ratio analysis of the primary end point (hierarchy: 1 = death, 2 = MI, and 3 = catheterization without obstructive CAD),individual safety components of the primary end point (death, MI), unplanned cardiovascular hospitalizations, and unstable angina. Prespecified secondary efficiency end points were catheterization without obstructive disease and revascularization after catheterization. Other end points included anginal symptoms using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire,medication use, and radiation exposure obtained at 45 days, 6 months, and 12 months. One nonfatal MI was determined by the Clinical Events Committee to have preceded randomization and was excluded. One fatal MI was included as a death, as per the protocol (eMethods in Supplement 4) and the statistical analysis plan (Supplement 2 and Supplement 3). Testing was confirmed by medical records; events, unplanned cardiovascular hospitalizations, and ischemia-driven revascularizations were independently adjudicated.

### PROspective multicenter imaging study for evaluation of chest pain: rationale and design of the PROMISE trial [^a15a921b]. American Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the most common, potentially life-threatening diagnostic problems clinicians encounter. However, no large outcome-based randomized trials have been performed to guide the selection of diagnostic strategies for these patients.

Methods

The PROMISE study is a prospective, randomized trial comparing the effectiveness of 2 initial diagnostic strategies in patients with symptoms suspicious for CAD. Patients are randomized to either (1) functional testing (exercise electrocardiogram, stress nuclear imaging, or stress echocardiogram) or (2) anatomical testing with ≥64-slice multidetector coronary computed tomographic angiography. Tests are interpreted locally in real time by subspecialty certified physicians, and all subsequent care decisions are made by the clinical care team. Sites are provided results of central core laboratory quality and completeness assessment. All subjects are followed up for ≥1 year. The primary end point is the time to occurrence of the composite of death, myocardial infarction, major procedural complications (stroke, major bleeding, anaphylaxis, and renal failure), or hospitalization for unstable angina.

Results

More than 10,000 symptomatic subjects were randomized in 3.2 years at 193 US and Canadian cardiology, radiology, primary care, urgent care, and anesthesiology sites.

Conclusion

Multispecialty community practice enrollment into a large pragmatic trial of diagnostic testing strategies is both feasible and efficient. The PROMISE trial will compare the clinical effectiveness of an initial strategy of functional testing against an initial strategy of anatomical testing in symptomatic patients with suspected CAD. Quality of life, resource use, cost-effectiveness, and radiation exposure will be assessed.

### The effectiveness of coronary computed tomography angiography and functional testing for the diagnosis of obstructive coronary artery disease: results from the individual patient data collaborative meta-analysis of cardiac CT (COME-CCT) [^e7716e92]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) is increasingly used to diagnose coronary artery disease (CAD). Indeed, clinical guideline 95 of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence with chest pain of recent onset recommends CTA as the first diagnostic test in all patients with possible angina. Functional stress testing, including exercise electrocardiography (exercise-ECG) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), is recommended in uncertainty about whether chest pain is caused by myocardial ischaemia in patients with known CAD. In contrast, the recent ESC guideline on chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) recommends coronary CTA as the first-line diagnostic imaging test with a low pretest probability for CCS, whereas functional cardiac imaging is recommended in patients having a high pretest probability for CCS. The ISCHEMIA trial showed that an invasive interventional strategy was not superior to a conservative strategy in patients with stable chest pain and test-based ischaemia.

Results of the SCOT-HEART trial showed a significant reduction of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction by CTA compared with diagnostic standard of care in patients with recent onset stable chest pain. However, there is a lack of large diagnostic comparison studies of CTA for coronary stenosis evaluation with functional stress testing for ischaemia evaluation for the detection of obstructive CAD. Previous investigations have suggested that coronary CT may have higher sensitivity and specificity than functional stress testing for the detection of anatomically defined CAD with invasive coronary angiography (ICA) as the reference standard. Within the Collaborative Meta-Analysis of Cardiac CT (COME-CCT) of patients with symptomatic stable chest pain, we compared the effectiveness of functional stress testing using exercise-ECG or SPECT with CTA for diagnosis of CAD using ICA as the reference standard. Further, the association of non-invasive diagnostic tests and pretest probability was assessed for evaluation of the ability to exclude obstructive CAD.

### Economic outcomes with precision diagnostic testing versus usual testing in stable chest pain: results from the PRECISE randomized trial [^dce95919]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2025). Medium credibility.

See Editorial by

Nonacute chest pain remains one of the most common symptoms prompting patients to seek medical care and one of the most challenging for clinicians to assess. Many patients will ultimately have a benign explanation for their symptoms, but an important minority will have prognostically significant coronary artery disease (CAD). For each patient, the clinician must decide whether diagnostic testing is indicated and, if so, which initial test to obtain. The first large outcome-based clinical trial of this question, the PROMISE (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for the Evaluation of Chest Pain), found that a functional testing–based strategy and a coronary computed tomographic angiography (cCTA)–based strategy provided equivalent short- and medium-term clinical outcomes for these patients.These results were largely concordant with the SCOT-HEART (Scottish Computed Tomography of the Heart Trial), which compared a cCTA strategy to a stress testing strategy that primarily used stress electrocardiography without imaging.These 2 trials established cCTA as a viable first-line test for nonacute chest pain that could be used instead of functional testing. However, they raised new questions about the efficiency of the strategies used, particularly related to the need for any testing in low-risk patients and the need for confirmatory invasive coronary angiography (ICA) in patients with ambiguous cCTA findings, about 30% of whom were found not to have obstructive CAD.

The PRECISE clinical trial (Prospective Randomized Trial of the Optimal Evaluation of Cardiac Symptoms and Revascularization) was designed specifically to address these efficiency of care issues raised by PROMISE and SCOT-HEART.The key innovation relative to PROMISE and SCOT-HEART was a novel precision medicine diagnostic testing strategy that matched the intensity of diagnostic evaluation with the risk level of each patient to improve the efficient identification of patients with actionable CAD while minimizing potentially harmful overtesting. The primary clinical outcomes of PRECISE have recently been reported.Economic efficiency, assessed in terms of resource use and medical costs, was a major prespecified secondary outcome of the trial.

ACCURATE will test whether a CAC-first strategy, performed routinely in symptomatic patients presenting for evaluation of possible coronary artery disease prior to the cardiac PET stress test, can be used as a gatekeeper for progression to the expensive rubidium-PET stress perfusion scan and be a major cost-saver without adversely affecting patient care or outcomes. Routinely, qualifying patients undergo CACS when they present for evaluation of possible but unknown CAD status and are referred for cardiac PET stress testing. In ACCURATE, those with CACS≤1 will then be consented and randomized to either a cardiac PET stress test strategy or a non-PET-driven medical care strategy.

Subjects randomized to the cardiac PET stress test strategy will receive appropriate subsequent care depending on the outcome of the cardiac PET scan. Subjects randomized to the CAC-only arm will receive appropriate non-PET driven medical clinical management and follow-up. All participating subjects' electronic medical records will be reviewed indefinitely for clinical outcomes. Initial outcomes will be reported at 1-year, 2-years, and 5-years, with future analyses to be determined by the study investigators.

### Coronary computed tomographic angiography combined with CT (...) [^947336f4]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Coronary Computed Tomographic Angiography Combined With CT-FFR in Intermediate-Risk Chest Pain Patients. ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview This study involves intermediate-risk emergency department patients presenting with chest pain or symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome but without acute myocardial infarction, defined by a HEART score greater than 3. After providing written informed consent, these patients are randomized to one of two strategies: an initial approach incorporating early coronary computed tomographic angiography or a standard care pathway without early CCTA. Patients in the CCTA group receive standard care as determined by their treating physician and undergo CCTA as soon as possible, typically within 24 hours and at most within 21 days.

The results of the CCTA, including coronary artery stenosis severity and CT-derived fractional flow reserve values, are provided to the physician to inform further management, which may include invasive coronary angiography, medical therapy, or lifestyle interventions. In contrast, patients randomized to the standard care group without early CCTA proceed with physician-directed evaluations that may include non-invasive functional tests such as exercise electrocardiography, stress echocardiography, or nuclear imaging according to local clinical practices, though CCTA is not part of their initial workup. Both groups receive optimal preventive care in line with current guidelines, and treating physicians are encouraged to initiate secondary prevention measures like antiplatelet therapy or statin use if any diagnostic tests reveal signs of coronary artery disease.

The primary endpoint of the study is a composite of death, readmission due to myocardial infarction, or hospitalization for unstable angina requiring revascularization. The trial aims to determine whether an early CCTA strategy improves diagnostic and treatment decision-making for intermediate-risk chest pain patients, ultimately influencing clinical outcomes compared to standard care. The study incorporates a prospective, multicenter design to ensure broad applicability and rigor, with careful attention to patient safety and adherence to ethical standards throughout the enrollment and follow-up processes.

Patients with suspected stable coronary artery disease

Seven individual non-invasive diagnostic strategies were examined and constitute the network of patients with symptoms assessed for suspected stable coronary artery disease (fig 1C). For the outcomes of invasive coronary angiography referral and revascularisation, no individual diagnostic strategy differed from an anatomical strategy (coronary CT angiography), apart from single photon emission CT-myocardial perfusion imaging that marginally yielded less invasive coronary angiography (odds ratio 0.54 (95% confidence interval 0.30 to 0.98)) and subsequent revascularisations (0.57 (0.37 to 0.87); fig 5). There was no evidence of inconsistency (P=0.62) and heterogeneity was moderate to high (𝜏 2 =0.336) for referrals to invasive coronary angiography. Overall, downstream testing favoured an initial diagnostic strategy with stress echocardiography (0.24 (0.08 to 0.74)) or single photon emission CT-myocardial perfusion imaging (0.57 (0.37 to 0.87)), but not cardiovascular magnetic resonance (0.95 (0.41 to 2.22)) compared with coronary CT angiography (fig 5, appendix 9). Exercise electrocardiograms were ranked last, with the highest rate of downstream testing compared with any other diagnostic strategy. The overall heterogeneity was moderate (τ 2 =0.137).

### Comparison of mid-to long-term clinical outcomes between anatomical testing and usual care in patients with suspected coronary artery disease: a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^c985f4ba]. Clinical Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Controversies remain regarding clinical outcomes following initial strategies of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) vs usual care with functional testing in patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD).

Hypothesis

CCTA as initial diagnostic strategy results in better mid- to long-term outcomes than usual care in patients with suspected CAD.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials comparing clinical outcomes during ≥6months' follow-up between initial anatomical testing by CCTA vs usual care with functional testing in patients with suspected CAD. Occurrence of all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and use of invasive coronary angiography and coronary revascularization, were compared between the 2 diagnostic strategies.

Results

Twelve trials were included (20 014 patients; mean follow-up, 20.5months). Patients undergoing CCTA as initial noninvasive testing had lower risk of nonfatal MI compared with those treated with usual care (risk ratio [RR]: 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52-0.94, P=0.02). There was a tendency for reduced MACE following initial CCTA strategy, but not for risk of all-cause mortality. Compared with functional testing, the CCTA strategy increased use of invasive coronary angiography (RR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.12-2.09, P=0.007) and coronary revascularization (RR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.11-2.00, P=0.007).

Conclusions

Anatomical testing with CCTA as the initial noninvasive diagnostic modality in patients with suspected CAD resulted in lower risk of nonfatal MI than usual care with functional testing, at the expense of more frequent use of invasive procedures.

### Comparative effectiveness of initial computed tomography and invasive coronary angiography in women and men with stable chest pain and suspected coronary artery disease: multicentre randomised trial [^662f6cd0]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess the comparative effectiveness of computed tomography and invasive coronary angiography in women and men with stable chest pain suspected to be caused by coronary artery disease.

Design

Prospective, multicentre, randomised pragmatic trial.

Setting

Hospitals at 26 sites in 16 European countries.

Participants

2002 (56.2%) women and 1559 (43.8%) men (total of 3561 patients) with suspected coronary artery disease referred for invasive coronary angiography on the basis of stable chest pain and a pre-test probability of obstructive coronary artery disease of 10-60%.

Intervention

Both women and men were randomised 1:1 (with stratification by gender and centre) to a strategy of either computed tomography or invasive coronary angiography as the initial diagnostic test (1019 and 983 women, and 789 and 770 men, respectively), and an intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Randomised allocation could not be blinded, but outcomes were assessed by investigators blinded to randomisation group.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke). Key secondary endpoints were an expanded MACE composite (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, transient ischaemic attack, or major procedure related complication) and major procedure related complications.

Results

Follow-up at a median of 3.5 years was available in 98.9% (1979/2002) of women and in 99.0% (1544/1559) of men. No statistically significant gender interaction was found for MACE (P=0.29), the expanded MACE composite (P=0.45), or major procedure related complications (P=0.11). In both genders, the rate of MACE did not differ between the computed tomography and invasive coronary angiography groups. In men, the expanded MACE composite endpoint occurred less frequently in the computed tomography group than in the invasive coronary angiography group (22 (2.8%) v 41 (5.3%); hazard ratio 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.31 to 0.87). In women, the risk of having a major procedure related complication was lower in the computed tomography group than in the invasive coronary angiography group (3 (0.3%) v 21 (2.1%); hazard ratio 0.14, 0.04 to 0.46).

Conclusion

This study found no evidence for a difference between women and men in the benefit of using computed tomography rather than invasive coronary angiography as the initial diagnostic test for the management of stable chest pain in patients with an intermediate pre-test probability of coronary artery disease. An initial computed tomography scan was associated with fewer major procedure related complications in women and a lower frequency of the expanded MACE composite in men.

### Dynamic myocardial perfusion CT for the detection of hemodynamically significant coronary artery disease [^8af12c84]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL ROLE OF CT-MPI.

In this study, the incremental value of CT-MPI was predominantly observed in moderately stenosed vessels. In populations with a low disease prevalence, the routine performance of CT-MPI would not be justified, but it may be offered after a coronary CTA with obstructive disease. The CRESCENT (Comprehensive Cardiac CT Versus Exercise Testing in Suspected Coronary Artery Disease) II trial showed a higher yield of coronary disease with a class I indication for revascularization when CT-MPI was selectively performed in patients with obstructive disease on coronary CTA, in comparison to stress testing, without increasing overall catheterization rates. Yu et al showed that the addition of CT-MPI decreased the rate of ICAs not followed by revascularization compared to coronary CTA alone. Based on various considerations and local context, multiple viable options exist to functionally assess CAD. If a coronary CTA of adequate quality is available, CT-FFR represents an attractive option without the need for further physical testing and associated risks. However, the proportion of coronary CTA scans of adequate quality for CT-FFR processing varies substantially among studies, and CT-FFR has not been validated in a range of clinical conditions (eg, stents, grafts, anomalous coronary anatomy). In patients with diffuse disease, CT-MPI integrated with coronary CTA can depict lesion-specific functional impact.

STUDY LIMITATIONS.

MPI and pressure-wire–based FFR are fundamentally different approaches to determine functional CAD severity. FFR assesses the hemodynamic significance of epicardial coronary stenoses, whereas MPI reflects the combination of epicardial and microvascular disease. By study design, the CAD prevalence was relatively high in our cohort, and extrapolation of the results to populations with lower disease probabilities should be done with care. Furthermore, we did not adjust for potential correlation between multiple vessels in the same subject, which might have underestimated the SEs of our analyses. Additionally, absolute and relative MBF thresholds indicating myocardial ischemia vary among studies and may be affected by the type of CT scanner and postprocessing software. Thus, future investigation is warranted to confirm our results on different CT scanners and postprocessing software. Similar to prior studies, and for a range of practical reasons including discrepancies between visual and QCA stenosis severity, FFR was not performed in all vessels with an intermediate stenosis severity.

### CCTA should be the new diagnostic gateway for evaluating intermediate-risk stable angina patients [^77556ce3]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

The current paradigm of diagnosing stable angina patients with intermediate risk using invasive angiography as an initial strategy is no longer the sole evidence-based strategy

In an accompanying editorial analysis of the DISCHARGE study, Loscalzodescribes the current paradigm of treating patients with stable angina, in which patients often undergo ICA as a default strategy with a bias toward performing percutaneous or surgical revascularization for obstructive CAD. This paradigm has been challenged, in part, by the advent of CCTA, which identifies both obstructive and nonobstructive CAD more accurately than noninvasive stress (“functional”) testing. CCTA has been directly compared with functional stress testing in multiple randomized controlled trials, the largest of which showed no difference in patient outcomes with either strategy.

As the first major randomized comparison of CCTA with ICA, the primary findings in the DISCHARGE study, that patient outcomes are similar regardless of whether CCTA or ICA is used to evaluate stable angina patients, further support the notion that CCTA and ICA are both reasonable and appropriate initial strategies in the evaluation of intermediate-risk patients. The DISCHARGE study findings should empower clinicians to consider CCTA as a prudent, safe, and effective alternative to ICA in their discussions with patients regarding diagnostic options to evaluate stable angina, as suggested in Figure 1. The consent process for ICA should include CCTA as an acceptable alternative for patients with stable angina and an intermediate pretest probability for CAD.

### Economic outcomes with anatomical versus functional diagnostic testing for coronary artery disease [^01ac75db]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

PROMISE (PROspective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain) found that initial use of at least 64-slice multidetector computed tomography angiography (CTA) versus functional diagnostic testing strategies did not improve clinical outcomes in stable symptomatic patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) requiring noninvasive testing.

Objective

To conduct an economic analysis for PROMISE (a major secondary aim of the study).

Design

Prospective economic study from the U.S. perspective. Comparisons were made according to the intention-to-treat principle, and CIs were calculated using bootstrap methods. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01174550).

Setting

190 U.S. centers.

Patients

9649 U.S. patients enrolled in PROMISE between July 2010 and September 2013. Median follow-up was 25 months.

Measurements

Technical costs of the initial (outpatient) testing strategy were estimated from Premier Research Database data. Hospital-based costs were estimated using hospital bills and Medicare cost-charge ratios. Physician fees were taken from the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. Costs were expressed in 2014 U.S. dollars, discounted at 3% annually, and estimated out to 3 years using inverse probability weighting methods.

Results

The mean initial testing costs were $174 for exercise electrocardiography; $404 for CTA; $501 to $514 for pharmacologic and exercise stress echocardiography, respectively; and $946 to $1132 for exercise and pharmacologic stress nuclear testing, respectively. Mean costs at 90 days were $2494 for the CTA strategy versus $2240 for the functional strategy (mean difference, $254 [95% CI, -$634 to $906]). The difference was associated with more revascularizations and catheterizations (4.25 per 100 patients) with CTA use. After 90 days, the mean cost difference between the groups out to 3 years remained small.

Limitation

Cost weights for test strategies were obtained from sources outside PROMISE.

Conclusion

Computed tomography angiography and functional diagnostic testing strategies in patients with suspected CAD have similar costs through 3 years of follow-up.

### Clinical outcomes of fractional flow reserve by computed tomographic angiography-guided diagnostic strategies vs. usual care in patients with suspected coronary artery disease: the prospective longitudinal trial of FFR (CT): outcome and resource impacts study [^e68e03fb]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Stable chest pain is a common clinical presentation that often requires further investigation using non-invasive or invasive testing.The goals of testing include clarifying the diagnosis, documenting the presence or absence of coronary artery disease (CAD), and directing subsequent care, whether revascularization, intensified medical treatment, or both, while maximizing efficiency and patient safety.The recently completed PROMISEand SCOT-HEARTtrials suggest that an evaluation strategy based on coronary computed tomographic angiography (CTA) increases diagnostic certainty, improves efficiency of triage to invasive catheterization, and may reduce radiation exposure when compared with functional stress testing, with similar rates of cardiac events. Moreover, in PROMISE, CTA increased the rate of invasive catheterization by almost 50% compared with functional testing, and over a quarter of these patients did not have obstructive CAD identified by invasive angiography. Since CTA provided only anatomic information and invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR) was rarely used, revascularizations guided by a CTA strategy were generally performed without evidence of the functional significance of coronary stenoses, at variance with practice guidelines.This is an important consideration since CTA in PROMISE doubled the rate of coronary revascularization compared with functional testing.

A diagnostic strategy that provides both anatomic and functional data could address this limitation and potentially afford enhanced efficiency and safety. Recently, a non-invasive method to determine the haemodynamic significance of coronary stenoses has been developed that computes the fractional flow reserve by computed tomographic angiography (FFR CT) based on computational fluid dynamics and simulated maximal coronary hyperaemia.Fractional flow reserve by computed tomographic angiography has been validated against invasively measured FFR as a reference standard, – but there are no data on the clinical utility of this new method and how its use may affect patient care and clinical outcomes.

The present study was designed to test the hypotheses that patients with suspected CAD evaluated using a CTA/FFR CT -guided strategy would have fewer invasive angiograms that showed no obstructive CAD than would patients who were evaluated based on standard practice, and would have similar and low rates of major cardiac events.

There were no significant differences in the proportion of patients undergoing coronary angiography at 6 months or any revascularization procedure at 12 months (Table 2). One patient in the CCTA arm died during the follow-up. Two patients in the MPI arm and one in the CCTA arm had recurrent ischemia. One additional patient in the MPI arm underwent unplanned PCI.

### Diagnostic implications in the aftermath of the ISCHEMIA trial [^ce51b198]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The recently reported ISCHEMIA trial will reignite the debate regarding the optimal first diagnostic test when evaluating chest pain in patients suspected to have coronary artery disease. This article considers whether the debate should be refocused even before selecting any diagnostic test. The case is made to prioritize risk factor management and empiric angina pectoris control as part of optimal secondary prevention followed by expeditious clinical reassessment to determine adequacy of therapeutic responses, including quality of life, before embarking on diagnostic testing. Once anatomical coronary artery disease is known in diagnostic algorithms that incorporate cardiac computed tomographic angiography, there is the potential to forego an adequate trial of conservative management, thereby failing to translate the key finding of ISCHEMIA to practice. Embedded in this "Symptom-driven Path" is the principle that definitive diagnostic testing must be expeditious if symptoms persist or deteriorate and impair quality of life during conservative management. This strategy would ensure appropriate utilization of contemporary conservative management which is replete with numerous effective pharmacotherapies that modify atherosclerosis and dramatically reduce cardiovascular risk. In conclusion, diagnostic testing and invasive therapy would be minimized and dictated primarily by adequacy of patient symptoms and quality of life.

### Cardiovascular outcomes of coronary computed tomography angiography versus functional testing in suspected coronary syndromes: real-world evidence from the nationwide cohort [^084c07b6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our study compared cardiovascular outcomes between patients who underwent CCTA and noninvasive functional tests as gatekeepers for suspected coronary syndromes using longitudinal data from a national sample cohort with a 5.4‐year follow‐up period. Compared with functional stress tests, CCTA was not associated with a reduction in the primary composite outcome of cardiac death or MI when used as a gatekeeper.

Various studies have compared the clinical efficacy of CCTA with that of functional studies for suspected coronary syndromes. In the PROMISE trial, 10 003 patients were randomly assigned to CCTA or functional testing for suspected CAD. Compared with functional testing, initial CCTA did not improve clinical outcomes over a median follow‐up of 2 years.In the SCOT‐HEART trial, which enrolled 4146 patients with stable chest pain who underwent a routine clinical evaluation including exercise electrocardiography, there was a significant reduction in the rate of death from coronary heart disease or nonfatal MI in the standard care plus CCTA group compared with the standard care group during a median follow‐up of 4.8 years.In a Danish nationwide registry study with a median follow‐up of 3.6 years, CCTA was associated with a lower risk of MI, but a similar risk of all‐cause death, compared with functional tests as an initial investigation modality for CAD.Due to these heterogeneous study settings and results, selection of the optimal initial diagnostic modality for the evaluation of suspected coronary syndromes still requires more evidence. Fortunately, the results of the PRECISE (Prospective Randomized Trial of the Optimal Evaluation of Cardiac Symptoms and Revascularization) trial is upcoming, in which 2103 patients with stable chest pain were enrolled and randomly assigned to a precision strategy group or usual care.The study might provide strong evidence for the optimal evaluation strategy for patients with stable chest pain.One major limitation of contemporary clinical trials was that they were conducted in the Western countries, and large‐scale studies for Asian populations are scarce. Our study provides evidence for the selection of gatekeepers on the basis of real‐world data from the Korean population, including >27 000 patients with about 5‐year median follow‐up period.

### Stress testing versus CT angiography in Patients with diabetes and suspected Coronary artery disease [^0aade60d]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal noninvasive test (NIT) for patients with diabetes and stable symptoms of coronary artery disease (CAD) is unknown.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to assess whether a diagnostic strategy based on coronary computed tomographic angiography (CTA) is superior to functional stress testing in reducing adverse cardiovascular (CV) outcomes (CV death or myocardial infarction [MI]) among symptomatic patients with diabetes.

Methods

PROMISE (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain) was a randomized trial evaluating an initial strategy of CTA versus functional testing in stable outpatients with symptoms suggestive of CAD. The study compared CV outcomes in patients with diabetes (n = 1,908 [21%]) and without diabetes (n = 7,058 [79%]) based on their randomization to CTA or functional testing.

Results

Patients with diabetes (vs. without) were similar in age (median 61 years vs. 60 years) and sex (female 54% vs. 52%) but had a greater burden of CV comorbidities. Patients with diabetes who underwent CTA had a lower risk of CV death/MI compared with functional stress testing (CTA: 1.1% [10 of 936] vs. stress testing: 2.6% [25 of 972]; adjusted hazard ratio: 0.38; 95% confidence interval: 0.18 to 0.79; p = 0.01). There was no significant difference in nondiabetic patients (CTA: 1.4% [50 of 3,564] vs. stress testing: 1.3% [45 of 3,494]; adjusted hazard ratio: 1.03; 95% confidence interval: 0.69 to 1.54; p = 0.887; interaction term for diabetes p value = 0.02).

Conclusions

In diabetic patients presenting with stable chest pain, a CTA strategy resulted in fewer adverse CV outcomes than a functional testing strategy. CTA may be considered as the initial diagnostic strategy in this subgroup. (PROspective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain [PROMISE]; NCT01174550).

### Non-invasive imaging of the coronary arteries [^aef26745]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Randomized controlled trials testing computed tomography coronary angiography

In contrast with most radiological investigations used in medical practice, the clinical utility of CTCA has been rigorously determined in a series of randomized clinical trials. In a comparison with exercise ECG testing, the CAPP (Cardiac CT for the Assessment of Pain and Plaque) trial (n = 500) demonstrated an improvement in angina-related quality of life, with the use of CTCA.This trial was underpowered for hard clinical events but identified a corresponding reduction in unplanned hospital admissions amongst those in the CTCA intervention arm. More recently, the much larger PROMISE (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain) and SCOT-HEART (Scottish Computed Tomography of the HEART) trials have reported their findings. PROMISE (n = 10 003) randomized intermediate-risk symptomatic patients being evaluated for the presence of coronary heart disease to CTCA or non-invasive functional testing (67% nuclear stress imaging, 23% stress echocardiography, 10% exercise ECG).The median duration of follow-up was 25 months and no difference in the primary composite endpoint (death, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, or major procedural complication) was demonstrated despite a downstream reduction in the rate of unnecessary invasive coronary angiograms and apparent reductions in death or myocardial infarction at 12 months. The SCOT-HEART trial (n = 4146) investigated the utility of adding CTCA to standard care (predominantly exercise ECG) in a broad population of patients seen in rapid access chest pain clinics across Scotland.The primary endpoint of diagnostic certainty at 6-weeks was increased with CTCA. Recently, the 5-year composite clinical outcome of coronary death or non-fatal myocardial infarction has been reported, with a marked 40% relative risk reduction in the CTCA arm of the trial.In aggregate, these trials provide powerful evidence of benefit for a CT first approach in the assessment of stable chest pain.

### Evaluation of computed tomography in patients with atypical angina or chest pain clinically referred for invasive coronary angiography: randomised controlled trial [^9ef3fcfa]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

Our study shows that cardiac CT is a safe test to rule out coronary artery disease in patients with atypical angina or chest pain and that invasive coronary angiography is a safe procedure in patients with atypical presentation with an increase only in minor procedural complications, which is in line with a study in 61 patients.Importantly, CT increased the diagnostic yield of coronary angiography by a factor of five, indicating the potential to improve utilisation of resources. The diagnostic yield of 75% for coronary angiography in the CT group was similar to that in the National Cardiovascular Data Registry and higher than reported for functional tests (approximately 45%).CT may thus be able to act as an effective gatekeeper to the catheterisation laboratoryand increase the reported low diagnostic yield of coronary angiography.Greater doctor confidence in CT findings was reported in the SCOT-Heart trial, which compared CT with standard of care including functional tests.Our study adds to this by showing low true positive and high true negative rates of functional tests performed within six months before randomisation. Thus, CT might be able to replace functional testing in certain patients. Our prospective study also adds to these findings by showing a reduction of unnecessary invasive coronary angiographies by CT in patients with atypical presentation referred for coronary angiography.

Conclusion

The search is ongoing for a gatekeeper that will reliably exclude normal invasive coronary angiography. This randomised trial showed that in patients with atypical symptoms suggestive of coronary artery disease requiring coronary angiography, CT safely deferred invasive coronary angiography with no increase in long term events, reduced minor but not major procedural complications compared with direct coronary angiography, and shortened the length of hospital stay. CT was associated with reduced coronary angiography rates and increased the diagnostic yield of this procedure but did not reduce exposure to radiation. More patients preferred the coronary CT first approach.

### The power of zero calcium in 82-rubidium PET irrespective of sex and age [^a5a6d888]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Calcium score as a gatekeeper

Despite its growing evidence and excellent prognostic power of ZCS, CACS has not been widely used as a gatekeeper in clinical practice. In the CRESCENT trial,Lubbers et al. randomized symptomatic patients with suspected CAD to CTCA or functional testing. In the CT group, a CACS was performed as a gatekeeper and CTCA was completed only if CACS was 1-400, or if CACS was 0 and the pre-test probability was very high (> 70%). During the short follow-up of 1.2 years, none of the 100 patients with ZCS had an adverse event.

In a slightly different setting, Budoff et al. introduced CTCA with a CACS gatekeeper to the CAD risk stratification algorithm of firefighters and could show a significant reduction in costs (503$ vs 1376$ per person).However, no data on prognosis are provided from this study.

In an ongoing, large, prospective randomized controlled trial (ACCURATE, NCT03972774), 2500 patients with suspected CAD are being randomized for PET scan versus no further testing in patients with zero calcium. The study aim is to compare cost-effectiveness and safety of the two approaches.

Although obstructive CAD was missed in 1.5% of patients with ZCS in the PROMISE trial, these patients had an even lower event rate compared to patients with a normal functional test (1.4% vs 2.1%).In our cohort, only 0.4% with ≥ 10% ischemia would have been missed. With these reassuring data, there is enough evidence that CACS should be implemented as a gatekeeper in clinical practice and be validated prospectively in different patient cohorts. This approach seems promising, especially since potential radiation and cost savings would be substantial (22%-23% in our cohort).

In addition, radiation dose could be further improved if CACS scans would be used for attenuation correction. This approach was shown to exhibit excellent correlation with standard attenuation correction scans.However, the more dose intense, dedicated CACS scan should not be substituted with attenuation scans with the same thresholds since this leads to significant underestimation of coronary calcification, especially in patients with minimal calcification only.

### SCCT 2021 expert consensus document on coronary computed tomographic angiography: a report of the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography [^2b84f9a1]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2020). High credibility.

Guidelines and pre-test probability in stable chest pain—NICE and ESC: Prior NICE guidance recommended no further investigations for PTP <10%, coronary artery calcium scoring (CACS) for PTP 10–29%, functional imaging for PTP 30–60% and invasive coronary angiography (ICA) for PTP 61–90%. The 2016 NICE update recommended CTA (on a ≥64-slice CT scanner) as the first line test, regardless of PTP, in patients with typical or atypical anginal symptoms or ECG findings consistent with significant CAD; functional imaging was recommended only in those with equivocal CTA or with known CAD, and ICA was recommended as a third-line investigation or when the functional imaging was non-diagnostic. With contemporary data, recalibration resulted in PTP values approximately one-third of those in the previous guidelines. Modeling showed CTA was the most cost-effective first line investigation at all levels of disease prevalence (25%, 45% and 75%) when assessed against both 50% and 70% thresholds. In SCOT-HEART and PROMISE comparisons, the c-statistic for identifying obstructive CAD favored the NICE strategy (0.634 vs 0.594 for ESC and 0.560 for ACC), and a NICE technology review concluded that FFRCT was a robust and valuable modality when added to CTA.

### Outcomes in patients with a first episode of chest pain undergoing early coronary CT imaging [^83014149]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

In accordance with the SCOT-HEART trial, we observed a higher referral rate for follow-up diagnostics and interventions in CT-first patients.We did not perform analyses of these downstream costs. Therefore, no statements can be given about the cost-to-benefit ratio in patients with and without a cardiac CT-first strategy. Yet, in the light of a faster and more often correct diagnosis,lower cumulative diagnostic expenses could be expected for patients with a cardiac CT.Nevertheless, cost-effectiveness of the CT-first strategy needs to be established and should take into account the higher number of revascularisations and medication prescriptions in CT-first patients.On the contrary, the relatively low cost and wide availability of CT makes it accessible for more patients compared with other cardiac imaging strategies.

### Myocardial perfusion imaging versus computed tomography angiography-derived fractional flow reserve testing in stable patients with intermediate-range coronary lesions: influence on downstream diagnostic workflows and invasive angiography findings [^3ceadb7c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this single‐center observational study of symptomatic patients with suspected CAD undergoing frontline coronary CTA testing, a change in functional testing strategy from standard MPI to FFR CT in patients with intermediate‐range coronary lesions did not affect overall downstream ICA utilization. However, following adjustment for differences in baseline risk variables, adoption of adjunctive FFR CT testing was associated with a reduction in downstream use of ICA. Moreover, after adoption of FFR CT, we observed a 75% reduction in patients who had to return for a second noninvasive test. Finally, the introduction of FFR CT was associated with a reduction in the rate of finding no obstructive CAD at ICA, a higher rate of revascularization, and an increase in availability of lesion‐specific functional information for guidance of coronary interventions.

Compared with MPI, the strength of coronary CTA is the ability to accurately exclude, detect, and localize CAD. In the recent PROMISE and SCOT‐HEART trials, frontline coronary CTA compared with noninvasive functional assessment in patients with stable CAD enhanced diagnostic certainty and favorably influenced the diagnostic workflow and therapeutic plans. 18, 19 Coronary CTA, however, overestimates the severity of lesions and cannot reliably determine their functional significance. 1 This gap in noninvasive diagnostic testing may be addressed by combining anatomic and physiologic data. 20

In accord with the present findings, the prognosis in contemporary patients undergoing noninvasive testing for suspected CAD is favorable, with an annual risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction or all‐cause death of ≈1%. 7, 18, 19 Consequently, demonstrating a benefit for clinical outcome with a new diagnostic test for stable CAD is complex. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has assessed the potential impact of frontline coronary CTA testing in combination with different functional test strategies on downstream diagnostic workflows and the quality of information for guiding care. In the recent PLATFORM study of patients with suspected stable CAD and planned ICA, FFR CT testing was associated with a safe reduction in downstream ICA utilization, a reduced rate of ICA showing no obstructive CAD, and an increase in the availability of functional information to guide therapeutic decision making. 7 The present study adds to these findings by demonstrating comparable results in a real‐world clinical setting of stable patients with chest pain in whom coronary CTA testing was performed according to guidelines 2 and in whom the overall ICA referral rate was low (≈13%).

### Cardiovascular outcomes of coronary computed tomography angiography versus functional testing in suspected coronary syndromes: real-world evidence from the nationwide cohort [^1a0616eb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Given the wide array of possible etiologies, patients with chest pain present a diagnostic challenge.Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the most common causes of chest pain, and its prevalence has been gradually increasing, reaching 1655 per 100 000 people in 2017.Invasive coronary angiography is the gold standard for CAD diagnosis and is often followed by coronary revascularization procedures. However, given the invasiveness and potential risks of invasive coronary angiography and the low diagnostic yield of elective invasive coronary angiography for suspected CAD, noninvasive tests are generally recommended as an initial investigation in patients who do not have a high clinical likelihood of CAD.

The selection of the initial noninvasive modality among various functional and anatomic studies is another challenging issue in clinical practice, and strategies for patient management vary according to the results of the initial test. Traditionally, functional tests, such as the treadmill test (TMT) and stress nuclear single‐photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), have been reported to provide excellent prognostic value for cardiovascular events.With advances in computed tomography techniques, sequential studies have also proven that coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is not only predictive of future cardiovascular events, but also highly sensitive for detecting the absence of CAD.

Large randomized controlled trials have been conducted to compare the efficacy of anatomic and functional testing in patients with suspected coronary syndromes.The PROMISE (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain) trial showed that the rate of major adverse cardiovascular events did not significantly differ between CCTA and functional stress testing.In the SCOT‐HEART (Scottish Computed Tomography of the Heart) trial, the use of CCTA in addition to standard care in patients with stable chest pain was associated with a reduction of the rate of death from coronary heart disease or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) and augmented use of preventive medications.Given the heterogeneity in the clinical efficacy of functional testing and CCTA in clinical trials, the use of CCTA as a first‐line noninvasive imaging modality above functional testing in patients with stable chest pain is still controversial. More importantly, despite the vast volume of clinical studies, real‐world data comparing the cardiovascular outcomes of gatekeeping studies in patients with suspected coronary syndromes are limited.

Thus, we sought to compare the clinical outcomes of noninvasive gatekeeping studies in patients with suspected coronary syndromes using the nationwide claims database of the National Health Insurance Service in South Korea.

### The effectiveness of coronary computed tomography angiography and functional testing for the diagnosis of obstructive coronary artery disease: results from the individual patient data collaborative meta-analysis of cardiac CT (COME-CCT) [^d13ba38e]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Comparison with previous studies

In a per-study-level meta-analysis of randomised trials, CTA compared with functional stress testing was associated with a reduced incidence of myocardial infarction. This further supports the conclusions from the present IPD meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy studies. In a network meta-analysis comparing CTA, SPECT, PET, and MRI on the per-study (not per-patient) level with ICA or fractional flow reserve (FFR) it was demonstrated that each diagnostic modality has its own optimal performance pretest probability. For the choice between stress testing and coronary CTA, the ESC guideline recommends considering whether patients are suitable and if local expertise in one or the other diagnostic test is present. Nowadays local expertise is commonly present for both stress testing and CTA, while our study shows that if local expertise is available, coronary CTA should be considered as the primary test for the exclusion of obstructive CAD. Our results may help in choosing the most appropriate non-invasive test before proceeding to ICA potentially resulting in an increase of the reportedly lower diagnostic yield of invasive angiography. Importantly, the ISCHEMIA trial suggests that an ischaemia detection strategy with subsequent invasive interventions may not result in improved outcomes. The COME-CCT consortium used (quantitative) coronary angiography as the reference standard for the direct visualisation of coronary obstructions. Considering the low uptake of invasive FFR worldwide, the pragmatic reference standard used in COME-CCT reflects clinical practice at the time of data collection.

### Survival after initial stress testing vs anatomic testing in suspected coronary artery disease: long-term follow-up of the PROMISE randomized clinical trial [^3eaa6972]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Symptoms suggestive of coronary artery disease (CAD) often require noninvasive testing for diagnostic and prognostic evaluation.

Objective

To determine long-term outcomes in patients randomized to functional (stress) vs anatomic (coronary computed tomographic angiography [CTA]) initial testing.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This study is a 2025 follow-up analysis of mortality of participants in the PROMISE (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain) randomized clinical trial, which was conducted from 2009 to 2014, using a 2024 National Death Index search. Median (IQR) follow-up duration was 10.6 (9.9-11.3) years; maximum follow-up was 12.4 years. PROMISE was conducted at 193 multispecialty outpatient sites in North America among 10 003 symptomatic patients requiring testing for suspected CAD. Data analysis was conducted from August 2024 to March 2025.

Intervention

Participants were randomized 1:1 to initial CTA or stress testing. Testing and subsequent care were performed by sites according to usual practices.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The PROMISE trial's original primary end point was death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina hospitalization, or major procedural complication. The primary end point for extended follow-up was all-cause death, with cardiovascular (CV) death as a secondary end point.

Results

At enrollment, mean (SD) participant age was 61 (8) years, 5270 participants (52.7%) were women, and 8762 (87.6%) had chest pain or dyspnea. Death occurred in 1128 participants (14.4%), including 558 (14.3%) in the CTA arm and 570 (14.5%) in the stress arm (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.98; 95% CI, 0.87-1.10). There was no demonstrable difference in cardiovascular mortality, although the point estimate favored CTA (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.67-1.05; adjusted HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.41-1.94). There were no significant interactions between all-cause death or CV death and study arm by age (<60 or ≥60 years) (P value for interaction=.19), gender (P value for interaction=.60), or race and ethnicity (P value for interaction=.47). A CTA indicating any degree of abnormality, including mild (nonobstructive CAD), moderate, and severe findings, conferred elevated adjusted HRs of death (1.99-3.44; all P<.001) compared to normal study results. Among stress testing results, only a severe abnormality was prognostically significant (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.10-1.91). In landmark analyses of those alive at 90 days, there were no interactions between randomized testing and use of statins (P value for interaction=.22), β-blockers (P value for interaction=.76), or antiplatelet agents (P value for interaction=.49).

Conclusions and Relevance

In long-term follow-up of the PROMISE randomized clinical trial, initial noninvasive test selection in patients with stable symptoms of suspected CAD did not affect all-cause or CV mortality at 10 years.

### An FFRdiagnostic strategy versus usual care in patients with suspected coronary artery disease planned for invasive coronary angiography at German sites: one-year results of a subgroup analysis of the PLATFORM (prospective longitudinal trial of FFR: outcome and resource impacts) study [^f0e47557]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Endpoints and definitions

The primary endpoint was the rate of ICA at ≤ 90days showing no obstructive CAD in patients with invasive testing planned before enrolment in the usual invasive care cohort versus the initial CTA/FFR CT cohort. Obstructive CAD was defined as stenosis of ≥50% in any coronary artery in a vessel ≥2.0 mm in diameter by core laboratory QCA or invasive FFR <0.80 in the absence of this degree of stenosis. Secondary endpoints included clinical, economic and QOL outcomes at 1 year. The clinical secondary endpoints included the following: (1) a composite of major cardiovascular events (MACE) at 1 year, including all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI) and unplanned hospitalisation for chest pain leading to urgent revascularisation and (2) MACE plus vascular events within 14 days of procedures. MACE were adjudicated by an event adjudication committee blinded to the treatment groups based on standard, prospectively determined definitions.Cumulative radiation exposure from all cardiovascular tests and procedures was determined over 1 year after enrolment, as previously described.

The use of key medical resources, including non-invasive stress tests, CTA, invasive tests, coronary revascularisation procedures and clinical events, was demonstrated from study enrolment through 1 year. Cumulative medical costs (in euro) over 1 year were calculated on a per-patient basis by multiplying a standardised cost weight for each resource by the number of times that resource was used. Cost data were obtained using reimbursement rates for privately insured patients from the 2016 German doctor’s fee schedule (GOÄ) for outpatient examinations and the 2016 German Diagnosis-Related Groups (G-DRG) system for inpatient investigations. The G-DRG system operates on a flat-fee principle based on the final documented diagnosis on discharge, taking into account factors such as comorbidities and length of stay. GOÄ reimbursement, on the other hand, operates on a fee-for-service basis for privately insured patients. When calculating the difference in subsequent costs between patients with the FFR CT strategy versus the conventional strategy, the FFR CT cost weight was set at zero, as there is no G-DRG or GOÄ cost weight at this time. QOL was assessed at baseline and one year using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ), the EuroQOL scale (EQ-5D) and the EuroQOL visual analogue scale, and the magnitude of change was compared between patients in the usual invasive care cohort versus the initial CTA/FFR CT cohort.

### Coronary computed tomography angiography alone versus confirmatory functional testing for guiding treatment strategy for patients with intermediate coronary artery stenosis [^cd130a94]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Intermediate coronary artery stenosis (≥50% and <90%) on coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) is usually considered as a significant lesion. However, anatomical diagnosis is not well correlated with the functional significance of myocardial ischemia. We investigated whether functional testing in addition to coronary CTA improves outcomes of patients with intermediate stenosis, compared with the 1-step CTA-alone-based strategy. From 2006 to 2011, we consecutively enrolled 335 patients with chest pain with intermediate stenosis detected by an initially performed coronary CTA. Of these, 159 patients followed the 1-step strategy, whereas 176 followed the 2-step strategy with confirmatory functional tests. One-year follow-up data were obtained for all patients. The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and repeated or delayed revascularization (major adverse cardiac event) within a year. Baseline clinical parameters were comparable between patients of the 2 different strategies. The rate of invasive catheterization or percutaneous intervention was 75.5% in the 1-step group and 35.2% in the 2-step group (p <0.001). Consequently, more patients in the 2-step group were medically treated without unnecessary revascularization compared with patients in the 1-step group (71.0% vs 40.9%, p <0.001). Only 2.5% of the patients who received medical treatment in the 2-step group finally received delayed revascularization, whereas 14% in the 1-step group did. Overall, the primary end point occurred in 11.3% in the 1-step group and 4.0% in the 2-step group (p = 0.011). In conclusion, confirmatory functional testing reduces invasive catheterization and coronary intervention and improves clinical outcomes in patients with intermediate stenosis on coronary CTA.

### Evaluation of computed tomography in patients with atypical angina or chest pain clinically referred for invasive coronary angiography: randomised controlled trial [^c7722602]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The final diagnosis of obstructive coronary artery disease is made by invasive coronary angiography.Coronary angiography has the advantages of allowing simultaneous coronary stenting and planning of coronary artery bypass grafting. Evidence from the United Statesand Europe,however, suggests that invasive coronary angiography has low diagnostic yield, indicating potential overuse, and also rare but possibly life threatening complications.Computed tomography (CT) is the most accurate non-invasive test for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease.The greatest clinical value of cardiac CT may be its ability to reliably rule out obstructive coronary artery disease in patients with atypical presentation and thus with a low-to-intermediate pretest probability of disease.

In a large multicentre US trial, CT did not improve clinical outcomes compared with functional testing,whereas in the large SCOT-Heart (Scottish COmputed Tomography of the HEART) trial in rapid access chest pain clinics,CT used for diagnosis and management decisions was found to possibly reduce myocardial infarction on follow-up of patients with recent onset angina.CT may also lead to fewer angina symptoms, downstream testing, and costs, while increasing exposure to radiation in patients with stable angina compared with functional testing.However, no study has analysed the effectiveness of CT in a randomised comparison with coronary angiography.

We investigated the comparative effectiveness of cardiac CT and coronary angiography in patients with suspected coronary artery disease and atypical angina or chest pain who were clinically referred for coronary angiography. We assessed the impact of CT on procedural complications, diagnostic yield of invasive coronary angiography, length of stay, radiation dose, long term clinical outcomes, and patient acceptance.

### Cardiovascular health technology assessment: recommendations to improve the quality of evidence [^3b8ed573]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Examples of guideline-changing trials that were susceptible to bias

The Scottish COmputed Tomography of the HEART (SCOT-HEART) was an open-label clinical trial that took place in chest pain clinics in NHS Scotland. Standard care was guideline-directed patient management mainly based on treadmill exercise testing. The intervention was standard care guided by an additional CT coronary angiogram. The control group followed standard care but there was no additional test (active or sham). The intervention was randomly allocated 1:1 in 4146 participants with stable chest pain. The trial had an open-label design and the intervention was unmasked. The primary endpoint of the study was the proportion of patients diagnosed with angina pectoris secondary to coronary heart disease at 6 weeks. The clinicians who determined the primary outcome were familiar with the treatment group of the participants.SCOT-HEART was a ‘positive’ trial in favour of the CT-guided strategy but by design the primary outcome was therefore susceptible to bias. On the other hand, unexpectedly, symptoms and quality of life (secondary outcomes) improved less with the CT-guided strategy as compared with standard care. Nonetheless, the updated NICE-95 clinical guidelines recommended CT coronary angiography as the first-line test for patients with stable chest pain. The CG95 guideline update issued in November 2016 did not mention the Clinical Evaluation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Coronary heart disease 2 trial that had been published in September 2016. This trial presents evidence in favour of stress imaging over CT coronary angiographyand highlights the importance of updates that take account of new evidence. A summary of the major published and ongoing diagnostic strategy trials in patients with suspected ischaemic heart disease is shown in table 3.

Table 3 
Focus topic: contemporary multicentre strategy trials of cardiac imaging in patients with suspected stable IHD

In phase III and phase IV trials in interventional cardiology, coronary revascularisation is commonly included as a component of the primary outcome. This procedure is triggered by a medical decision and the primary outcome becomes susceptible to bias when the decision for revascularisation is made by an unblinded clinician who may also be an investigator in the trial. The design becomes all the more problematic if the revascularisation event is discounted within a time period when revascularisation might commonly occur, for example, 45 daysor 60 days.The primary outcome can therefore be influenced by an investigator who may purposefully or subconsciously schedule a revascularisation procedure days before or after this cut-off.

Clinical indications for coronary CTA—stable chest pain outcomes: When compared to functional testing techniques, the use of CTA is associated with increased use of preventive medical therapies and a significant reduction in the rate of incident myocardial infarction, with a relatively low rate of referral to ICA for patients without any obstructive CAD and without an increased likelihood of undergoing coronary revascularization in the only long term trial; collectively, outcomes with CTA are at least comparable to functional testing, without increasing costs.

### Comparative effectiveness of initial computed tomography and invasive coronary angiography in women and men with stable chest pain and suspected coronary artery disease: multicentre randomised trial [^c5ef6d13]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

Our results corroborate and further extend the findings of previous post-hoc gender specific investigations conducted in the PROMISE, ISCHEMIA, and SCOT-HEART diagnostic strategy trials.In accordance with these investigations, we found that women with chest pain had less obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease and more frequently had normal coronary arteries compared with men. Importantly, the proportion of patients in whom obstructive coronary artery disease was found was similar with either a computed tomography strategy or an invasive coronary angiography strategy, in both women (19.7% and 18.2%) and men (33.5% and 35.3%), suggesting comparable diagnostic accuracy of the two investigations to identify obstructive disease. Interestingly, non-obstructive coronary artery disease was more frequently detected by computed tomography than by invasive coronary angiography, and the frequency of detected non-obstructive disease was similar in women and men. This higher sensitivity of computed tomography to detect non-obstructive coronary artery disease compared with invasive coronary angiography may have important clinical implications in terms of treatment because non-obstructive disease is associated with poorer long term outcome.As recently highlighted by Al-Lamee and colleagues in The BMJ, aggressive risk factor modification with medical therapy in patients with stable coronary artery disease has the greatest effect on the long term risk of myocardial infarction and death.That, in both genders, preventive medical therapy could be improved when guided by computed tomography seems plausible. The frequency of non-diagnostic computed tomography was similar in women and men, ranging from 5% to 6%, in accordance with similar large scale studies using computed tomography scanners with 64 slices and higher.On the other hand, a frequency of non-diagnostic computed tomography of 3.7% was previously reported when exclusively 320 slice computed tomography technology was used, suggesting that the frequency of non-diagnostic computed tomography might be lower if more advanced computed tomography technology was used consistently.

However, the impact of these recommendations on the appropriate selection of patients for the application of these tests remains underexplored in prospective clinical trials. Indeed, while all 3 of the guidelines recognize the limited utility of diagnostic testing in low-risk individuals, each has adopted important differences in approach to defining this cohort. To our knowledge, no prior study has systematically compared the results of the 3 approaches to identify obstructive CAD and clinical outcomes. Thus, we studied the efficiency and safety of the 3 major guidelines for the diagnosis of obstructive CAD in patients with stable chest pain within the context of 2 recent large clinical studies—the North American, PROMISE (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain), and the SCOT-HEART (Scottish Computed Tomography of the Heart) trial.

Chronic stable coronary artery disease (CAD) evaluation—coronary computed tomographic angiography (CTA) facilitates decision making by dividing patients into multiple informative categories. The CAD-RADS categories shown include “CAD-RADS 1 <25% stenosis,” “CAD-RADS 2 25-49% stenosis,” “CAD-RADS 3 50-69% stenosis,” and “CAD-RADS 4A 70-99% stenosis,” with management prompts such as “Risk Factor Control Secondary Prevention Rx,” and for CAD-RADS 3 the figure notes “Consider ICA instead of Functional Testing if appropriate.” This categorization was used in trial design by “excluding patients with <50% diameter.”

In symptomatic patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD), computed tomographic angiography (CTA) improves patient selection for invasive coronary angiography (ICA) compared with functional testing. The impact of measuring fractional flow reserve by CTA (FFRCT) is unknown.

Methods and Results

At 11 sites, 584 patients with new onset chest pain were prospectively assigned to receive either usual testing (n = 287) or CTA/FFR(CT) (n = 297). Test interpretation and care decisions were made by the clinical care team. The primary endpoint was the percentage of those with planned ICA in whom no significant obstructive CAD (no stenosis ≥50% by core laboratory quantitative analysis or invasive FFR < 0.80) was found at ICA within 90 days. Secondary endpoints including death, myocardial infarction, and unplanned revascularization were independently and blindly adjudicated. Subjects averaged 61 ± 11 years of age, 40% were female, and the mean pre-test probability of obstructive CAD was 49 ± 17%. Among those with intended ICA (FFR(CT)-guided = 193; usual care = 187), no obstructive CAD was found at ICA in 24 (12%) in the CTA/FFR(CT) arm and 137 (73%) in the usual care arm (risk difference 61%, 95% confidence interval 53-69, P< 0.0001), with similar mean cumulative radiation exposure (9.9 vs. 9.4 mSv, P = 0.20). Invasive coronary angiography was cancelled in 61% after receiving CTA/FFR(CT) results. Among those with intended non-invasive testing, the rates of finding no obstructive CAD at ICA were 13% (CTA/FFR(CT)) and 6% (usual care; P = 0.95). Clinical event rates within 90 days were low in usual care and CTA/FFR(CT) arms.

Conclusions

Computed tomographic angiography/fractional flow reserve by CTA was a feasible and safe alternative to ICA and was associated with a significantly lower rate of invasive angiography showing no obstructive CAD.

Discussion

Current guidelines recommend that stable chest pain patients be evaluated with non-invasive stress testing, yet the rates of invasive angiograms showing no obstructive CAD remain high. The PLATFORM study showed that, in patients with planned ICA, a diagnostic strategy based on CTA/FFR CT yielded a significantly lower rate of ICA showing no obstructive CAD. In patients with planned non-invasive testing, there was no difference between use of CTA/FFR CT and usual care. Clinical events through 90 days were rare with either strategy.

The goals of the diagnostic evaluation of patients with stable chest pain include identifying those individuals needing catheterization as well as those who cannot benefit, and providing optimal guidance for subsequent care. Two recent trials provide evidence that non-invasive visualization of the coronary arteries using CTA enhances diagnostic certainty and appropriately alters diagnostic and therapeutic plans, with comparable clinical outcomes. However, CTA increased the rate of referral to ICA and revascularization by up to 50%.Because the use of adjunctive invasive measures such as FFR to assess haemodynamic significance was rare, in keeping with current practice,a CTA-only strategy resulted in revascularization with little understanding of the ischaemia-producing potential of coronary lesions, as recommended for appropriate revascularization and optimal outcomes. Our data demonstrate that it is possible to obtain both anatomic and functional information non-invasively, and that doing so reduces the rate of finding no obstructive CAD at catheterization among those with planned ICA.

The low adverse clinical event rate in PLATFORM is similar to recent trials, and indicates that studies of non-invasive testing in a contemporary chest pain population should, in addition to clinical events, consider use of endpoints such as changes in care plans, efficiency of diagnosis, and quality of information guiding care. To this end, the remarkable reduction in the primary endpoint of not finding obstructive CAD at ICA, and the lower overall rate of ICA, coupled with the higher rate of revascularizations informed by haemodynamic significance or ischaemia, suggest that use of CTA/FFR CT more effectively triages patients for invasive procedures than usual care strategies.

The rate of finding no obstructive CAD in our usual care ICA patients was high, but was determined by core laboratory QCA. The corresponding rate using site visual readings was lower (57%), identical to population studies, reporting that 54–62% of elective catheterizations do not have obstructive disease. The higher rate by QCA is consistent with known differences between the two assessment techniques.

### Rationale and design of the prospective longitudinAl trial of FFRCT: outcome and resource IMpacts study [^419547ec]. American Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Fractional flow reserve (FFR) measured by coronary computed tomography angiography (FFRCT) has been validated against invasive FFR. However, there are no data on how the use of FFRCT affects patient care and outcomes. The aim of this study is to compare standard practice guided by usual care testing to FFRCT-guided management in symptomatic subjects with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD).

Methods

In this prospective nonrandomized trial, symptomatic patients with suspected CAD will be enrolled in 2 consecutive cohorts: a usual care-guided pathway (cohort 1) and an FFRCT-guided pathway (cohort 2). Each cohort is divided into 2 groups according to whether noninvasive or invasive diagnostic testing was planned before enrollment. In all subjects, the patient's clinical team will review all diagnostic test results and determine a treatment strategy. A total sample size of 580 subjects will be enrolled and followed up for 12 months.

Results

The primary end point is the comparison of the percentage of patients with planned invasive testing who have a catheterization (invasive coronary angiography) within 90 days from initial assessment, which does not show a significant stenosis (defined as coronary artery stenosis >50% or invasive FFR ≤0.80). Secondary end points include the rate of invasive coronary angiography without obstructive CAD in those with planned noninvasive testing and, in all groups, noninferiority of resource use, quality of life, medical radiation exposure, and major adverse cardiac events up to 365 days of follow-up.

Conclusions

The study compares clinical and economic outcomes based on diagnostic evaluation using FFRCT with that based on standard diagnostic strategies.

### An FFRdiagnostic strategy versus usual care in patients with suspected coronary artery disease planned for invasive coronary angiography at German sites: one-year results of a subgroup analysis of the PLATFORM (prospective longitudinal trial of FFR: outcome and resource impacts) study [^b6c72c83]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Stable chest pain is a common clinical presentation, often warranting further evaluation by non-invasive or invasive means.A considerable proportion of patients require invasive coronary angiography (ICA) for definitive assessment, which has inherent risks and economic costs. Coronary CT angiography (CTA) may improve the efficiency of triage to ICA and potentially reduce radiation exposure.However, this may come at a price of increased rates of coronary angiography and revascularisation compared with a strategy of non-invasive testing.

CTA is limited by the provision of an exclusively anatomical assessment of the coronary vasculature. CT-derived fractional flow reserve (FFR CT) may address this shortcoming by providing functional information obtained by non-invasive means in addition to the anatomical information provided by coronary CTA.Indeed, a number of trials have validated its use against invasive FFR.The PLATFORM (Prospective Longitudinal Trial of FFR CT : Outcome and Resource Impacts) study, which enrolled patients at 11 centres across 6 European countries, showed that coronary CTA/FFR CT, when used as an alternative initial diagnostic strategy in patients planned for invasive catheterisation, was associated with a significantly lower rate of angiography showing no obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) within 90 days,with no difference in clinical outcomes or quality of life (QOL) at 1 year.Furthermore, a resource use and cost analysis performed at 90 days and 1 year showed that an FFR CT strategy was associated with reduced resource use and lower cost than an initial invasive strategy.

In patients with suspected CAD, diagnostic evaluation practices may differ from country to country. Specifically, in the German healthcare system, a higher rate of coronary angiography is observed in comparison with other European countries or the USA.Moreover, it has been suggested that the associated healthcare costs and reimbursement models may favour a more invasive approach to the evaluation of chest pain.Against this background, the aim of this study is to compare an initial CTA/FFR CT versus an ICA strategy in patients enrolled in the PLATFORM study at German sites, who were planned for ICA for investigation of chest pain, in terms of clinical efficacy and safety, resource use, cost and QOL.

### Outcomes of non-invasive diagnostic modalities for the detection of coronary artery disease: network meta-analysis of diagnostic randomised controlled trials [^fe2646f3]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Chest pain is a leading cause for physician consultation that leads to several million office and emergency department visits as well as hospital admissions yearly.Despite the use of clinical decision rulesand the improved sensitivity of cardiac biomarkers,many patients who are admitted to the emergency department in order to exclude an acute coronary syndrome are ultimately found not to have a cardiac cause of their symptoms. Conversely, patients with symptoms who undergo cardiac investigations because of chest pain and are diagnosed with non-cardiac causes or in whom the cause of chest pain remains undetermined are at increased risk of subsequent cardiovascular events and death.

Guidelines published in 2012 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association recommended the use of functional testing, mainly on the basis of evidence derived from studies of diagnostic accuracy (because the vast majority of diagnostic randomised trials were published after these guidelines).However, recent audits in large numbers of patients showed only a modest effect on subsequent diagnostic findings.Currently, functional and anatomical non-invasive tests are widely available and used according to locally available resources and expertise (box): exercise electrocardiograms, single photon emission computed tomography (CT)-myocardial perfusion imaging, stress echocardiography, real time myocardial contrast echocardiography, coronary CT angiography, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance. Among these, coronary CT angiography as the only non-invasive anatomical diagnostic modality has been suggested to overcome limitations of traditional functional testing and has undergone close scrutiny in recent years.So far, diagnostic randomised controlled trials do not provide conclusive evidence as to whether a non-invasive anatomical or functional testing strategy gives the best results for subsequent downstream testing or clinical outcomes. Therefore, we summarised the available evidence and evaluated clinical endpoints of different non-invasive diagnostic modalities in patients with symptoms suggestive of coronary artery disease through network meta-analysis.

Comparison with literature

Our findings are in line with the results of the CONSERVE trial, which compared CT with a direct referral strategy using ICA as index test for patients with stable chest pain but suspected CAD. In that trial, the investigators found that using CT as the initial test reduced total cost by 57% compared with ICA at 1-year follow-up. However, the investigators only analysed the cost of invasive and non-invasive testing, while they did not include medication or hospitalisation cost at follow-up and did not evaluate EQ-5D-3L for a full CUA. Also, in the CAT-CAD trial, the use of CT as the initial diagnostic test in stable patients with an indication for ICA led to a significant cost reduction. The trial demonstrated a 63% decrease in the cost associated with diagnosing CAD and a 55% reduction in the combined cost of diagnosis and treatment during the 90-day follow-up period. We identified no other studies that specifically analysed the cost of CT and ICA in patients with suspected CAD.

Several randomised trials have compared the cost of CT with different comparators, such as standard care [,,–], functional testing, or myocardial perfusion single-photon emission CT in patients with stable chest pain or suspected CAD. In almost all the trials, CT was less expensive [–,,,–] or had the same cost as the comparator. Only in the RAPID-CTCA trial, which compared the use of early CT in addition to standard care with standard care alone in patients with suspected or provisionally diagnosed acute coronary syndrome, were the costs of CT higher than those of standard care alone. The investigators attributed the higher cost in the CT group to the inclusion of patients from the emergency department and the additional use of CT, which resulted in longer hospital stays and additional CT scans. More detailed information on the trials can be found in Supplementary Table S 6.

### Angina: contemporary diagnosis and management [^75c33f3b]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

These results should be considered in relation to design limitations of this trial. There was no control procedure (test vs no test), the threshold for prescribing preventive therapy with statins was 20%–30% likelihood of a CHD event in 10 years (much higher than many contemporary healthcare systems), CTCA was performed on top of treadmill exercise testing which has poor test accuracy in distinct patient groups, notably women, and the procedures were unblinded and open-label. Outcome reporting that is narrowly focused on CHD does not take account of other cardiovascular events, such as hospitalisation for arrhythmias and heart failure, which have implications for quality of life. In PROMISE, a ‘head-to-head’ trial of CTCA versus functional testing, there were no differences in health outcomes.In the interests of providing patients and clinicians with a reliable and accurate test result, a strategy based on anatomical CTCA has fundamental limitations. SCOT-HEART identified that obstructive CAD affects the minority (one in four) patients presenting to the Chest Pain Clinic with known or suspected angina. This means that an anatomical test strategy with CTCA leaving the aetiology and treatment unexplained in the majority of affected patients, which becomes all the more relevant considering that anginal symptoms and quality of life are worse when CTCA is used.Diagnostic options are enhanced by advances in technology and tests for the functional significance of CAD are now feasible, but at significant cost.NICE guidelines state that HeartFlow FFR CT should be considered as an ‘option for patients with stable, recent onset chest pain who are offered CCTA as part of the NICE pathway on chest pain’. Using HeartFlow FFR CT may avoid the need for invasive coronary angiography and revascularisation; however, major randomised controlled trials are ongoing (eg, FORECAST study NCT03187639).

We support efforts to provide a definitive diagnosis for patients with ongoing angina symptoms after a ‘negative’ CTCA, initially using non-invasive ischaemia testing. Notably, the recent International Standardised Criteria for diagnosing ‘suspected’ MVA would be met in patients with symptoms of myocardial ischaemia, no obstructive CAD and objective evidence of myocardial ischaemia (table 1). Invasive testing for diagnosis of MVA could be reserved for subjects with refractory symptoms and negative ischaemia testing or diagnostic uncertainty. The criteria for ‘definite MVA’ require the above AND objective evidence of microvascular dysfunction (eg, reduced CFR or raised microvascular resistance).

### Clinical outcomes of fractional flow reserve by computed tomographic angiography-guided diagnostic strategies vs. usual care in patients with suspected coronary artery disease: the prospective longitudinal trial of FFR (CT): outcome and resource impacts study [^08c667da]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Although FFR CT is a relatively new technique, PLATFORM demonstrates that it is feasible and safe in busy clinical settings. Overall, 90% of CTAs had acceptable image quality for analysis, and radiation averaged 5.2 ± 5.4 mSv, less than the average level of 14 mSv noted in the literature for nuclear stress testing.Use of FFR CT improved the availability of functional data available in those referred to ICA (96% CTA/FFR CT vs. 45% usual care), and those referred to revascularization (95% CTA/FFR CT vs. 55% usual care), allowing compliance with current recommendations supporting use of both anatomic and functional data in decision-making.While still high, the rate of revascularization performed without functional data in usual care patients is improved from previous reports of 55%.

PLATFORM adds substantially to both the PROMISE and SCOT-HEART trials. Compared with PROMISE, the addition of FFR CT functional information in PLATFORM to the anatomic CTA information prevented the reported ∼50% increase in catheterizations and revascularizations. PLATFORM builds on SCOT-HEART's finding of increased diagnostic certainty with CTA by noting cancellation of ICA in 61% of the CTA/FFR CT arm and a dramatically lower rate of finding no obstructive CAD. Like these studies, PLATFORM provides prospective data essential to evaluating and optimizing the role of non-invasive testing as a gatekeeper to catheterization.

While PLATFORM has many strengths, it is important to note that the sample size and follow-up duration are insufficient to detect an impact on clinical outcomes. Although not randomized, PLATFORM differs substantially from most observational studies by requiring a carefully controlled ‘experimental’ intervention in the CTA/FFR CT groups, and core lab angiographic reading. The study's rigour is further enhanced by basing all analyses on the prospective allocation of patients into cohorts regardless of actual care. Use of an initial roll-in group of usual care ‘control’ patients provided a detailed, real-time snapshot of contemporaneous practice at enrolling centres, rather than using historical controls. Even in a randomized trial it would have been impossible to blind investigators to the results of testing since they are needed for clinicians to determine downstream care. Further, the current approach reflects clinical research trends favouring pragmatic design and effectiveness (vs. efficacy) evaluations. The multiple sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint, yielding similar results, document that our findings are robust and free of significant verification bias.

### Fractional flow reserve derived from computed tomography coronary angiography in the assessment and management of stable chest pain: the FORECAST randomized trial [^48962cf2]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

A second limitation of the trial is that the costs in this study were based on UK National Health Service cost tariffs, and may not be generalizable to other countries with different cost structures in their health delivery systems. In an attempt to address this, one pre-specified sensitivity analysis for this trial is to apply US-specific cost tariffs to the FORECAST data, and this is the subject of ongoing analysis. Third, we used cardiac costs, rather than total medical costs, as the primary endpoint. Cardiac costs are more likely to be affected by the alternative strategies and were simpler for the local research teams to document. While it seems unlikely that non-cardiac costs would be affected by the management strategies tested, we cannot exclude the possibility that total medical costs differed, even though the cardiac costs did not.

The significant reduction in death from coronary heart disease and non-fatal MI seen at 5 years in the SCOT-HEART trialin the cohort undergoing CTCA, compared with routine care alone, indicates that there is considerable prognostic benefit from identifying coronary atheroma and initiating optimal medical therapy based on CTCA findings. Indeed, the results of FORECAST raise an important question that the trial cannot answer: namely, what is the optimal use of FFR CT in routine clinical practice when CTCA is the default approach? In light of the findings from SCOT-HEARTand ISCHEMIA,one could speculate that, rather than using FFR CT based on the burden of atheroma found on CTCA, FFR CT analysis could be reserved only for patients with insufficient symptomatic response to optimal medical therapy in whom revascularization is therefore being considered. This approach would be consistent with a sub-analysis of the PROMISE trialthat demonstrated the value of describing degrees of coronary atheroma by CTCA in patients presenting with suspected angina, even in the absence of any functional testing for ischaemia, for predicting the primary endpoint of death, MI, and hospitalization for unstable angina. This suggests that the optimal application of FFR CT in the setting of stable symptoms may be after optimal medical therapy fails to control angina adequately, at which time FFR CT could be performed using the previously collected CTCA dataset, and thereby assess the need for revascularization as part of a shared decision-making process with the patient.
