## Question

Antibiotics if no known source

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage suspected infection when the source is unknown, including when to start antibiotics, how to choose empiric therapy, how long to treat, and when to stop if no source is identified. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate risk stratification by severity and likelihood of infection. Then, I should verify the timing thresholds for antibiotic initiation in septic shock versus non-shock states. Next, I will consider empiric regimen selection based on likely sources and local resistance patterns. After that, I need to ensure diagnostic workup and source control are prioritized. Then, I will review duration guidance and biomarker-driven discontinuation strategies. Finally, I should confirm a daily reassessment and de-escalation plan, and address special populations and stewardship guardrails to minimize harm from overtreatment.

> Let me first confirm the risk stratification framework, because everything hinges on this. I need to check for septic shock or high-likelihood sepsis with organ dysfunction, in which case immediate broad-spectrum antibiotics are indicated, ideally within 1 hour of recognition, given the strong association between delay and mortality in shock states [^114t5iXv] [^113qkY3D]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — if the patient is hemodynamically stable and the probability of infection is low to moderate, a short delay to obtain cultures and clarify the diagnosis is acceptable and may reduce unnecessary antibiotic exposure, especially when cultures are negative and no source is found [^116u9zSX] [^114t5iXv].

> Wait, let me verify the timing nuance because this is often misunderstood. The classic "each hour of delay increases mortality by ~7–8%" signal is strongest in septic shock and diminishes in sepsis without shock; moreover, some contemporary data suggest that very early antibiotics in all-comers may not uniformly improve outcomes and can worsen overtreatment, so I should align urgency with severity and pretest probability rather than a rigid clock for everyone [^113qkY3D] [^116tRBaf]. I should double-check that current guidance still supports a 1-hour target for shock while allowing diagnostic clarification within a few hours for stable patients with uncertain infection, which it does [^114t5iXv] [^116u9zSX].

> Next, I should review empiric regimen selection when the source is unknown. Let me think about likely sources based on epidemiology and patient factors: pneumonia, urinary tract, intra-abdominal, skin/soft tissue, device-related bacteremia, and CNS infections should be considered, and empiric therapy should cover the most plausible pathogens while planning to narrow once data return [^111W8GHj]. I need to ensure local antibiograms guide choices and that I avoid reflexive overtreatment; for example, in community-onset sepsis, resistant organisms are isolated in a minority, yet broad-spectrum agents are frequently used, which exposes patients to harm without benefit when resistance is absent [^112qjbSN] [^117MHk7w]. But wait, what if the patient has recent healthcare exposure, prior resistant colonization, or is immunocompromised? In those cases, broader coverage, including MRSA and antipseudomonal agents, is reasonable until cultures clarify the pathogen [^111W8GHj] [^111BShZ2].

> I will now examine source identification and control, because antibiotics alone will fail without it. I should confirm that early imaging and targeted procedures are pursued in parallel with resuscitation and antibiotics when shock is present, and within a reasonable window for stable patients to avoid missing drainable foci or device-related sources [^114ou8Vs] [^11677EbB]. Hold on, I should verify that this principle is consistent across surgical and critical care pathways; indeed, multiple guidelines emphasize that source control is decisive for outcomes and that persistent fever or failure should trigger re-imaging and reconsideration of missed sources rather than simply extending antibiotics [^111YjBji] [^113r1wAa].

> Let me consider duration next, and I need to ensure I do not default to prolonged therapy when shorter is sufficient. For most serious infections with adequate source control, 5–8 days is adequate, with shorter fixed courses supported in intra-abdominal infection and uncomplicated bacteremia, and longer durations reserved for slow response, inadequate source control, or specific pathogens like Staphylococcus aureus with complications [^1122xiuH] [^1126W7ep] [^111BShZ2]. I should double-check that contemporary surgical guidance aligns with 4 days after source control for complicated intra-abdominal infection, which it does, reinforcing the principle that duration should be anchored to source control and clinical response rather than arbitrary long courses [^111znV5x].

> Next, I should review how to handle the scenario of no identified source and negative cultures. If the patient is clinically improving, I need to ensure antibiotics are stopped and alternative diagnoses are pursued; if the patient is not improving, I should verify that we have not missed a source, repeated cultures or used molecular diagnostics, and considered noninfectious mimics before escalating or extending therapy [^notfound] [^116EhSku]. Hold on, I should verify that biomarkers can help here; procalcitonin-guided strategies, when combined with clinical assessment, can safely reduce antibiotic exposure and may improve mortality in sepsis with adequate source control, supporting earlier discontinuation when the trajectory is favorable [^114t5iXv] [^114rvATp].

> I need to ensure a daily reassessment and de-escalation plan is explicit. Every day, I should confirm whether new data justify narrowing or stopping antibiotics, document the rationale for continuation, and avoid therapeutic inertia; stewardship programs and ID consultation improve adherence to de-escalation and shorten duration without harming outcomes [^114NZQDr] [^1168JygD]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said "never escalate without new data", but I should correct that — if the patient deteriorates or new risk factors emerge, escalation can be appropriate, but it should be deliberate and tied to evolving clinical and microbiologic information rather than reflexive broadening [^111W8GHj].

> Let me consider special populations where thresholds shift. In neutropenia or cellular immunotherapies like CAR T-cell therapy, I should have a lower threshold for empiric broad-spectrum therapy and a high index of suspicion for early bacterial infection, with early ID input and planned de-escalation if infection is not confirmed [^116qXt8Z]. For periprosthetic joint infection, I should confirm that holding antibiotics for at least two weeks prior to obtaining intra-articular cultures improves diagnostic yield when infection is suspected, balancing this against sepsis risk if the patient is unstable [^115EAKMz]. In pediatrics, I need to check age-specific pathways for fever without source and ensure that unnecessary antibiotics are avoided when viral etiologies are likely and the child is low risk [^117EcqxT] [^114t5iXv].

> I should confirm that our approach aligns with antimicrobial stewardship principles to mitigate collateral damage. Unnecessary antibiotics drive C. difficile, resistant organisms, adverse drug events, and microbiome disruption, so every day of avoided exposure matters; this is especially true when the pretest probability of resistant infection is low or when cultures are negative and the patient is improving [^117QxEZQ] [^115EG4mJ]. Hold on, I should verify that real-world data show overtreatment is common in suspected sepsis — yes, broad-spectrum use is frequent while resistant organisms are uncommon in community-onset sepsis, underscoring the need for tighter stewardship at the bedside [^112qjbSN].

> Putting this together, my final algorithm is as follows, and I should double-check each step against guidelines before acting: if septic shock or high-likelihood sepsis with organ dysfunction is present, start broad-spectrum antibiotics within 1 hour, obtain cultures, pursue urgent source control, and plan to narrow or stop within days as data return; if sepsis without shock is suspected, allow a short diagnostic window to clarify the source and likelihood of infection, starting antibiotics if concern persists or the patient deteriorates; if no source is identified and the patient is stable and improving, discontinue antibiotics and broaden the noninfectious workup; if the patient is not improving, repeat cultures, re-image for missed sources, and reconsider the diagnosis before escalating therapy; throughout, use the shortest effective duration with source control, consider PCT to guide discontinuation, and reassess daily for de-escalation opportunities [^114t5iXv] [^114NZQDr] [^117AzBSU].

In general, **do not start antibiotics** if there is no identified source of infection, the patient is hemodynamically stable, and there is no immunocompromise or high-risk features [^116u9zSX]. Antibiotics should be reserved for patients with **septic shock** [^113JyKUf], **high-risk immunocompromised states** [^116qXt8Z], or when a bacterial infection is strongly suspected and diagnostic workup is underway. If antibiotics are started empirically, they should be **stopped within 24–48 hours** if no source is identified and the patient is clinically stable [^116PSdkr]. This approach minimizes harm from unnecessary antibiotics, including resistance, adverse effects, and microbiome disruption [^117QxEZQ] [^112x2xqo].

## Clinical scenarios where antibiotics may be considered without a known source

While the general principle is to avoid antibiotics without a confirmed source, certain clinical scenarios may warrant empiric antibiotic therapy:

- **Septic shock or severe sepsis**: Immediate broad-spectrum antibiotics are indicated due to the high risk of mortality associated with delayed treatment [^113qkY3D] [^117AzBSU].

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Patients with neutropenia, active malignancy, or immunosuppressive therapy may require empiric antibiotics due to the risk of rapid clinical deterioration [^116qXt8Z].

- **High-risk clinical features**: Persistent fever, elevated inflammatory markers, or clinical instability may prompt empiric therapy while diagnostic workup continues [^117AzBSU].

---

## Risks associated with unnecessary antibiotic use

Initiating antibiotics without a confirmed source carries **significant risks**:

- **Antimicrobial resistance**: Unnecessary antibiotic exposure drives resistance, complicating future infections [^116PSdkr] [^117PcCKP].

- **Adverse drug reactions**: Antibiotics can cause allergic reactions, nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and other adverse effects [^114d7ULn].

- **Microbiome disruption**: Antibiotics can disrupt the normal microbiota, increasing the risk of secondary infections such as Clostridioides difficile [^117QxEZQ].

- **Increased healthcare costs**: Unnecessary antibiotic use increases healthcare expenditures and resource utilization [^115kkPFN].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **judicious antibiotic use** and provide clear recommendations:

- **Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) 2021**: Recommends immediate antibiotics for septic shock or high likelihood of infection, but allows a short delay in stable patients without shock to obtain cultures and clarify the diagnosis [^114t5iXv] [^116u9zSX].

- **Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)**: Recommends stopping antibiotics within 24–48 hours if no source is identified and the patient is clinically stable [^notfound].

- **American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) 2024**: Recommends against prophylactic antibiotics in severe acute pancreatitis without infection, emphasizing the importance of identifying a source before initiating antibiotics [^113JazSM].

---

## Diagnostic strategies to identify the source of infection

Before initiating antibiotics, clinicians should employ **diagnostic strategies** to identify the source:

- **Clinical evaluation**: Thorough history, physical examination, and review of systems to identify potential sources of infection [^11677EbB].

- **Laboratory tests**: Complete blood count, inflammatory markers (CRP, procalcitonin), blood cultures, urinalysis, and cultures as indicated [^notfound].

- **Imaging studies**: Chest radiography, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to localize infection sources [^117EcqxT].

- **Specialized tests**: Lumbar puncture, joint aspiration, or other invasive procedures as clinically indicated [^115EAKMz].

---

## Clinical outcomes of withholding antibiotics without a known source

Withholding antibiotics in stable patients without a known source is **generally safe** and associated with positive outcomes:

- **Reduced antibiotic resistance**: Limiting unnecessary antibiotic use reduces resistance rates [^115kkPFN].

- **Fewer adverse effects**: Patients experience fewer antibiotic-related adverse events [^115kkPFN].

- **Lower healthcare costs**: Reduced unnecessary antibiotic use lowers healthcare expenditures [^115kkPFN].

- **No significant increase in mortality**: Studies have shown no significant increase in mortality when antibiotics are withheld in stable patients without a confirmed source of infection [^114t5iXv].

---

## Clinical outcomes of initiating antibiotics without a known source

Initiating antibiotics without a known source can lead to **negative outcomes**:

- **Increased antimicrobial resistance**: Unnecessary antibiotic exposure drives resistance, complicating future infections [^117PcCKP].

- **Adverse drug reactions**: Patients are at increased risk of antibiotic-related adverse effects [^115EG4mJ].

- **Microbiome disruption**: Antibiotics can disrupt normal microbiota, increasing the risk of secondary infections [^117QxEZQ].

- **Increased healthcare costs**: Unnecessary antibiotic use increases healthcare expenditures [^115kkPFN].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

In summary, **antibiotics should not be initiated without a known source of infection** unless the patient is in septic shock, is immunocompromised, or has high-risk features. If antibiotics are started empirically, they should be stopped within 24–48 hours if no source is identified and the patient is clinically stable. This approach balances the risks and benefits of antibiotic therapy, minimizes harm, and aligns with current clinical guidelines [^114t5iXv] [^116PSdkr].

### The use of long-term antibiotics for suppression of bacterial infections [^112x2xqo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Suppressive antibiotic therapy is prescribed when a patient has an infection that is presumed to be incurable by a defined course of therapy or source control. The cohort receiving suppressive antibiotic therapy is typically highly comorbid and the infections often involve retained prosthetic material. In part due to a lack of clear guidelines regarding the use of suppressive antibiotics, and in part due to the complex nature of the infections in question, patients are often prescribed suppressive antibiotics for extremely long, if not indefinite, courses. The risks of prolonged antibiotic exposure in this context are not fully characterized, but they include adverse drug effects ranging from mild to severe, the development of antibiotic-resistant organisms, and perturbations of the gastrointestinal microbiome. In this narrative review we present the available evidence for the use of suppressive antibiotic therapy in 4 common indications, examine the gaps in the current literature, and explore the known and potential risks of this therapy. We also make suggestions for improving the quality of evidence in future studies, particularly by highlighting the need for a standardized term to describe the use of long courses of antibiotics to suppress hard-to-treat infections.

### Short-course antibiotics for common infections: what do we know and where do we go from here? [^116rgAo8]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Over the past 25 years, researchers have performed > 120 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) illustrating short courses to be non-inferior to long courses of antibiotics for common bacterial infections.

Objective

We sought to determine whether clinical data from RCTs affirm the mantra of 'shorter is better' for antibiotic durations in 7 common infections: pneumonia, urinary tract infection, intra-abdominal infection, bacteraemia, skin and soft tissue infection, bone and joint infections, pharyngitis and sinusitis.

Sources

Published RCTs comparing short- versus long-course antibiotic durations were identified through searches of PubMed and clinical guideline documents.

Content

Short-course antibiotic durations consistently result in similar treatment success rates as longer antibiotic courses among patients with community-acquired pneumonia, complicated urinary tract infections in women, gram-negative bacteraemia, and skin and soft tissue infections when the diagnosis is confirmed, appropriate antimicrobials are used, and patients show clinical signs of improvement. For patients with osteomyelitis, 6 weeks of antibiotics is adequate for the treatment of osteomyelitis in the absence of implanted foreign bodies and surgical debridement. Whether durations can be further shortened with debridement is unclear, although small studies are promising.

Implications

With few exceptions, short courses were non-inferior to long courses; future research should focus on appropriately defining the patient population, ensuring the correct choice and dose of antimicrobials and developing meaningful outcomes relevant for frontline clinicians.

### Prophylactic antibiotics and prevention of surgical site infections [^117Dd14N]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Healthcare-associated infections present a significant source of preventable morbidity and mortality. More than 30% of all healthcare-associated infections are represented by surgical site infections, making them the most common subtype. Studies suggest that 40% to 60% of these infections are preventable, yet many hospitals have yet to implement evidence-based best practices. This article reviews the impact of surgical site infections, describes their measurement and reporting, and most importantly provides perioperative strategies for their prevention with a focus on the appropriate use of prophylactic antibiotics.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^115tq8DD]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Antimicrobials

The 2016 guidelines recommend administering empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobials that cover all likely pathogens, including bacteria and potentially viruses/fungi (depending on the risk factors of the patient). The initial empiric antibiotic regimen for patients in septic shock should include at least two antibiotics from different classes (combination therapy) directed toward the most likely pathogens. Treatment should be narrowed once the pathogen and its antimicrobial sensitivities are ascertained or when the patient demonstrates clinical improvement. However, patients with bacteremia, neutropenic sepsis or sepsis without shock do not require combination antibiotic therapy. This is a notable difference from the 2012 recommendation that neutropenic sepsis be treated with empiric combination antimicrobials. The authors note, however, that these recommendations do not preclude the use of multiple antibiotics if the goal is to expand the spectrum of pathogens covered.

With respect to antibiotic duration, combination therapy (either empiric or targets) in patients with septic shock should be de-escalated to monotherapy within a few days if clinical improvement or with evidence of infection resolution. This is slightly different than the 2012 guidelines, which recommend that no more than 3–5 days of empiric combination therapy and de-escalation as soon as the responsible organism and susceptibilities are known. Total treatment duration should be 7–10 days for infections with sepsis or septic shock; however, some patients may warrant a prolonged course if they respond slowly to treatment, do not have source control, have bacteremia with Staphylococcus aureus or have immunological deficiencies or fungal/viral infections.

One new recommendation in 2016 is that shorter antibiotic courses are indicated in patients whose sepsis resolves rapidly after source previously, the 2016 authors recommend daily assessments for potential de-escalation of antimicrobials. Failure to normalize procalcitonin levels has recently been shown in a prospective multicenter study to be a significant predictor of mortality. For those who initially appear septic, but do not subsequently have clinical evidence of infection, it can also be used to shorten or discontinue antimicrobial therapy. It is important to note that blood cultures can be negative in up to one-third of all patients suffering from sepsis. Lastly, the campaign does not recommend prophylactic antibiotics for non-infectious inflammatory states such as burns or severe pancreatitis.

### Ten golden rules for optimal antibiotic use in hospital settings: the WARNING call to action [^114TVReZ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic therapy of up to 21 days for VAP and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) was used historically until several prospective studies demonstrated the effectiveness of shorter (7–8 days) therapy with no differences in mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, mechanical ventilation-free days or organ failure-free days. The 2017 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) guidelines and the 2016 IDSA guidelines both recommend 7 days of therapy for HAP/VAP. Ongoing studies are determining if therapy duration could be reduced further.

Bacteremia caused by Enterobacterales has been treated traditionally with 2 weeks of antibiotics. Recent RCTs and meta-analyses investigating shorter (7–8 days) versus longer antibiotic courses (14–15 days) in patients with gram-negative bacteremia (mostly of urinary tract origin) demonstrate non-inferiority. Regarding acute uncomplicated cellulitis, evidence also suggests that prolonged courses may be unnecessary and that 5 days of treatment may be sufficient. IDSA guidelines recommend a 5-day antibiotic therapy duration for uncomplicated cellulitis, but may be extended if the infection has not improved within that time frame.

Generally, in critically ill patients, decisions about antibiotic therapy duration should be individualized, taking into account patient parameters such as severity of illness, the site and type of infection, whether source control has been achieved, whether PK has been optimized, and clinical response. Procalcitonin (PCT) may be useful to guide antibiotic therapy in the ICU. PCT-guided treatment can reduce the duration of therapy and length of hospital stay in adult critically ill patients with sepsis. Based on apparent benefit and no obvious undesirable effects, the 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines suggest using PCT along with a clinical evaluation to decide when to discontinue antibiotics in adults with an initial diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and adequate source control, if the optimal duration of therapy is unclear and if PCT is available.

### Ten golden rules for optimal antibiotic use in hospital settings: the WARNING call to action [^114t5iXv]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Assessing the severity of infection is a crucial step in evaluating patients for antimicrobial therapy. Early implementation of appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy has a significant favorable impact on outcomes of septic shock, independent of infection site. Whereas critically ill patients benefit from early antibiotic therapy, clinicians managing less severely ill patients may have time to consider carefully and determine the appropriate antibiotic treatment before initiating therapy. Delayed antibiotic prescription, using a wait-and-see approach with reevaluation of the patient, has been reported as a useful tactic to help reduce antibiotic use, particularly for respiratory tract infections. However, some data suggest that hasty antibiotic therapy may be harmful for critically ill surgical patients, where the adequacy of source control is the crucial determinant of survival. A before-after trial compared universal early antibiotic therapy (aggressive approach) to a second period where immediate antibiotic therapy was given only in hypotensive patients. At the same time, other patients underwent therapy only after microbiological confirmation of infection (conservative approach). The aggressive approach was associated with a lower time interval from fever onset and blood culture collection to the start of treatment. The conservative approach was associated with more likely initial appropriate therapy, a shorter duration of therapy, and lower mortality. This differentiation of infection from inflammation can be challenging, especially in critically ill patients, wherein only about one-half of suspected infections are proven. Delaying antibiotics to investigate the cause of sepsis may be of benefit to patients without shock.

Delayed antibiotic prescription is especially useful to help reduce antibiotic use, especially for community-acquired respiratory tract infections, many of which have a viral etiology. In a meta-analysis, delayed prescription compared with no antibiotics was associated with similar symptom duration; withholding antibiotics pending pathogen identification and susceptibility testing may be acceptable to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use for viral respiratory tract infections.

By contrast, for patients (both adults and children) with sepsis-related shock and organ dysfunction, delay of appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy can be deleterious; early initiation of antibiotics is crucial for good outcomes. There is a strong correlation between each hour of delay in antibiotic initiation and mortality rates for patients with septic shock. The 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines recommend that adults with possible septic shock or probable sepsis should receive antibiotics as soon as possible, ideally within 1 h from symptom onset. For adults with possible sepsis without shock, a rapid assessment for the likelihood of infectious vs. non-infectious causes of acute illness should be conducted, and antimicrobial agents should be administered within 3 h from the time sepsis was first recognized.

### Optimal antibiotic use in the intensive care unit [^114HuMxU]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, empiric antibiotic therapy in critically ill patients suspected of having sepsis remains a challenging decision. Patients with septic shock should promptly receive broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting likely bacteria such as MRSA and resistant GNB based on patient characteristics and local resistance rates. However, threshold rates for empiric antibiotic coverage of specific pathogen types are not currently supported by research. Nevertheless, at our institution for potentially life-threatening infections such as bacteremia and septic shock we recommend empiric coverage if the likely threshold rate is greater than ten percent. Another important issue influencing antibiotic selection and efficacy is source control which is beyond the scope of this review. Yet, we suggest that source control can be a decisive factor influencing patient outcomes with some infections (UTI, IAI, SSTI, etc.) and that clinicians need to always address this issue when dealing with infections in the CU setting. When patients present with severe sepsis, nearing septic shock, accelerated antibiotic administration may also be warranted. Overall, all infected patients likely benefit from antibiotic treatment regardless of the severity of presentation and harm arises when patients without infections receive antibiotics. Future AI/ML methods and rapid diagnostics that increase the pretest probability of infection and differentiate sepsis from mimics have the potential to greatly improve outcomes in all patients.

### It's not just the antibiotics, it's the treatment [^1167uYXv]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Should these findings have been surprising? We think not. The author's cite a meta-analysis by Barochia and colleagues that suggests that timely administration of antimicrobials is associated with improved survival. However, this finding was only significant after removing the effects from Rivers and colleagues' study on early goal-directed therapy. Another meta-analysis conducted on studies of outpatient respiratory infections found no difference between immediate or delayed antibiotic therapy. Puskarich and colleagues demonstrated that, in the setting of appropriate resuscitation, the timing of antimicrobial therapy appears to have little effect on mortality. Similarly, Hranjec and colleagues found that, assuming resuscitation and source control occur in a timely manner, intentionally withholding antimicrobial therapy until infection can be objectively proven to result in improved patient outcomes compared with early and aggressive initiation. These studies focused on emergency department and ICU management, respectively. Bloos and colleagues' study confirms the findings of Hranjec and colleagues and Puskarich and colleagues, while spanning the entire spectrum of hospitalization.

This trial also suffers from the most common deficit in most studies of timing of antimicrobial therapy in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock: the lack of a proper control group. The question faced by the clinician is not whether a patient with proven infection should have the rapid initiation of antimicrobials, but whether a patient who might be infected should receive therapy. Missing in this study is the group of patients who received antimicrobials for suspected infection but were not infected, and what the consequences of this unnecessary exposure to antibiotics were. However, the data are reassuring to us who believe that it is prudent to wait until there is objective microbiological data to support the diagnosis of infection before initiating therapy. Even among these patients with significant disease, the exact timing of antimicrobial therapy did not appear to be the main driver of outcomes.

### Knowledge, awareness, and attitude towards infection prevention and management among surgeons: identifying the surgeon champion [^111AjuS4]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Antibiotic therapy is an additional key component of daily surgical practice. Antibiotics are life-saving when treating bacterial infections but are often used inappropriately, specifically when not indicated. Antibiotic therapy plays an integral role in the management of surgical infections, especially in critically ill patients who require immediate empiric antibiotic therapy. Poor antibiotic coverage and inappropriate regimens are the variables most strongly associated with unfavorable outcomes. The timing, regimen, dose, route of administration, and duration of antibiotic therapy should be always optimized. In most patients with surgical infections, antibiotic therapy aims to treat any residual infection after adequate source control. In these patients, prolonging antibiotic treatment, which can lead to antibiotic resistance, does not prevent the persistence or recurrence of the infection. When source control is obtained, the duration of antibiotic therapy should be shortened as much as possible, unless there are special circumstances that require prolonging antimicrobial therapy, such as signs of an ongoing infection. Patients who have systemic signs of sepsis beyond 5 to 7 days of treatment warrant diagnostic investigation to determine an ongoing uncontrolled source of infection needing intervention. In Appendix 2, ten strategies for correct antibiotic therapy are illustrated.

### It's not just the antibiotics, it's the treatment [^112KSqzp]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

At its core, the narrow-focused debate surrounding the timing of antimicrobial therapy is inherently flawed. The appropriate treatment of the septic patient requires a rapid multimodal response including fluid resuscitation, source control, and pressors (if required). Antimicrobials are only one part of this equation. In cases of life threatening septic shock, broad-spectrum empiric therapy should be initiated as soon as possible. However, the harmful effects of inappropriate antimicrobials should be mitigated, whenever possible, by using culture-guided therapy and delayed initiation. In all cases, resuscitation and source control should be the highest priority. Bloos and colleagues' study is a reminder that antimicrobials, while important, are not the only tools in our arsenal against infectious disease.

### Source identification and source control [^11677EbB]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Identifying sources of infection and establishing source control is an essential component of the workup and treatment of sepsis. Investigation with history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging can in identifying sources of infection. All organ systems have the potential to develop sources of infection. However, there are inherent difficulties presented by some that require additional diligence, namely, urinalysis, chest radiographs, and intraabdominal infections. Interventions include administration of antibiotics and may require surgical or other specialist intervention. This is highlighted by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign with specific recommendations for time to antibiotics and expeditious time to surgical source control.

### A proposal for a comprehensive approach to infections across the surgical pathway [^111YjBji]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Below, we report 13 practices in an appropriate antibiotic therapy across the surgical pathway:
The source of infection should always be identified and controlled as soon as possible.
Antibiotic empiric therapy should be initiated after a treatable surgical infection has been recognized, since microbiological data (culture and susceptibility results) may not be available for up to 48–72 h to guide targeted therapy.
In critically ill patients, empiric broad-spectrum therapy to cover all likely pathogens should be initiated as soon as possible after a surgical infection has been recognized. Empiric antimicrobial therapy should be narrowed once culture and susceptibility results are available and/or adequate clinical improvement is noted.
Empirical therapy should be chosen on the basis of local epidemiology, individual patient risk factors for MDR bacteria and Candida spp. clinical severity, and infection source.
Specimens for microbiological evaluation from the site of infection are always recommended for patients with hospital-acquired or with community-acquired infections at risk for resistant pathogens (e.g. previous antimicrobial therapy, prior infection or colonization with a multidrug-resistant, extensively drug-resistant, and pan-drug-resistant pathogens) and in critically ill patients. Blood cultures should be performed before the administration of antibiotics in critically ill patients.
Antibiotics dose should be optimized to ensure that pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) targets are achieved. This involves prescribing of an adequate dose, according to the most appropriate and right method and schedule to maximize the probability of target attainment.
The appropriateness and need for antimicrobial treatment should be reassessed daily.
Once source control is established, short courses of antibiotic therapy are as effective as longer courses regardless of signs of inflammation. Intra-abdominal infection: 4 days are as effective as 8 days in moderately ill patients. Bloodstream infection: 5–7 days are as effective as 7–21 days for most patients. Ventilator-associated pneumonia: 8 days are as effective as 15 days.
Failure of antibiotic therapy in patients having continued evidence of active infection may require a re-operation for a second source control intervention.
Biomarkers such as procalcitonin (PCT) may be useful to guide duration and/or cessation of antibiotic therapy in critically ill patients.
Clinicians with advanced training and clinical experience in surgical infections should be included in the care of patients with severe infections.
IPC measures, combined with ASPs, should be implemented in surgical departments. These interventions and programs require regular, systematic monitoring to assess compliance and efficacy.
Monitoring of antibiotic consumption should be implemented and feedback provided to all ASP team members regularly (e.g. every 3–6 months) along with resistance surveillance data and outcome measures.

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^117AzBSU]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Table 2 — suspected sepsis antibiotics: out-of-hospital evidence is insufficient to make a recommendation; in the emergency department, we recommend prompt administration, reserving very short time thresholds for those with infection and shock given insufficient data to specify a threshold, administer broad-spectrum therapy when the source is unconfirmed based on local susceptibility, and target therapy to identified sources such as pneumonia or UTI per source-specific guidelines.

### Rationalizing antimicrobial therapy in the ICU: a narrative review [^1168JygD]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The massive consumption of antibiotics in the ICU is responsible for substantial ecological side effects that promote the dissemination of multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDRB) in this environment. Strikingly, up to half of ICU patients receiving empirical antibiotic therapy have no definitively confirmed infection, while de-escalation and shortened treatment duration are insufficiently considered in those with documented sepsis, highlighting the potential benefit of implementing antibiotic stewardship programs (ASP) and other quality improvement initiatives. The objective of this narrative review is to summarize the available evidence, emerging options, and unsolved controversies for the optimization of antibiotic therapy in the ICU. Published data notably support the need for better identification of patients at risk of MDRB infection, more accurate diagnostic tools enabling a rule-in/rule-out approach for bacterial sepsis, an individualized reasoning for the selection of single-drug or combination empirical regimen, the use of adequate dosing and administration schemes to ensure the attainment of pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics targets, concomitant source control when appropriate, and a systematic reappraisal of initial therapy in an attempt to minimize collateral damage on commensal ecosystems through de-escalation and treatment-shortening whenever conceivable. This narrative review also aims at compiling arguments for the elaboration of actionable ASP in the ICU, including improved patient outcomes and a reduction in antibiotic-related selection pressure that may help to control the dissemination of MDRB in this healthcare setting.

### Patterns, predictors, and intercenter variability in empiric Gram-Negative antibiotic use across 928 United States hospitals [^116QTjZy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Although the potential overuse of broad-spectrum therapy when not indicated is problematic, the potential underuse of broad-spectrum therapy when it is indicated may be even more concerning. In our cohort, 23% of patients with sepsis did not receive broad-spectrum empiric gram-negative therapy. Although ceftriaxone is a reasonable therapeutic option for many septic patients depending upon their individual risk factors and presumed infection source, 6% of septic patients received narrow-spectrum antibiotics other than ceftriaxone. Moreover, patients with additional resistance risk factors or, depending upon institutional antimicrobial resistance patterns, with more severe clinical presentations should ideally receive broader-spectrum therapy with antipseudomonal coverage. Yet, 10% of septic patients did not receive broad-spectrum therapy even though they had already received inpatient broad-spectrum gram-negative antibiotics in the previous 3 months, nor did 12% of septic patients who were in the ICU, mechanically ventilated, and/or who received vasopressors while receiving empiric therapy — together representing > 32 000 patients. This is particularly concerning, because we identified patients with sepsis using a set of explicit diagnosis codes, which tend to select for the most severe cases and have a high sensitivity for identifying patients with septic shock. Thus, the sepsis patients in our cohort likely comprise a severely ill subpopulation, for whom each additional hour of inadequate antibiotic therapy can increase mortality. Taken together, both the potential overtreating of patients without clear risk factors and the potential undertreating of patients with invasive infections underscores the need for more standardized guidelines, and ideally the development of validated risk-assessment tools, to inform empiric therapy selection.

### A comprehensive review of abdominal infections [^1152GQ6K]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Antibiotic Therapy

Surgery is the definitive treatment for complicated IAI, but systemic antibiotic therapy is a necessary adjunct. The role of antibiotics in this setting is prevention and treatment of hematogenous spread of infection and reduction of late complications. Treatment should be initiated as soon as a diagnosis is suspected, and within an hour in the case of severe sepsis. Antibiotic choice should depend on the most likely source of infection, immune status of the patient, and the likelihood of opportunistic or resistant organisms.

In general, the gastrointestinal tract is sterile in the stomach and duodenum, with enteric gram negatives in the proximal small bowel, and anaerobes populating the distal ileum and colon. Table 1 lists the expected organisms according to source of contamination.

In cases where the source is known, antimicrobial selection can target site-specific organisms. When the source is not known, choice of antimicrobial regimen and duration of treatment should be guided by patient risk. Risk, in this context, is intended to describe risk for failure of treatment, and risk assessment allows for proper selection of narrow versus broad-spectrum antibiotics. High versus low risk is determined primarily by patient physiology and underlying medical conditions (Table 2). Health care-associated infections, APACHE II score > 15, advanced age, organ dysfunction, poor nutritional status, immunosuppression and presence of malignancy are all associated with a high risk of treatment failure.

Surgical site infections

Question

What are the treatment and antibiotic use recommendation for surgical site infection (SSI)?

Recommendation

The treatment of an SSI involves evacuation of infected material and one to 1–2 days of antibiotics if cellulitis is > 5 cm or if significant systemic symptoms are present.

Discussion

The most important therapy for a patient with an SSI is prompt source control by removing the infected material. In superficial SSIs, removing sutures/staples may accomplish this. If the surrounding erythema is minor and the patient has no significant systemic symptoms, antibiotics are unnecessary. Otherwise, a short course of antibiotics (24–48 hours) may be appropriate, such as cefazolin for clean procedures and ceftriaxone plus metronidazole for intra-abdominal procedures. Persistence or recurrence of superficial signs/symptoms may indicate a deep or organ space SSI.

Intra-abdominal infection

Question

In patients with IAI, what is the treatment and duration?

Recommendation

Initial antibiotic selection for IAI should be based on the source of infection, local antibiogram, and clinical severity. One reasonable empiric regimen is piperacillin-tazobactam for high-risk patients (plus vancomycin or linezolid in healthcare-associated IAI and ceftriaxone plus metronidazole for low-risk patients. Uncomplicated IAI (uIAI) can be managed with a single dose of preoperative antibiotic or a maximum of 24 hours postoperatively. Complicated IAI (cIAI) can be managed with 4 days of antibiotics once source control is achieved. When source control is not possible, we recommend 5–7 days of antibiotics. There is no demonstrated benefit in empiric antifungal therapy.

Acute pancreatitis — role of antibiotics: We suggest against prophylactic antibiotics in patients with severe acute pancreatitis (AP) (Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). While antibiotics should not be used in patients with sterile necrosis, antibiotics are an important part of treatment in infected necrosis. In patients with infected necrosis, antibiotics known to penetrate pancreatic necrosis should be used largely to delay surgical, endoscopic, and radiologic drainage beyond 4 weeks, and some patients may avoid drainage altogether because the infection may completely resolve with antibiotics. Routine administration of antifungal agents along with prophylactic or therapeutic antibiotics is not needed. When cultures are negative and no source of infection is identified, antibiotics should be discontinued.

(Basic awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance and prevailing mechanisms can aid emergency physicians in providing appropriate care to patients with infections due to a multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO). Empiric treatment of MDRO infections should be approached with caution and guided by the most likely pathogens based on differential diagnosis, severity of the illness, suspected source of infection, patient-specific factors, and local antibiotic susceptibility patterns. Newer broad-spectrum antibiotics should be reserved for critically ill patients where there is a high likelihood of infection with an MDRO.).

### Determining the optimal antibiotic duration for skin and soft tissue infections [^112FyTjX]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Optimal duration of therapy in SSTIs - a heterogeneous group of infections - remains unknown. The advances in knowledge of antibiotic duration of treatment in selected SSTIs that can impact clinical practice and published in the last 18 months are reviewed.

Recent Findings

Recent evidence indicates that few patients receive guideline concordant empiric antibiotics and appropriate duration in the United States, although this likely can be extrapolated to other countries. One of the most commonly identified opportunities to improve antibiotic stewardship is duration of therapy more than 10 days. The long-standing debate regarding the significance of abscess size and its impact on clinical response to antibiotics, following proper drainage, is increasingly shifting towards the conclusion that abscess size is not directly associated with cure. In obese patients with SSTI, there is no benefit to longer antibiotic durations for SSTIs in patients with obesity, and it appears that longer antibiotic duration of therapy was associated with increased treatment failure. In diabetic foot infections (DFO), two randomized studies suggest that in the presence of osteomyelitis, the total duration of antibiotic therapy for patients treated nonsurgically does not need to be more than 6weeks. In a prospective, randomized, noninferiority, pilot trial, patients with DFO who underwent surgical debridement and received either a 3-week or 6-week course of antibiotic therapy had similar outcomes and antibiotic-related adverse events. In patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections, successive observational studies clearly suggest that short duration of antibiotic treatment after NSTI source control is as well tolerated and effective as a longer course. It appears that 48h would be enough. The possibility of fixed versus individualized approaches to therapy for common bacterial infections, including SSTIs merits to be considered seriously. Fully individualized therapy may be an ideal approach to maximize the benefits and minimize the harms of antimicrobials. Much more work is needed before this strategy becomes feasible.

Summary

There is increasing evidence that shorter duration of treatment is better in different types of SSTIs. Paradoxically, evaluation of real-life clinical practice indicates that long treatments continue to be commonly given to this population.

### Timing of appropriate empirical antimicrobial administration and outcome of adults with community-onset bacteremia [^116HmhL4]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Despite improvements in hemodynamic support and antibiotic therapy, bacteremia is still associated with high morbidity and mortality, which contribute substantially to healthcare costs. Community-onset bacteremia, with an annual incidence of 0.82% in a population-based study, is a common problem for clinicians. In addition to early establishment of vascular access, fluid resuscitation, and removal of infection source, particularly in critically ill patients, antimicrobial therapy has been regarded as one of the mainstays of bacteremia treatment. Although most investigations have concluded that early administration of appropriate antimicrobials could be linked to a favorable prognosis in the individuals with bacteremia, several studies have not identified the survival benefit of early appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Furthermore, the timing of the first dose of appropriate antibiotics remains a controversial point, and thus appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy has been defined as the interval between bacteremia onset and antimicrobial administration, ranging widely from < 24 hours to < 48 hours in previous reports. To our knowledge, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SCC) "International guidelines for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock" recommend that an appropriate antimicrobial therapy be administered within the first 1 hour of recognition of severe sepsis or septic shock. However, focusing on patients with bacteremia, the question "what priority is early enough for appropriate antibiotic administration?" has been debated. Therefore, to describe the beneficial effects of appropriate empirical antimicrobial administration on clinical outcome and to further achieve the "optimum timing" of appropriate antimicrobial administration, we compared the outcome impact of different time cutoffs from emergence department (ED) triage to appropriate antimicrobial administration for adults with community-onset bacteremia.

### Hey surgeons! It is time to lead and be a champion in preventing and managing surgical infections! [^115DBA9Z]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Prevention of surgical site infections (SSIs)

In 2017, the Global Alliance for Infections in Surgery shared with over 230 experts from 83 different countries a global declaration on appropriate use of antimicrobial agents in hospitals worldwide. Within this declaration, the authors highlighted the contribution of antibiotic exposure, misuse, and overuse to the development of AMR and outlined the fundamental principles of appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis and therapy across the surgical pathway. Efforts to prevent hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) were not specifically highlighted in their declaration, but they are of significant importance in limiting antibiotic exposure.

Prevention is better than cure, and every infection prevented is one that needs no treatment. Prevention of infection can be cost effective and implemented everywhere, even where resources are limited. The surgical community continues to be cavalier in its approach to infection prevention and control. Patients with medical devices (central lines, urinary catheters, ventilators) or who undergo surgical procedures are at risk of acquiring HAIs. HAIs result in significant morbidity and mortality, prolong the duration of hospital stay, and necessitate additional diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Surgeons continue to be obtuse to this reality with limited response to requests for intervention. Surgical site infections (SSIs) are the most common HAIs among surgical patients. In recent years, many comprehensive sets of guidelines for the prevention of surgical site infections have been published. Despite clear evidences and guidelines to direct SSI prevention strategies, compliance is universally poor.

Source control in surgical infections

When surgical infection occurs, the source of infection should be recognized and controlled. Whether related to a catheter, abscess or device all measures should be undertaken to eliminate the source and reduce the bacterial inoculum. Appropriate source control is of outmost importance in the management of surgical infections. Intra-abdominal infections along with soft tissues infections are the sites where source control is impactful. In these settings, an appropriate source control can improve patients' outcome and reduce prolonged courses of antibiotic therapy. As a general principle, every verified source of infection should be controlled as soon as possible. The level of urgency of treatment is determined by the affected organ(s), the relative speed at which clinical symptoms progress, and the underlying physiological stability of the patient.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the WSES 2016 consensus conference [^115We23S]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

What are the principles of antimicrobial therapy?

Statement 24

Empirical antimicrobial therapy should be based on local epidemiology, individual patient risk factors for difficult to treat pathogens, clinical severity of infection, and infection source (Recommendation 1 C).

The principles of empiric antibiotic treatment should be defined according to the most frequently isolated microbes, always taking into consideration the local trend of antibiotic resistance.

In this era of prevalent drug-resistant microorganisms, the threat of resistance is a source of major concern that cannot be ignored.

In the past 20 years, the incidence of IAIs caused by MDROs has risen dramatically.

Quinolone resistance, prevalence of ESBL-producing bacteria, prevalence and mechanisms of carbapenem resistance in the local environment and the place of recent traveling should be always taken into account when an antimicrobial therapy is administered empirically.

Generally, the most important factors in predicting the presence of resistant pathogens in IAIs is acquisition in a healthcare setting (particularly if the patient becomes infected in the ICU or has been hospitalized for more than 1 week), corticosteroid use, organ transplantation, baseline pulmonary or hepatic disease, and previous antimicrobial therapy.

Previous antimicrobial therapy is one of the most important risk factors for resistant pathogens.

In order to determine risk factors for presence of MDROs in post-operative peritonitis (PP), Augustin et al. reviewed data of 100 patients hospitalized in the ICU for PP. According to logistic regression analysis, the use of broad-spectrum antibiotic between initial intervention and re-operation was the only significant risk factor for emergence of MDROs. For patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, early and properly administered empirical antimicrobial therapy can have a significant impact on the outcome, independent of the anatomical site of infection. Riché et al. in a prospective observational study involving 180 consecutive patients with secondary generalized peritonitis demonstrated a significantly higher mortality rate for patients in septic shock (35 and 8% for patients with and without shock, respectively). Clinical severity should be assessed with the sepsis score criteria or the new proposed criteria for definition of sepsis.

### Diagnosis and prevention of periprosthetic joint infections [^115EAKMz]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). High credibility.

Avoiding antimicrobials prior to intra-articular culture for periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is conditionally advised, as limited evidence supports withholding antimicrobials for a minimum of two weeks prior to obtaining intra-articular culture to establish the diagnosis of PJI, with strength of recommendation labeled Limited. Rationale includes a moderate strength study reporting increased risk of false negative culture results when antibiotics were received within two weeks of culture, although a low quality study found no statistical difference between those who did and did not receive antibiotics within two weeks. Withholding may not be appropriate in sepsis; in a hemodynamically stable patient, there are no known associated risks or harms, but it is recommended that patients remain closely monitored during the antibiotic free period. Applicability across microorganism-types and antibiotic-types is unknown, and future research is needed to define the ideal antibiotic-free time prior to specimen collection for cultures in patients with suspected PJI.

### When not to start antibiotics: avoiding antibiotic overuse in the intensive care unit [^1163fhHg]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Most intensive care unit (ICU) patients receive broad-spectrum antibiotics. While lifesaving in some, in others these treatments may be unnecessary and place patients at risk of antibiotic-associated harms.

Objectives

To review the literature exploring how we diagnose infection in patients in the ICU and address the safety and utility of a 'watchful waiting' approach to antibiotic initiation with selected patients in the ICU.

Sources

A semi-structured search of PubMed and Cochrane Library databases for articles published in English during the past 15 years was conducted.

Content

Distinguishing infection from non-infectious mimics in ICU patients is uniquely challenging. At present, we do not have access to a rapid point-of-care test that reliably differentiates between individuals who need antibiotics and those who do not. A small number of studies have attempted to compare early aggressive versus conservative antimicrobial strategies in the ICU. However, this body of literature is small and not robust enough to guide practice.

Implications

This issue will not likely be resolved until there are diagnostic tests that rapidly and reliably identify the presence or absence of infection in the ICU population. In the meantime, prospective trials that identify clinical situations wherein it is safe to delay or withhold antibiotic initiation in the ICU until the presence of an infection is proven are warranted.

### Choosing wisely in healthcare epidemiology and antimicrobial stewardship [^116PSdkr]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial stewardship — culture-negative suspected infection: Stop antibiotics in patients whose diagnostic culture(s) are negative unless there is clear evidence of bacterial infection. Patients often receive antibiotic treatment when bacterial infection is suspected but not yet confirmed, and usually, laboratory and radiology information are available after 3 days. Based on test and culture results, antibiotics should be deescalated to a narrow-spectrum antibiotic or discontinued if there is no further evidence of infection. Reducing antibiotic exposure decreases the risk of infections with C. difficile and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and medical professionals should use their local antibiogram to develop guidance for narrow empiric choices to limit patient exposures to unnecessary antibiotics.

### Management of adult sepsis in resource-limited settings: global expert consensus statements using a Delphi method [^114stj1t]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial clinical guidance for managing sepsis in resource-limited settings should recognize that

When there is a high likelihood of sepsis or septic shock, antimicrobials should be administered immediately, ideally within one hour.
For adults with possible sepsis without shock, where investigations (such as laboratory or imaging) to exclude a non–infectious cause of acute illness are not readily available and if concern for infection persists, antimicrobials should be administered without delay.
Administration of antiparasitic agents should not be delayed in patients with suspicion of sepsis of parasitic origin.
In patients with sepsis and where the source has been adequately controlled, clinical improvement with an improving trend in white blood cell count can be used to guide the duration of antibiotic therapy.

Providing appropriate and timely antimicrobial therapy in sepsis is central to improving outcomes. However, in resource-limited settings, achieving this goal must be balanced against providing other aspects of care, especially to the sickest patients. Providing timely antimicrobial therapy should also be balanced with concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance where infections are commonly caused by resistant organisms and empiric therapy is likely to include broad-spectrum antibiotics. While the World Health Assembly recognises the need to promote 'judicious use of antimicrobials' in sepsis management, how best to do this in patients with sepsis is unclear and likely will need significant improvements in both diagnostics and antimicrobial stewardship programmes. The WHO's global research agenda for antimicrobial resistance includes research priorities of context-specific optimization of antimicrobial stewardship and empiric antimicrobial regimens and new rapid point-of-care diagnostics which would be of great value in addressing this complex issue.

### Antimicrobial treatment duration in sepsis and serious infections [^115kkPFN]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Sepsis mortality has improved following advancements in early recognition and standardized management, including emphasis on early administration of appropriate antimicrobials. However, guidance regarding antimicrobial duration in sepsis is surprisingly limited. Decreased antibiotic exposure is associated with lower rates of de novo resistance development, Clostridioides difficile-associated disease, antibiotic-related toxicities, and health care costs. Consequently, data weighing safety versus adequacy of shorter treatment durations in sepsis would be beneficial. We provide a narrative review of evidence to guide antibiotic duration in sepsis. Evidence is significantly limited by noninferiority trial designs and exclusion of critically ill patients in many trials. Potential challenges to shorter antimicrobial duration in sepsis include inadequate source control, treatment of multidrug-resistant organisms, and pharmacokinetic alterations that predispose to inadequate antimicrobial levels. Additional studies specifically targeting patients with clinical indicators of sepsis are needed to guide measures to safely reduce antimicrobial exposure in this high-risk population while preserving clinical effectiveness.

### Impact of inadequate empirical antibiotic treatment on outcome of non-critically ill children with bacterial infections [^113CypGA]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Empiric antimicrobial therapy is the initial choice of antimicrobials pending microbiological results, and should cover the pathogens that are likely to cause the infection, taking into account the patient's age, the site of infection, medical history and other factors. Adequate antibiotic use is commonly defined as the use of an antimicrobial agent that is correct based on all available clinical, pharmacological, and microbiological data. Broad-spectrum therapy is recommended for initial empiric therapy of critically ill children with sepsis. There are guidelines for the empirical antibiotic treatment in several common pediatric situations, including the management of young infants < 60 days with fever, management of fever without source in infants and children < 3 years before and after the engagement of the conjugated pneumococcal vaccine into the routine immunization program, and management of urinary tract infections in children < 24 months. However, selecting adequate empirical antibiotic therapy for children with suspected bacterial infections in other circumstances can be challenging and requires a number of considerations, including past medical history and comorbidities, site of infection and local antibiotic susceptibility patterns.

Inadequate therapy can influence patient outcomes, while broad-spectrum treatment can lead to antibiotic resistance and can influence gut microbiome. One of the consequences of the rise in antibiotic resistance is the growing rate of inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment of bacterial infections. Adequate empirical antibiotic therapy improves the outcomes for patients with severe sepsis, pediatric patients with severe pneumonia, children with nosocomial bloodstream infection, neonates with gram positive and gram negative bacteremia and more. However, the significance of adequate empirical antibiotic treatment in children with milder infections is debatable and may be influenced by many factors, such as infection severity, the source of infection, the patient's immune status, and the pathogenicity of the causative organism. Little is known about the implications of inadequate empirical antibiotic treatment of bacterial infections in not critically ill children.

### It's not just the antibiotics, it's the treatment [^111wHH6t]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The recent study by Bloos and colleagues demonstrates that early initiation of antimicrobial therapy is not associated with improved survival in sepsis. We contend that these findings should not be surprising. This study is yet another part of the growing case against early and aggressive antimicrobial therapy and highlights the important roles resuscitation and source control play in the management of the septic patient. We suggest that, whenever possible, antimicrobial therapy should we withheld until objective evidence of infection has been obtained.

### Factors contributing to delayed initiation of appropriate antimicrobial treatment in patients with streptococcal bacteremia [^114cjM2a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Finally, we concur that results from observational studies should be interpreted with caution, particularly regarding parameters reflecting medical decisions, such as antimicrobial treatment or source control interventions, as these decisions are based on complex evaluations not fully captured during data collection. However, the effect of appropriate antimicrobial treatment on the mortality of various infections and pathogens has consistently been shown to be one of the most important interventions for improving outcomes. Nonetheless, as noted by Dequidt et al, in patients with suspected infection and in the absence of an evident site of infection, sepsis, and neutropenia, antimicrobial treatment can be safely withheld, as initiating antimicrobial treatment in all such patients could lead to unnecessary consequences at both the individual and society levels, including gut microbiota dysregulation, antimicrobial-associated side effects, and increase in antimicrobial resistance.

### Initial antimicrobial management of sepsis [^111W8GHj]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The management of suspected sepsis requires thoughtful and individualized care. Initial empiric therapy should be immediate for those with a high likelihood of infection, severe illness and/or shock. Specific empiric antimicrobial therapy should be chosen with consideration of the likely site of infection, common pathogens for these sites, and with modification made by consideration of patient-specific risk factors for resistance and knowledge of local microbiology. While timely and appropriate therapy is necessary to reduce mortality, it must be accompanied by a commitment to de-escalate once we get culture and serial clinical and laboratory data, since indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum empiric therapy is a driving force for antimicrobial resistance. Key recommendations for management are summarized in Table 1.

### Considerations for empiric antimicrobial therapy in sepsis and septic shock in an era of antimicrobial resistance [^114h6N1R]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with sepsis present across a spectrum of infection sites and severity of illnesses requiring complex decision making at the bedside as to when prompt antibiotics are indicated and which regimen is warranted. Many hemodynamically stable patients with sepsis and low acuity of illness may benefit from further work up before initiating therapy, whereas patients with septic shock warrant emergent broad-spectrum antibiotics. The precise empiric regimen is determined by assessing patient and epidemiological risk factors, likely source of infection based on presenting signs and symptoms, and severity of illness. Hospitals should implement quality improvement measures to aid in the rapid and accurate diagnosis of septic patients and to ensure antibiotics are given to patients in an expedited fashion after antibiotic order.

Mervyn Singer: restricted and abbreviated use of antimicrobials for infection

Background: Few therapies are as well entrenched in ICU practice as the early and aggressive use of antibiotics to suppress infection. A well-discussed and appropriate concern is the need to avoid the indiscriminate use of these agents to prevent emergence of life-threatening microbial resistance to these vital armaments. Yet, the idea that appropriate antibiotics are invariably helpful when infection develops is never seriously challenged. It may be wise to re-examine this mandate. Antibiotics are effective not only against the offending organism but also the host tissues, as well. Apart from their widely acknowledged potential for side effects, renal and hepatic dysfunction, the ability of certain agents to impair mitochondrial function (e.g. linezolid) and to adversely alter both immunity and the microbiome is extensively documented. Few would withhold an effective antimicrobial in the face of a known symptomatic infection. However, considering their predictable tendencies to produce adverse consequences, one might logically wonder: "Just how solid is the evidence that antibiotics reduce mortality?" It turns out, less reassuring than one might think.

Many patients survived what might be considered life-threatening illnesses in the pre-antibiotic era. Early comparisons of sulphonamide antibiotics with placebo demonstrated a modest reduction of mortality from pneumonia, but an increased incidence of complications (e.g. empyema). In the pre-antibiotic eras that preceded our own, surgery of chest and abdomen for advanced infections was frequently successful without their use. In more recent years, enthusiasm for earliest possible antibiotic intervention has waned with the demonstration by multiple prospective studies that reasonable delays make very little difference to eventual outcome of sepsis and septic shock. Some experimental data indicate that the rapid early release of bacterial cell products by bactericidal antibiotics exacerbate severity. In certain settings, biomarker-targeted decisions for antibiotic intervention rather than automatic broad spectrum coverage may often make better sense, and de-escalation strategies for life-threatening infections appear to offer a survival advantage over sustained antibiotic treatment. Very recent reports indicate that fewer antibiotics and shorter treatment courses lessen adverse side effects and might even improve survival. Indeed, courses as brief as 1–3 days may be as effective as those traditionally recommended. Taken together, such data prompt careful consideration of the need for antibiotic treatment and urge that targeted antibiotics be given for the shortest effective time.

Idea: Curtail the duration of antimicrobial treatment and avoid the use of antibiotics whenever feasible to do so.

### The elusive concept of appropriate antibiotic for septic patients when a pathogen is not detected by standard culture methods [^116EhSku]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, "culture-negative" sepsis should be interpreted literally, to describe cases in which standard culture techniques yield no results, not as a synonym for sepsis without a causative agent. Expedited identification of pathogens using all available methods, including molecular diagnostics, is essential. These tools are integral to modern microbiology, although their results should always be interpreted judiciously to avoid overdiagnosis. Indeed, with regard to appropriateness of therapy, discrepancies between genotype and phenotype are not uncommon and should be considered when deciding an empirical treatment based on detection of some resistance genes, for instance. In Fig. 1 we summarize challenges and solutions of "culture-negative" sepsis management.

Fig. 1
Challenges and solutions in culture-negative sepsis management

We advocate integrating advanced diagnostics into clinical practice to enhance the precision of sepsis management and reduce the reliance on empirical guidelines that may not adequately address culture-negative cases.

Finally, defining antibiotic therapy as "appropriate" solely based on adherence to guidelines risks overlooking mismatches between empirical antibiotic therapies and actual etiologies, contributing to antibiotic misuse and its consequences.

### Trial of short-course antimicrobial therapy for intraabdominal infection [^1126W7ep]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

The successful treatment of intraabdominal infection requires a combination of anatomical source control and antibiotics. The appropriate duration of antimicrobial therapy remains unclear.

Methods

We randomly assigned 518 patients with complicated intraabdominal infection and adequate source control to receive antibiotics until 2 days after the resolution of fever, leukocytosis, and ileus, with a maximum of 10 days of therapy (control group), or to receive a fixed course of antibiotics (experimental group) for 4 ± 1 calendar days. The primary outcome was a composite of surgical-site infection, recurrent intraabdominal infection, or death within 30 days after the index source-control procedure, according to treatment group. Secondary outcomes included the duration of therapy and rates of subsequent infections.

Results

Surgical-site infection, recurrent intraabdominal infection, or death occurred in 56 of 257 patients in the experimental group (21.8%), as compared with 58 of 260 patients in the control group (22.3%) (absolute difference, -0.5 percentage point; 95% confidence interval, -7.0 to 8.0; P = 0.92). The median duration of antibiotic therapy was 4.0 days (interquartile range, 4.0 to 5.0) in the experimental group, as compared with 8.0 days (interquartile range, 5.0 to 10.0) in the control group (absolute difference, -4.0 days; 95% CI, -4.7 to -3.3; P < 0.001). No significant between-group differences were found in the individual rates of the components of the primary outcome or in other secondary outcomes.

Conclusions

In patients with intraabdominal infections who had undergone an adequate source-control procedure, the outcomes after fixed-duration antibiotic therapy (approximately 4 days) were similar to those after a longer course of antibiotics (approximately 8 days) that extended until after the resolution of physiological abnormalities.

### Diagnosing sepsis: does the microbiology matter? [^111KChaK]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Sepsis is caused by infection, and knowing what type of organism is causing the infection certainly matters in terms of both epidemiology and selecting antibiotic therapy. Although there is considerable laboratory evidence that micro-organisms initiate sepsis in different ways, the clinical consequences are usually indistinguishable. New drugs that target specific points in the activation pathway are starting to emerge, and these will require us to be much more accurate in how we diagnose sepsis.

### Principles of antibiotic therapy in severe infections: optimizing the therapeutic approach by use of laboratory and clinical data [^116Jb9KK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The increasingly daunting problem of antimicrobial resistance has led to an intense focus on optimization of antibiotic therapy, with simultaneous goals of improving patient outcomes and minimizing the contribution of that therapy to making the available antibiotics obsolete. Although even appropriate antibiotic therapy drives resistance, inappropriate therapy may also have adverse effects on the individual patient, as well as on the bacterial ecology. Recent research has validated the benefit of intelligent utilization of both microbiological data and clinical assessment in the empirical selection of initial broad-spectrum therapy and in further guidance of therapeutic decisions throughout the course of illness by use of a systems approach. Thus, the optimal approach to the critically ill patient with infection involves the initiation of aggressive broad-spectrum empirical therapy followed by timely responses to microbiological and clinical results as they become available. An appropriate response to this information often involves de-escalation of therapy or even its discontinuation.

Data extraction

Data were extracted from the studies using a standardised data extraction template, which included publication year; country; study design (grouped into: clinical audit, patient interview, provider interview or behavioural studies); sample size (the number of individuals receiving antibiotics, except for community-based surveys, where the number of individuals responding to the survey was used as a proxy); population under study; drug class; drug; estimated inappropriate use of antibiotics (%); CI; indicator used to categorise inappropriate use (see next section); key term(s) used to describe the type of inappropriate usage; and whether the inappropriate use of antibiotics was estimated following an intervention (eg, proportion of antibiotics inappropriately used before/after an introduction of a new antibiotic stewardship intervention in a hospital). We did not analyse inappropriate use by antibiotic class due to the limited number of studies (17.0%, 176/1033) reporting this information.

Classification of inappropriate use: study designs and indicators

Studies of inappropriate use were classified into four categories based on study design:

Clinical audit/database analysis

These studies were typically conducted in a hospital or medical doctor's practice. Clinical information on antibiotics prescribed was obtained from clinical databases. These data were reviewed and defined as whether an antibiotic prescription did or did not match the clinical prescribing guidelines recommended at the study location for the clinical indication. This type of study measured provider-mediated use of antibiotics.

Patient interviews

These studies measured patient use of antibiotics. Patients were asked questions, either in-person or remotely, in either a clinical setting (eg, pharmacy) or in the community. Sampled populations included either those with symptoms where an antibiotic may be required, where individuals have received antibiotics, or general populations inquiring about routine antibiotic use. Questions varied by sampling population. For instance, they may concern patients' attitudes, for example, "Did you not receive an antibiotic when you believed you should have received one?", or practices for example, "Will you complete your full antibiotic prescription even on succession of symptoms?", or "Have you taken an antibiotic without a prescription in the last 6 months?". All antibiotics taken in the absence of a prescription ('non-prescription') were classified as inappropriate use.

### Top 10 pearls for the recognition, evaluation, and management of maternal sepsis [^117X3GPU]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Pearl 6. Move fast during the golden hour to save lives: choose antimicrobials tailored to the most likely diagnosis.

The appropriate initial selection of antibiotics in nonobstetric patients has been shown to decrease mortality. – Therefore, once the diagnosis of sepsis is suspected, broad-spectrum antibiotics tailored to the most likely diagnosis should be initiated. Because most cases of maternal sepsis are due to genitourinary sources, a cost-effective, first-line therapy with intravenous ampicillin, gentamicin, and clindamycin is usually suitable, especially if the source is unknown. However, if a soft tissue infection is present, or if initial evaluation suggests a respiratory cause, first-line antibiotic selection will differ (Table 4). In addition, local resistance patterns as well as emerging strains of resistance and prior antibiotic exposure in the prior 30 days should be considered. – After initiating first-line antibiotics, reviewing the hospital antibiogram of antimicrobial susceptibilities and consulting with an infectious disease specialist may be useful to help tailor antibiotic selection. If a viral or fungal etiology is suspected, targeted antimicrobial treatment can be concurrently administered (Table 3).

Table 4.
Common Antibiotic Regimens for Maternal Sepsis by Suspected Etiology

In certain situations, drug monitoring may be considered; this should be performed in patients with 1) septic shock or admitted to the intensive care unit, 2) liver or kidney impairment, or 3) a large volume of distribution. The antibiotic regimen should be reassessed daily, with the goal of narrowing the spectrum as soon as possible. Clinical improvement or isolation of a pathogen with susceptibility patterns should prompt de-escalation of antibiotic therapy. This is necessary to prevent the development of antibiotic resistance, and to reduce the risk of superinfection (eg, candida, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and clostridium), toxicity, and costs.

### Best practice considerations by the American society of transplant and cellular therapy: infection prevention and management after chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy for hematological malignancies [^116qXt8Z]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Fever management after CAR T-cell therapy — early broad-spectrum coverage, source-specific care, and cautious de-escalation are advised. Given the predominance of bacterial infections early after CAR T-cell therapy, there should be a low threshold for rapidly initiating broad-spectrum, bactericidal antibiotics per institutional guidelines for the management of fever and neutropenia. Antimicrobial therapy can be modified if there is clinical and/or microbiological evidence of infection, and if respiratory viral infections are identified as the source, their management should follow the guidelines for patients with hematological malignancies and TCT. An antibiotic de-escalation strategy, followed by close monitoring, may be safe and can be considered if there is no clinical suspicion of infection and the fever resolves. Fevers after CAR T-cell infusion should warrant prompt infectious workup and initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and because CRS treatment can mask fever, clinical suspicion for infection should be high, and early ID consultation should be considered.

### How antibiotics can make us sick: the less obvious adverse effects of antimicrobial chemotherapy [^115EG4mJ]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2004). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial agents are associated with side-effects, which are usually tolerated because the benefits of treatment outweigh the toxic effects. Clinicians know about these side-effects but are less likely to understand additional adverse events, such as the overgrowth of resistant microorganisms. Overgrowth can itself precipitate a secondary infection, which can be more difficult to treat. Resistant organisms then spread to other patients and the environment, and contribute to increasing antimicrobial resistance worldwide. Organisms exposed to antibiotics undergo molecular changes that might enhance virulence. Enhanced pathogenicity would affect patients, particularly if the organism is also multiply resistant. Clinicians have a responsibility to select the correct antibiotic as soon as they have diagnosed infection, but an absence of microbiological understanding and ignorance of the potential environmental effects have contributed to inappropriate prescribing. The less obvious results of antimicrobial consumption probably go unrecognised in routine clinical care.

Bacteremia management — Early source control and imaging are emphasized, and intravenous (IV) to oral transition is allowed with defined duration. Early drainage of purulent material should be performed; repeat imaging studies should be performed in the patient with persistent bacteremia to identify undrained foci of infection; antibiotics should be administered intravenously initially, but once the patient is clinically improved, oral antibiotics are appropriate when bacteremia cleared promptly and there is no evidence of endocarditis or metastatic abscess, and Two to 3 weeks of therapy is recommended (strong, low).

### Trends in empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic use for suspected community-onset sepsis in US hospitals [^112qjbSN]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

Empiric treatment for suspected community-onset sepsis accounts for about half of broad-spectrum antibiotic use in US hospitals even though resistant organisms are isolated in only 7% of patients with community-onset sepsis and less than 10% of patients treated with broad-spectrum agents. Broad-spectrum antibiotic use for suspected sepsis is increasing while the percentage of cases with proven resistant infections is decreasing, translating into an increasing number of broad-spectrum courses that are likely unnecessary in retrospect. These findings help elucidate the contribution of suspected sepsis to antibiotic prescribing in US hospitals and inform ongoing deliberations on finding the balance between assuring early, appropriate therapy for patients with severe infections vs limiting overuse for the majority of patients who do not have antibiotic-resistant infections.

### WSES / GAIS / SIS-E / WSIS / AAST global clinical pathways for patients with intra-abdominal infections [^115WTTGn]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

In contrast, antibiotics such as aminoglycosides exhibit concentration-dependent activity and should be administered in a once-daily manner (or with the least possible number of daily administrations) in order to achieve high peak plasma concentrations. With these agents, the peak serum concentration, and not the time the concentration remains above the MIC, is more closely associated with efficacy. In terms of toxicity, aminoglycosides nephrotoxicity is caused by a direct effect on the renal cortex and its uptake saturation. Thus, an extended interval dosing strategy reduces the renal cortex exposure to aminoglycosides and reduces the risk of nephrotoxicity.

In 2017, the Global Alliance for Infections in Surgery published a global declaration on the appropriate use of antimicrobial agents across the surgical pathway and reported the following 16 principles of appropriate antibiotic therapy across the surgical pathways:
The source of infection should always be identified and controlled as soon as possible.
Antibiotic empiric therapy should be initiated after a treatable surgical infection has been recognized, because microbiologic data (culture and susceptibility results) may not be available for up to 48–72 h to guide targeted therapy.
In critically ill patients, empiric broad-spectrum therapy to cover the most likely pathogens should be initiated as soon as possible after a surgical infection has been recognized. Empiric antimicrobial therapy should be narrowed once culture and susceptibility results are available and adequate clinical improvement is noted.
Empiric therapy should be chosen on the basis of local epidemiology, individual patient risk factors for MDR bacteria and Candida spp. clinical severity, and infection source.
Specimens for microbiologic evaluation from the site of infection are always recommended for patients with hospital-acquired or with community-acquired infections at risk for resistant pathogens (e.g. previous antimicrobial therapy, previous infection or colonization with a MDR, XDR, and PDR pathogen) and in critically ill patients. Blood cultures should be performed before the administration of antibiotic agents in critically ill patients.
The antibiotic dose should be optimized to ensure that PK-PD targets are achieved. This involves prescribing an adequate dose, according to the most appropriate and right method and schedule to maximize the probability of target attainment.
The appropriateness and need for antimicrobial treatment should be re-assessed daily.
Once source control is established, short courses of antibiotic therapy are as effective as longer courses regardless of signs of inflammation.
Intra-abdominal infection — 4 days are as effective as 8 days in moderately ill patients
Blood stream infection — 5 to 7 days are as effective as 7 to 21 days for most patients
Ventilator-associated pneumonia — 8 days are as effective as 15 days.
Failure of antibiotic therapy in patients having continued evidence of active infection may require a reoperation for a second source control intervention.
Biomarkers such as procalcitonin may be useful to guide the duration and cessation of antibiotic therapy in critically ill patients.
Clinicians with advanced training and clinical experience in surgical infections should be included in the care of patients with severe infections.
The infection prevention and control measures combined with antimicrobial stewardship programs should be implemented in surgical departments. These interventions and programs require regular, systematic monitoring to assess compliance and efficacy.
Monitoring of antibiotic consumption should be implemented and feedback provided to all ASP team members regularly (e.g. every 3 to 6 months) along with resistance surveillance data and outcome measures.

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^1163rp1W]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Factors contributing to antibiotic overprescribing

One of the primary factors contributing to the high rate of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for common infections is diagnostic uncertainty. The fear of complications is a significant reason why doctors may hesitate to refrain from prescribing antibiotics when in doubt. In primary care, doctors frequently prescribe antibiotics empirically, relying on clinical judgment derived from patient history and physical examination. Obtaining samples for microbiological analysis is considered cumbersome, impractical, expensive and, in most cases, too slow to make an impact. It can be challenging to discourage doctors from prescribing antibiotics when uncertain. Early control of infection and prompt antibiotic administration are crucial for the outcome of some serious infections, such as pneumonia or septic shock, which occur in very few cases, but the risk of which particularly increases in older and frail individuals. However, a recent paper highlighted the lack of relationship between a patient's level of risk and their likelihood of being prescribed an antibiotic in primary care. Some qualitative studies suggest that doctors, prioritising the preservation of their relationship with patients, are reluctant to forgo antibiotic prescriptions, considering it a minor matter. Interestingly, these studies reveal that doctors express more concern about potential consequences for their future relationships with patients than about the threat of AMR. When doctors perceive a demand for antibiotics from patients, they are more inclined to prescribe them. The presence of comorbidities and the inability to effectively negotiate or explain the appropriate use of antibiotics also play crucial roles in explaining the overuse of antibiotics.

### Concordance between initial presumptive and final adjudicated diagnoses of infection among patients meeting sepsis-3 criteria in the emergency department [^112jrGob]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

False-positive diagnosis was associated with factors increasing the complexity of assessment, such as increasing comorbidity burden and, likely due to difficulty obtaining history, altered mental status. Patients treated for suspected infection despite lacking canonical laboratory or vital sign evidence of infection in the form of leukocytosis or fever, respectively, were also more likely to have infection disproven on final assessment. Lack of a clear infectious source in the ED ("unknown" source of infection) was the strongest risk factor for false-positive presumptive infection diagnosis. This finding suggests that clinical decision support or other methods aiding evaluation of patients with an "unknown" infection source diagnosis as well as recent recommendations advocating less urgency for antibiotic initiation when there is uncertainty around the sepsis diagnosis and shock is absent could help reduce false-positive infection diagnoses. Conversely, while both theoretical models and guidelines for decision making in sepsis would assume that increasing organ severity should be associated with a lower threshold for initiating antibiotics with regard to the perceived probability of infection, an increasing SOFA score was actually associated with a lower probability of false-positive infection diagnosis. The mechanisms underlying this unexpected finding require further study. It is possible that clinicians were less likely to discontinue antibiotics for more severely ill patients, decreasing the proportion of patients adjudicated as false-positive infections (although we did not observe a concomitant increase in the frequency of "possible" infections).

We found no significant association between 30-day mortality and false-positive presumptive infection diagnosis. Although our study may have been underpowered for this analysis, this could suggest that anchoring related to false-positive infection diagnosis may not have dramatically impaired identification and treatment of noninfectious problems. Among patients with infection, source diagnosis discordance also was not associated with 30-day mortality. These findings are in line with some but not all prior studies. Standardized treatment algorithms in place at study hospitals matching antibiotic treatment to infection source, hospital resistance patterns, and patients' risk for resistant pathogen infection and recommending broad-spectrum antibiotics for sepsis of unknown source may mitigate the impact of source diagnosis discordance. For both false-positive diagnosis and source diagnosis discordance, we cannot rule out an impact on other patient-relevant outcomes, including patient functional status, costs or length of stay, antibiotic side effects, opportunistic infections, and patient- and community-level antimicrobial resistance.

### Implementation of earlier antibiotic administration in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock in Japan: a descriptive analysis of a prospective observational study [^112g2ZHa]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Possible explanations and implications

Medical staff intuitively understands that the early use of appropriate antibiotics is an important modifiable factor. However, optimal timing and its effectiveness remain unclear after a widespread implementation of the sepsis protocol in developed countries such as Japan. Although there is no doubt that sepsis care bundle components, such as time to antibiotic, play a role in the arising importance of treatment speed, a similar situation arose when early goal-directed therapy was debated.

In this study, patients who received antibiotics within the first hour had the highest mortality despite the greatest compliance with the entire 3-h bundle. This may be because of the severity at presentation, detecting antibiotic use within the first hour, or an obvious septic state. Alternatively, very early antibiotic use (within 1 h) may lead to unfavorable outcomes; although, this does not seem likely as all the patients would have had a sepsis state for some time before the point of recognition. Furthermore, indiscriminate and rapid use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in all patients may be potentially harmful, as it may lead to adverse events; however, there are only few reports on adverse events of rapid use of antibiotics. Incorrect diagnosis of sepsis may lead to a delay in administering other useful treatments or appropriate source control despite the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Although there may be a linear relationship between early time to antibiotic therapy and better prognosis in sepsis, it is presumably weak. Moreover, similar to the previous study report, our results showed that earlier time to antibiotic therapy was related to better outcomes in ED patients when we excluded patients who received antibiotics within 1 h. Otherwise, focusing on the rapid use of antibiotics may lead to misdiagnosis of the site of infection, which is related to poor outcomes. Sepsis treatment and care involve components other than the time to antibiotic, and while this does not mean that rapid treatments are not good, most physicians intuitively recognize the need for it. Thus, timely antibiotic administration to patients with sepsis should remain one of the key elements in the sepsis care bundle, regardless of time restriction.

### Infective endocarditis: it takes a team [^113YBBdH]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Infectious diseases specialist

The ID specialist provides expertise in both diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of IE management. Common clinical scenarios include non-infectious IE, culture-negative IE, extra-cardiac foci of infection, and identification or unusual or atypical microorganisms that must be distinguished from contamination isolated from blood or other specimen sources. The ID specialist has a crucial understanding of the clinical probability of IE, and must indicate when IE remains strongly suspected despite absence of imaging evidence to suggest infection. The ID specialist also guides appropriate investigation to identify the source of infection. The decision on duration of anti-microbial therapy, need and timing of synergistic combination antibiotic therapy, and mitigating the risk of adverse drug events require timely understanding, especially when surgical therapy or device extraction is planned. The ID specialist plays also a key role in adapting antibiotic doses in cases of renal insufficiency, in the choice of antibiotics in cases of allergy, in evaluating whether a course of antibiotics could be completed at home (outpatient parenteral antibiotic treatment) and the appropriateness of transitioning from intravenous to oral antibiotics in select patients. In patients with IE episodes managed without surgery despite indications for such, decisions regarding whether long-term suppressive therapy is an option and, if so, what drug(s) are appropriate are better made by ID specialists.

### Diagnosis and prevention of periprosthetic joint infections [^1139n3Ru]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). High credibility.

Antibiotics with low preoperative suspicion of PJI or established PJI with a known pathogen — Strong evidence supports that preoperative prophylactic antibiotics be given prior to revision surgery in patients at low preoperative suspicion for periprosthetic infection and those with an established diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection of known pathogen who are undergoing reoperation. Strength of Recommendation: Strong, with the description noting evidence from two or more "High" quality studies with consistent findings for recommending for or against the intervention. The rationale states that preoperative prophylactic antibiotics mitigate the risk for surgical infection and PJI and thus should be administered prior to revision surgery in patients with low preoperative suspicion for PJI. Possible harms of implementation specify that in the patient with a known diagnosis of PJI and an identified organism, there are no known associated risks or harms with this recommendation; however, it is possible that implementing this recommendation could mask an occult PJI in a patient is undergoing revision for presumed aseptic causes of failure, and in these patients, a preoperative evaluation should have established a low suspicion of PJI prior to undergoing revision surgery, while the evidence would suggest that the ability to culture an organism from intraoperative specimens would not be affected by preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^114sswqQ]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical recommendations for managing sepsis have also recently been updated. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) published their initial clinical practice guidelines (CPG) for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock in 2004. Updated versions were published in 2008,2012and most recently in 2016. The 2016 CPG is largely similar to the 2012 version, but there are differences in recommendations in a number of categories, including initial resuscitation parameters, vasopressor selection, antibiotic selection and ventilation. After the release of the Sepsis-3 definition revisions, the SCCM SSC released a practice guideline update to provide clinical context to the guidelines and help providers expeditiously screen, identify and treat patients with sepsis. In this update, they reiterate adherence to the campaign recommendations from 2012. Providers should 'continue to use signs and symptoms of infection to promote early identification' and those with suspected infection should begin immediate management to include 'obtaining blood and other cultures… administering tailored antibiotics as appropriate, and simultaneously obtain laboratory results'.

### Prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in culture-proven sepsis and outcomes associated with inadequate and broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic use [^117MHk7w]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in community-onset sepsis, and is there risk associated with the receipt of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics?

Findings

In this cohort study of 17 430 adults with culture-positive sepsis admitted to 104 US hospitals, 67.0% received empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics, but resistant gram-positive organisms were isolated in only 13.6% of patients and resistant gram-negative organisms in 13.2%. Both undertreatment (failure to cover organisms) and overtreatment (resistant organisms targeted but not isolated) were associated with higher mortality after detailed risk adjustment.

Meaning

In this study, broad-spectrum antibiotics were frequently administered to patients with community-onset sepsis without resistant organisms, and these therapies were associated with worse outcomes.

AmpC-producing Enterobacterales (AmpC-E) serious infections — piperacillin-tazobactam use is discouraged except in limited circumstances. The panel suggests against prescribing piperacillin-tazobactam for serious infections caused by AmpC-E, noting at least 4 observational studies identifying poorer clinical outcomes in patients prescribed piperacillin-tazobactam. Piperacillin-tazobactam may be a reasonable treatment option for mild infections such as uncomplicated cystitis, and for other relatively uncomplicated infections it may be reasonable to transition to piperacillin-tazobactam in settings of adverse events to preferred agents or other patient-specific factors. This practice is only advised after clinical improvement has been achieved and if there are no concerns for ongoing sources of infection.

### Antibiotics in critically ill children-a narrative review on different aspects of a rational approach [^115UsYGA]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Targeted therapy

Antibiotics are initiated because of a suspected infection. After obtaining results from cultures, an important strategy to avoid the development of MDR strains and reduce individual organ toxicity is a de-escalation of the initial empiric treatment. This includes targeted antimicrobial therapy whenever possible, discontinuation of treatment if no infection is confirmed, definition of treatment duration, and source control.

In a prospective multicenter study, children with neutropenic fever were stratified into groups with high, intermediate, and low risk for bacterial infection based on clinical findings and laboratory results. Patients in the high-risk group were treated empirically with antibiotics. Interleukin-8 was determined to distinguish between intermediate and low risk. Intermediate-risk patients received antibiotics and were re-evaluated after 72 h. In 41% of these patients, antibiotic treatment was discontinued following re-evaluation — without a case of sepsis relapse. Low-risk patients were clinically observed and discharged after 12 h without fever. However, 13% of the low-risk patients turned out to have an infection with coagulase-negative staphylococci requiring antibiotic treatment. Highlighting the adverse effects of unindicated antibiotic exposure, the failure to de-escalate initial empiric antibiotic treatment was associated with higher 90-days mortality in adults with severe sepsis or septic shock.

### Antimicrobials: a global alliance for optimizing their rational use in intra-abdominal infections (AGORA) [^112YQnjU]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Antibiotic selection in critically Ill patients

An inadequate empiric antimicrobial regimen is associated with unfavorable outcomes in critical ill patients. In these patients the following strategies should be always implemented to obtain an optimal response to therapy:

early source control procedures when indicated;
early initiation of therapy (ideally, within 1 h);
correct dosing;
considering risk factor for MDRO; and
avoiding use of identical antibiotic and the same antibiotic class administered in the preceding 3 months.

Infections are among the main factors contributing to mortality in intensive care units (ICU). Abdominal sepsis is a common indication for admission to the ICU. The abdomen is the second most common site of invasive infection among critically ill patients. In 2014, the EPIC II study, including 13,796 adult patients from 1265 ICUs in 75 countries, revealed that mortality rate in patients who developed abdominal infections was significantly higher than in patients who had other infections (most of which were respiratory infections). Disease severity, need for organ support, and presence of co-morbidities were independently associated with mortality. In patients with organ dysfunction from septic shock, early appropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy has a significant impact on the outcome, independent of the site of infection. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines recommend intravenous antimicrobials within the first hour of onset of sepsis and septic shock and the use of broad-spectrum agents with adequate penetration of the presumed site of infection. An ineffective or otherwise inadequate antimicrobial regimen is one of the variables more strongly associated with unfavorable outcomes in critical ill patients. Empiric antimicrobial therapy should be started as soon as possible in patients with organ dysfunction and septic shock.

De-escalation

The evidence on de-escalation strategies is largely restricted to patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, particularily in patients with IAIs. In 2013, a Cochrane review on de-escalation of antimicrobial treatment for adults with sepsis did not find adequate evidence to support this. In 2014, a multicenter randomized trial investigating a strategy based on de-escalation of antibiotics resulted in prolonged duration of ICU stay and did not affect the mortality rate. Several authors have associated antimicrobial de-escalation interventions in critically ill patients with reductions in length of hospitalization, inpatient antimicrobial use, adverse events, cost, and recovery of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms. The safety and beneficial outcomes of carbapenem de-escalation as part of an antimicrobial stewardship program in an ESBL-endemic setting, was also recently confirmed.

Catheter-related bloodstream infection

Question

What is the most effective approach and antibiotic therapy for the management of CRBSI?

Recommendation

Effective management of CRBSI involves timely diagnosis, prompt removal of vascular access if at all possible (source control), and appropriate antibiotic therapy for 7–14 days depending on the causative microorganism, as shown in table 3. Vancomycin plus a beta-lactam (such as piperacillin-tazobactam or a ceftazidime) is usually a good empiric regimen if the risk of ESBL is not high. Reference to the local antibiogram and hospital recommendations is recommended for the selection of empiric therapy.

Table 3
Summary of antibiotic durations for common ICU infections

Discussion

The diagnosis of CRBSI should be distinguished from secondary bacteremia due to other sources. Surveillance cultures for patients with central lines are not recommended when CRBSI is not suspected such as in an asymptomatic patient and should not be done when other cultures are more appropriate to evaluate for the clinically suspected infection (eg, respiratory cultures for a suspected pneumonia).

The choice of antibiotic therapy should be based on local susceptibility patterns and the severity of illness and should be de-escalated when culture data become available. The recommended duration of antibiotic therapy is 7 days for coagulase-negative staphylococci, 7 days for Gram-negative bacilli,14 days for S. aureus (unless a complicated infection is present); and 14 days for Candida (in the absence of retinitis or risk factors for it, as described in the 'Bacteremia' section). Examples of when a S. aureus infection is considered complicated include endocarditis, osteomyelitis, foreign body or implant, metastatic infection, low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), immunocompromise, and recurrent infection. An infectious disease consultation should be sought in S. aureus CRBSI.

The management described here applies to non-tunneled lines. When a CRBSI is suspected, the central line should be removed. Catheter salvage options when the line cannot reasonably be removed are beyond the scope of this text.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^114rvATp]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Sepsis and septic shock — procalcitonin-guided discontinuation of antimicrobials is supported by evidence from 14 randomized controlled trials (RCTs; n = 4,499 patients) assessing use of procalcitonin to guide duration, with a meta-analysis reporting improved mortality (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.99) and no effect on length of stay in ICU or hospital; antibiotic exposure was consistently lower though in many trials the total duration of therapy was still 7 days or longer, and the overall quality of evidence was judged to be low. Based on apparent benefit and no obvious undesirable effects, we suggest using procalcitonin along with clinical evaluation to decide when to discontinue antimicrobials in adults with an initial diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and adequate source control, if the optimal duration of therapy is unclear and if procalcitonin is available.

### Characteristics and outcomes of culture-negative versus culture-positive severe sepsis [^115JpSNU]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

What are the implications of our study's findings? Early administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics is recommended by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines in an effort to improve outcomes in sepsis, culture-positive or culture-negative. Kumar and colleagues showed that every hour of delay in the administration of effective antibiotics from the onset of septic shock resulted in an increase in mortality. This association occurred even among culture- negative patients, for which antimicrobial therapy was deemed appropriate if they were consistent with national guidelines modified to local flora for the clinical syndrome. In contrast, similar to the majority of studies in the literature, our study defined the administered antibiotics to be inappropriate only if they did not match the in vitro susceptibility of the identified pathogens, that is, only in culture-positive patients. In so doing, we found the mortality rate to be much higher among culture-positive patients who were administered inappropriate antibiotics than culture-negative patients (55.5% versus 35.9%). There was also a trend toward higher mortality among culture-positive patients who received appropriate antibiotics (41.9%) than culture-negative patients. These findings do not invalidate the Surviving Sepsis Campaign's recommendation, especially since it is impossible to accurately predict one's culture status at presentation. On the clinical front, we echo the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines' advice for cautious consideration of antimicrobial therapy using clinician judgment and available clinical information when cultures are unrevealing. On the research front, we propose that it is time for more in-depth studies of culture-negative sepsis. Such investigations could come in the form of multiplex PCR amplification techniques for the quantification of bacteria, fungi, and viruses to elucidate the false-negative and true-negative rates of cultures, and interventional trials comparing algorithms to escalate, continue, narrow, or cease antibiotics coupled with a search for noninfectious etiologies when pathogens are not detected.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^114NZQDr]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Antimicrobial stewardship in adults with sepsis or septic shock — we suggest daily assessment for de-escalation of antimicrobials over using fixed durations of therapy without daily reassessment for de-escalation (Weak, very low quality of evidence). For patients with an initial diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and adequate source control, we suggest using shorter over longer duration of antimicrobial therapy (Weak, very low quality of evidence). Where optimal duration of therapy is unclear, we suggest using procalcitonin AND clinical evaluation to decide when to discontinue antimicrobials over clinical evaluation alone (Weak, low quality of evidence).

### Timing and spectrum of antibiotic treatment for suspected sepsis and septic shock: why so controversial? [^116tRBaf]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Sepsis guidelines and mandates encourage increasingly aggressive time-to-antibiotic targets for broad-spectrum antimicrobials for suspected sepsis and septic shock. This has caused considerable controversy due to weaknesses in the underlying evidence and fear that overly strict antibiotic deadlines may harm patients by perpetuating or escalating overtreatment. Indeed, a third or more of patients currently treated for sepsis and septic shock have noninfectious or nonbacterial conditions. These patients risk all the potential harms of antibiotics without their possible benefits. Updated Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines now emphasize the importance of tailoring antibiotics to each patient's likelihood of infection, risk for drug-resistant pathogens, and severity-of-illness.

### Saturday night fever: finding and controlling the source of sepsis in critical illness [^114WbBZd]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2002). Medium credibility.

Fever is a daily concern in the intensive care unit. Although about half of all febrile cases are due to non-infectious causes, fear of sepsis frequently leads to diagnostic tests and escalation of therapy, including broadening antibiotic therapy. Using a case to illustrate this dilemma, we discuss the commonest non-infectious and infectious causes of fever, and suggests approaches to their management. Any unexplained fever in intensive care unit patients warrants investigation, which includes complete clinical assessment and blood cultures. When the source of fever is not immediately apparent, non-infectious and infectious causes should be considered. If stable, non-neutropenic patients should be monitored before further tests or empiric antibiotics are started. In an era of rapid emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens and intense scrutiny of resources, optimal diagnosis and management of patients with suspected infection entails much more than the escalation of antimicrobial therapy.

### Bloodstream infections in critically ill patients: an expert statement [^111BShZ2]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Bloodstream infection (BSI) is defined by positive blood cultures in a patient with systemic signs of infection and may be either secondary to a documented source or primary-that is, without identified origin. Community-acquired BSIs in immunocompetent adults usually involve drug-susceptible bacteria, while healthcare-associated BSIs are frequently due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains. Early adequate antimicrobial therapy is a key to improve patient outcomes, especially in those with criteria for sepsis or septic shock, and should be based on guidelines and direct examination of available samples. Local epidemiology, suspected source, immune status, previous antimicrobial exposure, and documented colonization with MDR bacteria must be considered for the choice of first-line antimicrobials in healthcare-associated and hospital-acquired BSIs. Early genotypic or phenotypic tests are now available for bacterial identification and early detection of resistance mechanisms and may help, though their clinical impact warrants further investigations. Initial antimicrobial dosing should take into account the pharmacokinetic alterations commonly observed in ICU patients, with a loading dose in case of sepsis or septic shock. Initial antimicrobial combination attempting to increase the antimicrobial spectrum should be discussed when MDR bacteria are suspected and/or in the most severely ill patients. Source identification and control should be performed as soon as the hemodynamic status is stabilized. De-escalation from a broad-spectrum to a narrow-spectrum antimicrobial may reduce antibiotic selection pressure without negative impact on mortality. The duration of therapy is usually 5–8 days though longer durations may be discussed depending on the underlying illness and the source of infection. This narrative review covers the epidemiology, diagnostic workflow and therapeutic aspects of BSI in ICU patients and proposed up-to-date expert statements.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2008 [^113GKuUS]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the original Surviving Sepsis Campaign clinical management guidelines, "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock", published in 2004.

Design

Modified Delphi method with a consensus conference of 55 international experts, several subsequent meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee. This process was conducted independently of any industry funding.

Methods

We used the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations. A strong recommendation (1) indicates that an intervention's desirable effects clearly outweigh its undesirable effects (risk, burden, cost) or clearly do not. Weak recommendations (2) indicate that the tradeoff between desirable and undesirable effects is less clear. The grade of strong or weak is considered of greater clinical importance than a difference in letter level of quality of evidence. In areas without complete agreement, a formal process of resolution was developed and applied. Recommendations are grouped into those directly targeting severe sepsis, recommendations targeting general care of the critically ill patient that are considered high priority in severe sepsis, and pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations, listed by category, include early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm potential source of infection (1C); administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy within 1 hr of diagnosis of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1D); reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate (1C); a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response (1D); source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method (1C); administration of either crystalloid or colloid fluid resuscitation (1B); fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure (1C); reduction in rate of fluid administration with rising filing pressures and no improvement in tissue perfusion (1D); vasopressor preference for norepinephrine or dopamine to maintain an initial target of mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg (1C); dobutamine inotropic therapy when cardiac output remains low despite fluid resuscitation and combined inotropic/vasopressor therapy (1C); stress-dose steroid therapy given only in septic shock after blood pressure is identified to be poorly responsive to fluid and vasopressor therapy (2C); recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and clinical assessment of high risk for death (2B except 2C for postoperative patients). In the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage, target a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL (1B); a low tidal volume (1B) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy (1C) for acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury (1C); head of bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); avoiding routine use of pulmonary artery catheters in ALI/ARDS (1A); to decrease days of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ALI/ARDS who are not in shock (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia (1B); using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions or lightening (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible (1B); institution of glycemic control (1B), targeting a blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization (2C); equivalency of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1A); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding using H2 blockers (1A) or proton pump inhibitors (1B); and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate (1D). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points (2C); dopamine as the first drug of choice for hypotension (2C); steroids only in children with suspected or proven adrenal insufficiency (2C); and a recommendation against the use of recombinant activated protein C in children (1B).

Conclusions

There was strong agreement among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best current care of patients with severe sepsis. Evidenced-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the first step toward improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^115ZaBnG]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Intra-abdominal infection (IAI) treatment failure — For patients with recurrent or persistent IAI identified by imaging studies, further source control should be the first consideration, and we suggest that these patients be monitored for resistant pathogens, with antimicrobial therapy adjusted as necessary to treat such pathogens (Grade 2-C). For early treatment failure with repeat source control within 48 hours of the initial source control intervention, patients do not need to have antimicrobial therapy changed (Grade 2-C); for late treatment failure, patients should have antimicrobial therapy changed to agents appropriate for CA-IAI and, if feasible, the class of antibiotic being provided should be switched (Grade 2-C). When clinical evidence of treatment failure is present but imaging is negative for recurrent or persistent IAI, antimicrobial therapy should be discontinued (Grade 2-B). When imaging shows ongoing intra-abdominal inflammation, patients should undergo a trial of additional antimicrobial agents appropriate for HA-IAI using a different class of agents if feasible; if there is no clinical response to this antimicrobial trial within a few days, antimicrobial therapy should be discontinued and only reinstituted if there is evidence of clinical deterioration (Grade 2-C). When there is clinical evidence of recurrent failure and imaging shows recurrent or persistent IAI but further source control cannot be achieved, antimicrobial therapy should be continued and discontinued when clinical signs of systemic inflammation or organ dysfunction abate (Grade 2-C).

### Antibiotic strategies in severe nosocomial sepsis: why do we not de-escalate more often? [^1145bUQL]. Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the use of antibiotic de-escalation in patients with hospital-acquired severe sepsis in an academic setting.

Design

We reviewed all episodes of severe sepsis treated over a 1-yr period in the department of intensive care. Antimicrobial therapy was considered as appropriate when the antimicrobial had in vitro activity against the causative microorganisms. According to the therapeutic strategy in the 5 days after the start of antimicrobial therapy, we classified patients into four groups: de-escalation (interruption of an antimicrobial agent or change of antibiotic to one with a narrower spectrum); no change in antibiotherapy; escalation (addition of a new antimicrobial agent or change in antibiotic to one with a broader spectrum); and mixed changes.

Setting

A 35-bed medico-surgical intensive care department in which antibiotic strategies are reviewed by infectious disease specialists three times per week.

Patients

One hundred sixty-nine patients with 216 episodes of severe sepsis attributable to a hospital-acquired infection who required broad-spectrum β-lactam antibiotics alone or in association with other anti-infectious agents.

Measurements and Main Results

The major sources of infection were the lungs (44%) and abdomen (38%). Microbiological data were available in 167 of the 216 episodes (77%). Initial antimicrobial therapy was inappropriate in 27 episodes (16% of culture-positive episodes). De-escalation was applied in 93 episodes (43%), escalation was applied in 22 episodes (10%), mixed changes were applied in 24 (11%) episodes, and there was no change in empirical antibiotic therapy in 77 (36%) episodes. In these 77 episodes, the reasons given for maintaining the initial antimicrobial therapy included the sensitivity pattern of the causative organisms and previous antibiotic therapy. The number of episodes when the chance to de-escalate may have been missed was small (4 episodes [5%]).

Conclusion

Even in a highly focused environment with close collaboration among intensivists and infectious disease specialists, de-escalation may actually be possible in < 50% of cases.

### Fever and infections in surgical intensive care: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^111zq6Pt]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Early and adequate treatment of bacteremia is essential. In general, higher doses of antibiotic are required early in the treatment course. Distinguishing community-acquired versus healthcare-acquired bacteremia is important to dictate antibiotic management. Previous antibiotic therapy, local antibiograms, and pharmacokinetic knowledge are important. The utilization of pharmacist expertise is critical for the provision of the best care in this circumstance. The specific antimicrobial treatment should be inspired by the primary source of infection in cases of secondary bacteremia. Early identification of the microbe, its sensitivities, and targeting of the antibiotic is important. There should be a high pretest probability for bacteremia prior to drawing blood cultures because the risk of contamination of blood culture specimens (false positive) remains significant. 'Double coverage' for Gram-negative bacteremia is no longer routinely recommended. An antifungal agent may be initiated depending on the clinical presentation and previous knowledge of Candida colonization. Where source control is obtained, the patient is clinically improved, and an appropriate oral antibiotic with favorable efficacy for the microbe is used, there is sufficient evidence to recommend stepdown to oral antibiotics to complete the total antibiotic course.

There is now sufficient evidence to recommend 7 days of antibiotic therapy in cases of coagulase-negative staphylococci and Gram-negative bacteremia, 14 days for MRSA (unless a complicated infection is present as described in the section on CRBSI), and 14 days for Candida. Patients with candidemia require screening for retinitis if they are symptomatic for vision disturbance, are non-verbal, or have risk factors for ocular involvement (risk factors include long intravascular lines, parenteral nutrition, prolonged hospital stays, and recent abdominal surgery). These criteria based on recent data, reviews, and statements by the Royal College of Ophthalmologists and the American Academy of Ophthalmology have not yet been evaluated by the IDSA. Patients with ocular involvement should have an infectious disease consultation.

Follow-up blood cultures are not routinely needed for bacteremia and are discouraged except for S. aureus infections or in patients lacking clinical response. In difficult-to-treat infections, infectious disease consultation is advisable. Intravenous beta-lactam antibiotics are the best antibiotics for initial management of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. Removal an infected device or a device suspected to be infected must be considered. Appropriate durations of therapy must be prescribed. Of note, an infectious disease consultation is of benefit for S. aureus bacteremia as it reduces morbidity and mortality, even in relatively minor infections.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® fever without source or unknown origin-child: 2024 update [^117EcqxT]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Fever is the most common reason for the evaluation of pediatric patients in acute care settings. Patients for whom no source of infection is identified after a thorough history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation are classified as having fever without source. Special considerations should be taken in the evaluation of neonates and neutropenic patients as they are at higher risk of serious bacterial infection. Patients with prolonged fever lasting > 3 weeks who have no identifiable source of fever are classified with fever of unknown origin and represent an additional subset of febrile pediatric patients that also require special consideration. This document summarizes the relevant literature and provides expert recommendations for the selection of the initial imaging in four common clinical scenarios in pediatric patients with fever without source or unknown origin. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Update on the use of antibiotics in cutaneous surgery [^115WxS9s]. Dermatologic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotics are often prescribed in perioperative settings, including dermatologic surgery. Given the continued evolution in the breadth and complexity of cutaneous procedures performed and inevitable localized or distant infections that occasionally occur, it seems prudent to periodically evaluate findings and recommendations from the literature regarding the use of antibiotics in cutaneous surgery.

Materials and Methods

Literature review from English-language sources from the past 30 years, especially focusing on sources from the past 5 to 10 years. Data were examined for a variety of cutaneous surgical procedures, routes of antibiotic administration, and consideration of both cutaneous and distant infections.

Results

The literature suggests that, for most routine skin procedures, antibiotic use is probably not warranted for the prevention of surgical wound infection, endocarditis, and late prosthetic joint infections. During prolonged Mohs procedures, delayed repairs, grafts, takedowns of interpolation flaps, or any procedure that breaches a mucosal surface, the evidence is less clear, and decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis. Topical antibiotics are probably overused, although silver sulfadiazine may have an undeserved negative reputation among dermatologists. Systemic prophylactic antibiotics for laser resurfacing and liposuction appear not to be routinely necessary, although patients with known prior herpes infection likely should receive antiviral prophylaxis. The overall reported infection rates and infectious complications remain low in dermatologic surgery, and antibiotic therapy may be prescribed excessively or inappropriately as a result. CONCLUSION.: Antibiotics continue to be widely used, and through varying routes of administration, in the setting of dermatologic surgery. Prudent use of these agents is indicated in high-risk patients, certain anatomic locations, and the presence of overt infection. Additional studies may help clarify the most appropriate indications, and in which patient populations, in the future.

Conclusion

There was strong agreement among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best current care of patients with severe sepsis. Evidenced-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the first step toward improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### The elusive concept of appropriate antibiotic for septic patients when a pathogen is not detected by standard culture methods [^114K9Qx5]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Dear Editor,

In a recent study, Chang et al. highlighted a critical challenge in the management of sepsis: the lack of etiological data in culture-negative cases, complicating the concept of therapeutic appropriateness. Their large multicentre cohort study demonstrated that, while empirical antibiotic therapy was deemed more "appropriate" in culture-negative cases (based on adherence to guidelines) than in culture-positive ones (based on susceptibility profile of causative organisms), patients in the former group faced worse mortality outcomes.

We propose reframing the understanding of "appropriateness" in antibiotic therapy to address the unique challenges of culture-negative sepsis.

Several points should be considered when interpreting these apparently contradictory findings, which question the adequacy of the defining "appropriate treatment" relying on empirical benchmarks derived from culture-positive cases to guide decisions for culture-negative patients. Moreover, the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the study imply a not negligible risk of misclassification bias, particularly differential misclassification, where the probability of being misclassified differs between groups.

Addressing this requires careful evaluation of diagnostic protocols to minimize bias and to ensure accurate stratification of sepsis cases.

First, the study focused on bacterial sepsis identified via standard culture methods, and not by other techniques, also excluding newer options such as molecular testing. This approach appears outdated given the current availability of "fast microbiology" tools designed to reduce the time to effective therapy in septic patients, as well as to lower the rates of so-called "culture negative sepsis". Furthermore, the authors do not report whether blood culture volumes were sufficient, a critical factor as under-inoculated bottles correlate with lower diagnostic yields and higher rates of negative blood cultures. Without this information, comparison between study groups is less reliable. At any rate, molecular diagnostics, including metagenomic sequencing, represent promising advancements for identifying pathogens in culture-negative cases, also overcoming limitations of standard techniques, such as the issue of blood inoculum.

### Concordance between initial presumptive and final adjudicated diagnoses of infection among patients meeting sepsis-3 criteria in the emergency department [^115dQ36Z]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

(See the Editorial Commentary by Rhee et al. on pages 2056–8.)

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by a dysregulated immune response to infection. Patients with this syndrome benefit from prompt treatment, and current international guidelines and regulatory mandates have set rapid timelines for antibiotic delivery and fluid resuscitation when sepsis is suspected. Various noninfectious conditions, however, can mimic the signs and symptoms of sepsis. Strict timelines for antibiotic administration in the emergency department (ED) coupled with the complex and multifaceted clinical syndrome of sepsis have raised concerns about false-positive presumptive infection diagnosis (suspected infection initially treated by the ED clinician that is later determined to be absent) and initial/final infection source diagnosis discordance (discrepancy between ED-diagnosed and final sources of infection) and consequent harms from unnecessary administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and/or delays in treatment for patients' actual infectious or noninfectious diagnosis.

Meaningful discussions of tradeoffs involved in accelerating sepsis treatment require accurate figures on the frequency of false-positive diagnosis and source diagnosis discordance. Previous studies have suggested sepsis false-positive diagnosis rates as high as 43%, but some of these studies have been small, included patients meeting legacy definitions of sepsis now reclassified as simple infection, or combined patients with possible infection and absent infection. We therefore analyzed a large, multihospital cohort to clarify the incidence of and risk factors for false-positive presumptive infection diagnosis and source diagnosis discordance among patients who met Sepsis-3 criteria in the ED.

### Antibiotic de-escalation in the ICU: how is it best done? [^116EEcEC]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

An antimicrobial policy consisting of the initial use of wide-spectrum antimicrobials followed by a reassessment of treatment when culture results are available is termed de-escalation therapy. Our aim is to examine the safety and feasibility of antibiotic de-escalation in critically ill patients providing practical tips about how to accomplish this strategy in the critical care setting.

Recent Findings

Numerous studies have assessed the rates of de-escalation therapy (range from 10 to 60%) in patients with severe sepsis or ventilator-associated pneumonia as well as the factors associated with de-escalation. De-escalation generally refers to a reduction in the spectrum of administered antibiotics through the discontinuation of antibiotics or switching to an agent with a narrower spectrum. Diverse studies have identified the adequacy of initial therapy as a factor independently associated with de-escalation. Negative impact on different outcome measures has not been reported in the observational studies. Two randomized clinical trials have evaluated this strategy in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia or severe sepsis. These trials alert us about the possibility that this strategy may be linked to a higher rate of reinfections but without an impact on mortality.

Summary

Antibiotic de-escalation is a well tolerated management strategy in critically ill patients but unfortunately is not widely adopted.

### Beyond septic shock: who else requires immediate antibiotics? [^116u9zSX]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Landmark studies published almost 20 years ago documented strong associations between time to antibiotic therapy and mortality in critically ill patients, most of whom had septic shock. These findings catalyzed early versions of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign that recommended administering antibiotics ≤ 1 hour after the diagnosis of sepsis with any acute organ dysfunction, not just septic shock. Some state and national quality metrics further extended this guidance, requiring rapid administration of antibiotic therapy for all patients with suspected sepsis or septic shock.

Sepsis, however, is a broad and heterogeneous syndrome that encompasses a wide range of inciting organisms, sites of infection, and patterns of organ dysfunctions. These differences are magnified by host factors, including extremes of age, comorbidities, and immune function. The manifestations of sepsis, prognoses, and the impact of therapy are very different for a young and healthy host with bacterial pneumonia compared with a geriatric patient with cancer complicated by neutropenia and disseminated fungal infection.

The latest version of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines recognizes some of this variability. The 2021 guidelines suggest that patients be stratified by certainty of infection and severity of illness. Specifically, they advise antibiotic therapy ≤ 1 hour after recognition in all patients with possible septic shock and all patients with definite or probable sepsis without shock. In patients with possible sepsis without shock, however, in whom the diagnosis of infection is uncertain and the severity of illness is lesser, they suggest the diagnosis be clarified before antibiotic therapy is administered to minimize unnecessary antibiotic agent use and unintended harms to the individual and the population. Clarifying steps can include assessing the patient's response to the treatment of noninfectious conditions and comorbidities (e.g. fluids, diuresis, bronchodilators, heart rate control, pain control, opioid antagonists, anticoagulation) and/or obtaining additional diagnostic studies (e.g. cross-sectional imaging, respiratory viral panels) and administering antimicrobial agents only if the concern for infection persists for > 3 hours.

### Impact of time to antibiotic therapy on clinical outcome in patients with bacterial infections in the emergency department: implications for antimicrobial stewardship [^111PSujZ]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Rapid initiation of antibiotic treatment is considered crucial in patients with severe infections such as septic shock and bacterial meningitis, but may not be as important for other infectious syndromes. A better understanding of which patients can tolerate a delay in start of therapy is important for antibiotic stewardship purposes.

Objectives

To explore the existing evidence on the impact of time to antibiotics on clinical outcomes in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with bacterial infections of different severity of illness and source of infection.

Sources

A literature search was performed in the PubMed/MEDLINE database using combined search terms for various infectious syndromes (sepsis/septic shock, bacterial meningitis, lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, intra-abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections), time to antibiotic treatment, and clinical outcome.

Content

The literature search generated 8828 hits. After screening titles and abstracts and assessing potentially relevant full-text papers, 60 original articles (four randomized controlled trials, 43 observational studies) were included. Most articles addressed sepsis/septic shock, while few studies evaluated early initiation of therapy in mild to moderate disease. The lack of randomized trials and the risk of confounding factors and biases in observational studies warrant caution in the interpretation of results. We conclude that the literature supports prompt administration of effective antibiotics for septic shock and bacterial meningitis, but there is no clear evidence showing that a delayed start of therapy is associated with worse outcome for less severe infectious syndromes.

Implications

For patients presenting with suspected bacterial infections, withholding antibiotic therapy until diagnostic results are available and a diagnosis has been established (e.g. by 4–8 h) seems acceptable in most cases unless septic shock or bacterial meningitis are suspected. This approach promotes the use of ecologically favourable antibiotics in the ED, reducing the risks of side effects and selection of resistance.

### Antibiotic-induced collateral damage to the microbiota and associated infections [^117QxEZQ]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2023). High credibility.

Antibiotics have transformed medicine, saving millions of lives since they were first used to treat a bacterial infection. However, antibiotics administered to target a specific pathogen can also cause collateral damage to the patient's resident microbial population. These drugs can suppress the growth of commensal species which provide protection against colonization by foreign pathogens, leading to an increased risk of subsequent infection. At the same time, a patient's microbiota can harbour potential pathogens and, hence, be a source of infection. Antibiotic-induced selection pressure can cause overgrowth of resistant pathogens pre-existing in the patient's microbiota, leading to hard-to-treat superinfections. In this Review, we explore our current understanding of how antibiotic therapy can facilitate subsequent infections due to both loss of colonization resistance and overgrowth of resistant microorganisms, and how these processes are often interlinked. We discuss both well-known and currently overlooked examples of antibiotic-associated infections at various body sites from various pathogens. Finally, we describe ongoing and new strategies to overcome the collateral damage caused by antibiotics and to limit the risk of antibiotic-associated infections.

Re-evaluation of the initial diagnosis of pneumonia

Assuming local guidelines are followed, inappropriate antibiotic therapy is seldom the cause of clinical failure in CAP but is more common in HAP/VAP, since the later is associated with a higher risk of MDR pathogens, particular in settings with high baseline MDR rates. ATS/IDSA guidelines addressing both CAP and HAP/VAP have identified risk factors for MDR organisms (Fig. 2). Communication between the microbiology lab, pharmacists, and clinicians is very important to promptly identify patients with inappropriate antibiotics. In addition to the choice of empiric antibiotic therapy, it is crucial to re-evaluate its adequacy. Drug dose should be reassessed as critically ill patients experience marked pharmacokinetic changes in both the volume of distribution and drug clearance rates compared to less sick patients. In addition, antibiotic administration, namely intermittent dosing vs continuous perfusion in time dependent drugs, and antibiotic lung penetration should be checked. A thorough history of the present illness can also raise the possibility of uncommon bacterial and fungal causes of severe pneumonia that may not respond to some empiric antibiotic regimens (Fig. 2). Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there is greater recognition of viral causes of severe pneumonia not responsive to empiric pneumonia therapy, including influenza (with or without bacterial co-infection), RSV, and finally HSV and CMV reactivation which have uncertain clinical impact.

Septic complication

Non-response could also be the result of concomitant sepsis either directly related to pneumonia or independent of a pulmonary infection. Septic complications because of pneumonia include secondary lung infection, parapneumonic pleural effusion, empyema, lung abscess, and necrotizing pneumonia. Loculated or persistent effusions frequently need a chest tube for source control, often in collaboration with interventional radiology and thoracic surgery. Other septic complications not directly due to pneumonia but that could mimic a non-responding pneumonia include endocarditis, Lemierre syndrome, acalculous cholecystitis, Clostridium difficile colitis, or other hospital-acquired infections.

### A proposal for a comprehensive approach to infections across the surgical pathway [^113KQBsm]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

In the past 20 years, the incidence of intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) caused by MDROs has risen dramatically. Quinolone resistance, prevalence of ESBL-producing bacteria, prevalence and mechanisms of carbapenem resistance in the local environment, and the place of recent traveling should be always taken into account when antibiotic therapy is administered empirically. Generally, the most important factors in predicting the presence of resistant pathogens are acquisition in a healthcare setting (particularly if the patient becomes infected in the ICU or has been hospitalized for more than 1 week), corticosteroid use, organ transplantation, baseline pulmonary or hepatic disease, and previous antimicrobial therapy.

Previous antibiotic therapy is one of the most important risk factors for resistant pathogens. Inappropriate therapy in critically ill patients may have a strong negative impact on the outcome. An ineffective or inadequate antimicrobial regimen is one of the variables more strongly associated with unfavorable outcomes in critically ill patients. Broad empiric antibiotic therapy should be started as soon as possible in patients with organ dysfunction (sepsis) and septic shock. International guidelines for the management of sepsis and septic shock (the Surviving Sepsis Campaign) recommend intravenously administered antibiotics as soon as possible and in any case within the first hour of onset of sepsis and the use of broad-spectrum agents with adequate penetration of the presumed site of infection.

The results of microbiological testing may have great importance for the choice of therapeutic strategy of every patient, in particular, in the adaptation of targeted antibiotic treatment. They provide an opportunity to expand the antibiotic regimen if the initial choice was too narrow but also allow de-escalation of antibiotic therapy if the empirical regimen was too broad. Antibiotic de-escalation has been associated with lower mortality rates in ICU patients and is now considered a key practice for antimicrobial stewardship purposes. The duration of antibiotic therapy has been studied appropriately in the setting of intra-abdominal infections (IAIs).

In the event of uncomplicated IAIs, the infection involves a single organ and does not extend to the peritoneum. When the source of infection is treated effectively by surgical excision, postoperative antibiotic therapy is not necessary, as demonstrated in managing uncomplicated acute appendicitis or cholecystitis.

4.4.3 Antibiotic treatment

In suspected bacterial sepsis, administration of the appropriate treatment within the first hour significantly reduces the rate of mortality. A delay in antibiotic treatment in the general population has been shown to increase sepsis‐related mortality by 8% per hour of delay. A UK population study of sepsis‐related maternal mortality showed that of women who died from sepsis, only 33% received antibiotics within the first hour after diagnosis, and 58% within 3 h.

Empiric broad‐spectrum antibiotics should be commenced within 1 h of recognition of sepsis. Treatment should not be delayed while awaiting results of investigations. Antibiotics should be tailored to the likely source and pathogens, and local patterns of resistance. Patients should be reassessed daily to monitor response to treatment and the need for ongoing intravenous antibiotic therapy. Once a pathogen is identified, treatment should be narrowed. Suggested empiric treatments are listed in Table 6; however, where available, local guidelines should be followed to reflect local patterns of resistance.

TABLE 6
Empiric antibiotics for maternal sepsis.

4.4.4 Antimicrobial stewardship

Antimicrobial stewardship should be considered to minimize antibiotic resistance. Coverage should be narrowed as soon as a causative organism is identified; however, given that pregnancy‐related or CS‐related sepsis polymicrobial infections are likely, the antibiotic should properly cover anaerobes. There is limited guidance on the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment; however, evidence from the non‐obstetric population indicates that shorter courses of antibiotics have similar efficacy to longer courses, but fewer side effects. Response to treatment should be assessed daily to determine the need for ongoing antibiotic therapy. All maternity services should work towards a lead for antibiotic stewardship alongside infectious diseases.

Guideline 16. AV access infection — general and medical management — states that "Blood cultures should always be obtained when an AV access infection is suspected", and site cultures "may help confirm causative organism and infection source". Initial treatment "includes immediate initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics (after attaining relevant cultures) for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organism coverage (eg, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam) and control of the infectious nidus (ie, source control)". "Ideally, the infected AV access should be avoided for dialysis", and "a CVC should be inserted and used until the AV access infection is resolved or, if not salvageable, until a new AV access can be established". "PICCs should be avoided in CKD and ESKD patients". Regimens should be adapted because "Antibiotic therapy should be altered accordingly to culture sensitivity results". "Antibiotics alone may be adequate treatment for limited localized AV access infections", but "AVG infections can rarely be treated with antibiotics alone", and care "should be patient individualized, and requires a multidisciplinary team approach". "The optimal duration of antibiotic therapy depends on the patient's circumstances and extent of infection".

### Intra-abdominal infections survival guide: a position statement by the global alliance for infections in surgery [^115XHCnd]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), another mechanism for neutralization of endotoxin and other bacterial toxins is controversial for surgical sepsis. In a meta-analysis of the clinical effectiveness of IVIg (18 RCTs), IVIg reduced sepsis mortality, but low study quality, heterogeneous Ig preparations and dosing regimens, and different comparators (placebo versus albumin) confounded interpretation. The available evidence is insufficient to support the widespread use of IVIg as therapy for sepsis.

Statement 22

For adults with septic shock, early and properly administered empiric antibiotic therapy has a significant impact on outcome (Moderate-quality evidence, Strong recommendation).

Early, appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy for septic shock can have a substantial beneficial impact on outcome, independent of the anatomic origin of infection. Given the high risk of death from septic shock and the strong association of delayed antibiotic therapy with mortality, prompt antibiotic administration is crucial. However, for sepsis without shock, the association between time to antibiotic administration and mortality is less pronounced. Therefore, absent shock and if source control is adequate, it may be possible to defer antibiotic therapy until culture and susceptibility testing can inform targeted therapy.

Duration of antibiotic agent therapy — We recommend limiting antimicrobial agent therapy to four days for low- and high-risk patients with source control achieved via a percutaneous drainage procedure (Grade 1-B). We recommend limiting antimicrobial agent therapy to four days after achieving source control in high-risk patients with sepsis (Grade 1-B). We recommend limiting antimicrobial agent therapy to four days after achieving source control in higher risk patients at increased risk of complications from diabetes mellitus, obesity, or higher illness severity (Grade 1-B). We suggest limiting antimicrobial agent therapy to eight days in critically ill patients after achieving adequate source control of IAI (Grade 2-B).

### Does antibiotic treatment affect the diagnostic accuracy ofF-FDG PET / CT studies in patients with suspected infectious processes? [^112BYSDD]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

18 F-FDG PET/CT plays a significant role in the assessment of various infectious processes. Patients with suspected or known sites of infection are often referred for 18 F-FDG imaging while already receiving antibiotic treatment. The current study assessed whether antibiotic therapy affected the detectability rate of infectious processes by 18 F-FDG PET/CT. Methods: A 5-y retrospective study of all adult patients who underwent 18 F-FDG PET/CT in search of a focal source of infection was performed. The presence, duration, and appropriateness of antibiotic treatment before 18 F-FDG imaging were recorded. Diagnosis of an infectious process was based on microbiologic or pathologic data as well as on clinical and radiologic follow-up. Results: Two hundred seventeen patients underwent 243 PET/CT studies in search of a focal source of infection and were included in the study. Sixty-seven studies were excluded from further analysis because of a final noninfectious etiology or lack of further follow-up or details regarding the antibiotic treatment. The final study population included 176 18 F-FDG PET/CT studies in 153 patients (107 men, 46 women; age range, 18–86 y). One hundred nineteen studies (68%) were performed in patients receiving antibiotic therapy for a range of 1–73 d. A diagnosis of infection was made in 107 true-positive cases (61%), including 63 studies (59%) in patients receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy started before the performance of the 18 F-FDG PET/CT study. There were 52 true-negative (29%) and 17 false-positive (10%) 18 F-FDG PET/CT studies. No false-negative results were found. Conclusion: 18 F-FDG PET/CT correctly identified foci of increased uptake compatible with infection in most patients, including all patients receiving appropriate antimicrobial therapy, with no false-negative cases. On the basis of the current study results, the administration of antibiotics appears to have no clinically significant impact on the diagnostic accuracy of 18 F-FDG PET/CT performed for evaluation of known or suspected infectious processes.

### Optimal antibiotic use in the intensive care unit [^113qkY3D]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Initial empiric treatment and combination therapy

Given the high prevalence of sepsis and septic shock, intensivists frequently face the decision of initiating antibiotic therapy and selecting the appropriate regimen. Empiric therapy is started when an infection is suspected before microbiology results are available. Once the pathogen has been identified and susceptibility testing performed, the empiric regimen can be tailored to directed or definitive therapy. Concordant therapy refers to an antibiotic choice that is active against the isolated bacterium(a) based on in vitro susceptibility testing. In the ICU, recognizing an infectious process is crucial. No absolute constellation of signs and symptoms or tests can unequivocally diagnose sepsis, thus clinicians must rely on the available clinical information and decide under uncertainty if empiric antibiotics will be beneficial or harmful. Typical symptoms can suggest an infectious syndrome, but older patients with multiple comorbidities often present ambiguously, with a wider differential diagnosis and higher mortality absent appropriate treatment. Up to a third of patients with presumed sepsis may ultimately have a sepsis mimic and potentially experience harm from broad-spectrum antibiotics. Critically ill patients have higher sepsis prevalence than non-ICU patients, therefore increasing the pretest probability of life-threatening infection.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) SEP-1 measures recommend immediate antibiotics — typically broad spectrum with MRSA and pseudomonal coverage — within 1 to 3 hours of sepsis recognition. Kumar et al described that each hour of delay in starting antibiotics led to a 7.6% decrease in survival for patients with septic shock. Other studies, examining timely antibiotic administration alone or as part of a sepsis care bundle, supported these findings, with the greatest benefit of early antibiotic initiation in patients with septic shock. Seymour et al.'s study of 50,000 patients treated for sepsis found that the 7% increased hourly risk of death was not present in those not requiring vasopressors. This differentiation led IDSA to caution against blanket recommendations for Rapid antibiotics in all sepsis cases, favoring a Rapid evaluation within the first 3−5 hours. This way, uninfected patients may be protected from the side effects of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Even in critically ill patients suspected of having a hospital-acquired infection, too rapid initiation of antibiotics in the absence of shock can result in adverse consequences, including higher mortality.

### The early antibiotic therapy in septic patients – milestone or sticking point? [^114yBDo1]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Rationale for early antibiotic therapy

Worldwide, the annual prevalence of sepsis is estimated at 19 million cases. The mortality rates in severe sepsis were reduced to 20% to 30% because of advances in training, recognition, surveillance, monitoring, and rapid initial antibiotic therapy and organ support. The most recent update of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines was published in 2013. A consensus committee provided valuable and clear recommendations on treatment of sepsis and septic shock (Table 1). One of the main focuses is the administration of a broad-spectrum antibiotic (Table 2). It is recommended that antimicrobials be administrated within the first hour of recognition of septic shock and severe sepsis without septic shock. Moreover, it is recommended that initial anti-infective therapy include one or more drugs that have activity against all likely pathogens and penetrate in adequate concentrations into the target tissue. The selected antibiotic strategy should anticipate the site of infection, medical and culture history, and local microbial susceptibility results, all in an emergency situation.

### Antimicrobial resistance… [^117PcCKP]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance
- Antibiotics are drugs that kill certain kinds of germs called bacteria and stop their growth.
- Anytime antibiotics are used, they can cause side effects and contribute to antimicrobial resistance.
- Antibiotics aren't always the answer when you're sick. Use antibiotics only when you need them to protect yourself from harms caused by unnecessary antibiotic use and fight antimicrobial resistance. Antibiotics FAQs What are bacteria. Bacteria are germs found inside and outside of our bodies. Most germs are harmless. Some are helpful to humans. However, bacteria can cause infections, like strep throat and urinary tract infections. What is an antibiotic. Antibiotics are drugs that kill certain kinds of germs called bacteria and stop their growth. Antibiotics are critical tools for preventing and treating infections caused by specific bacteria in people, animals and crops.

In health care, antibiotics are one of our most powerful drugs for fighting life-threatening bacterial infections. We need antibiotics to treat life-threatening conditions caused by bacteria. What is a virus. Viruses are germs different from bacteria. They cause infections, such as colds and flu. However, antibiotics do not treat infections caused by viruses. Keep Reading: Take antibiotics ONLY when you need them. Antimicrobial resistance What is antimicrobial resistance. Antimicrobial resistance happens when germs like bacteria and fungi develop the ability to defeat the drugs designed to kill them. That means the germs continue to grow. Resistant infections can be difficult, and sometimes impossible, to treat. Bacteria and fungi do not have to be resistant to every antibiotic or antifungal to be dangerous. Resistance to even one antibiotic can mean serious problems.

Antimicrobial resistance can affect any person, at any stage of life. Antimicrobial resistance does not mean our body is resistant to antibiotics or antifungals. Many medical advances are dependent on the ability to fight infections using antibiotics, including joint replacements, organ transplants, cancer therapy, and the treatment of chronic diseases like diabetes, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis. If antibiotics and antifungals lose their effectiveness, then we lose the ability to treat infections and control these public health threats. Aside from health care, antimicrobial resistance also impacts the veterinary and agriculture industries.
