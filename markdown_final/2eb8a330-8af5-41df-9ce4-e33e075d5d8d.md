## Question

How complex is trimaleolar fracture

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how complex a trimalleolar ankle fracture is and why it is considered complex. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the anatomic definition and the biomechanical implications of involving three malleoli. Then, I should verify the imaging complexity and how often radiographs miss critical details. Next, I will examine surgical decision-making and fixation strategy variability. After that, I need to assess complication profiles and reoperation risks. Finally, I should consider patient factors and rehabilitation needs, and synthesize a concise conclusion that ties these domains together.

> Let me first confirm the anatomic definition and biomechanics. A trimalleolar fracture involves the lateral malleolus of the fibula, the medial malleolus of the tibia, and the posterior malleolus, which means the injury disrupts both the medial and lateral columns and the posterior tibial plafond, destabilizing the ankle mortise and syndesmosis. This tri-column involvement inherently creates instability and mandates anatomic restoration to preserve joint congruity and function.

> Wait, let me verify the imaging complexity before drawing conclusions. Plain radiographs frequently underappreciate posterior malleolar fragment size, articular impaction, and syndesmotic involvement; surgeons report changing operative plans in more than 25% of cases after reviewing CT, and CT-based posterior malleolus classifications show only modest interobserver agreement, underscoring the morphologic variability and the need for advanced imaging to guide fixation decisions [^115gMgTT]. Hold on, I should also check whether 3D-CT further refines planning; yes, 3D-CT alters surgical approach, posterior fixation method, and sequence in a substantial proportion of trimalleolar cases, indicating that even standard CT may not fully capture spatial relationships in some patterns [^117YASeW].

> I will now examine surgical decision-making and fixation strategy variability. There is no universal consensus on when to fix the posterior malleolus, with decisions driven by fragment size, displacement, and articular involvement; biomechanical data suggest that even small posterior fragments can alter contact pressures, yet load-to-failure may not differ with fixation of very small fragments, which fuels ongoing debate and variability in practice patterns. Let me consider approach selection next; posterior-based approaches are increasingly used for direct reduction and buttress plating of posterior fragments, but meta-analytic data show trade-offs in infection versus pain and hardware symptoms compared with lateral approaches, highlighting that technique selection is nuanced and surgeon-dependent [^114scrze]. I should double-check whether surgeons frequently change their mind intraoperatively; indeed, OTA survey data show that CT frequently converts non-fixation plans to fixation and changes operative approaches, reflecting the difficulty of anticipating posterior fragment behavior on radiographs alone [^115gMgTT].

> Next, I should review complication profiles and reoperation risks. Large registry data show that bimalleolar and trimalleolar fractures carry higher risks of short-term complications, particularly infection, and higher long-term reoperation rates, with implant removal being the most common reason and a cumulative incidence around 17% within three years; trimalleolar patterns also have a higher likelihood of eventual arthrodesis or revision, albeit at low absolute rates [^111BronQ] [^114xoeeG]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to ensure I'm attributing risk correctly — these elevated risks persist after adjusting for age and comorbidity, reinforcing that the injury pattern itself contributes to complexity and adverse outcomes [^111BronQ].

> Let me consider patient factors that amplify complexity. Older adults, particularly women with osteoporosis, have a second epidemiologic peak for unstable bimalleolar and trimalleolar fractures, and age over 75 independently increases short-term complication risk. Diabetes, chronic pulmonary, renal, or liver disease, and peripheral vascular disease further compound perioperative morbidity, while obesity and diabetes together increase in-hospital complications and length of stay, all of which complicate fixation choices and postoperative recovery [^1116w9V7] [^111BronQ] [^116rDUGJ]. I should confirm that these comorbidity burdens also track with longer-term functional limitations. Yes, multimorbidity clusters are associated with excess mortality after fractures, emphasizing the need for comprehensive perioperative care in this population [^113WeBxo].

> I need to check rehabilitation implications and functional recovery. Trimalleolar fractures are frequently categorized as complex fractures requiring structured, multidisciplinary rehabilitation after hospital discharge, yet return-to-work rates remain modest at 50–64% by two years, reflecting persistent pain, stiffness, and instability; this prolonged recovery trajectory and the need for staged rehabilitation add another layer of complexity beyond the operating room [^113LZCYy]. But wait, what if early mobilization is emphasized; even with stable fixation, the tri-column injury and potential syndesmotic incompetence often necessitate careful progression to protect the repair, which can delay full functional recovery compared with simpler malleolar patterns [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize and ensure I haven't missed a key domain. Trimalleolar fractures are complex because they combine tri-column anatomic disruption with biomechanical instability, imaging uncertainty that drives frequent intraoperative plan changes, lack of standardized fixation algorithms for the posterior malleolus, higher complication and reoperation rates, and vulnerability to adverse outcomes in older or comorbid patients; together, these factors mandate advanced imaging, meticulous surgical planning, and coordinated rehabilitation to optimize outcomes [^115gMgTT] [^111BronQ] [^113LZCYy].

Trimalleolar fractures are among the **most complex ankle injuries** because they involve all three malleoli (medial, lateral, and posterior), disrupting the mortise and syndesmosis, and are often unstable with intra-articular extension [^116HRvVN]. Management is complicated by the need for **precise anatomic reduction** of the posterior malleolus to restore joint congruity and stability, frequent syndesmotic injury, and a high risk of post-traumatic arthritis and chronic instability if not treated optimally [^117XJbPW] [^114xoeeG]. Preoperative CT is **strongly recommended** to define fragment size, displacement, and joint involvement, as it frequently alters surgical planning and fixation strategy [^115gMgTT] [^112Gmhdh]. Surgical fixation is usually required, with outcomes closely linked to the accuracy of reduction and the stability of fixation [^notfound].

---

## Anatomical complexity

Trimalleolar fractures involve the **medial, lateral, and posterior malleoli**, each with distinct biomechanical roles:

- **Medial malleolus**: Provides medial stability and anchors the deltoid ligament.
- **Lateral malleolus**: Stabilizes the lateral ankle and maintains fibular length.
- **Posterior malleolus**: Supports the posterior tibial plafond and stabilizes the syndesmosis.

This three-malleolus involvement **destabilizes the ankle mortise**, causing malalignment, loss of joint congruity, and syndesmotic instability [^116HRvVN].

---

## Biomechanical complexity

Trimalleolar fractures disrupt normal ankle biomechanics by destabilizing the mortise, leading to malalignment and abnormal joint contact pressures [^117XJbPW]. Posterior malleolus fragments can impinge or shear the joint surface, further compromising stability and function. Syndesmotic instability is common and often requires **specific fixation** to restore joint integrity [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Patients typically present with:

- **Severe pain and swelling**: Localized to the ankle.
- **Deformity**: Often with external rotation or abduction.
- **Inability to bear weight**: Due to instability and pain [^115H93Uy].

Imaging is essential for accurate diagnosis and planning:

- **Plain radiographs**: Initial assessment of fracture pattern and displacement.
- **Computed tomography (CT)**: Gold standard for defining fragment size, displacement, and joint involvement; alters surgical planning in ~25% of cases [^115gMgTT] [^117YASeW].
- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: Useful for assessing soft tissue injuries, including deltoid ligament and syndesmotic injuries [^112Gmhdh].

---

## Classification systems

Several classification systems guide management:

| **Classification system** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Lauge-Hansen | Based on mechanism of injury (e.g. pronation-abduction, supination-external rotation) [^112EpFoc] |
| AO/OTA | Alphanumeric system classifying fractures by location and severity [^notfound] |
| Haraguchi | Specifically for posterior malleolus fractures, based on fragment size and location [^112kCSac] |

---

These systems help standardize **communication and guide treatment decisions**, though interobserver variability exists [^1177yzek].

---

## Treatment complexity

Trimalleolar fractures **typically require surgical intervention** to restore joint congruity and stability. Nonoperative management is reserved for minimally displaced, stable fractures in low-demand patients [^notfound]. Surgical treatment involves:

- **Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF)**: Standard approach for displaced fractures, aiming for anatomic reduction and stable fixation [^114scrze].
- **Posterior malleolus fixation**: Critical for restoring joint congruity and stability; fragment size > 25% of the joint surface or > 2 mm displacement generally indicates fixation [^notfound].
- **Syndesmotic fixation**: Often required to stabilize the distal tibiofibular joint [^notfound].

---

## Surgical approaches and techniques

Surgeons employ various approaches based on fracture pattern and surgeon preference:

- **Lateral approach**: Commonly used for lateral malleolus fixation.
- **Medial approach**: Used for medial malleolus fixation.
- **Posterior approach**: Preferred for posterior malleolus fixation, providing direct visualization and stable fixation [^notfound].

Recent advances include the use of **3D CT** for preoperative planning and patient-specific implants to improve accuracy and outcomes [^117YASeW].

---

## Complications and outcomes

Trimalleolar fractures are associated with **significant complications**, including:

- **Post-traumatic arthritis**: Due to joint incongruity and cartilage damage [^notfound].
- **Chronic ankle instability**: Resulting from ligamentous injury and improper reduction [^115H93Uy].
- **Infection and wound healing problems**: Particularly in open fractures or patients with comorbidities [^111BronQ].
- **Malunion and nonunion**: Especially in osteoporotic or poorly managed cases [^notfound].

Functional outcomes vary, with many patients experiencing **persistent pain, stiffness, and reduced mobility**. However, with accurate reduction and stable fixation, satisfactory results are achievable [^113U5SzQ].

---

## Factors influencing complexity

Several factors influence the complexity of trimalleolar fractures:

- **Fragment size and displacement**: Larger posterior fragments significantly increase complexity and the need for fixation [^notfound].
- **Soft tissue injury**: Extensive soft tissue damage complicates surgical management and increases infection risk [^113KL8BV].
- **Patient factors**: Age, osteoporosis, and comorbidities (e.g. diabetes, vascular disease) complicate treatment and recovery [^1116w9V7] [^113WeBxo].
- **Mechanism of injury**: High-energy trauma often results in more complex fracture patterns and associated injuries [^113KL8BV].

---

## Current research and advancements

Recent research focuses on improving diagnostic accuracy, surgical techniques, and outcomes. Advances include **3D CT imaging** for preoperative planning, minimally invasive surgical techniques, and improved implant designs. Rehabilitation protocols emphasize early mobilization and structured physical therapy to optimize recovery [^notfound].

---

Trimalleolar fractures are among the **most complex ankle injuries**, requiring precise diagnosis, careful surgical planning, and skilled execution. Their complexity arises from the involvement of all three malleoli, biomechanical instability, and high risk of complications. Advances in imaging, surgical techniques, and rehabilitation continue to improve outcomes for these challenging injuries.

### Neuropsychologic outcomes in patients treated for complex maxillofacial trauma [^115k11W2]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Complex fractures of the craniofacial skeleton are caused most commonly, in Australia, by motor vehicle accidents, falls, and interpersonal violence. Significant force is required to fracture the facial skeleton, and the long-term effect these forces have on higher brain function is unclear. The study aim was to assess long-term neuropsychologic changes associated with complex fractures of the facial skeleton. Patients managed for complex fractures of the facial skeleton by the Australian Craniofacial Unit, South Australia, between 2002 and 2011, with at least 1-year follow-up, were assessed using the European Brain Injury Questionnaire. This questionnaire has previously published control data to which results were compared. Of the 2077 patients treated for facial fractures, 46 were identified as having complex fractures of the facial skeleton. Of the 46 patients, 13 were able to be contacted and assessed using the European Brain Injury Questionnaire. Changes in personality and ability to socialize and undertake executive function were noted in approximately 30% of the patients. In addition, approximately 50% of the patients' family members reported significant changes in the patients' life after the accident, yet this was only recognized by approximately 30% of the patients. This study shows that, despite the "crumple zone" of the facial skeleton providing some level of protection to the brain, patients having complex fractures of the facial skeleton have long-term neuropsychologic changes that affect both their own and their family's quality of life.

### Comparison of early adverse events after operative treatment of bimalleolar and trimalleolar fractures versus pilon fractures [^113ngwP5]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Ankle fractures requiring open reduction and internal fixation vary in severity from unimalleolar fractures to bimalleolar/trimalleolar (BT) fractures to pilon fractures. Consequently, the postoperative outcomes with these surgeries can vary. Most previous studies of these injuries had small sample sizes, studied a single risk factor or adverse event, or did not compare different injuries by severity. The purpose of the present study was to describe and compare the patient characteristics and postoperative outcomes of 2 high-energy ankle fractures: BT and pilon fractures. The relevant patients were identified from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database using the Current Procedural Terminology codes for BT and pilon fractures. Patient demographics, characteristics, comorbidities, and 30-day mortality and adverse events were recorded and compared between the 2 types of ankle fractures. More than 45% of patients with these fracture types were aged 40 to 65 years. Pilon fractures occurred more frequently in younger patients, were more likely to occur in men, required a longer hospital stay and operative time, were less likely to occur in patients with a body mass index of > 30 kg/m², and conferred a greater risk of wound complications (odds ratio 1.76; p = .048) compared with BT fractures. The findings from the present study help us understand the differences in patient characteristics and potential early adverse events after open reduction and internal fixation of BT fractures versus pilon fractures.

### Are complex skull fractures indicative of either child abuse or major trauma in the era of 3-dimensional computed tomography imaging? [^111cHoba]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was to determine whether complex skull fractures are more indicative of child abuse or major trauma than simple skull fractures.

Design

This is a retrospective chart and imaging review of children diagnosed with a skull fracture. Subjects were from 2 pediatric tertiary care centers. Children younger than 4 years who underwent a head computed tomography with 3-dimensional rendering were included. We reviewed the medical records and imaging for type of skull fracture, abuse findings, and reported mechanism of injury. A complex skull fracture was defined as multiple fractures of a single skull bone, fractures of more than 1 skull bone, a nonlinear fracture, or diastasis of greater than 3 mm. Abuse versus accident was determined at the time of the initial evaluation with child abuse physician team confirmation.

Results

From 2011 to 2012, 287 subjects were identified by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, code. The 147 subjects with a cranial vault fracture and available 3-dimensional computed tomography composed this study's subjects. The average age was 12.3 months. Seventy four (50.3%) had complex and 73 (49.7%) had simple fractures. Abuse was determined in 6 subjects (4.1%), and a determination could not be made for 5 subjects. Adding abused children from 2013 to 2014 yielded 15 abused subjects. Twelve of the abused children (80%) had complex fractures; more than the 66 (48.5%) of 136 accidentally injured children (P = 0.001; relative risk = 1.65 [1.21–2.24]). However, among children with a complex fracture, the positive predictive value for abuse was only 7%.

Conclusions

Complex skull fractures frequently occur from accidental injuries. This study suggests that the presence of complex skull fractures should not be used alone when making a determination of abuse.

### Application of 3D printing and framework internal fixation technology for high complex rib fractures [^11585e4Z]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chest injuries often cause multiple rib fractures and serious complications. At present, the surgical fixation of multiple rib fractures has been widely used in the world, which can achieve good results. Besides, with the development of internal fixation equipment and the continuous in-depth research, surgical methods have become minimally invasive. However, surgery of high complex rib fractures is still considered difficult due to the position of fractures, the coverage of strong pectoral muscles (mammary gland in women) the complex structure of anatomy and multiple fracture segments. The rib fractures meet the following requirements are classified as high complex rib fractures: (1) has one to three fractures in the 2nd to 4th ribs; (2) each fracture site has ≥ 3 fracture segment; (3) the length of the middle fracture segment ≤ 5 cm; (4) the presence of costal cartilage fracture. At present, fractures involving this part are usually widely separated from the chest wall muscle layer by a diagonal incision of the chest muscle or subbreast fold, resulting in long incisions and large injuries. Minimally invasive tunnel fixation with minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO) has a tiny surgical incision, whereas the visual field is not well exposed. In addition, the locking plate shaping during the procedure is often difficult, time consuming and requires multiple adjustments due to the multi-segment fractures of ribs accompanied with significant deformities of chest curvature, longitudinal torsion rate and deployment curvature. Furthermore, locking plate is difficult to achieve a good fit with the ribs, resulting in increased probability of thoracic deformity, and displacement of fixator and screws after surgery. Some studies have found that insufficient fixation can lead to fracture nonunion, delayed union and secondary surgical fixation. Therefore, preoperative planning and intraoperative reduction of rib fracture are the key factors to achieve good clinical outcomes in internal fixation of high complex rib fractures.

Computer tomography (CT), three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction, and 3D model printing technology have been successfully used in the preoperative planning of a variety complex cases such as fractures and reconstruction of chest wall defects. There are also reports showing that 3D printing is beneficial for internal fixation of rib fractures. However, not many studies have demonstrated the use of 3D printing technology for preoperative planning, and the specific operation skills of high complex rib fractures. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the feasibility and clinical efficacy of pre-shaping locking plates based on 3D printed rib models, as well as the application of framework internal fixation techniques in minimally invasive surgery of high complex rib fractures.

### Complex orthopaedic trauma is shifting away from level I to non-level I trauma centers: an analysis of the national trauma data bank [^113UN46K]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Participants

Patients between 18 and 65 years of age who received treatment for complex orthopaedic trauma were included in the study. We defined complex orthopaedic trauma as a complex surgical fracture fixation or a time-sensitive orthopaedic fracture. The complex fracture fixations we considered for this study were nondiaphyseal (articular or periarticular), open or closed fractures, requiring surgical treatment by internal fixation (after open or closed reduction), excluding hip and distal radius fractures: proximal humerus, distal humerus, proximal tibia, distal tibia, and distal femur. Fractures of the pelvis, acetabulum, calcaneus, and talus were also considered complex. International Classification of Diseases Revision 9 diagnostic codes and procedure codes were used for years 2008 to 2015, and International Classification of Diseases Revision 10 diagnostic codes and procedure codes were used for years 2016 to 2017 (Table 1). Time-sensitive procedures included Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF) or Closed Reduction and Internal Fixation (CRIF) of the following fractures that require timely management: open tibia fractures, open femoral shaft fractures, open distal femur fractures, closed femoral shaft fractures, and open or closed femoral neck fractures in patients aged 50 years or younger (Table 1). A cutoff of 50 years of age was selected to conform to similar studies, which used 50 years as the distinction between younger and older patients. Combining both the diagnostic and procedure codes reduced the chance for misclassification. In 2007 to 2015, the principal procedure codes applied were ORIF and CRIF. For 2016 to 2017 the procedure codes listed under reposition and internal fixation using open and percutaneous approaches were applied.

### Key components of rehabilitation programmes for adults with complex fractures following traumatic injury: a scoping review [^113LZCYy]. Injury (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Complex fractures are life-altering injuries associated with significant morbidity, which places a large burden on health and social care resources. The impact is felt by the individual, their family and friends, and wider society. Return to work rate is low, with only 50–64% returning to their previous employment by 2-years post injury. Inability to work often results in financial hardship and social isolation.

Complex fractures are injuries that involve severe breaks to a bone or multiple bones and require specialist treatment. The definition used by the James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership for complex fractures was also used in this review. This definition encompasses fractures to the pelvis, acetabulum, upper and lower extremities, where the bones are broken into multiple pieces (comminuted or intra articular), open fractures with significant soft tissue damage, and/or multiple fractures at the same time to one or more limbs. It does not include fractures to other parts of the body such as head, face, spine or ribs.

In the UK, most patients with complex fractures are treated acutely in a Major Trauma Centre or Trauma Unit, where all the required specialist teams and facilities are available. However, the question for this review focuses on the next stages of their recovery and specifically rehabilitation after hospital discharge. This is often referred to as outpatient or community rehabilitation and can take place in a variety of settings outside of acute hospital wards, for example, outpatient departments, community hospitals, leisure centres, or an individual's home or workplace.

The importance of rehabilitation in achieving good outcomes and preventing complications is well recognised. Rehabilitation is defined as a set of interventions designed to optimise function and reduce disability in individuals with health conditions. These interventions are complex and multifactorial but can be broken down into individual components. Each component is a planned rehabilitation activity and within the context of healthcare is prescribed and/or delivered by a trained healthcare professional. These activities can be physical, psychological, and/or socioenvironmental.

At present, it is unclear what the best rehabilitation strategy is for adults with complex fractures, after their discharge from hospital. The James Lind Alliance priority setting partnership for complex fractures highlighted the importance of this research question to stakeholders. The aim of this scoping review was to identify and map the breadth of evidence available on this topic. Ethical approval was obtained from (Coventry University) Ethics Committee (P161717).

Research question

What are the key components of interventions used to rehabilitate adults with complex fractures following traumatic injury after their discharge from hospital?

### C1-C2 wiring with timed self-obsolescence for complex C2 body fracture [^113LVDeQ]. Operative Neurosurgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Importance

Fractures of C2 are typically managed nonoperatively with good rates of healing. Management decisions are complicated, however, when there are additional fractures in the axis possibly leading to increased instability. Additionally, the techniques used for treating these unstable axis fractures can have either significant complications or permanent loss of range of motion. Here, we present a novel technique for the reduction and stabilization of complex C2 body fracture.

Clinical Presentation

A 34-yr-old woman with a complex C2 body fracture, which included a right pars and left lateral mass fracture, presented after a water slide accident. It was felt that this fracture was both unstable and would not heal in an anatomically acceptable way so an open surgical reduction was needed. After consideration of more traditional fusion and osteosynthesis techniques, we chose to perform a C1-C2 internal stabilization with C1 sublaminar and C2 spinous process wiring. The patient was then instructed to wear a Miami J collar for 3 mo.

Conclusion

The outcome was favorable with good approximation and healing with preserved range of motion.

### Posterior process fractures… [^113wbzWB]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Posterior Process Fractures The posterior process of the talus is composed of two tubercles, the lateral and medial. The lateral tubercle is the larger of the two and serves as the attachment of the posterior talocalcaneal and posterior talofibular ligaments. 9, 14, 15 The medial tubercle serves as the attachment for the posterior third of the deltoid ligament. 9, 14, 15 The under-surface of both tubercles forms the posterior fourth of the subtalar joint. 9, 14. 15 Physical examination findings in lateral tubercle fractures of the posterior process are highly consistent for tenderness to deep palpation anterior to the Achilles tendon over the posterior talus. The pain is often reproduced with plantar flexion and occasionally accentuated with dorsiflexion of the great toe. This is caused by compression of the fracture fragment as the flexor hallucis longus tendon passes between the medial and lateral tubercle.
15.

6, 9 When evaluating the fracture line, a rough, irregular cortical surface suggests the presence of an acute fracture. In acute injuries, this rough irregular surface may help distinguish a fracture from a normal os trigonum, which generally has a smooth, rounded cortical surface. 15 In chronic cases, these differences may be less distinct, making the distinction between a fracture and a normal os trigonum difficult. When the diagnosis is unclear and clinical suspicion is present, an MRI or CT will clearly demonstrate this fracture.
16. **FRACTURES OF THE POSTERIOR PROCESS**: MEDIAL TUBERCLE Diagnosis Visualization of the medial tubercle fracture on plain radiograph may be challenging, but the fracture can generally be seen on an oblique projection with the foot and ankle externally rotated 40 degrees and the beam centered 1 cm posterior and inferior to the medial malleolus 16,
17. However, CT or MRI may be necessary if the diagnosis is unclear.

16, 17 Treatment. Fracture of the Anterior Process of the Calcaneus The anterior process of the calcaneus is a saddle-shaped bony protuberance that articulates with the cuboid. It is attached to the cuboid by an interosseous ligament and to the cuboid and navicular bones by the strong bifurcate ligament.

### Fingertip injuries [^117Fk57r]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Distal phalanx fracture — etiology, imaging, treatment range, and antibiotics: "Fractures of the distal phalanx typically result from direct trauma such as crush injuries or an axial force to the fingertip". "Radiography is the initial imaging mode of choice. Anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique views show the fracture pattern and alignment". Treatment "ranges from stabilization in a composite aluminum and foam splint for 3 to 4 weeks to surgical intervention with open reduction and internal fixation for more complex (e.g., notable angulation or displacement) or open fractures". Additionally, "a systematic review failed to show that prophylactic antibiotics prevent the development of superficial infections or osteomyelitis after distal phalanx fractures".

### LeFort and complex midface fractures [^111ns48t]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Midfacial fractures, including LeFort fractures, are common injuries resulting from high-impact trauma. These fractures affect critical anatomic structures, including the maxilla, zygomaticomaxillary complex, and naso-orbito-ethmoid regions, leading to significant functional and aesthetic consequences. This article provides an in-depth analysis of fracture classification, clinical presentation, and diagnostic techniques, highlighting the role of computed tomography, three-dimensional imaging, and emerging technologies in fracture detection and surgical planning. Management strategies, advances in computer-aided surgery and 3D printing, and complications alongside innovative solutions for prevention and management are discussed. This article also aims to guide clinicians in the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of these complex injuries.

### Effects of three-dimensional CT on surgical plans for trimalleolar ankle fractures [^117YASeW]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Three-dimensional CT (3D-CT) has enhanced medical imaging by producing detailed surface renderings from two-dimensional CT scans. As an advancement beneficial in orthopaedic trauma, 3D-CT offers improved visualization of fracture geometry, size, and spatial relationships. For trimalleolar ankle fractures, specifically, 3D-CT could refine surgical planning and classification. Multiple studies have investigated the effect of 3D-CT on various injuries, yet the effect on trimalleolar fractures remains underexplored.

Methods

Our study examined the influence of 3D-CT on preoperative planning for trimalleolar ankle fractures, comparing it with preoperative planning using radiographs and CT. Patient records were reviewed from January 1, 2017, to May 24, 2021. Four orthopaedic surgeons analyzed preoperative imaging in two phases: initially with radiographs and CT and then with the inclusion of 3D-CT. Each reviewer then completed a questionnaire consisting of fracture classification and surgical planning questions. Statistical analysis was completed using Cohen kappa coefficient.

Results

Analysis of 42 patient cases revealed notable differences in surgical approaches, posterior fixation methods, and fixation sequences when using 3D-CT (1-[k] > 0.70). Changes in Mason classification (1-[k] = 0.62) and order of lateral fixation (1-[k] = 0.67) approached significance; however, variability in intraobserver reliability was noted among reviewers.

Conclusions

3D-CT markedly influences preoperative planning for trimalleolar ankle fractures, specifically involving decisions about the posterior malleolus fragment. Future research should be aimed toward a comparison of preoperative planning with real-world surgical outcomes while also weighing the cost of 3D-CT.

### Complex orbital fractures: three-dimensional planning and combined surgical approach [^116KT2nU]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Nowadays the development of diagnostic imaging, surgical techniques, alloplastic materials, and surgical instruments has made possible a more accurate management of orbital fractures. The aim of the present study was the management of orbital fractures and the solution of particular cases. The use of high-resolution computed tomography makes possible to gain a better understanding of the complex orbit anatomical structure. Also endoscopy is a valid alternative for medial orbital wall fractures treatment. It gives high control of the fracture site and its reduction. When this technology is combined with 3-dimensional (3D) reformatted images, it allows us to reconstruct more accurately the orbital defects. The authors present their experience in complex orbital fractures treated with the aim of the 3D navigation using a preformed orbital titanium plate. Endosopical approach was used to control plate positioning.

### Posterior malleolar fracture assessment: an independent interobserver and intraobserver validation of three computed tomography-based classifications [^112kCSac]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

When all three classifications are compared, it is clear that some similarities exist based on descriptions. It is necessary to remember that all those classifications were arbitrarily chosen by morphology assessment. Because of the lack of physiopathological studies, these types might not be different. For example, a prior study on posterior malleolus fracture suggests that type III and type I of Haraguchi classification may be a continuous spectrum. We believe that an ideal classification of posterior malleolus fracture should include a physiopathological or severity pathway to contribute to clinical decision making.

This study has some weaknesses to take into account. First, the sample size was selected for convenience. One of the disadvantages of this process is that it can over or underrepresent certain groups of patients within the sample size. However, this nonprobability method allowed us to select patients with a trimalleolar ankle fracture, often surgically treated because they are considered unstable. Second, this independent study was not multicentric, which is recommended during a validation process of any classification. Third, we do not have precise information for explaining why only some patients had a 3D reconstruction, confirming a selection bias that could not be addressed. The strength of this study is that it was conducted following the GRRAS. Moreover, the level of agreement was obtained using six evaluators with different levels of expertise. This independent study provided insights into the shortcomings of the current classifications of posterior malleolus ankle fractures. Future studies are necessary to formulate a new classification under strict guidelines, which gives orientation to the surgeon during the decision-making process.

### Complex and rare fracture patterns in perilunate dislocations [^11458sJo]. Hand (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

The wrist represents a complex anatomic region in the upper extremity and a highly functional and intricate structural joint. Perilunate injuries have classically been described as involving a greater or lesser arc as described by Mayfield and imply a specific pattern of force transmission. The greater and lesser arc classifications do not include descriptions of when non-scaphoid carpal fractures occur as part of a perilunate injury.

Methods/Results

We present three cases of complex and rare perilunate fracture dislocation patterns and discuss the surgical management as a treatment model for these complex wrist injuries: the trans-scaphoid, trans-capitate perilunate dislocation, the trans-scapholunate ligament, trans-capitate dislocation, and the trans-scaphoid, trans-triquetral perilunate dislocation.

Discussion

Although there is a low incidence of injury to non-scaphoid carpal bones, it is beneficial to understand the approach to the perilunate reduction and scaphoid fixation through a combined volar and dorsal approach, which will also allow for the reduction and fixation of more rare and complex carpal fractures.

### Complications after ankle fracture surgery in Finland between 1998 and 2020 [^111BronQ]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2024). Medium credibility.

Background:

Ankle fracture is a common injury and often requires operative treatment. This study investigated short-term (≤ 4 months) and long-term (> 4 months) complications after ankle fracture surgery in a 23-year period with use of data from a comprehensive, nationwide, individual-level register.

Methods:

Data regarding patients who underwent operative treatment for ankle fracture were collected from the Finnish Care Register for Health Care and analyzed with use of logistic and Cox regression.

Results:

A total of 83,666 ankle fractures were operatively treated between 1998 and 2020. Of these, 36% were lateral malleolar fractures, 7% were medial malleolar fractures, 52% were bimalleolar or trimalleolar fractures, and 5% were other types of fractures. Fifty-one percent of the fractures were in female patients. The overall rate of short-term complications was 7.2%. Specifically, infection occurred in 4.4% of cases; thromboembolic complications,1.6% of cases; mechanical complications, 0.4% of cases; and other complications, 0.9% of cases. An age of > 75 years was associated with a higher rate of short-term complications than an age of 51 to 75 years, with an odds ratio of 1.53 in the multivariable analysis (95% confidence interval, 1.39 to 1.67; p < 0.001). Short-term complications were also more prevalent in patients with diabetes (with or without associated complications); chronic pulmonary, kidney, or liver disease; or peripheral vascular disease. Mortality during the first 4 months after the ankle fracture operation was 0.6%. The most common reason for reoperation in the long term (> 4 months after the index procedure) was fixation device removal, with a cumulative incidence of 17% within the first 3 years postoperatively. The risk of implant removal increased in younger patients and patients with bimalleolar or trimalleolar fractures. The cumulative incidence of ankle arthrodesis and arthroplasty was low.

Conclusions:

Although postoperative complications are relatively rare, their treatment can lead to considerable morbidity. The findings of this study allow us to identify patients who are prone to complications or reoperations after undergoing operative treatment for ankle fracture.

### Association of multimorbidity and excess mortality after fractures among Danish adults [^113WeBxo]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this cohort study suggest that concomitant illnesses naturally clustered into distinct multimorbidity clusters were associated with excess mortality after fracture. The combination of multimorbidity and a proximal fracture resulted in a compound increase in mortality, strongly indicating the need for more comprehensive approaches for high-risk patients. Our findings further support the need for future studies that address postfracture care of high-risk patients and examine the association between multimorbidity clusters and other sentinel health events.

### Ankle fracture with a complex injury mechanism and misleading hook test result: a case report [^112EpFoc]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Ankle fractures and their mechanisms of injury can be complex. We report a case of a patient with an uncertain mechanism of injury and an uncommon combination of lower extremity fractures, which fit the criteria for a Lauge-Hansen classification pronation-external-rotation fracture, Maisonneuve fracture, Wagstaffe fracture, and posterior pilon fracture. Plain radiographs and computed tomography scan revealed Chaput tubercle avulsion fractures, an anterior distal fibular fracture fragment, multiple lateral malleolar fractures, a posterior malleolar fracture fragment with proximal displacement, a die-punch fragment between the posterior malleolar fragment and the tibia, a proximal fibular fracture, and possible ankle syndesmotic diastasis. Intraoperative hook test was negative after fixation of the fractures, so syndesmotic fixation was not performed. At 3-month follow-up, plain radiographs showed obvious syndesmotic diastasis. At 1-year follow-up, symptoms persisted and syndesmotic fusion was recommended but declined by the patient. This case demonstrates that both ankle fractures and their mechanisms of injury can be remarkably complex and confusing, posterior pilon fractures can occur along with pronation-external-rotation ankle fractures, syndesmotic fixation should be considered for all patients with Maisonneuve fractures, reliance on the hook test for surgical management decisions may not always be reliable, and there exists a need for a more accurate and reliable intraoperative test to determine the presence of ankle syndesmotic injury.

### Management of fractures of the zygomaticomaxillary complex [^115gmvKP]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The zygomaticomaxillary complex (ZMC) has important aesthetic, structural, and functional roles that need to be preserved and/or restored during treatment of facial fractures. Surgical treatment of ZMC fractures is indicated when there is displacement of the bony fragments, and open reduction and internal fixation is the treatment of choice in cases of comminution or fracture instability. The surgical approaches used for fracture reduction as well as the type, number, and location of the fixation will be determined by the pattern of the fracture and the surgeon's preference. This article discusses the main points of the management of ZMC fractures.

Defining the strength of the recommendations — judging the strength of evidence is only a steppingstone towards arriving at the strength of a systematic literature review recommendation. The strength of recommendation also takes into account the quality, quantity, and the trade-off between the benefits and harms of a treatment, the magnitude of a treatment's effect, and whether there is data on critical outcomes. The recommendations and their strength were voted on by the guideline development group members during the final meeting, and recommendations were approved and adopted in instances where a simple majority (60%) of the guideline development group voted to approve.

### Interobserver agreement for the chest wall injury society taxonomy of rib fractures using computed tomography images [^115bV73e]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Study Design

Independent observers who were associated with CWIS, either as a member or as a colleague of a member who is involved in the care for patients with chest wall injury, were invited by email to evaluate axial, coronal, and sagittal images from 11 CT scans of rib fractures. An online platform (SurveyMonkey) was used to execute this survey. Multiple reminders to complete the survey were sent by email. The Medical Research Ethics Committee (MEC-2020–0883) exempted the study. No sample size calculations were made. The Guidelines for Reporting Reliability and Agreement Studies was used to ensure proper reporting of methods, results, and discussion (Supplemental Digital Content, Supplementary Data 1).

Observers

A total of 2,306 invitations, which included reminder emails, were sent to health care professionals associated with CWIS. The invitation contained a link that provided a single opportunity to fill out the survey to avoid duplicates. The observers were asked to classify type and displacement of rib fractures using the CWIS taxonomy definitions, which were provided in the survey. The CWIS categories for fracture type are as follows: Simple, Wedge, and Complex. A simple fracture is defined as one fracture line across the rib, a wedge fracture has a second fracture line that does not span the whole width of the rib, and a complex fracture has at least two fracture lines with one or more fragments spanning the width of the rib. The CWIS categories for fracture displacement are as follows: Undisplaced, Offset, and Displaced. Undisplaced fractures are defined where there is at least 90% contact between the cortical surfaces, displaced fractures where there is no cortical contact, and offset in between where there is some cortical contact but less than 90%. The introduction of the questionnaire provided the definitions and explanatory images with excerpts from the original taxonomy paper for the fracture and dislocation types. Observers were asked to indicate the anatomical sectors where the rib fracture was located, based on their own definitions, since no consensus was reached for the definition of the anatomic sectors for the localization of rib fractures in the CWIS taxonomy. At the end of the survey, observers were asked to explain how they distinguished between the anterior, lateral, and posterior rib sectors. Links to illustrations that demonstrated the definitions were provided for reference throughout any portion of the survey.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: management of hip fractures in older adults [^115Saq13]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis after hip fracture — NOAC/DOAC medication and research needs are described: NOAC/DOAC medication are an effective but more costly means of VTE prophylaxis for appropriately selected patients and are able to be administered in an oral route, with little education and no post discharge monitoring. The issue of VTE prophylaxis in patients who have sustained a hip fracture is complex, with many unanswered questions that have the potential to have a significant impact on clinical outcomes; a multi-armed randomized controlled study would be optimal and would potentially need to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of a multitude of chemical agents, at different dosages, with multiple time points (such as pre- and post-op), and include assorted durations of therapy, while utilizing contemporary diagnostic methodologies. Barriers include the low incidence of the complication implicating a requirement for a substantially large sample size and ethical concerns given the potential risks associated with under-treatment, and potentially well organized patient outcome registries and advances in large data-set machine learning algorithms may also help sort through the complexity of these mixed patient groups and their treatment needs.

### Beyond the break: development and validation of a new classification system for acute traumatic rib fractures [^112KFhs1]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 22,000–45,000 people per year sustain rib fractures in the USA. Despite the high incidence and significant injury burden of rib fractures, there is no universally agreed-upon taxonomy for acute traumatic rib fractures. Publications from the Chest Wall Injury Society (CWIS) were an important step toward framing a taxonomy. In 2020, Edwards et al proposed an initial taxonomy based on the Delphi method, but it has not yet gained widespread acceptance. In 2023, Nguyen et al released a refined consensus proposal, "Improved Chest Wall Trauma Taxonomy", which was another step forward with support from the American Society of Emergency Radiology along with improved descriptive terminology. Despite this, the CWIS working group could not reach a consensus for the descriptive anatomic sector of rib fractures based on chest CT imaging.

Patients with bicortically displaced rib fractures are more likely to develop pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and need for tracheostomy. An offset of 50% or greater axially has traditionally been the standard measure of displacementand as a basis for CWIS recommendations for rib fixation. However, evidence suggests that rib fractures are likely to displace further over time. Therefore, we think a new taxonomy should be developed that aims at clinical relevance whereas remaining easily communicable. Thus, we developed a novel taxonomy for acute rib fractures (TARF) with three components: (1) the rib that is fractured (including the laterality (right or left)), (2) the sector of the fracture (costochondral (CC), anterior (A), lateral (L), posterior (P), or transverse process (TP) associated), and (3) the severity of the fracture (single cortical (1), bicortical non-displaced (2), or displaced/distracted/comminuted (3)).

This TARF provides a simplistic, but finely discrete, descriptive model that can be used as a map for rib fractures. This map is useful for clinical communication with the team about the severity of rib fractures and is a tool for preoperative planning for rib stabilization. Additionally, this approach can be used in research to better compare patient groups whose rib fractures, to date, have been characterized simplistically as "rib fractures", ignoring which rib was broken, where the fracture was located on the rib, or its severity.

### Is gillies temporal incision necessary to successfully reduce zygomaticomaxillary fracture combined with orbital wall fracture? [^111wFUs7]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Gillies temporal approach has been widely used to reduce zygoma fractures. Traditionally, it is the preferred method to reduce the isolated zygomatic arch fracture. It can be combined with other approaches, such as subciliary and intraoral incisions for more complex zygomatic fractures, so-called tripod fractures. In this study, the author hypothesized that complex zygomaticomaxillary bone fracture reduction can successfully be achieved without Gillies temporal incision. The author retrospectively analyzed the medical records and 3D facial Computed Tomography (CT) scans of 80 patients who had orbitozygomaticomaxillary fractures that affected > 3 sites among the frontozygomatic suture, zygomaticomaxillary buttress, zygomatic arch, and orbital walls from May 2021 to August 2023. A single surgeon performed all surgical operations. All fractures were reduced with 2 incisions, lower eyelid incisions (subciliary or subconjunctival) and intraoral incisions (gingivobuccal approach), within a week of the initial traumatic event. After sufficient exposure to fractured sites using 2 incisions, the author reduced the fracture with a bony hook at the inferior orbital rim, lateral wall, or Boise elevator at the intraoral incision. All cases were successfully corrected without any complications. In conclusion, the author can successfully reduce complex zygomaticomaxillary fracture combined with orbital wall fractures without temporal Gillies approach.

This report introduced and evaluated our computer-assisted surgical method in the treatment of complex maxillofacial fractures. One patient with zygomatico-orbitomaxillary complex fracture underwent computed tomography to obtain DICOM data. Three-dimensional reconstruction and virtual surgical planning were carried out in the software MIMICS 10.01. Three reposition templates and 1 skull model were manufactured in our three-dimensional rapid prototyping machine. Reconstruction surgery was carried out according to the preoperative planning and with the guide of reposition templates. At 3-month follow-up, the treatment outcome was consistent with preoperative planning exactly, and the patient expressed high satisfaction with the surgery. Combination of reposition templates and rapid prototyping method demonstrated great practical value in complex maxillofacial fracture surgery.

Most distal radius fractures result from low-energy mechanisms and can be successfully treated nonsurgically or with a variety of surgical techniques if indicated. High-energy distal radius fractures can involve extensive comminution or bone loss with concomitant ligament, soft-tissue, and neurovascular injuries. In patients with complex distal radius fractures, reconstruction of the distal radius, ulna, and triangular fibrocartilage complex can be challenging. Effective restoration of the bony architecture requires intimate knowledge of the anatomy of the distal radius, a thorough understanding of the goals of treatment, versatility in surgical approaches, and familiarity with multiple fixation options.

### Medial malleolar fractures: current treatment concepts [^113tSDvq]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

The medial malleolus, once believed to be the primary stabilizer of the ankle, has been the topic of conflicting clinical and biomechanical data for many decades. Despite the relevant surgical anatomy being understood for almost 40 years, the optimal treatment of medial malleolar fractures remains unclear, whether the injury occurs in isolation or as part of an unstable bi- or trimalleolar fracture configuration. Traditional teaching recommends open reduction and fixation of medial malleolar fractures that are part of an unstable injury. However, there is recent evidence to suggest that nonoperative management of well-reduced fractures may result in equivalent outcomes, but without the morbidity associated with surgery. This review gives an update on the relevant anatomy and classification systems for medial malleolar fractures and an overview of the current literature regarding their management, including surgical approaches and the choice of implants.

### The surgical outcomes of unstable ankle fractures in patients aged > 65 years [^1116w9V7]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

With increased life expectancy, ankle fractures are the third most commonly seen fractures after hip and wrist fractures in the elderly osteoporotic population. In recent years there has been an increase in the prevalence and severity of ankle fractures in the elderly, especially of unstable bimalleolar and trimalleolar fracture types in females. Although epidemiological studies have shown that ankle fractures are often seen in young adults, the frequency of these fractures has been shown to reach a second peak in the 65–84 years age group (145–248/100,000), and this peak is more evident in females.

Modern ankle fracture treatment in the general population to obtain good functional healing and early mobilization is achieved with anatomic restoration of the ankle mortise and stable fixation. Excellent results are predicted with open reduction and internal fixation of unstable ankle fractures. However, because of various comorbidities such as diabetes, osteoporosis, peripheral vascular disease and cardiac problems, the results cannot be accurately predicted. It is important to obtain satisfactory results after unstable ankle fractures in the geriatric population because reduced ambulation will worsen the severity of pre-existing comorbidities and decrease the possibility of independent living.

Although ankle fractures in the elderly are frequently seen, the treatment method and results have not been evaluated in literature as comprehensively as for hip and wrist fractures.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the results, complications and relationships between complications and comorbidities of patients operated on for an unstable ankle fracture with the current literature.

### Timing of definitive fixation of major long bone fractures: can fat embolism syndrome be prevented? [^116JUgpq]. Injury (2017). Low credibility.

Fat embolism is common in patients with major fractures, but leads to devastating consequences, named fat embolism syndrome (FES) in some. Despite advances in treatment strategies regarding the timing of definitive fixation of major fractures, FES still occurs in patients. In this overview, current literature is reviewed and optimal treatment strategies for patients with multiple traumatic injuries, including major fractures, are discussed. Considering the multifactorial etiology of FES, including mechanical and biochemical pathways, FES cannot be prevented in all patients. However, screening for symptoms of FES should be standard in the pre-operative work-up of these patients, prior to definitive fixation of major fractures.

Zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures

A fracture of the zygomaticomaxillary complex results from a direct impact on the malar eminence that causes the underlying zygomatic bone to separate from the calvaria. The zygomatic bone is a paired irregular bone that forms part of the lateral orbital walls. Under normal conditions, it has four sutures with the rest of the facial skeleton and the calvaria. Zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures extend through these four borders (Fig. 11 a, b). Also called a tetrapod or quadripod fracture, this injury used to be called a tripod fracture because plain-film radiography was only able to show three disrupted borders. In fact, the fracture extends posteriorly through the sphenozygomatic suture, so there are four elements.

### Surgical fixation of quadrimalleolar fractures of the ankle [^113U5SzQ]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary

We present a technique of fixation of trimalleolar fractures with additional fracture of the anterior tibial tubercle ("quadrimalleolar") or anterior fibular rim ("quadrimalleolar equivalent"). Twenty-four patients with a mean age of 60 years were treated with open reduction and internal fixation of all 4 malleoli. There were 17 quadrimalleolar and 6 quadrimalleolar equivalent fractures. One patient had both anterior tibial and fibular avulsion fracture in addition to a trimalleolar ankle fracture. Surgical approaches and internal fixation were tailored individually. Twenty patients were operated in the prone position with direct fixation of the posterior malleolus and 4 patients in the supine position with anterior to posterior screw fixation of the posterior malleolus. After fixation of al 4 malleoli, only 1 patient (4%) required a syndesmotic screw for residual syndesmotic instability on intraoperative testing. There were no infections and no wound healing problems. All patients went on to solid union. Nineteen patients (79%) were followed for a mean of 77 months (range, 15–156 months). The Foot Function Index averaged 15 (range, 50 to 0), the Olerud and Molander Score averaged 79 (range, 45–100), and the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Ankle and Hindfoot Scale averaged 87 (range, 39–100). Fixation of the anterior and posterior tibial fragments increases syndesmotic stability by providing a bone-to-bone fixation. Anatomic reduction of the anterior and posterior tibial rim restores the physiological shape of the tibial incisura and therefore facilitates fibular reduction.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^116tzwrB]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Imaging in orthopaedic trauma — key points highlight that pelvic radiographs are important to obtain during the initial evaluation of the patient with multiple injuries because pelvic ring injuries can be life-threatening, plain radiographs should include anteroposterior (AP) and lateral views of long bones and three-views for joints, consider pelvic computed tomography (CT) with 3D reconstructions in complex pelvic fractures, CT is valuable in pre-operative planning for complicated fractures such as peri-articular fractures in which intra-articular involvement is suspected, pediatric fractures can occur without radiographic abnormalities, and perform imaging of the non- injured limb, as well as the injured limb, on a case-by-case basis. More than 60 percent of trauma patients have injuries involving the musculoskeletal system, and more than half of hospitalized trauma patients have at least one musculoskeletal injury that could be life-threatening, limb-threatening, or result in significant functional impairment, supporting the statement that appropriate imaging of orthopaedic injuries is essential to determine the best method of treatment.

### Association between diabetes, obesity, and short-term outcomes among patients surgically treated for ankle fracture [^116rDUGJ]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Although obesity is widely accepted as a risk factor for surgical complications following orthopaedic surgery, the literature is unclear with regard to the effect of obesity on outcomes of ankle fracture surgery, particularly in the setting of competing risks from diabetes. We hypothesized that obesity would be independently associated with more frequent complications, longer hospital length of stay, and higher costs of care among patients with and without diabetes.

Methods

With use of data from 2001 to 2010 from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, we identified all adult patients who underwent surgical treatment for a primary diagnosis of an isolated ankle fracture or dislocation. We then divided patients into four groups according to the presence or absence of diabetes or obesity: Group A included patients with neither diagnosis; Group B, obesity alone; Group C, diabetes alone; and Group D, both diagnoses. Multivariable regression models were constructed to determine the association between diagnostic group and in-hospital complications, hospital length of stay, and imputed costs of care, while controlling for other conditions.

Results

The final sample included 148,483 patients (78.4% in Group A, 5.0% in Group B, 13.6% in Group C, and 3.0% in Group D). The median age was 53.0 years, and most patients (62.2%) were female and had a closed bimalleolar or trimalleolar fracture (62.2%). In the unadjusted analysis, the frequency of in-hospital complications (2.6%, 4.2%, 5.3%, and 6.5% in Groups A, B, C, and D, respectively; p < 0.001), length of stay (3.0, 3.6, 4.4, and 4.8 days, respectively; p < 0.001), and costs of care ($9686, $10,555, $11,616, and $12,804, respectively, in 2010 U.S. dollars; p < 0.001) increased across groups. Patients with obesity alone (Group B) (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3 to 1.6), diabetes alone (Group C) (OR = 1.1; 95% CI = 1.0 to 1.2), and both diagnoses (Group D) (OR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.2 to 1.5) had more frequent in-hospital complications than those with neither diagnosis.

Conclusions

We found that patients with concurrent diagnoses of diabetes and obesity had higher health-care utilization and costs than those with neither diagnosis or with obesity alone or diabetes alone. The delay in the diagnosis of diabetes may somewhat obscure the true effect.

### The effectiveness of 1-point fixation for zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures… [^113RNtzh]. JAMA Network (2012). Excellent credibility.

The patients underwent 3D CT before surgery to evaluate the type and extent of the fracture and at 2 to 6 months after surgery to assess successful reduction. Multidetector CT was performed in the axial position using a 3-mm section thickness, and the coronal and 3D views were then reconstructed using a computer program. This study demonstrated that 1-point fixation at the ZMB through a gingivobuccal incision was effective for tripod fractures without comminution of lateral orbital rim fractures. If the lateral and inferior orbital walls are adequately reduced, this surgical technique results in a successful outcome. To avoid long-term aesthetic, sensory, or ocular consequences, stable reduction is essential in the treatment of ZMC fractures. Other authors routinely expose the infraorbital rim and perform multiple osteosyntheses or even expose all or nearly all of the fracture lines.

1, 3 On the other hand, Hwang8 suggested that 1-point fixation of tripod fractures through a lateral brow incision can apply to cases with minimal or moderate displacement of the infraorbital rim in a tripod fracture, no ocular signs of diplopia or enophthalmos, and comminuted infraorbital rim fractures when internal fixation is difficult. However, because the ZMB plays a key role in withstanding contraction of the masseter muscle and supporting zygoma, 9 rigid fixation at the ZMB is important in the treatment of tripod fractures. Tarabichi10 reported successful results with transsinus reduction through the comminuted anterior wall of the sinus and 1-point fixation of malar fractures and pointed out that in vitro studies are misleading because of the absence of serration along the orbital rim and disregard of the roles of the superficial musculoaponeurotic system, uninterrupted periosteum, and skin in stabilizing a fractured zygoma.

Ultrasonography is a valuable visualization tool for both diagnosis and treatment of facial bone fractures. 11, 12 When the remaining displacement is identified by ultrasonography, a repositioning instrument can be accurately positioned beneath the bone fragments and applied to restore the correct anatomical position with ultrasonography. Therefore, if it is not difficult to reduce displacement of the ZF process and a comminuted fracture of the infraorbital rim and zygomatic arch using ultrasonography, 1-point fixation at the ZMB area should be sufficiently stable for tripod fractures.

### Differentiation in an inclusive trauma system: allocation of lower extremity fractures [^115FbzQW]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this mature inclusive trauma system situated in a densely populated area, most fractures were treated in the L2 centre. The majority of fractures overall (including avulsion fractures) were treated in the L2 centre; the amount of surgical procedures performed per surgeon was higher in the L2 centre, run by a smaller surgical team. The majority of complex fractures were treated in the L1 centre. This was demonstrated by the number of immediate surgical procedures, late secondary surgeries, a necessary multidisciplinary approach, and utilization of additional resources. Fracture classification supported this difference in complexity, as did accompanying soft tissue injury and concomitant injuries to the lower extremity and other body regions.

The presented differentiation in this inclusive trauma system occurred spontaneously, without regional contracts or prehospital guidelines. Several factors may have contributed to this process. First, the prehospital triage guidelines are aimed at the identification of polytrauma patients with potentially lethal injuries and not so much at (isolated) complex lower extremity injuries. These guidelines in combination with some options for the paramedics that allow direct triage to the L1 centre resulted in the allocation of 78% of the polytrauma patients to the L1 centre in our region as demonstrated previously. Trauma mechanism is one of these options in the triage decision making by paramedics in our country, which may have contributed to the described differentiation in allocation of lower extremity fractures. Second, an important factor that may have contributed to this differentiation is the relatively short distance between the L1 and L2 centres, which is applicable not only to the Central Region of the Netherlands, but also to other densely populated areas with multiple established hospitals. This is the case in most large metropolis cities around the world. The geographic localisation might also have contributed to the difference, as the L2 centre is within the centre of the city, while the L1 centre is situated on the edge of the urban area. Last, in a thrive to improve patient care, the L1 and L2 centres optimized their profile and logistics in accordance to their designated role in the inclusive trauma system. The L2 centres implemented fast tracks for specific diagnoses (e.g. ankle fractures/distortion, wrist injuries, hip fractures), with one surgeon responsible for the patient's whole course including clinical care, surgery, post-operative consultation, and outpatient follow-up. In contrast, the L1 centre implemented 24/7 specialist care, emergency operating team availability within minutes, and flexible OR time on a daily basis.

### Early major fracture care in polytrauma-priorities in the context of concomitant injuries: a Delphi consensus process and systematic review [^113EPJ7Z]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Systematic Review

The reporting of the systematic review adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Supplemental Digital Content 2). We performed a systematic review to identify all relevant publications on the timing of fracture fixation in trauma patients with injuries to the brain, thorax, abdomen, spine/spinal cord, and vasculature.

Preliminary Screening

Several preliminary literature searches were conducted to prepare for the initiation of the Delphi process. These searches focused on the terminology for major fractures, the distinction between early surgery and damage control in isolated fractures with soft tissue injuries, the nomenclature of concepts, and the pathophysiology of polytrauma.

Search Strategy

The final systematic literature search was performed on August 4, 2023, in the Medline and EMBASE databases. The time window was from January 1, 2000, to August 1, 2023. We used a combination of controlled vocabulary (MESH/Emtree-Terms) and regular search terms connected by Boolean operators. Truncation was used to account for plural forms and alternate spellings. Great care was taken to consider all relevant synonyms. Filters were applied to exclude inappropriate article types. The complete list of search terms is provided in the Supplemental Digital Content 3. In addition, we screened the reference lists of selected studies and related reviews were screened (referred to as "additional sources").

Extraction, Screening and Retrieval

Search results were extracted and organized in EndNote version 20 by Clarivate. Articles were de-duplicated and then screened (title and abstract) independently by F.K.-L.K. and F.K. R. Pf. performed a crosscheck of the extracted data. Any disagreement was resolved in a personal meeting. The remaining articles were retrieved from the respective publishers through access to our universitiy's central library.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Original articles, reviews, systematic reviews/meta-analyses and guidelines in English or German were assessed for inclusion. Articles were included if they dealt with the timing of fracture care in multiply injured adult patients with concomitant brain, thoracic, abdominal, spinal, and/or vascular injuries.

Commentaries, conference abstracts, correspondences, expert opinions, editorials, letters, and experimental studies (in vitro/animal) were excluded. Further exclusion criteria were pediatric and combat trauma, an insufficient characterization of the injury patterns or injured body regions, or a missing concern with timing of fracture care.

### Fracture fixation in the polytrauma patient: markers that matter [^116FqZ7G]. Injury (2020). Medium credibility.

Timing and type of fracture fixation in the multiply-injured trauma patient have been important and controversial topics. Ideal care for these patients come from providers who communicate well with one another in a team fashion and view the whole person, rather than focusing on injury to individual systems. This group encompasses a wide range of musculoskeletal and other injuries, further complicated by the broad spectrum of patients, with variability in age, medical and social comorbidities, all of which may have profound impact upon outcomes. The concept of Early Total Care arose from the realization that early definitive fixation of femur fractures provided pulmonary and systemic benefits to most patients. However, insufficient assessment and understanding of the physiological status of polytraumatized patients at the time of major orthopaedic procedures, potentially with inclusion of multiple other procedures in the same setting resulted in more morbidity, swinging the pendulum of care toward initial Damage Control Orthopaedics to minimize surgical insult. More recently, iterative assessment of response to resuscitation using Early Appropriate Care guidelines, suggests definitive fixation of most axial and femoral injuries within 36 h after injury appears safe in resuscitated patients, as measured by improvement of acidosis.

### The operative treatment of ankle fractures: a 10-year retrospective study of 1529 patients [^114xoeeG]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Ankle fractures are the second most common fracture of the lower limb and account for nearly 10% of all fractures. They range from simple to complex injuries and approximately 40% require surgical intervention. The aim of our study was to provide an up-to-date reference of the epidemiology, fracture, and fixation characteristics of operatively treated ankle fractures. We also sought to determine the number of patients undergoing further surgery through revision, implant removal, or ankle fusion. A retrospective observational study was conducted of 1529 consecutive patients that underwent operative intervention for an unstable ankle fracture between 2007 and 2017. Fractures of the distal tibia and pilon injuries were excluded. The mean age of patients was 41.8 years with 50.7% male. Unimalleolar fixation was performed in 60.1%, while bimalleolar and trimalleolar fixation was performed in 31.2% and 5%, respectively. Isolated syndesmotic fixation was performed in 3.8%. A posterior malleolus fracture was present in 28.6%, of which 31.6% underwent fixation. A further procedure was performed in 234 (15.3%) patients. Revision open reduction internal fixation was required in 1.4% and 0.8% underwent future ankle fusion. Treatment of ankle fractures makes up a sizeable part of orthopedic trauma practice with more than 1 in 7 patients requiring a second procedure. More complex fractures were predominantly seen in older females, while patients who suffered trimalleolar fractures have an increased likelihood of requiring future ankle fusion or revision. Despite this the rate of ankle fusion was < 1%.

### The role of a small posterior malleolar fragment in trimalleolar fractures: a biomechanical study [^117XJbPW]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a posterior malleolar fragment (PMF), with < 25% ankle joint surface, on pressure distribution and joint-stability. There is still little scientific evidence available to advise on the size of PMF, which is essential to provide treatment. To date, studies show inconsistent results and recommendations for surgical treatment date from 1940.

Materials and Methods

A total of 12 cadaveric ankles were assigned to two study groups. A trimalleolar fracture was created, followed by open reduction and internal fixation. PMF was fixed in Group I, but not in Group II. Intra-articular pressure was measured and cyclic loading was performed.

Results

Contact area decreased following each fracture, while anatomical fixation restored it nearly to its intact level. Contact pressure decreased significantly with fixation of the PMF. In plantarflexion, the centre of force shifted significantly posteriorly in Group II and anteriorly in Group I. Load to failure testing showed no difference between the groups.

Conclusion

Surgical reduction of a small PMF with less than 25% ankle joint surface improves pressure distribution but does not affect ankle joint stability. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2018;100-B:95–100.

### Complex distal femoral fracture treated with interfragmentary screws and medial buttress plating [^114S6Y49]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

The obtained osteosynthesis fulfilled the objectives of the surgical treatment. An anatomic reduction of the articular surface was achieved with stable internal fixation, which allowed early mobilisation of the limb and an acceptable functional result. Nevertheless, it has to be pointed out that certain treatment methods should be standard in the therapy of such fractures, namely, the usage of headless screws, intraoperative 3D imaging and postoperative CT scan to evaluate fracture reduction and implant placement.

In conclusion, fractures of the distal femur can be complex and difficult to manage. The currently available classifications are insufficient to describe the complexity of the patterns found in clinical practice, and the surgical techniques currently used are unable to overcome all the problems associated with these fractures. More research is needed to evaluate the best treatment options and standardise patient care.

Patient's perspective

I am pleased to be able to do my daily life with the help of my family and my walking cane.

Learning points

Distal femoral fractures may be a surgical challenge as the fracture patterns are diverse.
Parapatellar approach is a good alternative for complex intraarticular fractures as it allows good visualisation of the fracture and enables anatomic reduction.
3D modelling of the fracture pattern may aid in the preoperative planning.
Even after obtaining anatomic reduction, full recovery of the limb function may not be achieved.
The usage of headless screws, intraoperative 3D imaging and postoperative CT scan to evaluate fracture reduction and implant placement should be standard in the therapy of such fractures.

### Diagnosis and management of common foot fractures [^115H93Uy]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on ankle fracture:

- Definition: Ankle fractures refer to a fracture in any of the three bones comprising the ankle joint: the lateral or posterior malleolus of the tibia, medial malleolus of the fibula, and/or the talus.
- **Pathophysiology**: Common causes of ankle fractures include trauma from falls, sports injuries, and twisting of the ankle. The primary mechanisms of ankle fractures are rotational injuries and supination or pronation movements.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for ankle fractures include advanced age, higher BMI, and participation in high-impact sports. Motor vehicle crashes can also lead to ankle fractures, particularly in drivers due to pedal interaction.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with ankle fractures often present with pain, swelling, and bruising in the ankle area. They may also have difficulty bearing weight on the affected side.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of ankle fractures can vary based on the severity of the fracture and the patient's adherence to rehabilitation. Complications such as posttraumatic arthritis or chronic instability can occur. In some cases, surgical intervention may be required, particularly for complex fractures.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute pain, more specifically with respect to patients with fractures, EUSEM 2020 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- NSAIDs have been suggested to prolong bone healing in patients with bone fracture, but the evidence is conflicting as is the data in tendon injury

- skeletal traction is a common method for preoperative fracture stabilization and pain control in patients with femoral shaft and acetabular fractures, and it has been suggested to reduce pain scores during immobilization of isolated femur fractures

- appropriate positioning in complex fractures, for example with a back slab for wrist/arm fractures, can alleviate pain and is widely recommended

- peripheral nerve block provides rapid reduction in pain within 30 min with a low risk of adverse effects in patients with hip fracture in the emergency department

-, while reducing the requirement for opioids

- intra-articular lidocaine has demonstrated comparable analgesia to IV analgesia/sedation in patients with acute shoulder dislocation, with a shorter duration of hospitalization and lower risk of complications

- IV lidocaine has demonstrated efficacy in patients with renal colic, with a faster onset to pain relief and greater pain relief than IV morphine

- IV lidocaine and lidocaine patches provide effective analgesia in patients with acute traumatic extremity pain

- and rib fracture.

### Determining the clinical significance of the chest wall injury society taxonomy for multiple rib fractures [^117S8E2K]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The Chest Wall Injury Society (CWIS) proposals for standardized nomenclature for multiple rib fracture (MRF) classifications were derived by international expert Delphi consensus. This study aimed to validate the CWIS taxonomy using a single-instituion clinical database.

Methods

Computed tomography (CT) scans, of 539 consecutive patients with MRFs admitted to a regional major trauma center over a 33-month period, were reviewed (blinded for clinical outcomes). Every rib fracture in every patient was assessed according to each of the CWIS criteria (the degree of displacement, characterization of the fracture line, location of each fracture, and the relationship to neighboring fractures). The clinical significance of the proposed CWIS definitions were determined from independently coded, routinely collected Hospital Episodes Statistics data.

Results

The radiologic aspects of 3,944 individual rib fractures were assessed. Indicators of injury severity (severe displacement greater series length, and flail segment) were positively associated with other fractures (p < 0.001), hemopneumothorax (p < 0.001), pulmonary complications (p = 0.002), adverse outcomes (p = 0.006), mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001) and prolonged hospital and intensive therapy unit length of stay (p = 0.006, p = 0.007 respectively). Four of the CWIS-proposed definitions were correlated with pulmonary complications and adverse outcomes: the categories of displacement, the definition of individual fracture characterization, the presence of a flail segment. Two definitions for which there was CWIS consensus were not correlated with clinical outcomes: the definition of a series to describe associated fractures on neighboring ribs, the inclusion of a paravertebral sector for fracture localization.

Conclusion

The CWIS rib fracture taxonomy demonstrates clinical relevance. There were associations between the severity of category groups within three of the proposed definitions, based on the clinical outcomes observed. Clinical outcome assessment proved inconclusive for four agreed definitions. Comprehensive, multiinstitutional data collection would be required to provide validation for all the CWIS-proposed definitions.

### Differentiation in an inclusive trauma system: allocation of lower extremity fractures [^113KL8BV]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Differentiation and specialisation leads to optimization of care. Although there is a diversity in injury type with regard to the complex injuries, the required treatment regime, necessary resources, and flexible logistics make acute complex care of lower extremity fractures a separate entity that requires its own differentiation. Complex lower extremity fracture types were more frequently treated in the L1 centre. Tibial plateau Schatzker types 4 through 6, complex tibial shaft, displaced calcaneal, and complex midfoot fractures were more prevalent in the L1 compared to the L2 centre (Table 3). It is tempting to speculate that these fractures are more frequently the result of high-energy mechanisms and therefore predisposed to presentation to an L1 centre. This is supported by trauma mechanism analysis, as all high incidence complex fracture types in the L1 were related to HET mechanisms, such as a fall from height (e.g. suicide attempts), traffic, and crush mechanisms. This is further illustrated by a higher incidence of open fractures, an increased need for external fixations, fasciotomies, amputations, and other secondary or complication surgeries in the L1 centre. Open lower extremity fractures have a greater likelihood of infection, which makes early soft tissue coverage within hours to days desirable. Vascular damage and neurological damage ought to be treated urgently. Furthermore, soft tissue damage especially in the case of multiple non-contiguous fractures often requires serial operations. As a result, there is a high demand on multiple resources in the L1 centre. In total, 24.9% of all fractures in the L1 required more than one operation. In contrast, only 1.4% of the patients in the L2 centre underwent multiple procedures. The presence of an in-hospital trauma surgeon as well as a dedicated OR team for complex and severely traumatized patients was initiated to improve outcomes, but adds to the costs incurred per patient. Although not all secondary and complication-related surgeries were performed during the initial hospitalization, also in a semi-acute setting, they put pressure on OR capacity and require personnel with a high level of expertise. OR utilization is one of the costliest components in secondary care. As a consequence, treatment of the complex extremity injuries is expensive.

### Computed tomography in traumatic orbital emergencies: a pictorial essay-imaging findings, tips, and report flowchart [^111Rumdi]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures

Zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures are the most common facial fractures with orbital involvement, usually caused by a high-energy direct traumatic blow to the malar eminence, resulting in fractures of the lateral and inferior orbital borders and extension into the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus, zygomatic arch, and internal lateral orbital wall (Fig. 8).

Fig. 8
3D reconstructions of a left zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures. Fractures of the lateral orbital wall (white arrow), of the orbital floor (empty arrow), multifocal fracture of the zygomatic arch (black arrows)

The zygomatic maxillary complex is made up of four bony articulations. Superiorly, the zygoma frontal process articulates with the frontal bone; medially, the zygomatic bone articulates with the maxillary bone. The zygomatic bone articulates with the temporal bone zygomatic process on the lateral side, contributing to a part of the zygomatic arch. Posteriorly, it articulates with the sphenoid greater wing, to form the orbit internal lateral wall. Fracture of the four articulations of the complex can be characterized on CT by evidence of fractures of the lateral and inferior orbital borders, combined with the involvement of the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus, zygomatic arch, and internal lateral orbital wall.

Displaced fractures with considerable lateral angulation of the orbital internal lateral wall or simultaneous orbital floor blowout fractures can cause enophthalmos, which requires urgent surgical correction and intraorbital reconstruction. CT is crucial in determining the degree of comminution and angulation of the internal lateral orbital wall, as well as the presence of a concurrent floor fracture: in this case, the presence of inferior rectus muscle entrapment should be assessed.

Tips: check for the comminution and the position of the bone fragments of the internal lateral orbital wall (Fig. 9).

### Early major fracture care in polytrauma-priorities in the context of concomitant injuries: a Delphi consensus process and systematic review [^111FLjSe]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

This international expert panel reached an overwhelming consensus that early definitive fracture fixation (within 24 hours) should be attempted even in polytrauma patients if the posttraumatic clinical condition allows. Our 20 statements provide clear indications and contraindications for the most relevant associated injuries and are supported by the literature.

The following order of priorities should be respected: (1) life, (2) central nervous system, (3) limb, and (4) functionality. While the physiological responses (hemodynamic, respiratory, renal, coagulation, metabolic) remain important, emphasis should also be put on the neurological status and injury-specific factors when deciding on the timing of fracture fixation in polytrauma patients. Serial assessments are mandatory to reflect the dynamics early on and to adapt the treatment strategy accordingly.

### Effectiveness of iodophor vs chlorhexidine solutions for surgical site infections and unplanned reoperations for patients who underwent fracture repair: the PREP-IT master protocol [^115dQ3TK]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Primary Outcome

The primary outcome is SSI, guided by the 2017 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network reporting criteria, which include superficial incisional SSIs within 30 days and deep incisional or organ or space SSIs within 90 days of fracture surgery. Because the management of some fractures may require more than 1 operative procedure as part of an intentionally staged surgical plan (eg, multiple irrigation and debridements, wound closures, temporary stabilization surgical procedures, or definitive fixation surgery), the primary outcome will include any SSI event from the date of fracture to the end of the 90-day postoperative surveillance periods from the definitive fracture management surgery. For participants with multiple fracture regions, the date of the definitive fracture management surgery will be matched to the fracture region with the SSI.

The sensitivity and robustness of the primary outcome will also be assessed using 2 exploratory definitions of SSI: (1) fracture-related infection, defined by the confirmatory criteria outlined in a consensus definition, and (2) the CDC criteria expanded to include all SSIs that occur within 12 months of fracture. These outcomes are considered exploratory because larger validation studies of their performance do not currently exist, to our knowledge; however, these alternative SSI definitions were included because the standard CDC criteria have been criticized for failing to adequately account for the complexities of infections in traumatic fractures. All reported SSIs will be reviewed by a blinded adjudication committee.

Secondary Outcome

The secondary outcome is unplanned fracture-related reoperation within 12 months of the fracture(s). This outcome has been used in previous fracture trials and is defined as any unplanned surgery that occurred from the time of injury to 12 months after fracture that is associated with an infection at the operative site or contiguous to it, a wound healing problem, or a fracture healing problem (ie, delayed union or nonunion). Common examples include any unplanned (1) irrigation and debridement of surgical incisions or open fracture wounds due to infections or wound healing problems, (2) revision wound closure for dehiscence, (3) soft-tissue coverage procedure for infected or necrotic wounds, (4) union or nonunion surgery (such as bone grafting or implant exchange) delayed by fracture, and (5) reoperation for hardware or prosthesis failure due to infection or bone healing problems. The members of the adjudication committee will review all reported reoperations.

### Beyond the break: development and validation of a new classification system for acute traumatic rib fractures [^1177yzek]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

In 2019, Bemelman et al published their IOA based on the Muller AO classification system. Although instructive, this classification system is overly complex in our assessment owing to the description of the "type" and "subtype" of fractures. They achieved 62% agreement in the interpretation of a limited number of images, perhaps due to the complexity of their classification system. The CWIS has made important changes in creating a taxonomyand showing IOA. However, the CWIS IOA was based on email responses from study participants who were shown a fracture and asked for the observer's interpretation of severity and sector. In contrast, our study required the observers to read 100 CT images in their entirety and identify the rib fractures, the position of the fractures on each rib, and the severity of the fractures. The lead surgeons developed the taxonomy using basic parameters and aimed to assess their IOA rate. Through this process, they realized that the definition of rib fracture types needed greater clarity. They also observed that many fractures occurred near the borders of the defined sectors, prompting them to be more mindful of these boundaries and to strictly follow the established criteria. Once these issues were addressed and the two lead authors reached a consensus on how to proceed, they reviewed the second set of CT scans using the same approach as the first. This resulted in a significantly improved agreement rate. The study was subsequently extended to include surgeons from all three participating centers, who showed comparable results. Participants received the key map for Set 1 before proceeding to analyze Set 2, allowing them to better understand accurate and inaccurate readings. With this training, the participants achieved 72% agreement on Set 2. Likely, the substantial improvement noted in Set 2 stems from enhanced pattern recognition through this simple training method. This excellent rate of agreement is comparable to that reported in the Bemelman and CWIS studies. As such, we think that this TARF can be effectively employed in clinical practice and provide the best description of the rib fracture burden for both clinical practice and optimizing comparisons in ongoing research. We intend to publish further studies with this TARF to provide a more descriptive update on the epidemiology and outcome of rib fracture patients with and without surgical rib fixation. Limitations of the study include limited generalizability as findings were applicable to three trauma medical centers. The sample is restricted to specific locations, patient demographics, or healthcare settings. The study population is limited as well however the scans were randomly selected. Future research will include larger and multi-regional samples to improve reliability and generalizability. Additionally, analysis of fracture subtypes will be conducted to identify which specific fracture types are most susceptible to interpretive disagreement.

### Initial fracture management and results [^1163vd9A]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2006). Low credibility.

In the management of fractures, the appropriate treatment must take into consideration the nature of the injury, the surgical insult and technique, and a variety of patient factors. The surgeon must also anticipate potential complications and plan the initial treatment accordingly. This article discusses the impact of surgical decisions on the process of fracture healing.

### Establishing a consensus definition of a knee fracture-dislocation (schenck knee dislocation V) using a global modified Delphi method [^112g6ZsE]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Knee fracture-dislocations are complex injuries; however, there is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes a fracture-dislocation within the Schenck Knee Dislocation (KD) V subcategory. The purpose of this study was to establish a more precise definition for fracture patterns included within the Schenck KD V subcategory.

Methods

A series of clinical scenarios encompassing various fracture patterns in association with a bicruciate knee ligament injury was created by a working group of 8 surgeons. Utilizing a modified Delphi technique, 46 surgeons from 18 countries and 6 continents with clinical and academic expertise in multiligamentous knee injuries undertook 3 rounds of online surveys to establish consensus. Consensus was defined as ≥ 70% agreement with responses of either "strongly agree" or "agree" for a positive consensus or "strongly disagree" or "disagree" for a negative consensus.

Results

There was a 100% response rate for Rounds 1 and 2 and a 96% response rate for Round 3. A total of 11 fracture patterns reached consensus for inclusion: (1) nondisplaced articular fracture of the femur; (2) displaced articular fracture of the femur; (3) tibial plateau fracture involving the weight-bearing surface (with or without tibial spine involvement); (4) tibial plateau peripheral rim compression fracture; (5) posterolateral tibial plateau compression fracture, Bernholt type IIB; (6) posterolateral tibial plateau compression fracture, Bernholt type IIIA; (7) posterolateral tibial plateau compression fracture, Bernholt type IIIB; (8) Gerdy's tubercle avulsion fracture with weight-bearing surface involvement; (9) displaced tibial tubercle fracture; (10) displaced patellar body fracture; and (11) displaced patellar inferior pole fracture. Fourteen fracture patterns reached consensus for exclusion from the definition. Two fracture patterns failed to reach consensus for either inclusion or exclusion from the definition.

Conclusions

Using a modified Delphi technique, this study established consensus for specific fracture patterns to include within or exclude from the Schenck KD V subcategory.

### Best practices in the management of orthopaedic trauma [^117HNFaU]. ACS (2015). Medium credibility.

Geriatric hip fracture — injury assessment, imaging, timing, anesthesia, and fracture categorization emphasize early suspicion and coordinated care: when a geriatric patient presents with severe hip pain, particularly following a fall, a hip fracture should be suspected, and a thorough history and physical examination should be performed with evaluation for concurrent injuries; early consultation with an inpatient medical or geriatric specialist may be beneficial, geriatric specialists or hospitalists may help streamline preoperative testing and serve as an effective liaison to the anesthesia team, and a well-coordinated and multidisciplinary approach is encouraged; diagnosis is typically evident on standard radiographic assessment, and when a hip fracture is suspected in the setting of normal radiographs, it is recommended that additional imaging (for example, MRI) be obtained to evaluate for the presence of a nondisplaced fracture; once diagnosed, patients are typically admitted, medically optimized, and should be surgically treated as soon as able, preferably within 48 hours; there is strong evidence that regional anesthesia improves perioperative management in patients with hip fracture and may reduce postoperative delirium and cardiac events; geriatric fractures of the proximal femur broadly fall into three categories: femoral neck fractures, intertrochanteric fractures, and subtrochanteric fractures.

### Diagnosis and management of common foot fractures… [^114HY85u]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Examination of the metatarsals should include palpation of the metatarsal base, shaft, and head, as well as examination of the proximal tarsometatarsal and distal metatarsophalangeal joints. Adjacent metatarsals should be examined, and neurovascular status should be assessed. Proximal Fifth Metatarsal Fractures The fifth metatarsal has the least cortical thickness of all the metatarsals. 13 There are multiple strong ligamentous and capsular attachments surrounding the proximal fifth metatarsal; these allow stresses to be directed through this portion of the bone. 13 Classically, fractures of the proximal fifth metatarsal can be classified based on anatomic location into one or more of three zones.
3. HISTORY Patients with a proximal fifth metatarsal fracture often present after an acute inversion of the foot or ankle. Patients have localized pain, swelling, and inability to bear weight on the lateral aspect of the foot.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Examination should consist of a neurovascular evaluation and palpation of the foot and ankle. There is typically focal tenderness, swelling, and ecchymosis at the base of the fifth metatarsal. Patients usually cannot bear full weight and sometimes will ambulate only on the medial aspect of the foot. If a fracture is present, it will typically be one of two types: a tuberosity avulsion fracture or a Jones fracture. Tuberosity avulsion fractures are generally found in zone 1 and do not extend into the joint between the fourth and fifth metatarsal bases. Jones fractures are located in a "watershed" area for blood supply and have high rates of delayed union and nonunion 17. HISTORY The most common mechanisms of injury are axial loading or crush injury. Patients typically present with pain, swelling, ecchymosis, and difficulty with ambulation.

Hyperflexion or hyperextension injuries most commonly lead to spiral or avulsion fractures. Spiral fractures often lead to rotation or shortening, and transverse fractures lead to angulation.
6. **MANAGEMENT**: GREAT TOE FRACTURES Great toe fractures are generally treated with a short leg walking cast with a toe plate.

### Application of digital tomosynthesis in diagnosing the fractures or dislocations in irregular bones and regions with complex structures [^116SmUc6]. Clinical Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The application potential of digital tomosynthesis in diagnosing fractures or dislocations in irregular bones and regions with complex structures was evaluated.

Methods

Digital radiography and tomosynthesis were performed in 121 patients, and the image quality, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were compared.

Results

The number of participants with a definite diagnosis of fracture and/or dislocation was 98. The ratio of excellent images, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of digital tomosynthesis were higher than that of direct radiography.

Conclusion

Digital tomosynthesis could be applied in the diagnosis of fractures or dislocations in irregular bones and regions with complex structures.

### Early major fracture care in polytrauma-priorities in the context of concomitant injuries: a Delphi consensus process and systematic review [^116Y8GHY]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Abdominal Trauma

The primary aim of abdominal trauma management is to control bleeding and contamination from enteral injuries. Information about the timing of fracture fixation in patients with abdominal trauma is limited. Roberts et al. published physiological parameters and rated indications for the use of damage-control surgery. According to their study, difficult-to-access major venous injuries, major liver or combined pancreaticoduodenal injuries, as well as devascularization or massive disruptions of the duodenum or pancreas, require damage-control interventions. If hemorrhage control can be achieved, or if nonoperative management is possible, it is recommended to perform definitive fixation of isolated fractures as long as the patient remains physiologically stable. For patients with multiple major fractures, it is recommended to conduct serial monitoring of the patient's physiologic response (hemodynamic, respiratory, renal, coagulation, and metabolic). It has been found that definitive fracture fixation is safe regarding surgical site infection, even in the presence of an open abdomen. As an exception, patients with pelvic ring injuries and associated abdominal trauma require special care to avoid gross contamination from enteric injuries. Still, even in this group, internal fixation helps heal soft tissue and control infection.

Multiple Fractures

The primary goal in treating patients with multiple fractures is early and safe bone reconstruction and patient mobilization. The sequence of fracture fixation is challenging, and clinical studies are difficult to perform in this patient population. However, multiple aspects must be considered when determining the surgical sequencing and timing for these complex patients. For instance, an international survey of 196 trauma surgeons from 61 countries found that assessing the surgical load (a physiological burden to the patient incurred by the surgical procedure) is very important. Factors to consider include the avoidance of shock, lung dysfunction, coagulopathy, hypothermia, soft tissue injuries, as well as potential intraoperative blood loss. It is crucial to prioritize life over limb when sequencing the fixation of major fractures after polytrauma. In addition, the management of major fractures is dictated by the prevention of severe disability (e.g. from spinal cord injury), followed by the risk of limb loss (e.g. compartment syndrome, arterial injury, or thrombosis). Should the patients' clinical status not improve after resuscitative efforts, damage-control orthopedics are a valid and important alternative for long bone fracture stabilization. In some situations, a staged procedure in the musculoskeletal system is performed mainly due to local factors (contaminated wounds, bone defects, etc.) and has been named "musculoskeletal temporary surgery". These complex injuries also affect the sequence of fracture fixation.

### Incidence of complex regional pain syndrome I following foot and ankle fractures using the budapest criteria [^116RMDvs]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE: Fractures are a well-recognized inciting event in the development of complex regional pain syndrome. This study aimed to prospectively determine the incidence of complex regional pain syndrome following foot and ankle fractures. METHODS: A prospective study was conducted of patients presenting to two metropolitan hospitals with plain radiograph diagnosis of fractures to the foot or ankle. Patients were initially screened by phone 3 months after injury using the validated International Association for the Study of Pain Budapest criteria. Patients who fulfilled the screening criteria were then physically examined by a pain specialist to assess clinical signs as part of the Budapest criteria. RESULTS: A total of 306 consecutive eligible patients were included. One hundred and ten patients reported at least one symptom of complex regional pain syndrome; however, only three fulfilled the minimum requirements to necessitate clinical review. Of these three, only one patient fulfilled the combination of symptom and sign criteria for a positive diagnosis according to the validated Budapest criteria. The incidence of complex regional pain syndrome following foot and ankle fracture in this study was 0.3%. CONCLUSION: Although many patients may experience vasomotor, sensory, and sudomotor disturbance following a fracture to the foot and ankle, the observed incidence of complex regional pain syndrome using a prospectively collected validated criteria is significantly lower than previously published.

Osteoporotic fractures are difficult to manage. They pose a number of difficulties to the surgeon arising from the underlying poor bone stock compromising the intention to achieve optimum fixation. Moreover, the frail elderly patients present with a variety of medical co-morbidities increasing the risk of developing perioperative complications. Despite these recognized challenges, there are currently a number of improving technologies and strategies at the surgeon's disposal to provide more confidence with fracture fixation and maximize the chance of success.

### The association between lateral radiographs and axial computed tomography of posterior malleolar fractures as a tool for predicting medial malleolar extension: a multi-center retrospective analysis [^11313rh9]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Posterior malleolar fractures are often part of complex ankle fracture patterns. Radiographs and computed tomography are often obtained in the preoperative setting. In this study, we compared measurements from lateral ankle radiographs with measurements on axial computed tomography. We hypothesize that there is an association between measurements taken on lateral XR and certain fracture morphology such as medial extension and that measurements taken on lateral XR can be used to predict likelihood of medial extension type fractures. A multi-center retrospective analysis was performed involving patients with trimalleolar ankle fractures treated at two large urban healthcare systems ranging from January 1, 2010 to November 1, 2019. A total of 279 patients met criteria including 186 females and 93 males aged 18 to 90 with an average age 55. Four reviewers measured continuous variables on lateral radiograph and axial computed tomography: posterior malleolus fracture height, articular surface length, medial-lateral width, and anterior-posterior depth and then agreement was assessed via intraclass correlation coefficient. Pearson correlations were calculated for all pairwise combinations of measurements. Two fracture classification systems were then evaluated for association with the continuous variables. Lateral height was divided into quartiles and analyzed for the degree of association. Positive correlation was found between lateral height and axial depth/axial width. Taller lateral height values were statistically associated with medial extension type fractures. Lateral height 24.5mm-29.5mm is 3.1x higher, and lateral height > 29.5mm is 8.6x more likely to have medial extension when compared to shorter lateral heights(< 20.5mm). Based on these findings we suggest increased usage of pre-operative CT and evaluation for the use of posteromedial approaches in the setting of taller lateral height fracture patterns(> 24.5mm) as seen on lateral XR.

### Differentiation in an inclusive trauma system: allocation of lower extremity fractures [^116e3CYa]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Fracture classification

A difference in fracture classification between the L1 and L2 centres was observed for tibial plateau, tibial shaft, ankle, and foot fractures. The presentation of more complex tibial plateau fractures (Schatzker types 4–6), complex tibial shaft fractures, distal tibia fractures, displaced calcaneal fractures, talus fractures, and complex midfoot fractures (Chopart, Lisfranc, and navicular/nutcracker) was significantly greater in the L1 centre.

Ankle fractures were seen more frequently in the L2 centre and accounted for almost half of the total amount of fractures treated (n = 402, 41.1%), of which the majority were uni-malleolar fractures (72.4% within L2). Metatarsal fractures were also more often treated in the L2 centre (n = 362, 37.0%). A complete overview of the fracture distribution is shown in Table 3.

Table 3
Fracture classifications and complexity per level trauma centre

Fractures were more often associated with concomitant injuries in the L1 centre (p < 0.001) (e.g. soft tissue, vascular, and neurological damage). The L1 centre treated more open fractures (n = 72 or 13.4% versus n = 15 or 1.5%, p < 0.001) and more mangled extremities (n = 15 or 3% versus n = 0 or 0%, p < 0.001) than the L2 centre. Fracture characteristics are shown in Table 4.

### Analysis of the advantages of 3D printing in the surgical treatment of multiple rib fractures: 5 cases report [^116xRNnE]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Rib fractures are most common in chest injuries, and the traditional treatment is mostly local compression bandaging, rib traction, selective mechanical ventilation and other methods. Mechanical ventilation and prolonged hospital stay in the ICU were significantly associated with increased mortality and morbidity, particularly in elderly patients over 65 years of age. The traditional internal fixation of rib fracture results in a large incision and a wide range of muscle cutting and fixation, which aggravates the trauma of patients. However, with continuous improvement and updating of medical devices and the trend toward minimally invasive surgery, the surgical treatment of multiple rib fractures has been accepted by more and more medical professionals. The thorax is a complex three-dimensional structure with different anatomical structures in different parts. The rib itself also has a relatively special and complex anatomical shape. In addition to the normal anatomic parameters such as length and width, the bending angle, longitudinal twist angle of each rib are important parameters that cannot be ignored, while the fixing devices that are currently most commonly used have undergone large improvements. However, it is still difficult to fully conform to the normal physiological and anatomical features of 3D bending and rib distortions.

For severe multi-root and multi-segment rib fractures, as the rib has been severely deformed and the basis for fixation material is lost, there is a risk of incomplete thoracic molding for the re-shaped locking plate after the reduction of the rib during surgery. In particular, the minimally invasive treatment of multiple fractures of multiple ribs in the area covered by the scapula and the pectoralis major (female breast), with the aid of the Matrix RIB system, is performed with the MIPO system tunnel, because the operating space is relatively small and it will be more difficult to restore the broken ends of each of the ribs and the plastic locking plate during surgery. For the fracture involving cartilage, especially the costal arch, the bending angle and longitudinal twisting angle of the ribs are more obvious. There is no corresponding proprietary device for the current internal fixation materials, and the re-shaped locking plate is needed (Fig. 6 a-c). Therefore, if the internal fixator is not in good shape and the two ends of the fracture are not a good fit, the internal fixator would produce twisting tension, while the rib is relatively weak, the fixation strength of the costal cartilage could be even worse. This can easily lead to nail removal and the removal of the fixator after surgery (Fig. 6 d).

### Ankle injuries… [^116HvsYc]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Ankle injuries are common among school-age children, accounting for approximately one-quarter of all pediatric sports-related injuries and ranging from benign sprains to complex fractures involving the physis. In fact, ankle fractures are the third most common physeal fracture in children. The distal tibial and fibular physes are located 1 to 2 fingerbreadths proximal to the joint and are the areas of the ankle most susceptible to injury. Identification of physeal injuries is crucial because they can lead to growth arrest and long-term disability. Although not covered herein, it is important to remember that aside from traumatic injury, ankle pain can be a manifestation of infectious, rheumatologic, or oncologic pathology. The ankle joint is composed of the distal tibia, distal fibula, and talus. The medial and lateral malleoli are the distal prominences of the tibia and fibula, respectively. Although the ankle is classified as a hinge joint, it also. Comments

### Does the fibula need to be fixed in complex pilon fractures? [^116x1YZL]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review a series of patients with complex plafond injuries with a metadiaphyseal dissociation who did not have the fibula fixed and compare with patients who had their fibula fixed using patients without a fibula fracture as a control group.

Design

Retrospective case-control study.

Setting

Level 1 Trauma center at a university hospital.

Patients/Participants

Skeletally mature patients with a complete metadiaphyseal plafond fracture, and adequate presentation, postreduction, and healed radiographs to measure varus and valgus alignment.

Intervention

Surgical treatment [external fixator or open reduction internal fixation (ORIF)] of high energy pilon fractures.

Main Outcome Measurements

Metaphyseal alignment at the time of presentation, after fixation, and at union, surgical procedures performed, and complications.

Methods

From 364 patients with plafond fractures, 111 had high energy injuries with metadiaphyseal dissociation and form the basis of the study. Radiographs and charts were reviewed for fracture characteristics, metaphyseal alignment at the time of presentation, after fixation, and at union, surgical procedures performed, and complications.

Results

Of the 111 study patients, 93 patients were treated definitively with ORIF of the tibia and 18 patients were treated definitively in an external fixator. Within the 93 patients treated definitively with ORIF of the tibia, we identified 3 groups of patients those with a fibula fracture that was fixed (26 patients), those with a fibula fracture that was not fixed (37 patients), and those without a fibula fracture acting as the control group (30 patients). Between the 2 groups having a fibula fracture treated with ORIF of the tibia, there was no difference in fibula fracture pattern or location. For the 26 patients who had fibular fixation, it was performed in 11 patients at an average of 17 days for inability to hold length and alignment and in 15 patients to augment fixation in poor bone stock or to aid in the reduction. Patients with initial valgus deformity were more likely to have their fibula fixed. There was no difference in the postoperative or final alignment between the patients with fibula fractures (with or without fixation) and those without fibula fractures (P = 0.92). When comparing the 3 groups, the only statistical finding between the 2 groups was that those with fibula fixation required plate removal (P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Fibular fixation is not a necessary step in the reconstruction of pilon fractures, although it may be helpful in specific cases to aid in tibial plafond reduction or augment external fixation. We found a higher rate of plate removal if the fibula was fixed.

### Definition and classification of fracture non-unions [^114bjjbM]. Injury (2007). Low credibility.

Classifications in general provide relevant information for clinical purposes to compose a suitable treatment strategy and for research purposes to be able to define comparable study groups. Two distinct types of non-unions are described in the established literature. In the first type the ends of the fragments are hypervascutar or hypertrophic and are capable of biologic reaction. In the second type the ends of the fragments are avascular or atrophic and are inert and incapable of biologic reaction. Hypervascular as well as avascular non-unions may be complicated by the presence of infection, poor soft-tissue quality, short peri-articular fragments or significant deformity, demanding mu[ti-stage treatment strategies with concomitant worsened prognosis and subsequent increased frequency of amputation.

### Variables related to surgical and nonsurgical treatment of zygomatic complex fracture [^112nqjN4]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of this retrospective research was to establish the association between variables for the surgical treatment of zygomatic complex (ZC) fractures. In a 10-year period, 532 patients were examined for ZC fractures. The medical records of patients were analyzed to obtain information related to sociodemographic characteristics, trauma etiology, sign and symptoms of patients, and surgical or nonsurgical treatment. Statistical analysis was performed using χ test with statistical significance of P < 0.05. Most fractures were sustained by subjects between 21 and 40 years of age (55.8%), being principally men (80.1%), and 153 patients underwent surgery (28.8%). Surgical treatment of ZC fractures was statistically associated to the presence of other facial fractures (P = 0.004), alteration of occlusion (P = 0.0001; probably due to jaw fractures), presence of the comminuted fractures (P = 0.0002), and infraorbital nerve sensory disturbances (P = 0.003). A mixture of complex variables can be associated to surgical treatment; however, variables as comminuted fracture and alteration of occlusion were associated to surgical treatment indications.

### Orthopaedic traumatology: fundamental principles and current controversies for the acute care surgeon [^113SsThi]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

Fractures

When describing fractures, the acute care surgeon must use precise language and avoid vague terminology. Essential descriptive terminology includes the anatomic location of the injury, fracture pattern, the amount of displacement and whether the fracture is open or closed.

Anatomic locations include articular, metaphyseal or diaphyseal injuries. An intra-articular fracture extends into the joint space. Fracture patterns include transverse, spiral, oblique, comminuted and segmental. A transverse fracture is perpendicular to the bone's line of axis. Spiral and oblique are often confused. Both can be the result of a rotational force applied to the bone. A true spiral fracture involves a fracture line that traverses in two directions while an oblique fracture extends in a single plane. A comminuted fracture has multiple fragments and a segmental fracture is a type of comminuted fracture in which there are well-defined fragments. Certain fractures may be complicated by associated bone loss, which often occurs in the setting of an open fracture.

Fracture displacement occurs when one fragment shifts in relation to the other through translation, angulation, shortening or rotation (figure 1). Typically, descriptions of displacement of hand and wrist fractures include the terms volar and dorsal instead of anterior and posterior and ulnar and radial instead of medial and lateral. The amount of translation should also be reported, as this may be a surrogate for the amount of energy required to create the fracture. Two millimeters or less of translation is considered 'minimally displaced'. When describing angulation, the direction of which the apex of the angle is pointing should be stated, that is, medial angulation or volar angulation, as well as the degree of angulation, which can be measured using a goniometer (a protractor-like device). Shortening or rotation of the bone should be noticed on clinical examination and likewise reported.

Figure 1
(A) Lateral radiograph of the wrist-apex volar angulation (dorsal displacement) of comminuted distal radius fracture. (B) Anteroposterior radiograph of tibia/fibula - apex medial angulation (valgus) of simple, diaphyseal tibia fracture. (C) Lateral radiograph of tibia/fibula – apex anterior angulation of spiral, diaphyseal tibia fracture. (D) Anteroposterior radiograph of femur - medial displacement of simple, diaphyseal femur fracture without significant angulation.

Communication of an open fracture is critical. Open fractures refer to injuries in which the fracture site has direct communication with the external environment. The presence of an open fracture has significant implications on injury management and prognosis.

### The role of computed tomography in surgical planning for trimalleolar fracture. A survey of OTA members [^115gMgTT]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Does the additional information provided by computed tomography (CT) alter surgeons' treatment plans for trimalleolar ankle fracture?

Design

Prospective.

Setting

Electronic survey.

Patients/Participants

Members of the OTA.

Intervention

Compare management of trimalleolar ankle fracture before and after CT.

Main Outcome Measurements

Compare types of fixation used, indication for fixation, and approach need for fixation before and after CT.

Results

Overall, OTA members' operative technique changed in 430 of the 1710 (25.1%) cases after review of the CT images. Of the 430 observations in which the operative technique was altered, the surgeon had initially stated that they would not have requested a CT in 51.2% incidences. When analyzing if CT affected whether or not operative fixation was indicated, a total of 16.3% responses changed. Surgeons were significantly more likely to change from no fixation to fixation (11.5%) than vice versa (4.8%) after reviewing CT imaging. A total of 17.8% of responses changed operative approach after reviewing the CT; 11.7% changed to open reduction internal fixation, whereas 6.1% changed away from open reduction internal fixation.

Conclusion

A consensus on the ideal treatment of trimalleolar fractures remains elusive, evidenced by a high variation in treatment preference, both before and after CT review. Our results demonstrate with the additional information delineated on CT, a surgeons' operative plan, technique, and approach often change. With greater than 25% of respondents changing their treatment strategy after seeing CT imaging, radiographs alone limited surgeon understanding of fracture pattern. Because of difficulty understanding the posterior fracture fragment, we recommend preoperative CT on all trimalleolar fractures.

### Spine injury [^115fQakn]. ACS (2022). High credibility.

Associated injuries indicating spinal risk — consider all trauma patients who present with severe injuries at high risk for associated spinal trauma, and consider specific injuries identified during the primary and secondary survey. Traumatic brain injuries (TBI), manifested by a decreased GCS score, place trauma patients at a high risk for an associated C-spine injury, and complex maxillofacial trauma is another example. A high proportion of patients with a pelvic fracture have associated spinal trauma to the cervical, thoracolumbar and sacral region. Thoracic trauma, including multiple rib fractures, sternal, scapular and clavicular fractures, increases the risk for associated cervical and thoracic spinal injuries. Calcaneal fractures resulting from a fall from height indicate a spinal injury risk, usually at the level of the lumbar region. Patients with a seatbelt-shaped abdominal contusion are also at risk for thoracolumbar spine trauma from a flexion-distraction injury. Also consider patients to be at high risk who require emergent surgical exploration for a gunshot wound or blunt traumatic injury, when an associated spinal injury may be found on postoperative imaging.

Rehabilitation of the multisystem trauma patient — key messages emphasize that a multidisciplinary rehabilitation team can provide optimal care to multiply-injured patients and should be integrated into the acute care hospitalization. Initial evaluation by a rehabilitation team should occur as early as possible following admission, even for critically ill patients unable to actively participate. Early evaluation provides an opportunity for the development of a proactive rehabilitation program and might reduce functional decline during hospitalization.

### Interobserver agreement for the chest wall injury society taxonomy of rib fractures using computed tomography images [^114sXZsW]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Further qualitative analysis on cases with low agreement on fracture type raised the suspicion that in several cases some of the observes did not see all the fracture lines in complex fractures. This probably resulted in a spread between wedge and complex type fractures. In addition, in two cases with low agreement on type, the fracture did not completely fit with the CWIS taxonomy definitions. One fracture consisted of one rib-width fracture line and multiple incomplete fracture lines, creating two butterfly fragments (Fig. 2). Most observers (54%) responded that this was a wedge type fracture, suggesting that a fracture with multiple butterfly fragments should probably classified as such. In another case, there were two rib width fracture lines with a considerable space in between. No specific CWIS taxonomy definition exists for the maximum distance between multiple fracture lines to be considered either one wedge or complex fracture or two separate fractures. This resulted in low agreement on type for this case. We suggest estimating if the fragment could be part of a flail pattern or not, which practically would be around a maximum of 2 cm between the fracture lines to be still considered the same fracture, based on our expert opinion.

### Early major fracture care in polytrauma-priorities in the context of concomitant injuries: a Delphi consensus process and systematic review [^116SPmq8]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Spinal Injuries

In polytrauma patients, the spine is affected in up to 30% of cases. Unstable fractures often require invasive procedures, which may be impossible in polytrauma patients due to the high surgical load, including long operative time, invasive approach, and risk of bleeding. Most publications recommend early fixation and treatment of unstable spinal fractures, regardless of the presence of neurologic deficit. Our literature review indicates that injuries to the thoracic spine, especially those with neurological deficits, should be stabilized early. A recent publication clearly showed that spinal injury requires early definitive surgery within 24 hours after admission, especially in patients with neurological deficits. Early surgery in the form of posterior spinal stabilization performed within 24 hours improves outcomes by avoiding immobilization, improving lung function, and shortening hospital and intensive care stays.

Vascular Injuries

The timing of fracture fixation in patients with associated major vascular injury remains a topic of debate. Some authors suggest temporary fixation of the fracture before final vascular repair to avoid potential graft complications. Conversely, others recommend immediate revascularization to decrease ischemia time. – In studies dealing with fracture repair and associated vascular trauma, the emphasis is mostly not on the timing but on the sequence of fracture fixation or revascularization. Our systematic review indicates that prolonged fracture fixation before revascularization increases vascular morbidity. Furthermore, the time taken to restore distal arterial flow has been consistently identified as the only modifiable risk factor for both graft failure and limb amputation in patients with a combined fracture of a long bone and severe arterial injury. Therefore, in cases of extremity fractures with arterial injuries, approaching the critical ischemia time of 6 hours, restoration of distal arterial flow takes priority over fracture fixation. This can be accomplished by the use of temporary intravascular shunts or definitive repair (primary repair, interposition graft), depending on the duration of ischemia and the complexity of the fractures.

Limitations

One limitation is the composition of the expert panel itself. Although it was important to control for an even distribution of experts in terms of geographical location, representation of different surgical specialties, and individual professional focus, slight imbalances had to be accepted regarding feasibility and coordination of the expert panel. The statements were synthesized from the expertise of the participants and the existing literature. Depending on the specific topic, the amount and quality/evidence of published literature varied greatly, resulting in a greater weighting of the expert opinions. Although most of the central issues of surgical care and trauma patterns were included in the statements, the recommendations may not cover rare or uncommon cases.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for distal radius fracture, more specifically with respect to prognosis, AOPT/APTA 2024 guidelines recommend to consider using female sex, high baseline levels of pain, and comorbid psychosocial factors (particularly depression) as potential predictors of poor outcomes related to the development of persistent pain symptoms, including type 1 complex regional pain syndrome.

### Posterior-based approaches to open reduction internal fixation of bimalleolar and trimalleolar fractures: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114scrze]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Although there is growing evidence supporting posterior-based surgical approaches to open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) of malleolar fractures, the lateral approach still remains the standard of care for this injury. The purpose of this review was to integrate the results of several studies investigating outcomes following posterior-based approaches to the ORIF of malleolar fractures. The literature search was undertaken using PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase. Crude event rates for fracture healing and postoperative complications were calculated. When possible, meta-analyses were conducted to estimate the relative risk of these outcomes between patients treated by posterior-based approaches versus other approaches to ORIF of malleolar fractures. Twenty-two studies were eligible, and 4 studies were included in the meta-analyses. The healing rate was 100% in all patients, regardless of the surgical approach. Overall, 1.26% of patients developed an infection, 0.63% required reoperation, 1.13% experienced aseptic loosening, 5.53% experienced pain after treatment, and 2.52% experienced symptomatic hardware. No malunion or heterotopic ossification was reported in any study. Among patients treated with a posterior-based approach, the most frequently reported complication was infection (2.50%), with lower rates of reoperation and postoperative pain. Patients with trimalleolar fractures experienced slightly poorer outcomes. Patients treated by posterior-based approaches had a significantly increased risk of infection (p = .010) relative to those treated by the lateral approach; patients treated by the lateral approach had a significantly increased risk of pain after surgery (p = .004) and symptomatic hardware (p = .007). This study brought together evidence that posterior-based surgical approaches and non-posterior-based approaches to ORIF are effective in healing malleolar fractures, with significant differences in specific postoperative complications that need to be further explored.

### Zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures and their association with naso-orbito-ethmoid fractures: a 5-year review [^111Wfig9]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures associated with ipsilateral naso-orbito-ethmoidal fractures are more complex injuries than isolated zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures. This injury pattern can have significant long-term morbidity if not recognized and treated appropriately during the initial operation. The purpose of this study is to compare mechanisms of injury, treatment, and outcome between patients with zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures and those with zygomaticomaxillary complex and ipsilateral naso-orbito-ethmoidal fractures.

Methods

A 5-year retrospective review of all patients treated with zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures at a level I trauma center was performed. Computed tomographic scans were reviewed to divide patients into those with zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures alone and those with zygomaticomaxillary complex and ipsilateral naso-orbito-ethmoidal fractures. Demographics, treatment protocols, outcomes, complications, reoperations, and length of follow-up were identified for both groups and compared to determine differences between these populations.

Results

A total of 245 patients were identified by the Current Procedural Terminology codes for zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures. One hundred eighty-five patients had zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures and 60 patients had zygomaticomaxillary complex/naso-orbito-ethmoidal injuries. The demographics for both populations were similar. There are differences between the groups with regard to mechanism of injury, operative findings, and techniques. The patients with zygomaticomaxillary complex/naso-orbito-ethmoidal fractures had higher rates of postoperative complications and deformities.

Conclusions

Patients who sustain a zygomaticomaxillary complex fracture associated with an ipsilateral naso-orbito-ethmoidal fracture have a higher incidence of postoperative complications and deformities. It is important to recognize this fracture pattern early to help minimize postoperative morbidity.

### Medial malleolar osteotomy for exposure of complex talar body fractures [^114qeRLM]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2001). Low credibility.

Traditional surgical approaches to the talus often fail to afford adequate exposure of the talar body, especially in the case of complex talar body fractures. Preservation of the remaining blood supply to the talus is a main concern during operative repair and can be difficult to accomplish when multiple approaches and forceful manipulations are required to gain satisfactory exposure. A medial malleolar osteotomy was used to gain access to the talar body in situations in which the traditional approaches did not provide adequate exposure. We describe our technique in a small series of patients.

### Complex extremity fractures following high energy injuries: the limited value of existing classifications and a proposal for a treatment-guide [^111GmDHu]. Injury (2009). Low credibility.

Complex extremity fractures have been described as demanding and associated with an increased risk of complications. Since a treatment-guided classification is not currently available, we recommend a new assessment for complex extremity fractures, categorising them into low, moderate and high risk depending on several fracture-related comorbidities. In our experience, the degree of soft-tissue damage and the overall injury severity are the most critical determinants in deciding whether primary definitive fracture stabilisation is possible or should be delayed. Low-risk complex extremity fractures can be managed according to classic fracture principles, whereas these principles may have limited value in moderate-risk complex extremity fractures. High-risk complex extremity fractures in the polytrauma setting require thorough assessment. In selected cases, primary amputation is a life-saving alternative. We present a new treatment guide taking parameters of local injury severity into account.

### Fracture of the anteromedial facet of the coronoid is more common than previously thought in combined fractures of the coronoid and radial head [^114peA2E]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The terrible triad injury involves an ulnohumeral dislocation, radial head fracture, and coronoid process fracture. According to traditional teaching, these injuries are strongly associated with anterolateral coronoid tip fractures and can be addressed via a lateral approach to the elbow. However, recent small clinical series suggest that some terrible triad injuries have larger coronoid fractures involving the anteromedial facet. It is important to understand how often these larger coronoid fractures occur because anteromedial facet fractures may need a different approach and different implants for fixation. An improved understanding of coronoid fracture morphology in terrible triad injuries may help surgeons construct a surgical plan.

Questions/Purposes

To better define coronoid fracture morphology in combined coronoid and radial head fractures, we therefore asked: What is the distribution of anterolateral facet versus anteromedial facet coronoid fragments in combined coronoid and radial head fractures without an ulnar shaft fracture?

Methods

This retrospective, multicenter descriptive study evaluated preoperative CT scans from adult patients (18 years or older) diagnosed with combined coronoid and radial head fractures. Between February 2014 and March 2023, we identified 10,016 adult patients with elbow or forearm injuries who underwent CT scans. Among these patients, we considered those diagnosed with combined coronoid and radial head fractures without an ulnar shaft fracture based on elbow CT scans performed within 4 weeks of the injury as potentially eligible. During that time, elbow CT scans were generally ordered to assess complex fractures, confirm diagnoses when radiographs were inconclusive, evaluate joint involvement, or plan for surgical interventions. Based on that, 2% (175 of 10,016) were eligible; a further 0.001% (8 of 10,016) were excluded because of preexisting elbow pathology, prior surgery, or low-quality CT images (including slice thickness greater than 2 mm, motion artifacts, and incomplete visualization of the osseous structure of the elbow and all its articulations), leaving 2% (167 of 10,016) for analysis. The mean age was 50 ± 15 years, and more than half of the patients were female (54% [90 of 167]). Coronoid fractures in patients with combined coronoid and radial head fractures were classified using the O'Driscoll classification into three types: Type 1 (anterolateral tip fractures), Type 2 (anteromedial facet fractures), and Type 3 (base fractures). Each type was further subcategorized based on specific fracture characteristics. Two of three trained researchers independently classified the coronoid fracture type of each patient using radiographs, two-dimensional (2D) CT scans, three-dimensional (3D) CT scans, and intraoperative findings, with interrater reliability assessed by the Cohen kappa, yielding a substantial agreement value of 0.658. Disagreements were resolved through discussions with a fellowship-trained orthopaedic trauma surgeon.

Results

Sixty-five percent (109 of 167) of patients had a Type 1 anterolateral coronoid tip fracture, 30% (50 of 167) had a Type 2 anteromedial facet fracture, and 5% (8 of 167) had a Type 3 basal fracture.

Conclusion

Surgeons should recognize that anteromedial facet involvement in coronoid fractures is more prevalent in combined coronoid and radial head fractures than previously appreciated. Future research should investigate whether these anteromedial fractures are more likely to need an additional medial approach to improve patient outcomes.

Clinical Relevance

This study suggests that anteromedial facet involvement is more common than traditionally recognized in terrible triad injuries, and surgeons should be prepared to address a larger fragment when treating these injuries.
