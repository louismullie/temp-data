## Question

Causes of acne vulgaris

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of acne vulgaris. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational framework that defines acne as a multifactorial inflammatory disease. Then, I should verify the core pathogenic pillars and whether they act sequentially or in parallel. Next, I will examine genetic predisposition, followed by hormonal drivers, microbial factors, and inflammatory mechanisms. After that, I need to integrate modifiable environmental contributors such as diet, stress, oxidative stress, and microbiome dysbiosis. Finally, I will synthesize the interrelationships into a coherent causal pathway, acknowledge competing perspectives and knowledge gaps, and conclude with a balanced model, ensuring each step is sourced and internally consistent [^112SWa1r] [^114jN1MK].

> Let me first confirm the fundamental framework. Acne vulgaris is best characterized as a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit with multifactorial pathophysiology, producing comedones, papules, pustules, and nodules on the face, chest, and back; this frames the discussion around interacting drivers rather than a single cause, and I need to ensure I keep that systems view in mind as I proceed [^112SWa1r] [^114jN1MK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about linear causality. I should verify the core pillars: increased sebum production, follicular hyperkeratinization, Cutibacterium acnes–related dysbiosis, and inflammation constitute interconnected mechanisms that can initiate and amplify each other rather than a rigid sequence, so I will evaluate them as concurrent, mutually reinforcing processes [^113KPk7C] [^112DMEmP] [^117Rvj7y].

> I will now examine genetic predisposition, since baseline susceptibility shapes how follicles respond to local and systemic cues. Large-scale GWAS show high heritability and identify dozens of loci, with implicated pathways in hair follicle morphogenesis, Wnt/MAPK signaling, and lipid biosynthesis; polygenic risk models stratify liability, with those in the highest risk percentiles having markedly increased odds, which I should remember when integrating upstream determinants with environmental triggers [^115Tttyk] [^115kjyUw] [^116pEDH2].

> Let me think about hormonal drivers next, and I should confirm both androgen and IGF-1 axes. Androgens stimulate sebocyte proliferation and lipogenesis, while IGF-1 integrates diet, mTORC1 signaling, sebaceous activity, and keratinocyte biology; the IGF-1/FoxO1/mTORC1 axis appears to potentiate both sebogenesis and hyperkeratinization, and I need to check that I link this to puberty and metabolic inputs appropriately [^1168nX9q] [^115gUKRk] [^113dgZjS].

> Next, I should review microbial contributors with an emphasis on strain-level effects rather than simple overgrowth. Wait, let me verify this shift in paradigm: acne associates with specific C. acnes phylotypes, with acne-associated strains demonstrating greater immunopathogenicity than health-associated strains, indicating dysbiosis and virulence factor profiles as key amplifiers of inflammation within a permissive follicular environment [^114361jm] [^117C6VYj].

> I need to ensure I do not understate inflammation, because evidence suggests subclinical inflammation can precede microcomedone formation. Aberrant innate immune activation, cytokine signaling, and persistent inflammatory cascades contribute to lesion evolution and sequelae, making inflammation both an early and sustained driver of disease expression [^1139QsB8] [^115SXemF] [^113KPk7C].

> Let me consider modifiable environmental and systemic cofactors, starting with diet and metabolism, but I should double-check guideline cautions. High glycemic load and dairy can increase insulin and IGF-1, linking diet to sebogenesis and keratinocyte biology; however, hold on, I should verify strength of evidence because contemporary guidelines note insufficient evidence to recommend specific dietary restrictions as therapy despite biologic plausibility, which tempers how prescriptively we counsel patients [^114md51p] [^115gUKRk] [^114LUT31].

> I will now examine oxidative stress, and I need to check whether it is upstream or downstream. Emerging data suggest lipid peroxidation may occur early and amplify inflammation and comedogenesis, implying antioxidant strategies could target proximal events, though the evidentiary base is still developing [^1124ReMn].

> Let me review psycho-emotional stress, but wait, I should distinguish association from mechanism. Stress-related neuroendocrine mediators such as CRH and substance P can stimulate sebaceous activity and inflammation, and the epidemiologic burden of acne includes mental health sequelae, so bidirectional links likely exist that can worsen disease cycles in vulnerable patients [^115QFep4] [^114jN1MK].

> I should confirm broader microbiome contributions beyond C. acnes. Skin microbial diversity shifts and potential gut–skin axis influences may prime or perpetuate cutaneous inflammation; I need to note these are plausible but heterogeneous findings that suggest future ecobiologic approaches to restore microbial balance rather than indiscriminately suppress flora [^117C6VYj] [^115QFep4].

> Synthesis now requires a stepwise but interactive causal pathway, and I will articulate it carefully. Genetically determined pilosebaceous vulnerability meets puberty-associated androgen and IGF-1 surges, driving sebaceous hypertrophy and altered keratinization; this creates a lipid-rich, hypoxic niche that favors acne-associated C. acnes strains, which in turn amplify innate immune activation and cytokine cascades, closing a vicious cycle that is further tilted by diet, stress, oxidative stress, and microbiome dysbiosis in susceptible individuals [^115Tttyk] [^115gUKRk] [^114361jm] [^113KPk7C].

> But wait, what if inflammation is not always primary; I should verify competing perspectives and correct as needed. Some translational and clinical studies argue that subclinical inflammation precedes visible comedogenesis, supporting inflammation as an initiating event, while certain genetic studies emphasize follicular structure and sebaceous biology without directly implicating inflammatory loci, suggesting inflammation could, in part, be secondary; acknowledging this apparent discrepancy, the most coherent position is that inflammation can be both initiating and amplifying depending on context and substrate, and I need to state that explicitly to avoid overclaiming causality [^1139QsB8] [^115SXemF] [^111W9wz5].

> Let me reconsider the entire model to ensure internal consistency. The weight of evidence supports a systems-level failure of host–pilosebaceous–microbiome homeostasis, grounded in genetic susceptibility, hormonally and metabolically driven sebaceous and keratinocyte changes, strain-specific C. acnes dysbiosis, and early-persistent inflammation, all modulated by diet, stress, oxidative stress, and broader microbiome dynamics, which together explain the clinical heterogeneity and chronicity of acne vulgaris [^112SWa1r] [^115Tttyk] [^114361jm] [^113KPk7C].

Acne vulgaris is driven by four core mechanisms: **increased sebum production**, **follicular hyperkeratinization**, **Cutibacterium acnes proliferation**, and **inflammation** [^112DMEmP] [^113XqcGQ] [^1139QsB8]. Androgens and IGF-1 amplify **sebum** and **keratinization**, while C. acnes triggers **innate immunity** and **cytokine release** [^113XqcGQ] [^114361jm] [^1139QsB8]. Genetic predisposition, high-glycemic diets, dairy, stress, and certain medications (e.g. corticosteroids, androgens) further exacerbate acne [^115Tttyk] [^113eXryf] [^112DMEmP] [^114md51p]. Management targets these pathways with topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, antibiotics, hormonal therapy, and isotretinoin for severe cases [^113GESw5] [^113XqcGQ] [^1139QsB8].

---

## Increased sebum production

Increased sebum production is driven by **androgens and IGF-1**, with androgens (testosterone, DHT) and IGF-1 driving sebocyte proliferation and lipogenesis, thereby increasing sebum and promoting follicular hyperkeratinization [^112DMEmP] [^113XqcGQ] [^115gUKRk]. Additionally, altered **sebum composition** (more monounsaturated fats) promotes inflammation and C. acnes growth [^113XqcGQ].

---

## Follicular hyperkeratinization

Follicular hyperkeratinization stems from **keratinocyte proliferation**, where excessive proliferation and abnormal desquamation cause microcomedones and follicular obstruction [^112DMEmP] [^1139QsB8]. It is further sustained by **inflammation**, as subclinical inflammation precedes lesions and persists throughout the lesion lifecycle [^113KPk7C] [^1139QsB8].

---

## Cutibacterium acnes proliferation

Cutibacterium acnes proliferation results from **microbial dysbiosis**, with C. acnes colonizing blocked follicles, producing proinflammatory mediators, and activating innate immunity [^1139QsB8]. Additionally, **strain variability** means certain C. acnes strains are more immunogenic and proinflammatory, worsening acne [^114361jm] [^1139QsB8].

---

## Inflammation

Inflammation in acne involves an **innate immune response**, whereby C. acnes activates TLRs, triggering cytokines (IL-1β, IL-8, TNF-α) and neutrophil recruitment [^1139QsB8] [^113KPk7C]. It also involves **oxidative stress**, with ROS and lipid peroxidation amplifying inflammation and tissue damage [^1124ReMn] [^1139QsB8].

---

## Hormonal factors

Hormonal factors include **androgens**, which increase sebum and keratinization and are central to acne pathogenesis [^112DMEmP] [^113XqcGQ], and **IGF-1**, which enhances androgen signaling and sebum production, thereby linking diet and hormones to acne [^115gUKRk] [^113XqcGQ].

---

## Genetic predisposition

Genetic predisposition is supported by **heritability** — acne is highly heritable, with multiple susceptibility loci identified [^115Tttyk] [^113XqcGQ] — and by specific **genetic variants** in androgen metabolism, sebaceous gland function, and immune pathways that increase risk [^115kjyUw] [^113XqcGQ].

---

## Environmental and lifestyle factors

- **Diet**: High-glycemic diets and dairy intake increase IGF-1 and sebum; omega-3s and low-glycemic diets are protective [^113eXryf] [^114md51p].

- **Stress**: Stress elevates cortisol and neuropeptides, increasing sebum and inflammation [^112DMEmP] [^113XqcGQ].

- **Medications**: Corticosteroids, androgens, and some anticonvulsants can trigger or worsen acne [^112DMEmP] [^113XqcGQ].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Topical therapies**: Retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, and antibiotics target core pathogenic pathways [^113GESw5] [^113XqcGQ].

- **Systemic therapies**: Oral antibiotics, hormonal therapy, and isotretinoin are used for moderate-to-severe acne [^115sg9Qn] [^1139QsB8].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Dietary changes and stress management can reduce severity [^113eXryf] [^114md51p].

---

Acne vulgaris is a **multifactorial disease** involving sebum, keratinization, microbial dysbiosis, and inflammation, with hormonal, genetic, and environmental modifiers; **effective care targets these mechanisms** with pharmacologic and lifestyle interventions [^113HZAsS].

### Genome-wide association meta-analysis identifies 29 new acne susceptibility loci [^112xM4QS]. Nature Communications (2022). Low credibility.

In addition to identifying specific loci contributing to acne susceptibility, our results demonstrate substantial polygenicity beyond the genome-wide significant association signals. In addition to the estimated 6% of the variance in acne liability explained by the 46 independent genome-wide significant variants identified here, a further 17% of acne liability is estimated to be explained by the polygenic tail. The polygenic architecture enabled the evaluation of genetic relationships with other traits that share underlying biological pathways, including immune-mediated disorders, such as Crohn's disease, and evidence of shared genetic aetiology with other traits, including a series of mental health disorders and breast cancer.

The epidemiological association between acne and mental health has been well documented. However, the direction of causality remains unclear; several observational studies indicate that damaged self-esteem resulting from acne development may mediate the association between severe acne and internalizing psychopathology. Depression, anxiety, and emotional lability have been associated with isotretinoin treatment. In contrast, there is also evidence that stress, poor self-care, and drug treatments for mental health disorders can cause acne. Elevated rates of breast cancer have been previously highlighted in females with a history of acne, and the shared influence of genetics between acne and breast cancer highlights the potential importance of endogenous hormone regulation. This is a key component of breast cancer risk and is further supported by a pu…

### Acne vulgaris: The role of oxidative stress and the potential therapeutic value of local and systemic antioxidants [^1124ReMn]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a common dermatological condition characterized by hormonally-mediated sebum overproduction, follicular hyperkeratinization, and chronic inflammation of the pilosebaceous unit. Microbes, genetic susceptibilities, and various environmental factors have been linked to the pathogenesis of the condition. Over the last several years, it has become apparent that patients with acne are under increased cutaneous and systemic oxidative stress. Moreover, the burden of oxidative stress may not be merely a consequence of acne; rather, oxidative stress, particularly lipid peroxidation, may be an early event that helps drive the acne process. Here, we explore the role of oxidative stress and review the preliminary research involving the administration of local and systemic antioxidants.

### Genome-wide association meta-analysis identifies 29 new acne susceptibility loci [^115Tttyk]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a highly heritable skin disorder that primarily affects facial skin. Severely inflamed lesions may leave permanent scars, which have been associated with long-term psychosocial consequences. Here, we perform a GWAS meta-analysis comprising 20,165 individuals with acne from nine independent European ancestry cohorts. We identify 29 novel genome-wide significant loci and replicate 14 of the 17 previously identified risk loci, bringing the total number of reported acne risk loci to 46. Using fine-mapping and eQTL colocalization approaches, we identify putative causal genes at several acne susceptibility loci that have previously been implicated in Mendelian hair and skin disorders, including pustular psoriasis. We identify shared genetic etiology between acne, hormone levels, hormone-sensitive cancers, and psychiatric traits. Finally, we show that a polygenic risk score calculated from our results explains up to 5.6% of the variance in acne liability in an independent cohort.

### Effects of diet on acne and its response to treatment [^114md51p]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Our understanding of the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris is still evolving. It is known that multiple factors impact acne pathophysiology, including genetic, hormonal, inflammatory, and environmental influences. Because of its implications in many of these factors, diet has been a part of the acne discussion for decades.

Several studies have evaluated the significance of the glycemic index of various foods and glycemic load in patients with acne, demonstrating individuals with acne who consume diets with a low glycemic load have reduced acne lesions compared with individuals on high glycemic load diets.

Dairy has also been a focus of study regarding dietary influences on acne. Whey proteins responsible for the insulinotropic effects of milk may contribute more to acne development than the actual fat or dairy content.

Studies have examined the effects of omega-3 fatty acid and γ-linoleic acid consumption in individuals with acne, showing individuals with acne benefit from diets consisting of fish and healthy oils, thereby increasing omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid intake.

Recent research into the effects of probiotic administration in individuals with acne presents promising results; further study of the effects of probiotics on acne is needed to support the findings of these early studies.

In this review, we discuss the evidence regarding the diets of US patients with acne and how they may impact acne and acne treatment.

### Photodynamic therapy for acne vulgaris: A critical review from basics to clinical practice: Part I. Acne vulgaris: When and why consider photodynamic therapy [^113uubEX]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

The first-line treatments for acne vulgaris are conventional topical and/or oral medications. However, many patients experience contraindications, only partial response, significant adverse effects, or recurrence. Light-based treatments and photodynamic therapy (PDT) using topical precursors of porphyrins are off-label alternative treatments for acne vulgaris, with their own advantages and disadvantages. At the time of writing, there is no consensus on PDT methodology and parameters. An understanding of the pathophysiology of acne, light-tissue interactions, and PDT mechanisms of action is helpful whenever PDT is considered as an alternative treatment. In general, blue light alone improves acne because of its anti-inflammatory effects. PDT using 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) or ALA derivatives induces transient antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects. At high doses, red light PDT may induce inhibition or destruction of sebaceous glands, resulting in clinical improvement.

- **Learning objectives**: After completing this learning activity, participants should be able to compare different treatments of acne, recognize when photodynamic therapy may be a useful off-label treatment for acne vulgaris, and identify variables that may affect the efficacy of photodynamic therapy.

### Genome-wide meta-analysis implicates mediators of hair follicle development and morphogenesis in risk for severe acne [^116XxJUF]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is an inflammatory disease of the skin, primarily affecting the face, chest, and back. The biological mechanisms leading to lesion development are poorly understood but involve a complex interplay between sebum production, follicular keratinization, inflammation, and colonization of pilosebaceous follicles by *Propionibacterium acnes*. The characteristic inflammatory papules, pustules, and nodules typically first develop during puberty, may persist for decades, and leave disfiguring scars in up to 20% of patients. Acne can have severe emotional and psychological consequences and has been associated with depression, unemployment, suicidal ideation, and suicide itself. Severe acne is typically treated with topical and systemic agents that suppress the microbiome repertoire or the activity of sebaceous glands. The treatment regimens are often ineffective and poorly tolerated, and there remains a substantial unmet medical need.

Evidence of a genetic component to acne susceptibility is well established. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of severe acne have identified three genomic loci harboring alleles associated with the disease in the European population and two in the Han Chinese population. These loci have provided insight into the biological mechanisms that underlie disease pathogenesis, including a potential role for components of the TGFβ pathway.

In the study, we further delineate the genetic susceptibility of severe acne through the identification of genetic variation at 15 genomic loci.

### Genome-wide association meta-analysis identifies 29 new acne susceptibility loci [^112CHidH]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The study capitalized on acne diagnoses ascertained by multiple different approaches, from clinical diagnosis to self-reported disease with varying criteria for case and control definition. This heterogeneity in cohort definitions may introduce bias into the effect size estimates, with estimates from the clinically ascertained cohorts typically larger than those observed in the cohorts where acne was self-reported or ascertained from electronic health records. In addition, the exclusion of mild acne cases from some of the self-reported cohorts may lead to inflated effect size estimates.

Nevertheless, the acne PRS defined from the meta-analysis is strongly associated with self-reported acne history across mild, moderate, and severe groups. Consistent with a liability threshold model of acne risk, the generated acne PRSs were associated with disease severity, with the best prediction among the severe group. Whilst further validation is needed, a robust genetic predictor of acne risk may have utility in identifying individuals at the highest risk of acne and intervening with prophylactic skin care regimes to minimize follicular occlusion before bacterial colonization and extensive inflammation are established, thus reducing disease severity and scarring.

The study sought to establish genetic risk factors that are independent of sex and age; however, further investigation to define specific genetic loci with sex or age-specific effects will improve our mechanistic understanding of the disease and has the potential to enhance polygenic prediction by modeling of dimorphic factors.

### Adolescent acne vulgaris: Current and emerging treatments [^1132g3WX]. The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health (2023). High credibility.

Acne vulgaris is one of the most common inflammatory skin diseases seen worldwide, affecting all ethnicities and races, with a peak prevalence between the ages of 15 and 20 years. The burden of this condition, along with the resulting clinical and psychological sequelae, is substantial. The visual appearance of acne and its sequelae, including scarring and pigment changes, frequently result in psychological and social morbidity due to concerns about appearance.

As our understanding of the pathophysiology has evolved, approaches to achieving optimal outcomes with effective treatment regimens continue to emerge. In recent years, several novel therapeutics have been developed, including new agents aimed at reducing antimicrobial resistance and products with specific actions targeting retinoid receptors as well as androgen receptors.

This review considers the management approaches for adolescents with acne vulgaris and examines treatment options based on the evidence base and international expert opinion. Approaches to selecting treatments, along with novel and emerging treatment regimens, are discussed.

### Effects of diet on acne and its response to treatment [^113eXryf]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is one of the most common dermatologic conditions globally. Unlike our knowledge regarding the heritable nature of acne and the role of hormones in acne pathogenesis, there is uncertainty regarding the role of environmental factors, including diet, in acne.

The development of acne in some populations after the adoption of a Western diet suggests that the latter plays a role in acne. Certain populations did not historically have acne: the Canadian Inuit, South African Zulus, Japanese Okinawans, Aché of Paraguay, and Kitavan islanders of Papua New Guinea. The appearance of acne in these groups has been attributed to their acceptance of Western diets, including processed foods, dairy, and refined sugars. Acne is also absent in adolescents with Laron syndrome, a hereditary dwarfism disorder resulting from insensitivity to growth hormone. However, some do develop acne if treatment with insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) is undertaken. Acne resolves when IGF-1 dosing is reduced or discontinued.

Here, we examine how diet may influence acne pathogenesis, persistence, and treatment. To perform the literature search for this review, PubMed and MEDLINE were queried with combinations including but not limited to the following search terms: isotretinoin, diet and acne, glycemic index (GI) and acne, dairy and acne, and acne pathophysiology. A review of search results was performed for dates from 1977 to 2020, and relevant articles were selected. Because of the limited number of studies available, clinical studies and review articles were included if they…

### Acne vaccines: Therapeutic option for the treatment of acne vulgaris [^112CzuKP]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Acne, one of the most common skin diseases, is caused by multiple factors, including Propionibacterium acnes. Studies suggest that responses to P. acnes by host immunity play important roles in its pathogenesis. Identifying immune modulators that attenuate inflammatory responses against P. acnes and the inhibition of bacterial growth may lead to novel avenues of immunologic intervention.

### What's new in the physiopathology of acne [^117Rvj7y]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

There are four central factors that contribute to acne physiopathology: the inflammatory response, colonization with Propionibacterium acnes, increased sebum production, and hypercornification of the pilosebaceous duct. In addition, research in the areas of diet and nutrition, genetics, and oxidative stress is yielding some interesting insights into the development of acne. This paper reviews some of the most recent research and novel concepts revealed through work published by researchers from diverse academic disciplines, including dermatology, immunology, microbiology, and endocrinology.

- **Novel concepts and research**: We discuss the implications of these findings, particularly in terms of opportunities to develop new therapies.
- **Interrelationships and gaps**: We highlight interrelationships between these novel factors that could contribute to the pathology of acne and indicate where gaps in our understanding still exist.

### What does acne genetics teach us about disease pathogenesis [^115fVBPF]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a highly prevalent inflammatory skin disorder with a complex pathogenesis, characterized by comedones, papules, pustules, and nodules. Familial preponderance clearly indicates a genetic basis for acne vulgaris, but until recently, solid genetic associations were lacking.

- **Results**: The advent of high-resolution genotyping array technologies has enabled large-scale studies with both family-based and cross-sectional designs. These studies have revealed genetic loci encompassing genes that could be active in biological pathways and processes underlying acne vulgaris. However, specific functional consequences of those variants remain elusive. In parallel, investigations into rare disorders and syndromes that incorporate features of acne or acne-like lesions have recently accelerated our understanding of disease pathogenesis. The genes revealed by these rare disorders highlight mechanisms cardinal for pilosebaceous biology and therefore anchor our insights from genetic association studies for acne vulgaris.

- **Conclusions**: The next phase of research will require more in-depth mechanistic investigations of loci and genes implicated in acne phenotypes to define the key molecular players driving the disorder. Concurrently, new treatments for acne vulgaris could be developed by dissecting the candidate molecular pathways to identify druggable targets.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^113GESw5]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acne vulgaris, particularly concerning topical therapies, the AAD 2024 guidelines recommend offering the following fixed-dose combinations of topical agents to patients with acne:

- **Topical antibiotics with benzoyl peroxide**: This combination is effective for reducing acne symptoms.
- **Topical retinoids with topical antibiotics**: Offer concomitant benzoyl peroxide to prevent the development of antibiotic resistance.
- **Topical retinoids with benzoyl peroxide**: This combination helps in managing acne by leveraging the synergistic effects of the two agents.

### Current issues in the treatment of acne vulgaris [^11745Dtg]. Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is an extraordinarily common skin condition in adolescents. The mainstays of acne treatment have remained largely unchanged over recent years. In the context of increasing antibiotic resistance worldwide, there is a global movement away from antibiotic monotherapy toward their more restrictive use. Classically reserved for nodulocystic acne, isotretinoin has become the drug of choice by dermatologists for moderate to severe acne. Given the virtually ubiquitous nature of acne in teenagers, there remains an appreciable need for novel therapies.

In this article, we will cover the currently used acne treatments, evaluate the issues and data supporting their use, explore the issues of compliance and the mental health implications of acne care, and recommend directions for the field of acne management in adolescents in the years ahead.

### Progress on multiomics research on acne vulgaris: A literature review [^113juGS3]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris, a prevalent chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit, continues to present with a complex pathogenesis that is not fully understood. The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has revolutionized biomedical research, enabling the comprehensive use of multiomics analyses to study diseases with intricate mechanisms, such as acne. This review summarizes the progress in genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics research on acne. By providing a comprehensive overview, we aim to enhance our understanding of acne pathogenesis and identify potential therapeutic targets that could inspire the prevention and treatment of acne.

### Advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of inflammatory acne [^1139QsB8]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris (AV) is the most common skin disorder. It was traditionally thought that AV lesions developed after abnormal desquamation of the keratinocytes that line the sebaceous follicle, leading to hyperkeratinization and microcomedone formation. However, in recent years, there has been a paradigm shift regarding the understanding of the pathogenesis of AV, and it is now viewed as a primary inflammatory skin disorder. Research has implicated the presence of subclinical inflammation in the normal skin of acne patients, even before microcomedone formation. This article reviews the novel concepts that play a role in the new pathogenesis of acne vulgaris.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^116WCbmE]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

The analyses presented here informed national guidance for the management of acne vulgaris in England, published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), who worked with the British Association of Dermatologists for this purpose. The guideline was developed by a committee of academics, health professionals, and service users with expertise and experience in acne vulgaris.

- **Materials and methods**: Searches for RCTs of treatments for acne vulgaris were conducted in Embase, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) from inception, using relevant medical subject headings, free-text terms, and study-type filters where appropriate. The search was undertaken in August 2019, and reruns were performed in May 2020.

- **Selection criteria for the systematic review and the network meta-analysis**: A systematic review of RCTs of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical, and combined treatments for mild-to-moderate and moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris was undertaken according to PRISMA guidelines. The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020154100).

The review included people with acne vulgaris of all ages (except neonatal acne) and severity levels. Populations with postinflammatory dyspigmentation, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), refractory acne, or receiving maintenance treatment were excluded. Separate analyses were conducted for mild-to-moderate and moderate-to-severe cases.

### Acne: Topical treatment [^115nRpza]. Clinics in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a common skin disease, affecting about 70–80% of adolescents and young adults. It is a multifactorial disease of the pilosebaceous unit. The influence of androgens at the onset of adolescence leads to an enlargement of the sebaceous gland and a rise in sebum production. Additional increased proliferation and altered differentiation of the follicular epithelium eventually blocks the pilosebaceous duct, leading to the development of the microcomedo as the primary acne lesion. Concomitantly and subsequently, colonization with Propionibacterium acnes increases, followed by induction of inflammatory reactions from bacteria, ductal corneocytes, and sebaceous proinflammatory agents.

### Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies novel loci conferring risk of acne vulgaris [^116pEDH2]. European journal of human genetics (2024). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a common chronic skin disorder presenting with comedones and cystic structures forming within the distal hair follicle. Most cases additionally show inflammatory skin lesions on the face and upper torso. We performed a genome-wide association study and meta-analysis of data from 34,422 individuals with acne and 364,991 controls from three independent European-ancestry cohorts. We replicated 19 previously implicated genome-wide significant risk loci and identified four novel loci [11q12.2 (FADS2), 12q21.1 (LGR5), 17q25.3 (FASN), and 22q12.1 (ZNRF3-KREMEN1)], bringing the total number of reported acne risk loci to 50. Our meta-analysis results explain 9.4% of the phenotypic variance of acne.

A polygenic model of acne risk variants showed that individuals in the top 5% of the risk percentiles had a 1.62-fold (95% CI 1.47–1.78) increased acne risk relative to individuals with average risk (20–80% on the polygenic risk score distribution). Our findings highlight the Wnt and MAPK pathways as key factors in the genetic predisposition to acne vulgaris, together with the effects of genetic variation on the structure and maintenance of the hair follicle and pilosebaceous unit. Two novel loci, 11q12.2 and 17q25.3, contain genes encoding key enzymes involved in lipid biosynthesis pathways.

### Acne: Hormonal concepts and therapy [^113dgZjS]. Clinics in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is the most common skin condition observed in the medical community. While it is known that hormones play an important role in the development of acne, many questions remain about the mechanisms by which hormones exert their effects.

Androgens such as dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and testosterone, the adrenal precursor dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and estrogens such as estradiol, alongside other hormones including growth hormone and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), may be significant contributors to acne. It is not yet determined whether these hormones are absorbed from the serum by the sebaceous gland, produced locally within the gland, or involve a combination of these processes. Additionally, the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which these hormones influence the sebaceous gland have not been fully elucidated.

Hormonal therapy is considered an option for women with acne that does not respond to conventional treatment or for those with signs of endocrine abnormalities.

### Acne in women [^115kMFLZ]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

This review focuses on the subject of acne in women, a disease that is increasingly common and can also affect men. Adult acne differs from the type of acne that occurs in teenagers, and it may persist beyond adolescence or have its onset at an older age (adult-onset acne or late acne). Acne can negatively impact the quality of life of patients at any age, leading to a negative body image and a decrease in self-esteem. In older patients, it can result in discrimination in the workplace and other social environments. Acne in women must be understood as a specific problem, and this article discusses the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, psychology, and treatment of this prevalent issue.

### Optimal management of acne to prevent scarring and psychological sequelae [^114tckBo]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is one of the most common inflammatory dermatoses and is seen in both the hospital setting and in general practice. Multiple factors are involved in the pathophysiology of acne, including an alteration in the pattern of keratinization within the pilosebaceous follicles resulting in comedone formation; an increase in sebum production influenced by androgens; the proliferation of *Propionibacterium acnes*; and the production of perifollicular inflammation. Genetic and hormonal factors may also contribute to acne. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease has led to the development of novel therapies targeted at one or more of the implicated etiologic factors.

Systemic antibiotics for acne have long been the mainstay of treatment. The primary concern following the use of systemic antibiotics is the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of *P. acnes*. Concomitant use of non-antibiotic therapies, such as benzoyl peroxide, helps decrease the occurrence of resistance and can be effective in treating both resistant and non-resistant propionibacterial strains. However, no one agent is capable of eradicating resistant strains completely. Since resistant strains correlate to a poor clinical response to therapy, prescribing strategies are required to minimize the occurrence of resistance to *P. acnes*.

When assessing acne, it is important to take an all-encompassing approach and carefully examine both the clinical and psychological effects of the disease process. There are numerous forms of acne scarring, and it is important to evaluate these thoroughly.

### Contribution of GATA6 to homeostasis of the human upper pilosebaceous unit and acne pathogenesis [^112SWa1r]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Acne vulgaris is one of the most common dermatological conditions, affecting about 650 million people worldwide, including over 85% of all teenagers. It is a chronic inflammatory disease of the upper pilosebaceous unit, the name given to the hair follicle (HF) and its associated sebaceous gland (SG). Microcomedones and comedones are primary acne lesions that result from occlusion of the HF, preventing sebum from being released onto the skin surface. Hyperseborrhoea and inflammatory papules, pustules, and nodules are also manifestations of acne. Acne places a significant clinical, psychological, and economic burden on patients.

The upper pilosebaceous unit includes the infundibulum (INF), which comprises multiple layers of differentiating keratinocytes adjacent to the hair shaft and the interfollicular epidermis (IFE). It also includes the sebaceous gland (SG) and the junctional zone (JZ) at the intersection between the INF, the sebaceous duct (SD), and the isthmus (IST) that lies above the lower, cycling portion of the HF. Together, the INF and JZ provide a channel for the hair shaft as it emerges onto the skin surface.

In humans, the SG is a multilobular holocrine gland with an outer layer of proliferative cells surrounding differentiating lipid-rich sebocytes. In mice, SG organization is similar, although SG are smaller and unilobular, and SD are shorter. Within the gland, differentiating sebocytes burst, releasing sebum into the JZ/INF through a short SD to lubricate the skin.

### The epidemiology of acne vulgaris in late adolescence [^112DMEmP]. Adolescent Health, Medicine and Therapeutics (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acne vulgaris:

- **Definition**: Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that predominantly affects late adolescents and young adults.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of acne vulgaris is multifaceted. It includes disturbed sebaceous gland activity, leading to hyperseborrhea or increased sebum production, dysregulation of the hormone microenvironment, interaction with neuropeptides, follicular hyperkeratinization, induction of inflammation, and dysfunction of the innate and adaptive immunity.

- **Epidemiology**: The worldwide prevalence of acne vulgaris is estimated at 1,585 per 100,000 population.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for acne vulgaris include hormonal influences, particularly androgens that enhance sebum production, most notably in polycystic ovarian syndrome; genetic predisposition with identified susceptibility loci; the use of specific medications; obesity; family history; and environmental factors. The precise etiological triggers of acne, however, remain unclear.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, acne vulgaris presents with a variety of lesions, including open and closed comedones (blackheads and whiteheads), inflammatory papules, pustules, and nodules and cysts in severe cases. It typically resolves in the late teens or early adulthood, but for some patients, it can persist into later life. Scarring, a potential consequence, can reduce the quality of life of patients.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Acne vulgaris is not a life-threatening condition; however, it can have significant physical and psychological effects.

### Studying the genetic predisposing factors in the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris [^115Z3YkL]. Human Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Acne is one of the most common dermatologic diseases in developed regions of the world, affecting a large percentage of the population. Despite significant improvements in the number and quality of studies on the molecular etiology of this disease over the past three decades, the detailed molecular pathogenesis and the cause of the large individual variations in the severity of skin symptoms remain unknown. The roles of genetic inheritance and specific genetic susceptibility and protective factors have been suggested for over 100 years, but their identification and determination began only in the 1990s. At the time of writing, only a small number of genetic polymorphisms affecting the expression and/or function of a few genes have been investigated. This review surveys the major findings of the classic and molecular genetic studies conducted in this field, draws conclusions, and indicates how the available data enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of this common skin disease.

### Genome-wide association meta-analysis identifies 29 new acne susceptibility loci [^115kjyUw]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a highly heritable skin disorder that primarily impacts facial skin. Severely inflamed lesions may leave permanent scars that have been associated with long-term psychosocial consequences. Here, we perform a GWAS meta-analysis comprising 20,165 individuals with acne from nine independent European ancestry cohorts. We identify 29 novel genome-wide significant loci and replicate 14 of the 17 previously identified risk loci, bringing the total number of reported acne risk loci to 46. Using fine-mapping and eQTL colocalisation approaches, we identify putative causal genes at several acne susceptibility loci that have previously been implicated in Mendelian hair and skin disorders, including pustular psoriasis. We identify shared genetic aetiology between acne, hormone levels, hormone-sensitive cancers, and psychiatric traits. Finally, we show that a polygenic risk score calculated from our results explains up to 5.6% of the variance in acne liability in an independent cohort.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^113HZAsS]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Acne vulgaris is the eighth most common disease globally, affecting over 0.5 billion people. Acne can have a detrimental physical, psychological, and social impact. Acne severity may be determined by clinical presentation (number and type of lesions), secondary sequelae (scarring, pigmentation), and its psychological and social impact on the patient. Uncertainty around acne treatment effectiveness may be a barrier to treatment. Various topical, oral, and physical acne treatments are available, but little is known about their comparative effectiveness, especially in relation to acne severity.

Network meta-analysis (NMA) allows simultaneous estimation of relative effects for any number of treatments, even if some have not been directly compared in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), provided that treatments create a 'network of evidence' where every treatment is linked to at least another treatment through direct comparisons.

Two NMAs assessing the effectiveness of treatments for acne vulgaris have been published at the time of writing, both focusing on mild-to-moderate acne. Therefore, our study examined the relative effectiveness, acceptability, and tolerability of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical, and combined treatments separately for mild-to-moderate and moderate-to-severe acne, as determined by clinician-assessed morphological features, to identify suitable first-line treatments.

### Immunotherapy for acne vulgaris: Current status and future directions [^114R5VmV]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

There is a high unmet clinical need for new and better treatments in acne vulgaris. Propionibacterium acnes has strong proinflammatory activity and targets molecules involved in innate cutaneous immunity, keratinocytes, and sebaceous glands of the pilosebaceous follicle. The role of P. acnes in acne confers legitimacy on the possible benefits of immunization-based approaches, which may represent a solution for limiting the development of antibiotic-resistant P. acnes.

Various immunization-based approaches have been developed over the last decades, including:

- **Killed pathogen-based vaccines**: Developed as a preventive measure.
- **Vaccination against cell wall-anchored sialidase**: Targeting specific virulence factors.
- **Monoclonal antibodies to the Christie, Atkins, Munch-Peterson factor of P. acnes**: Targeting specific bacterial components.
- **Anti-Toll-like receptors vaccines**: Designed to modulate immune response.
- **Natural antimicrobial peptides**: Explored as an alternative to traditional therapies.

This review summarizes the evidence and explores the challenges in making these approaches realistic treatment options for the future.

### Individual article: Pathophysiologic targets of acne treatment [^117PSYQr]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is an extremely common dermatologic condition. Individuals with acne present not only to dermatologists but also to internists, family medicine physicians, pediatricians, estheticians, and beauty counters alike in search of a treatment. The diagnosis of acne is relatively straightforward, leading many to believe that acne is a simple condition. However, the pathophysiology of acne is anything but simple. Decades of research have ultimately revealed a complex interaction of pathogenic factors that lead to acne. This includes sebum production, *C. acnes* colonization, inflammation, and follicular hyperkeratinization. Understanding each of these features has been fundamental to the development of anti-acne medications.

Topical agents are often used as an initial therapy given their safety and efficacy. While some topical therapies have been used for decades, new creams, gels, and lotions continue to be added to the list of approved acne treatments. Given the number of topical acne products on the market, we present an updated review of the landscape of topical acne treatments and how each choice functions mechanistically to fight against acne.

### Acne: Inflammation [^1168iJFB]. Clinics in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

The inflammatory stage of acne vulgaris is typically of greatest concern to patients. Various morphologically different inflammatory lesions may form, which can be both painful and unsightly. In 30% of patients, these lesions lead to scarring. Inflammatory acne and resultant scarring can significantly impact a patient's psychological well-being, causing issues such as depression, anxiety, and poor self-image. Although clinically well-characterized, the mechanisms through which inflammatory lesions develop are still poorly understood. The human skin commensal bacterium, Propionibacterium acnes, has long been associated with inflammatory acne. It is implicated more than any other cutaneous microflora in triggering the inflammatory response typical of acne. However, its precise role in the disease and its interaction with the human immune system remain to be fully elucidated.

### Evolving perspectives on the etiology and pathogenesis of acne vulgaris [^1139Kvar]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

As the pathophysiology of acne is complex and multifactorial, the continued influx of new basic science and clinical information requires careful analysis before drawing conclusions about what truly contributes to the development and progression of this chronic disease. Our objective is to review the latest evidence and highlight a number of important perspectives on the pathophysiology of acne. An improved understanding of acne pathogenesis should lead to more rational therapy, and a better understanding of the role of P. acnes opens new perspectives for the development of new treatments and management.

Further research may be directed at targeting receptors, adhesion molecules, cytokines, chemokines, or other pro-inflammatory targets implicated in the activation of immune detection and response (i.e. toll-like receptors [TLRs], protease-activated receptors [PARs]) that appear to contribute to the pathophysiology of acne. Therapeutic options that reduce the need for topical and/or oral antibiotic therapy for acne are welcome as bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a clinically relevant concern both in the United States and globally.

### New insights into systemic drivers of inflammation and their contributions to the pathophysiology of acne [^115QFep4]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris (AV) is a prominent skin disease commonly affecting teenagers. It often persists into adulthood and is associated with adverse physical and psychosocial impacts. The pathophysiology of AV is conventionally correlated with four factors within and around the pilosebaceous unit: increased sebum production, follicular hyperkeratinization, Cutibacterium acnes proliferation, and localized immune responses. As such, conventional therapeutic approaches for AV have primarily focused on these factors.

In addition to this primarily localized pathophysiology, there is a progressively emerging body of evidence indicating that underlying systemic factors contributing to a generalized immuno-inflammatory response can contribute to or exacerbate AV. In this article, we introduce and provide supporting data for six patient-centric systems that may be implicated in the development of AV: psycho-emotional stress, diet and metabolism, dysbiosis of the gut and skin microbiome, hormonal fluctuations, oxidative stress, and immune response. Identifying these pathways and their contributions in a patient-centric approach may provide expanded therapeutic opportunities for treating patients with AV.

### Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies novel loci conferring risk of acne vulgaris [^111W9wz5]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2024). Low credibility.

Twin studies have shown that acne is highly heritable, with up to 85% of the population variance attributed to genetic factors. Cross-sectional prevalence studies suggest a similar genetic contribution, with family history correlating strongly with disease risk and severity. Concordant with knowledge of the pathogenesis of acne, genetic studies have outlined biological pathways with overlapping functions, such as stem cell homeostasis, tissue remodeling, cell adhesion, as well as androgen metabolism.

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have led to the identification of 46 susceptibility loci in European populations, highlighting genes with established roles in the determination of hair follicle development, morphology, and activity. These findings underscore the importance of TGF-β–mediated signaling pathways. GWASs and studies of single-gene disorders and syndromes associated with acne have revealed strong links to the tissue microenvironment and remodeling occurring during sebaceous gland maturation, but not to inflammation. Thus, inflammation may be considered a secondary event. Understanding the biological processes that govern sebaceous gland (SG) development and homeostasis would reveal potential etiological mechanisms underlying acne and other SG-associated skin disorders.

Yet, a significant proportion of the genetic susceptibility to acne remains unclear. Therefore, conducting comparative studies with different populations is essential. The replication of previous findings is crucial to identify true risk loci and unravel key trait-related pathways. We carried out a GWAS with the Estonian population, but further details of our findings were not provided in the text.

### Genome-wide association meta-analysis identifies 29 new acne susceptibility loci [^113iZDnv]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Despite considerable recent advances in new treatments for other inflammatory skin diseases, including psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, there is a substantial unmet medical need in the treatment of acne. Early and effective intervention strategies are often necessary to avoid irreversible scarring in severe acne. Treatment typically consists of topical and systemic agents that suppress the microbiome repertoire or the activity of sebaceous glands, while other treatments include hormonal treatment and phototherapy. The most effective agent to treat acne is isotretinoin, which may induce remission through its effect on epidermal differentiation. However, its side effect profile, including dry skin, lips (cheilitis) and mucous membranes, muscle aches, skin itching, and headaches, restricts its use to those with severe disease. Isotretinoin is also a powerful teratogen, and its use during pregnancy is restricted due to its association with severe and life-threatening birth defects. Therefore, better-tolerated acne treatments are required, and there is a particular need for effective options without the risk of teratogenicity.

The genetic contribution to acne susceptibility has been demonstrated in several twin studies, with heritability consistently estimated around 80%. Recent molecular genetic studies identified 17 genomic loci harboring alleles associated with the disease — 15 loci with a reported effect in European populations, and two in a Han Chinese population. Functional characterization of these genetic association signals has implicated a series of causal genes whose genetic…

### Genome-wide association meta-analysis identifies 29 new acne susceptibility loci [^114jN1MK]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a common skin disorder resulting from inflammation of the pilosebaceous unit leading to characteristic comedones, papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts. Lesions are generally restricted to the face, neck, chest, and back, with onset typically occurring during puberty. Prevalence estimates of acne vary substantially; it is estimated that more than 85% of teenagers are affected to some degree, and up to 8% have been reported with severe disease, making acne the most prevalent skin disease worldwide. According to the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD), acne was estimated to be responsible for nearly 5 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) globally in 2019, with the majority occurring in those aged 15–49 years. This is greater than other chronic inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis. Severe acne often persists into adulthood, and scar formation is more prevalent in this severe adult population.

Acne is associated with impaired quality of life, including lower rates of employment in patients with acne, reduced school and work performance, as well as a substantial impact on mental health that correlates with clinical severity. Individuals with acne have elevated rates of depression and higher rates of mental health illness than those without acne. Rates of suicidal ideation and other mental health disorders are up to three times higher in adolescents with severe acne than their peers with little or no acne. Several studies report increased clinical depression and anxiety.

### Re-evaluating treatment targets in acne vulgaris: Adapting to a new understanding of pathophysiology [^115SXemF]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Two primary factors are changing approaches to the management of acne vulgaris (AV): the continuously evolving role of *Propionibacterium acnes* in the pathophysiology of AV and recent evidence of an inflammatory basis for AV via innate immunity. The developing concepts emphasize that acne is primarily an inflammatory disease.

The emerging concept of subclinical inflammation and its effect on the development and progression of acne lesions correlating with the sequence of the underlying inflammation process has been a major change in our understanding of acne pathogenesis. Thus, inflammation has become the major feature of the disease process from onset to resolution, including postinflammatory erythema, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, and scarring. Our treatment targets may also need to be reconsidered, with more emphasis on anti-inflammatory treatments.

### Pathogenesis of acne vulgaris: recent advances [^116paZRa]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is the most common disorder seen in ambulatory dermatology practice. It causes significant morbidity, and the direct costs associated with it exceed $2.2 billion per year in the United States (U.S.). The pathogenesis is multifactorial, and our understanding of the mechanisms involved in the development of acne lesions has improved over time. Follicular hyperkeratinization, sebum production, the presence of *Propionibacterium acnes* (P. acnes), inflammatory mediators, as well as androgens have been identified as key components of acne pathophysiology.

Recent advances have been made in this area, including the discovery of P. acnes interaction with Toll-like receptors (TLRs), vaccines targeting P. acnes or its components, antimicrobial peptides, and the role of hormones.

### Understanding the role of Propionibacterium acnes in acne vulgaris: The critical importance of skin sampling methodologies [^116Mo34o]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory skin condition classified by the Global Burden of Disease Study as the eighth most prevalent disease worldwide. The pathophysiology of the condition has been extensively studied, with an increase in sebum production, abnormal keratinization of the pilosebaceous follicle, and an inflammatory immune response all implicated in its etiology. One of the most disputed points, however, is the role of the gram-positive anaerobic bacterium Propionibacterium acnes in the development of acne, particularly when this organism is also found in normal sebaceous follicles of healthy skin.

Against this background, we now describe the different sampling strategies that have been adopted for qualitative and quantitative study of P. acnes within intact hair follicles of the skin and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of such methodologies for investigating the role of P. acnes in the development of acne.

### Functional divergence of a bacterial enzyme promotes healthy or acneic skin [^114361jm]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Acne vulgaris affects four out of five individuals at some point during their lifetime. Predisposition to acne depends on both host and environmental factors. Among these, the role of skin commensal C. acnes has been debated since both healthy and acne-prone individuals are robustly colonized with C. acnes. Recent skin microbiome studies of C. acnes strain populations from acne patients and individuals with healthy skin highlight the importance of C. acnes genetic elements as a major determinant of acne, as the development of acne is strongly associated with certain C. acnes strains and phylotypes. Accordingly, C. acnes strains have been categorized based on their association with health or acne. Consistent with this classification, studies of select health- and acne-associated C. acnes strains have demonstrated greater induction of inflammation or potentially deleterious responses by acne-associated strains compared to health-associated strains in vitro.

Subsequent metagenomics studies unveiled sets of genes that are prominently present in acne- or health-associated strains of C. acnes, thereby ushering in a new frontier in the quest to understand acne pathogenesis. However, acne pathogenesis is poorly understood, hampered by the absence of a robust animal model and the poor survival of C. acnes in rodents. We recently addressed the growth of C. acnes in mice by applying human synthetic sebum to murine skin, which allowed the persistence of C. acnes. We further demonstrated remarkable and uniformly enhanced immunopathogenicity of acne-associated strains.

### Targeting inflammation in acne: Current treatments and future prospects [^113KPk7C]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

As knowledge of acne pathogenesis expands, novel approaches for targeting inflammation are rapidly emerging in the form of topical, systemic, procedural, and combination therapies. New or modified medications within familiar classes, the repurposing of drugs used to treat other inflammatory conditions, and the development of novel treatment modalities may all be efficacious in treating acne. Some of these treatments have the added benefit of decreasing and treating acne sequelae, including atrophic scarring and dyspigmentation. The diverse mechanisms of action include direct bactericidal activity against C. acnes, inhibition of pro-inflammatory factor release, reduction of oxidative stress, activation of the immune system, and modulation of the microbiome. With growing concerns over antimicrobial resistance and with certain individuals unable to tolerate well-established therapies, additional treatment options that are safe and effective in all skin types and colors are needed.

### What's new in acne and inflammation [^116sziZs]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Acne is a disease that leaves physiological as well as physical scars. As we attempt to understand this complicated disease, new research challenges our traditional understanding that the microcomedone is the initial step in the development of the acne lesion. Recent evidence suggests that subclinical inflammation is the primary event in lesion development and that inflammation persists throughout the lesion life-cycle. Therefore, all types of acne should be considered "inflammatory" acne.

### Inflammation and acne: Putting the pieces together [^111vmaQF]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a common skin disease in which abnormal desquamation, excess sebum production, proliferation of *Propionibacterium acnes*, and the production of proinflammatory mediators all contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. A review of the literature shows that our understanding of acne pathogenesis continues to evolve. Recent data suggest that inflammatory mediators may play a more important role than previously realized; however, how these mediators work independently as well as together in acne lesion progression is not well understood.

Several cell types and mediators involved in the pathology of acne are responsible for producing or exacerbating an inflammatory response. Here, we present an updated theoretical model of acne lesion progression that highlights the role inflammatory mediators may play throughout acne lesion development.

### Targeting inflammation in acne: Current treatments and future prospects [^1168nX9q]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Low credibility.

Acne pathophysiology is multifactorial: sebum alteration, aberrant follicular keratinization, and Cutibacterium acnes combine to cause microcomedones, ultimately leading to inflammation and acne. Recent advances in the study of acne have identified nuances in these contributing factors, including hormones and neuropeptides, sebum production, the microbiome, and innate and adaptive immunity.

- **Hormones and neuropeptides**: Androgens stimulate sebocyte proliferation, augment the formation of intracellular lipid droplets and triglyceride formation, and induce hyperkeratinization of the follicular infrainfundibulum. While androgens certainly influence acne, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is the principal hormonal driver of acne. IGF-1 downregulates nuclear transcription factor Forkhead Box protein O1 (FoxO1), ultimately increasing lipogenesis as well as androgen receptor transduction, as FoxO1 normally suppresses both. IGF-1 additionally promotes a pro-inflammatory sebum higher in monounsaturated fats, induces androgen synthesis, and increases the availability of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the skin. Diets comprised of high-glycemic index foods, dairy, and whey protein contribute to acne through stimulation of IGF-1, while omega-3-fatty acids and low-glycemic load diets are protective as they downregulate IGF-1.

Neuropeptides are biologically active molecules found in neurons, and numerous are implicated in acne pathogenesis, including corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), substance P (SP), and the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) system.

### The skin microbiome: A new actor in inflammatory acne [^117C6VYj]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Our understanding of the role of Cutibacterium acnes in the pathophysiology of acne has recently undergone a paradigm shift. Rather than C. acnes hyperproliferation, it is the loss of balance between the different C. acnes phylotypes, together with a dysbiosis of the skin microbiome, which results in acne development. The loss of diversity of C. acnes phylotypes acts as a trigger for innate immune system activation, leading to cutaneous inflammation. A predominance of C. acnes phylotype IA1 has been observed with a more virulent profile in acne than in normal skin.

Other bacteria, mainly Staphylococcus epidermis, are also implicated in acne. S. epidermidis and C. acnes interact and are critical for the regulation of skin homeostasis. Recent studies also showed that the gut microbiome is involved in acne through interactions with the skin microbiome. As commonly used topical and systemic antibiotics induce cutaneous dysbiosis, our new understanding of acne pathophysiology has prompted a change in direction for acne treatment.

In the future, the development of individualized acne therapies will allow targeting of the pathogenic strains, leaving the commensal strains intact. Such alternative treatments, involving modifications of the microbiome, will form the next generation of "ecobiological" anti-inflammatory treatments.

### Acne: Transient arrest in the homeostatic host-microbiota dialog [^112z9zuX]. Trends in Immunology (2019). Low credibility.

We propose that acne vulgaris represents a naturally developing, transient inflammatory interaction of adolescent facial skin with its new microbial/chemical milieu (Cutibacterium acnes, sebum), replacing a state of previous childhood skin homeostasis. This concept might explain why acne is characterized by strong regional and age specificity, prevalent occurrence, and resolution.

### Effects of diet on acne and its response to treatment [^115gUKRk]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Acne pathogenesis is attributed to four key factors: excess sebum production, hyperproliferation of *Cutibacterium acnes* (C. acnes, formerly called *Propionibacterium acnes*) bacteria, hyperkeratinization of the pilosebaceous follicles, and inflammatory mechanisms. Excess sebum production occurs because of increased activity of androgen hormones and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1).

- **Mechanism of IGF-1**: Insulin-like growth factor-1 has been shown to decrease nuclear levels of the metabolic forkhead box class O transcription factor 1 (FoxO1), which leads to activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 is implicated in cell proliferation and metabolism. In acne, mTORC1 mediates sebaceous gland hyperproliferation, lipid synthesis, and hyperplasia of keratinocytes. Leucine, a common amino acid in meat and dairy proteins, also activates mTORC1. Insulin-like growth factor-1 also increases androgen levels, which in turn increase endogenous levels of IGF-1, forming a positive feedback loop that increases sebum production. Hyperinsulinemia increases circulating levels of IGF-1 and insulin-growth factor-binding protein-3, directly impacting keratinocyte hyperplasia and apoptosis. The expression of sterol response element-binding protein-1 is also increased by IGF-1, stimulating sebum production in sebocytes. Growth hormones and inflammatory mediators are also associated with acne development.

### Effects of diet on acne and its response to treatment [^1138iLyN]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Acne prevalence is estimated to be 9.4% worldwide, with the highest prevalence in adolescents and young adults. It decreases with age beyond 30 years. After the teenage years, acne remains more common in women than men, occurring in approximately one-half of women in their 20s, one-third in their 30s, and one-quarter in their 40s.

In the United States, acne is the most common condition presenting to dermatologists. Despite a greater number of teenage boys having acne compared to girls, almost two-thirds of dermatology visits due to acne are attended by female individuals. Approximately two-thirds of visits are made by patients under 25 years of age, with the mean age of those seeking treatment being 24 years. Children as young as 6 years may be prescribed acne treatment. Acne medications are most often prescribed for those aged 12–14 years.

### Targeting inflammation in acne: Current treatments and future prospects [^113XqcGQ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Low credibility.

Acne is a common, chronic inflammatory condition affecting millions of people worldwide, significantly impacting quality of life and mental health. It is characterized by comedones, inflammatory papules, pustules, and nodulocystic lesions, which can lead to long-lasting sequelae, including scarring and dyspigmentation. Dyspigmentation is more common in skin of color. The four main pillars of acne pathophysiology include alterations in sebum production and concentration, hyperkeratinization of the follicular unit, Cutibacterium acnes strains, and an inflammatory immune response. Recent research has provided greater insight into these pathophysiological categories. This enhanced understanding of acne pathogenesis has led to numerous new and emerging treatment modalities. These include combinations of existing treatments, repurposing of existing agents historically used for other conditions, new topical treatments, novel antibiotics, topical and oral probiotics, and various procedural devices. This article provides an overview of emerging treatments for acne and their connection to our improved understanding of acne pathogenesis.
