## Question

Are systolic murmurs dangerous?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether systolic murmurs are dangerous. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context, because danger varies by age, symptoms, and risk factors. Then, I should verify how murmurs are classified and which features raise concern. Next, I will review evidence on diagnostic accuracy and the risk of missing serious disease. After that, I should consider specific high-risk entities like aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and acute valvular emergencies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach and state when echocardiography is warranted, anchoring to guidelines and population data.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context matters enormously. In children, most murmurs are innocent, whereas in adults — especially older adults — murmurs more often reflect structural valve disease, so I need to be careful not to overgeneralize across ages. I should double-check that neonates and infants are a special case where even seemingly benign murmurs can herald congenital heart disease, so a lower threshold for evaluation is appropriate [^116erdhe] [^115bZ8ks].

> Next, I should review classification. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: a systolic murmur is not inherently dangerous. Innocent (functional) murmurs are common, soft, early systolic, and often position-variant, whereas pathologic murmurs tend to be louder, holosystolic, late-peaking, or accompanied by abnormal extra sounds. I need to ensure I integrate intensity, timing, quality, radiation, and associated findings like S2 abnormalities or clicks before labeling a murmur as dangerous [^114ggdRX] [^1158pR7y].

> I will now examine the diagnostic performance of auscultation, because misclassification changes risk. Wait, let me verify the numbers: in a general adult population, GPs detected murmurs in 23% but only 35.5% of those with significant valvular disease had an audible murmur, meaning sensitivity is limited and many cases are missed. Conversely, when a systolic murmur is present, specificity for significant disease is high, especially for aortic stenosis, which is why a new systolic murmur in an adult should prompt echocardiography even if asymptomatic [^1112e78R].

> Let me consider specific high-risk entities. Aortic stenosis is a prime example where a new systolic murmur can be the first clue to progressive, potentially life-threatening disease. I should confirm that guidelines advise repeat echocardiography when the murmur intensifies, peaks later in systole, or A2 is diminished, and that preoperative or symptomatic patients with suspected AS warrant formal evaluation because hemodynamic compromise can be sudden [^1161sH7S] [^116bPXrZ].

> But wait, what if the murmur is dynamic and position-sensitive? Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy produces a harsh systolic murmur that intensifies with standing or Valsalva and decreases with squatting; this is a classic red flag because HCM is a leading cause of sudden cardiac death in adolescents and young adults. I should double-check that preparticipation screening literature supports ECG in addition to exam features to improve detection, given the limited predictive value of murmur classification alone in this age group [^112ibAcW] [^1124zyQQ].

> Next, I should review acute scenarios. In acute chest pain, a new systolic murmur can signal acute mitral regurgitation from papillary muscle rupture or a ventricular septal defect, both high-mortality complications. Hold on, I should verify that contemporary ED pathways explicitly flag a new systolic murmur as a high-risk finding that should expedite imaging and specialty input, which they do [^113JDTgA].

> Let me synthesize risk stratification. In adults, a new systolic murmur — especially grade 3/6 or louder, holosystolic, late-peaking, radiating, or accompanied by abnormal S2 — warrants transthoracic echocardiography even if asymptomatic, because the pretest probability of significant valve disease is material and the consequences of delay can be serious. In children, most murmurs are innocent, but diastolic murmurs, harsh or holosystolic murmurs, or those with concerning associated findings should be imaged. In neonates, I should confirm that many experts recommend a low threshold for echocardiography given the higher prevalence of structural disease and the difficulty of auscultation in the first days of life [^111kjxZe] [^116erdhe] [^115bZ8ks].

> I need to ensure I address the question of "danger" directly. Yes, some systolic murmurs are dangerous because they indicate structural heart disease with risks of heart failure, arrhythmias, ischemia, or sudden death, and they can be the only early sign before symptoms emerge. However, many systolic murmurs are benign, especially in children and in adults with soft, early systolic ejection murmurs and otherwise normal exams. The key is to integrate intensity, timing, quality, associated sounds, symptoms, age, and risk factors, and to use echocardiography when the clinical picture raises concern or when the stakes are high, such as before surgery or in acute presentations [^1161sH7S] [^116bPXrZ] [^116erdhe].

> Finally, I should double-check practical next steps. For adults with a new systolic murmur, obtain an echocardiogram if the murmur is grade 3/6 or louder, holosystolic, late-peaking, radiating, associated with abnormal S2 or symptoms, or if there are risk factors or planned surgery. For children, refer if the murmur is diastolic, harsh, holosystolic, grade 3/6 or louder, or accompanied by abnormal exam findings. For neonates, consider early echocardiography given the higher yield. And if in doubt, remember that auscultation has imperfect sensitivity; when suspicion persists, imaging is the safer course [^111Ydgw9] [^116erdhe] [^115bZ8ks].

Systolic murmurs are **not inherently dangerous**; most are innocent, especially in children and adolescents, and pose no risk [^116erdhe]. However, some indicate **significant heart disease** — such as aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy — and can lead to serious complications if untreated [^1161sH7S] [^112ibAcW]. Danger signs include a loud (≥ grade 3/6), harsh, holosystolic, or late-peaking murmur, especially with symptoms, abnormal heart sounds, or radiation to the neck or back [^1158pR7y] [^1161sH7S]. Echocardiography is the **gold standard** for distinguishing innocent from pathologic murmurs and should be used when red flags are present or when the diagnosis is uncertain [^111Ydgw9] [^111kjxZe].

---

## Classification of systolic murmurs

Systolic murmurs are broadly classified as **innocent (benign)** or **pathologic (organic)** based on their acoustic characteristics and associated clinical findings [^114ggdRX].

| **Feature** | **Innocent murmurs** | **Pathologic murmurs** |
|-|-|-|
| Intensity | Soft (≤ grade 2/6) | Loud (≥ grade 3/6) |
| Quality | Musical, blowing | Harsh, coarse |
| Timing | Early systolic, short | Holosystolic, late systolic |
| Associated sounds | Normal S1 and S2 | Abnormal S2, ejection clicks, gallops |
| Radiation | None or limited | Wide radiation (neck, back, axilla) |
| Symptoms | Asymptomatic | May have symptoms (dyspnea, syncope, chest pain) |

---

## Prevalence and clinical significance

Innocent murmurs are **common in children and adolescents**, with a prevalence of up to 80% in healthy children [^116erdhe]. They are typically soft, short, and early systolic, with normal S1 and S2, and require no further evaluation or treatment [^114ggdRX]. Pathologic murmurs are less common but carry **significant clinical implications**. They may indicate structural heart disease, such as:

- **Aortic stenosis**: A harsh, late-peaking systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border, often radiating to the neck [^112pur5r].
- **Mitral regurgitation**: A holosystolic murmur at the apex, radiating to the axilla [^113yZD8w].
- **Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)**: A harsh systolic murmur that intensifies with standing or Valsalva maneuver [^1124zyQQ].
- **Ventricular septal defect (VSD)**: A holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border [^113TraFJ].

---

## Clinical features indicating danger

Certain features of systolic murmurs indicate **potential danger** and warrant further evaluation:

- **Loud intensity**: Grade 3/6 or higher [^1158pR7y].
- **Harsh quality**: Coarse, rough, or harsh-sounding murmurs [^1174QtzH].
- **Holosystolic timing**: Extending throughout systole [^1158pR7y].
- **Late systolic peak**: Suggests severe outflow obstruction (e.g. aortic stenosis) [^1161sH7S].
- **Abnormal heart sounds**: Diminished or absent S2, ejection clicks, or gallops [^1158pR7y].
- **Wide radiation**: To the neck, back, or axilla [^116erdhe].
- **Associated symptoms**: Dyspnea, syncope, chest pain, or exercise intolerance [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Echocardiography is the **gold standard** for differentiating innocent from pathologic murmurs. It provides detailed information about cardiac structure and function, enabling accurate diagnosis and management planning [^111Ydgw9]. Electrocardiography (ECG) and chest radiography may be used selectively based on clinical suspicion but are not routinely indicated for all murmurs [^116erdhe].

---

## Potential complications of pathologic systolic murmurs

If left untreated, pathologic systolic murmurs can lead to **significant complications**, including:

- **Heart failure**: Due to chronic volume or pressure overload [^notfound].
- **Arrhythmias**: Including atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias [^notfound].
- **Infective endocarditis**: Particularly in valvular heart disease [^notfound].
- **Sudden cardiac death**: Especially in conditions like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^112ibAcW].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause and severity** of the murmur. Innocent murmurs require no treatment, whereas pathologic murmurs may necessitate medical therapy, surgical intervention, or transcatheter procedures. Regular follow-up and monitoring are essential to track disease progression and guide timely intervention [^1161sH7S].

---

## Prognosis

The prognosis of systolic murmurs varies with the **underlying etiology**. Innocent murmurs have an excellent prognosis, while pathologic murmurs carry variable prognoses depending on the severity and type of cardiac disease. Early diagnosis and appropriate management significantly improve outcomes [^1166ALmY].

---

Systolic murmurs are **not inherently dangerous**; most are innocent and benign. However, certain features — such as loud intensity, harsh quality, holosystolic timing, and associated symptoms — indicate potential underlying heart disease and warrant further evaluation. Echocardiography is the definitive diagnostic tool, and early identification of pathologic murmurs enables timely intervention and improved outcomes [^111Ydgw9].

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) may remain clinically silent and undiagnosed until patients reach advanced age. We describe 2 older patients with previously undetected and probable late-onset HCM whose preoperative cardiac examination revealed only the presence of a systolic murmur. Both patients were diagnosed with HCM by perioperative echocardiography. We provide an algorithm for the evaluation of murmurs detected during the preoperative anesthesia evaluation, with emphasis on the clinical characteristics of HCM, and we discuss the perioperative management of these patients. In addition, recent findings concerning the natural progression of HCM are discussed, revealing differences between HCM in younger patient populations and that in older patient populations and its implications for anesthetic management.

### Evaluation of children with heart murmurs [^1167QhXY]. Clinical Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Cardiac murmurs can be a source of anxiety for both physicians and parents until serious cardiac disorders are excluded. The innocent cardiac murmur is still the most common finding in healthy children and can usually be diagnosed through obtaining a complete history and performing a complete physical examination. However, a cardiac murmur may be the first sign of a structural cardiac disease and should not be ignored. Referral to a pediatric cardiologist for further evaluation is required when murmur assessment is not clear and diagnostic uncertainty is present. Educating and reassuring parents remains an important aspect of this evaluation. This article discusses features of innocent and pathological murmurs and provides an approach to cardiac murmurs in children.

### Samuel A. levine and the history of grading systolic murmurs [^116AYFBz]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Murmurs were described first by Laennec in 1819, after which the significance of a murmur became a matter of debate. By the late 19th century, many physicians regarded systolic murmurs as "organic", whereas others believed that they were often "functional". Samuel Levine became a central figure in separating functional from organic systolic murmurs. Freeman and Levine's 1933 study of 1,000 "noncardiac" subjects determined the frequency, cause, and significance of systolic murmurs. Murmurs were rated on a scale of 1 to 6 grades of intensity. Approximately 20% of their patients had grade 1 or 2 systolic murmurs. Hypertension, fever, tachycardia, and anemia were common factors, and the murmurs were considered functional because they would often disappear when these causes were controlled. Of 19 subjects with grade 3 or 4 murmurs, all were determined to have organic heart disease or anemia. Thus, louder systolic murmurs were found to be a significant finding, as were the cause, location, and effects of posture. They concluded that systolic murmurs often have an explanation and that their grade can be useful in the diagnosis and prognosis. They cautioned that a loud systolic murmur did not necessarily indicate a bad prognosis or even serious heart disease. Levine's system of grading a systolic murmur is valuable and persists into the 21st century.

### Heart murmurs in children: evaluation and management [^116erdhe]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Up to 8.6% of infants and 80% of children have a heart murmur during their early years of life. The presence of a murmur can indicate conditions ranging from no discernable pathology to acquired or congenital heart disease. In infants with a murmur, physicians should review the obstetric and family histories to detect the possibility of congenital heart pathologies. Evaluation by a pediatric cardiologist is indicated for newborns with a murmur because studies show that neonatal murmurs have higher rates of pathology than in older children, and neonatal murmur characteristics are more difficult to evaluate during examination; referral is preferred over echocardiography. All infants, with or without a murmur, should have pulse oximetry screening to detect underlying critical congenital heart disease. In older children, most murmurs are innocent and can be followed with serial examinations if there are no findings of concern. Findings in older children that warrant referral include diastolic murmurs, loud or harsh-sounding murmurs, holosystolic murmurs, murmurs that radiate to the back or neck, or signs or symptoms of cardiac disease. Referral to a pediatric cardiologist is indicated when a pathologic murmur is suspected. Electrocardiography, chest radiography, and other tests should not be reflexively performed as part of all murmur evaluations because these tests can misclassify a murmur as innocent or pathologic, and they are not cost-effective. Emerging technologies include phonocardiography interpretation of murmurs and artificial intelligence algorithms for differentiating innocent from pathologic murmurs.

### Evaluation and management of heart murmurs in children [^1158pR7y]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Heart murmurs are common in healthy infants, children, and adolescents. Although most are not pathologic, a murmur may be the sole manifestation of serious heart disease. Historical elements that suggest pathology include family history of sudden cardiac death or congenital heart disease, in utero exposure to certain medications or alcohol, maternal diabetes mellitus, history of rheumatic fever or Kawasaki disease, and certain genetic disorders. Physical examination should focus on vital signs; age-appropriate exercise capacity; respiratory or gastrointestinal manifestations of congestive heart failure; and a thorough cardiovascular examination, including features of the murmur, assessment of peripheral perfusion, and auscultation over the heart valves. Red flags that increase the likelihood of a pathologic murmur include a holosystolic or diastolic murmur, grade 3 or higher murmur, harsh quality, an abnormal S2, maximal murmur intensity at the upper left sternal border, a systolic click, or increased intensity when the patient stands. Electrocardiography and chest radiography rarely assist in the diagnosis. Referral to a pediatric cardiologist is recommended for patients with any other abnormal physical examination findings, a history of conditions that increase the likelihood of structural heart disease, symptoms suggesting underlying cardiac disease, or when a specific innocent murmur cannot be identified by the family physician. Echocardiography provides a definitive diagnosis and is recommended for evaluation of any potentially pathologic murmur, and for evaluation of neonatal heart murmurs because these are more likely to be manifestations of structural heart disease.

### Low-grade systolic murmurs in healthy middle-aged individuals: innocent or clinically significant? A 35-year follow-up study of 2014 Norwegian men [^11591RX4]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether a low-grade systolic murmur, found at heart auscultation, in middle-aged healthy men influences the long-term risk of aortic valve replacement (AVR) and death from cardiovascular disease (CVD). Setting and subjects. During 1972–1975, 2014 apparently healthy men aged 40-59years underwent an examination programme including case history, clinical examination, blood tests and a symptom-limited exercise ECG test. Heart auscultation was performed under standardized conditions, and murmurs were graded on a scale from I to VI. No men were found to have grade V/VI murmurs. Participants were followed for up to 35years.

Results

A total of 1541 men had no systolic murmur; 441 had low-grade murmurs (grade I/II) and 32 had moderate-grade murmurs (grade III/IV). Men with low-grade murmurs had a 4.7-fold [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1–11.1] increased age-adjusted risk of AVR, but no increase in risk of CVD death. Men with moderate-grade murmurs had an 89.3-fold (95% CI 39.2–211.2) age-adjusted risk of AVR and a 1.5-fold (95% CI 0.8–2.5) age-adjusted increased risk of CVD death.

Conclusions

Low-grade systolic murmur was detected at heart auscultation in 21.9% of apparently healthy middle-aged men. Men with low-grade murmur had an increased risk of AVR, but no increase in risk of CVD death. Only 1.6% of men had moderate-grade murmur; these men had a very high risk of AVR and a 1.5-fold albeit non-significant increase in risk of CVD death.

### Teenage heart murmurs [^111e1G25]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

The first-time appearance of a murmur in an adolescent can create a substantial amount of anxiety in the parents and the teenager. The appropriate evaluation and diagnosis is very important in decision-making regarding sports participation in this population. Accurate identification of the innocent murmurs can obviate the need for echocardiography. Identification of a pathologic murmur may reduce morbidity and, possibly, mortality in critical lesions such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This article discusses the physiology and characteristics of different murmurs, and outlines an approach to cardiac murmurs in adolescents.

### Deep learning algorithms to detect murmurs associated with structural heart disease [^111CwFxP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

By applying the suite of algorithms to 1 million recordings from our database of sounds obtained from routine clinical practice, we can estimate the prevalence of structural murmurs and their characteristics in a manner not previously possible. Overall, our poor signal rate reflects that seen in our validation sets, underscoring the generalizability of our prior findings. The observed prevalence of structural heart murmurs is sizeable (Figure 5), suggesting that a large amount of subclinical disease exists in the community. Furthermore, although diastolic murmurs were rarer than systolic murmurs, they were more common than we expected based on prior reports or clinical anecdotes. Because diastolic murmurs are typically driven by lower pressure differentials, and therefore more difficult to identify than systolic murmurs, this may further reflect the usefulness of the technology presented. These epidemiological investigations should be considered exploratory, given that we are not privy to the underlying ground truth of these patients. To our knowledge, this is both the largest analysis of heart sounds to date and the first large‐scale study of the prevalence of structural heart murmurs themselves. We acknowledge a degree of selection bias in the Eko database, because clinicians are more likely to capture a recording of either an abnormal heart sound or a sound from a patient with known SHD. As such, the reported prevalence of such murmurs may be higher than in the overall population. Limitations in the curation and lack of ground truth for this data set should therefore be considered when interpreting the results of this analysis.

### Etiology and diagnosis of systolic murmurs in adults [^112pur5r]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

It is unknown whether echocardiography can provide insights into the origin of systolic murmurs and the modern value of bedside cardiovascular diagnosis.

Methods

The author examined 376 inpatients and compared their physical findings to transthoracic echocardiography, exploring the associations between echocardiography and systolic murmurs and investigating the diagnostic accuracy of physical examination for pathologic murmurs.

Results

Four echocardiographic variables predict the presence of systolic murmurs: peak aortic velocity (P < .001); mitral regurgitation severity (P < .001); mitral valve E-point velocity (P = 0.09); and absence of pericardial effusion (P = 0.09). When diagnosing murmurs, the most helpful finding is its distribution on the chest wall with respect to the 3(rd) left parasternal space, a landmark that distinguishes murmurs into 6 patterns. The "apical-base" pattern indicates increased aortic velocity (likelihood ratio [LR] 9.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]; 6.7–14): a delayed carotid upstroke (LR 6.8; 95% CI; 4.0–11.5); absent S2 (LR 12.7; 95% CI; 5.3–30.4); and humming quality to the murmur (LR 8.5; 95% CI; 4.3–16.5) further increase the probability of aortic valve disease. The "broad apical" murmur pattern suggests significant mitral regurgitation (LR 6.8; 95% CI; 3.9–11.9); and the "left lower sternal" murmur pattern indicates significant tricuspid regurgitation (LR 8.4; 95% CI; 3.5–20.3): additional bedside observations refine these diagnoses. Nonetheless, this study shows that some classic physical findings are no longer accurate, that physical examination cannot reliably distinguish severe aortic stenosis from less severe stenosis, and that classic physical findings, despite having proven value, are absent in many patients with significant cardiac lesions.

Conclusions

In the diagnosis of systolic murmurs, physical examination has limitations but also unappreciated value. A simple system using onomatopoeia and classifying systolic murmurs into 1 of 6 patterns is diagnostically helpful.

### Initial clinical evaluation of cardiac systolic murmurs in the ED by noncardiologists [^113tRtbb]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

It is not exactly known how ED physicians perform in evaluating cardiac systolic murmurs. In 203 consecutive medical ED patients with systolic murmur, we compared the initial clinical evaluation, including auscultation, with transthoracic echocardiography. Of the 203 patients, 132 (65%) had innocent murmurs and 71 patients (35%) had valvular heart disease. Sensitivity and specificity of the initial clinical routine evaluation in diagnosing echocardiographic valvular heart disease were 82% (70%-86%) and 69% (60%-76%), respectively. Independent significant positive predictors of valvular heart disease were grade > 2/6 systolic murmur (odds ratio [OR], 8.3; confidence interval [CI] 3.5–19.7, P < .001) and pathologic electrocardiogram (ECG) (OR, 8.4; CI, 3.2–22, P < .001. Patients younger than 50 years with a systolic murmur graded ≤ 2/6 had innocent murmurs in 98%. The initial clinical evaluation, including auscultation, by experienced ED physicians in internal medicine distinguishes well between innocent murmurs and valvular heart disease in medical patients with cardiac systolic murmurs.

Circulation (2008). Medium credibility.

Double-chambered right ventricle — clinical features in unoperated adults include that "Although most patients undergo repair before adulthood, some present much later". Adult symptoms "may mimic coronary disease (angina) or LV dysfunction (dyspnea)", and "Occasionally, dizziness and syncope may occur". Some patients are identified because of "the increasing intensity of a systolic murmur, previously ascribed to a small VSD or functional murmur".

### Eighty-two-year-old man with a systolic murmur [^112BqMk1]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical Introduction

An 82-year-old man with a history of coronary artery bypass surgery, hypertension and small bowel gastrointestinal stromal tumour underwent cardiac risk evaluation prior to surgical resection of his tumour. He was asymptomatic from a cardiovascular perspective, but his activity level was less than four metabolic equivalents. Physical examination was notable for a 2/6 systolic murmur at the apex. ECG showed sinus rhythm. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed (figure 1 and online supplementary video 1).DC1SP110.1136/heartjnl-2018-313413.supp1Supplementary file 1 heartjnl;104/22/1887/F1F1F1Figure 1Transthoracic echocardiography. (A) Mitral valve continuous wave Doppler and (B) tricuspid valve continuous wave Doppler.

Question

The findings in figure 1 are most likely due to which of the following?Atrioventricular conduction block. Acute severe aortic regurgitation. Patent ductus arteriosus. Atrial flutter. Severe mitral stenosis.

### 2022 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on the evaluation and disposition of acute chest pain in the Emergency department: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^113JDTgA]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Initial assessment of chest pain — terminology, examination, and chest X-ray guidance include using the terms "cardiac, possible cardiac, and noncardiac" to describe the suspected cause; clinical assessment "should include the chest pain description and associated symptoms, onset, duration, location, radiation, and precipitating and relieving factors"; there are "no physical examination findings specific for coronary ischemia", so the exam "should be targeted to identify findings associated with high risk for morbidity and mortality in ACS, or to the presence of potential alternative diagnoses", with high-risk findings including "signs of low cardiac output… heart failure… and a new systolic murmur concerning for acute mitral regurgitation or a ventricular septal defect"; as part of the initial assessment, "a chest X-ray should be performed in almost all patients with possible ACS", given its potential to identify high-risk and noncardiac causes, and "performance of a chest X-ray should not delay emergent interventions such as primary percutaneous coronary intervention for those with a definitive STEMI".

### Deep learning algorithms to detect murmurs associated with structural heart disease [^1175HKfj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Perhaps more importantly, such algorithms require regulatory approval to even be incorporated into clinical practice. Although several have received Food and Drug Administration clearance, the performance in true clinical environments remains unknown, either because the test characteristics seen in realistic clinical validation cohorts are lower than the original reports (SensiCardiac, K131044), or the algorithms are confined for use on discontinued devices (eMurmur, K181988).

In this research we present a novel suite of Food and Drug Administration‐cleared algorithms that characterize and classify heart sounds at the point of care. The algorithms screen signal quality and identify fundamental heart sounds (first and second heart sounds [S1 and S2]), murmurs associated with SHD (pathological murmurs), and murmur timing within the cardiac cycle (systolic and diastolic). We validate our algorithm with the largest data set to date entirely from real clinical environments, featuring a consistent data collection protocol, a diverse patient population, and clear ground truth labels from both expert cardiologists and echocardiograms as the clinical gold standard. Our findings illustrate the potential of a fully automated suite of machine learning algorithms to successfully and objectively detect SHD at the bedside as part of routine clinical care.

### The physiology of cardiac auscultation [^1131JZXk]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Cardiac auscultation remains a critical component of the pediatric examination and is the primary method of diagnosis for the common innocent murmurs of childhood. This article outlines the significance of auscultation and defines the skills important for the diagnosis and recognition of common cardiac murmurs in childhood. The origin of heart sounds and murmurs is reviewed, and an approach to pediatric murmur evaluation is presented. The seven innocent murmurs of childhood and adolescence are reviewed in detail. Further diagnostic evaluation and referral depends the clinician's confidence and experience in recognizing and correctly characterizing these murmurs.

### Heart murmurs in the general population: diagnostic value and prevalence from the troms ø study [^1112e78R]. Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Heart auscultation is a widely used and cost-effective clinical tool for detecting valvular heart disease (VHD), particularly in primary care. However, existing evidence on its diagnostic accuracy is limited by small sample sizes, specialist-led studies and high-prevalence settings. Robust population-based data are lacking. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and diagnostic accuracy of heart murmurs for identifying VHD in a general adult population, using echocardiography as the reference standard.

Methods

We conducted a diagnostic accuracy study within the Seventh Tromsø Study (2015–2016), involving 2082 participants aged ≥ 40 years (mean age 63 years). Heart sounds were recorded at four chest locations and independently classified by general practitioners (GPs) blinded to echocardiographic results. Murmurs were graded and categorised as systolic or diastolic. Clinically significant VHD was defined as ≥ mild aortic stenosis (AS) or ≥ moderate aortic regurgitation (AR) or mitral regurgitation (MR). We calculated sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and likelihood ratios for murmur detection.

Results

GPs detected heart murmurs in 487 participants (23%). Significant VHD was identified in 392 participants (19%), but only 139 of them (35.5%) had an audible murmur. Systolic murmurs detected all cases of AS (sensitivity 100%, specificity 78%). Sensitivity was lower for AR (43%) and MR (29%), while specificity of distinct murmurs exceeded 94% across all VHD types. Diastolic murmurs were rare (n = 9) but highly specific (> 99%). Among participants with murmurs, age ≥ 70 years (OR 2.0, 95%CI 1.2 to 3.4), male sex (OR 3.3, 95%CI 2.0 to 5.3) and previous myocardial infarction (OR 2.3, 95%CI 1.0 to 5.2) were independently associated with VHD.

Conclusion

In this general adult population, heart auscultation by GPs identified murmurs in nearly one in four individuals and showed high specificity but limited sensitivity for diagnosing VHD. Auscultation remains a valuable initial screening tool-especially for AS-but should be complemented by echocardiography in older or high-risk individuals.

### Automated cardiac auscultation for detection of pathologic heart murmurs [^1174QtzH]. Pediatric Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Experienced cardiologists can usually recognize pathologic heart murmurs with high sensitivity and specificity, although nonspecialists with less clinical experience may have more difficulty. Harsh, pansystolic murmurs of intensity grade ≥ 3 at the left upper sternal border (LUSB) are likely to be associated with pathology. In this study, we designed a system for automatically detecting systolic murmurs due to a variety of conditions and examined the correlation between relative murmur intensity and likelihood of pathology. Cardiac auscultatory examinations of 194 children and young adults were recorded, digitized, and stored along with corresponding echocardiographic diagnoses, and automated spectral analysis using continuous wavelet transforms was performed. Patients without heart disease and either no murmur or an innocent murmur (n = 95) were compared to patients with a variety of cardiac diagnoses and a pathologic systolic murmur present at the LUSB (n = 99). The sensitivity and specificity of the automated system for detecting pathologic murmurs with intensity grade ≥ 2 were both 96%, and for grade ≥ 3 murmurs they were 100%. Automated cardiac auscultation and interpretation may be useful as a diagnostic aid to support clinical decision making.

Stable chest pain, intermediate-high risk — assessment of left ventricular function: In intermediate-high risk patients with stable chest pain who have pathological Q waves, symptoms or signs suggestive of heart failure, complex ventricular arrhythmia, or a heart murmur with unclear diagnosis, use of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is effective for diagnosis of resting left ventricular systolic and diastolic ventricular function and detection of myocardial, valvular, and pericardial abnormalities.

### The systolic murmur… [^111hrJQx]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The physical causes or mechanism of the systolic murmur and its clinical significance have been matters of much discussion for many years. There was a time, not so very long ago, when on hearing a systolic murmur over the heart, even in the absence of any other important abnormalities, the physician would pronounce the ominous verdict that the patient was suffering from organic heart disease with mitral insufficiency. He would also imply in this diagnosis a serious prognosis and institute restrictions in the mode of life for his patient. More recently, systolic murmurs have been found so often to be benign that an entirely opposite point of view has developed. It has become the teaching in many localities that "systolic murmurs have no significance whatever, " that "organic mitral insufficiency does not exist except with mitral stenosis" and even that "auscultation is of no great importance, " for it is not the.

### Murmur clinic: validation of a new model for detecting heart valve disease [^115UDnxA]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first published description of a specialist murmur clinic. The majority (70%) of patients referred from the community with a murmur had structurally normal hearts and could safely have been screened using the limited views of a point-of-care scan.

The sensitivity of auscultation by the scientist was 83% compared with 91% by the cardiologist, a difference that was not statistically significant although with wide 95% CIs reflecting the small population size. We estimate that a sample size of 580 would be necessary to investigate equivalence between scientist and cardiologist with 80% power and assuming an acceptable difference in performance of < 5%. By contrast, the point-of-care scan had a sensitivity of 100% when performed by either scientist or cardiologist showing its superiority over auscultation for the detection of valve disease. We believe that auscultation should still be included in the assessment at a murmur clinic since a number of uncommon abnormalities (eg, muscular ventricular septal defect, aortic coarctation or pulmonary stenosis) would usually be associated with obvious systolic murmurs but might not be detected by a point-of-care scan. Conversely, diastolic murmurs as a result of mitral stenosis or pulmonary or aortic regurgitation may be hard to hear but should be obvious on a point-of-care echocardiogram. An abnormal murmur or point-of-care scan should prompt a TTE.

National workforce and organisational differences mean that the disciplines running a murmur clinic may vary. Often a cardiologist will run a murmur clinic either separately or within a specialist valve clinic, but in some countries, a specialist senior nurse might be trained for the role. In the UK, the cardiac physiologist career structure is now expanding with a Higher Specialist Scientific Training programme designed to produce a new class of consultant clinical scientists. A murmur clinic is consistent with the extended clinical role expected of this discipline.

### Deep learning algorithms to detect murmurs associated with structural heart disease [^117STFb3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The success of cardiac auscultation varies widely among medical professionals, which can lead to missed treatments for structural heart disease. Applying machine learning to cardiac auscultation could address this problem, but despite recent interest, few algorithms have been brought to clinical practice. We evaluated a novel suite of Food and Drug Administration‐cleared algorithms trained via deep learning on > 15 000 heart sound recordings.

Methods and Results

We validated the algorithms on a data set of 2375 recordings from 615 unique subjects. This data set was collected in real clinical environments using commercially available digital stethoscopes, annotated by board‐certified cardiologists, and paired with echocardiograms as the gold standard. To model the algorithm in clinical practice, we compared its performance against 10 clinicians on a subset of the validation database. Our algorithm reliably detected structural murmurs with a sensitivity of 85.6% and specificity of 84.4%. When limiting the analysis to clearly audible murmurs in adults, performance improved to a sensitivity of 97.9% and specificity of 90.6%. The algorithm also reported timing within the cardiac cycle, differentiating between systolic and diastolic murmurs. Despite optimizing acoustics for the clinicians, the algorithm substantially outperformed the clinicians (average clinician accuracy, 77.9%; algorithm accuracy, 84.7%.)

Conclusions

The algorithms accurately identified murmurs associated with structural heart disease. Our results illustrate a marked contrast between the consistency of the algorithm and the substantial interobserver variability of clinicians. Our results suggest that adopting machine learning algorithms into clinical practice could improve the detection of structural heart disease to facilitate patient care.

### Should functional cardiac murmurs be diagnosed by auscultation or by Doppler echocardiography? [^116kgfrL]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

For many years, cardiac auscultation has been the only available method for distinguishing between functional and organic murmurs; however, a more reliable differential diagnosis can now be achieved with Doppler echocardiography. The question remains as to whether a Doppler echocardiogram needs to be routinely recorded in the presence of a heart murmur or whether the auscultatory diagnosis of a functional murmur is sufficient.

Hypothesis

This prospective study attempts to answer this important question at a time when medical costs have to be curbed.

Methods

The three cardiologists involved in this study saw 516 new patients in their private practice over a 10-month period; of these, 321 (63.6%) underwent Doppler echocardiography. All patients underwent careful auscultation prior to echocardiography. At the end of their examinations, the cardiologists noted whether they considered the murmur to be of functional or organic origin. Minimal mitral or aortic regurgitations of short duration and low velocity occurring on non-thickened valves were considered functional.

Results

The results for cardiac auscultation and Doppler echocardiography were considered to be concordant, that is, both techniques diagnosed either a functional or organic murmur in 250 of 321 patients (77.9%). The results for cardiac auscultation and Doppler echocardiography showed a major discordance in just six cases (1.9%). All were mitral regurgitations of moderate severity.

Conclusion

The prevalence of cardiac murmurs in the general population is very high. As echocardiography currently represents a significant proportion of cardiac medical expenditure, it would be wise to limit the use of this technique to essential indications. This study confirms that both cardiac auscultation and Doppler echocardiography possess important limitations. Nevertheless, it also shows that well-trained cardiologists can identify the vast majority of functional murmurs on auscultation. Better training of nonspecialist physicians in cardiac auscultation may help in containing medical expenses.

### Murmurs… [^1124zyQQ]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Murmurs Systolic murmurs have only a few possible causes: blood flow across an outflow tract, a ventricular septal defect; atrioventricular valve regurgitation, or persistent patency of the arterial duct. Systolic murmurs can also be functional. GRADES Systolic murmurs are graded on a six-point scale. A grade 1 murmur is barely audible, a grade 2 murmur is louder and a grade 3 murmur is loud but not accompanied by a thrill. A grade 4 murmur is loud and associated with a palpable thrill. A grade 5 murmur is associated with a thrill, and the murmur can be heard with the stethoscope partially off the chest. Finally, the grade 6 murmur is audible without a stethoscope. All murmurs louder than grade 3 are pathologic. Most pathologic murmurs do not change significantly with standing. An important exception is the murmur of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a potentially life-threatening condition.

This murmur increases in intensity when the patient stands. In the upright position, venous return to the heart is reduced, decreasing the left ventricular end diastolic volume. As left ventricular size decreases, the left ventricular outflow tract narrows, and the systolic outflow obstruction increases. This narrowing increases the intensity of the murmur. Overall, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is rare; however, it is one of the leading causes of sudden death in athletes. Murmurs heard in patients with atrial septal defects are often of low pitch and intensity. However, the intensity of the murmur is not a reliable basis for the diagnosis. The systolic murmur is caused by an increased volume of blood coursing across the right ventricular outflow tract. If the murmur is audible, it can be heard at the upper left sternal border. 2, a systolic murmur at the upper left sternal border and a diastolic rumble should still be present when the patient is standing.

If the patient has an innocent or functional murmur, the precordial activity should be normal, the S 2 should split and move with respiration, the systolic murmur should decrease in intensity and no diastolic murmur should be present in the tricuspid valve area.

### The maverick heart sound [^113Q71Si]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical Introduction

An asymptomatic 29-year-old woman presented for prenatal counselling. She had a history of a heart murmur since childhood and a previous echocardiogram suggesting 'enlargement of the heart'. Physical exam revealed normal jugular venous pressure and contour. Precordial palpation was unremarkable. Auscultation, however, was abnormal; findings on inspiration and expiration are presented in Figure 1, sound clip.

Question

Based on the phonocardiogram and online supplementary audio clip, which of the following is correct? An early diastolic filling sound (S3) is heard, indicating increased right ventricular filling pressures. An ejection click without respiratory variation and a systolic ejection murmur are heard, consistent with bicuspid aortic valve stenosis. An ejection click with respiratory variation and a systolic ejection murmur are heard, consistent with pulmonic valve stenosis. A holosystolic murmur with inspiratory augmentation is heard, indicating tricuspid regurgitation.

A popular saying holds that if one can hear a heart murmur in the middle of a loud and busy emergency department, then by definition the murmur is significant. Whether or not this is actually true, it does capture the frustration emergency physicians feel when trying to diagnose or manage valvular pathologic conditions with familiar yet limited tools. This article focuses on the valve-related issues the emergency physician will face, from the trauma patient with a mechanical valve who may need his or her anticoagulation reversed to the febrile patient with a new murmur.

Ventricular septal defect (VSD) clinical examination — VSD is characterized clinically by a systolic murmur usually maximal at the left lower sternal border; when RV pressure is low the murmur is blowing and pansystolic; with incremental increases in RV pressure, the murmur is shorter, softer, and lower pitched; and small, muscular VSDs are very high-pitched and occupy early systole only because muscular contraction closes the defect.

Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) stenosis — problems and pitfalls are highlighted as follows: The click murmur of a BAV may be misdiagnosed as mitral valve prolapse, and a systolic murmur may be thought to be "benign" because an ejection click is not recognized. For assessment, mean gradient and aortic valve area should be used rather than relying only on peak systolic gradient, and the aortic valve area should be indexed to body surface area to correct for different body sizes and habitus. Progressive aortic dilatation may occur in patients with BAV even without significant aortic stenosis (AS) or aortic regurgitation (AR), and when left ventricular (LV) dimensions are increased with normal wall thickness, LV mass is increased and LV mass calculations should be indexed to body surface area.

### Can cardiologists distinguish innocent from pathologic murmurs in neonates? [^1157TQov]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the sensitivity and specificity of the clinical assessment of murmurs in neonates, as performed by pediatric cardiologists, and to identify clinical features that predict the presence of congenital heart disease (CHD) in this population.

Study Design

Neonates (n = 201) referred for outpatient evaluation of a heart murmur were enrolled consecutively. After a clinical evaluation, the cardiologist documented whether the murmur was "likely innocent" or "likely pathologic". The cardiologist repeated his/her assessment after an electrocardiogram. Echocardiography served as the gold standard.

Results

The median age was 12 days (range, 2–31 days). CHD was present in 113 of 201 (56%). Clinical assessment alone identified patients with CHD with a sensitivity of 80.5% (95% CI, 73.2–87.8), specificity of 90.9% (95% CI, 84.9–96.9), positive predictive value of 91.9% (95% CI, 86.6–97.3), and negative predictive value of 78.4% (95% CI, 70.4–86.4). The addition of an electrocardiogram did not improve these test characteristics. Features that were predictive of CHD were murmur quality (P < .0001), location (P = 0.02), and timing (P = 0.04). No patients requiring catheter or surgical intervention were missed by clinical assessment.

Conclusions

The prevalence of CHD in this referral population was high. Clinical assessment detected all complex CHD, although some simple lesions were missed. Murmur quality, location, and timing were predictive of CHD.

### A systolic murmur is a common presentation of aortic regurgitation detected by echocardiography [^113u4SNP]. Clinical Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The finding of aortic regurgitation at a classical examination is a diastolic murmur.

Hypothesis

Aortic regurgitation is more likely to be associated with a systolic than with a diastolic murmur during routine screening by a noncardiologist physician.

Methods

In all, 243 asymptomatic patients (mean age 42 ± 10 years) with no known cardiac disease but at risk for aortic valve disease due to prior mediastinal irradiation (≥ 35 Gy) underwent auscultation by a noncardiologist followed by echocardiography. A systolic murmur was considered benign if it was grade ≤ II/VI, not holosystolic, was not heard at the apex, did not radiate to the carotids, and was not associated with a diastolic murmur.

Results

Of the patients included, 122 (49%) were male, and 86 (35%) had aortic regurgitation, which was trace in 20 (8%), mild in 52 (21%), and moderate in 14 (6%). A systolic murmur was common in patients with aortic regurgitation, occurring in 12 (86%) with moderate, 26 (50%) with mild, 6 (30%) with trace, and 27 (17%) with no aortic regurgitation (p < 0.0001). The systolic murmurs were classified as benign in 21 (78%) patients with mild and 8 (67%) with moderate aortic regurgitation. Diastolic murmurs were rare, occurring in two (14%) with moderate, two (4%) with mild, and three (2%) with no aortic regurgitation (p = 0.15).

Conclusions

An isolated systolic murmur is a common auscultatory finding by a noncardiologist in patients with moderate or milder aortic regurgitation. A systolic murmur in patients at risk for aortic valve disease should prompt a more thorough physical examination for aortic regurgitation.

### Echocardiographic yield in children when innocent murmur seems likely but doubts linger [^112mqUbW]. Pediatric Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of our study was to determine the incidence and nature of heart disease found among children with murmurs clinically ambiguous to an expert examiner. The study was a prospective, blinded evaluation of accuracy of the expert examination using echocardiography as the diagnostic standard. The setting of the study was a pediatric cardiology outpatient department. The study comprised 903 outpatients with heart murmur under 21 years old without prior echocardiography or pediatric cardiology consultation. The intervention was echocardiography as clinically indicated for evaluation of heart murmur of uncertain cause. The outcome measure were a comparison of clinical diagnoses with echocardiographic results. In this clinical population, the presence of heart disease correlated with young age at presentation and with the expert examiner's level of suspicion of heart disease. However, 16 of 187 cases in which specific pathology was unsuspected had disease, and 6 of these 16 have had catheter or surgical intervention. Fourteen of the 16 unsuspected had objective indications for echocardiography and the other 2 were examined to allay anxiety. When evaluating very young outpatients with innocent-sounding murmur or older outpatients with innocent-sounding murmur and disconcerting symptoms, signs, or laboratory results, pediatric cardiologists should have a low threshold for echocardiography. Older outpatients with innocent-sounding murmur seldom have heart disease when anxiety is the only indication for echocardiography.

### Do' pathologic' cardiac murmurs in adolescents identify structural heart disease? An evaluation of 15 141 active adolescents for conditions that put them at risk of sudden cardiac death [^112ibAcW]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We assessed whether the presence and character of a cardiac murmur in adolescents were associated with structural heart disease that confers risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD).

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of 15141 adolescents age 12–19 who underwent a heart screen with history, physical examination and ECG. Participants with any screening abnormality underwent an echocardiogram for the assessment of structural heart disease. Murmurs were classified as physiological or pathological according to standard clinical criteria, and participants with murmurs were compared with a comparison group without murmurs. The primary outcome was echocardiogram-detected structural heart disease associated with SCD.

Results

905 participants with a cardiac murmur (mean age 15.8; 58% male) and 4333 participants without a murmur (comparison group; mean age 15.8; 55% male) had an echocardiogram to detect structural heart disease. 743 (82%) murmurs were described as physiological and 162 (18%) as pathological. Twenty-five (2.8%) participants with murmurs and 61 (1.4%) participants without murmurs had structural heart disease. Three (0.3%) participants in the murmur group were diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) which was the only identified condition associated with SCD. Two participants with HCM had physiological murmurs, one had a pathological murmur, and all three had an abnormal ECG. The most common minor structural heart disease was bicuspid aortic valve in both the murmur (7; 0.8%) and comparison (20; 0.5%) groups. The positive predictive value of physiological versus pathological murmurs for identifying any structural heart disease was 2.4% versus 4.3% (p = 0.21), respectively. The positive predictive value of having any murmur versus no murmur for identifying structural heart disease was 2.8% versus 1.4% (p = 0.003), respectively.

Conclusions

In adolescents, the traditional classification of cardiac murmurs as 'physiologic' or 'pathologic' does not differentiate for structural heart disease that puts individuals at risk for SCD. We recommend ECG evaluation in all patients with a cardiac murmur found during preparticipation screening to increase detection of HCM.

### Murmur clinic: validation of a new model for detecting heart valve disease [^1166ALmY]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart valve disease is increasingly prevalent and a major cause of morbidity and premature death in all countries. Early identification and specialist follow-up allows timely referral for intervention and improves outcomes.

Auscultating a murmur followed by echocardiography is the principle pathway for detecting valve disease in the community and is the second most common indication for open access echocardiography after suspected heart failure. However, auscultation by general practitioners has recently been confirmed to be both insensitive and non-specific for the detection of heart valve disease. Valve disease of any grade is found on echocardiography in less than one-third of patients referred from the community because of a murmur. Furthermore, standard echocardiograms (transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE)) take about 45 min to perform and are a relatively scarce resource. It has been suggested that a more limited 'point-of-care scan' taking 10–15 min can screen out patients not requiring TTE. This has not previously been investigated.

At our hospital, we developed a specialist murmur clinic for open access general practitioner requests indicated by a murmur. In a first feasibility phase, a consultant cardiologist performed both auscultation and the point-of-care scan, and in a subsequent phase these were performed by clinical scientists. This study compares results of auscultation and a point-of-care scan performed by a scientist or a cardiologist against TTE as the 'gold standard'.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Pediatric transthoracic echocardiography appropriate use criteria (AUC) — indications for murmurs, chest pain, and syncope are as follows: Pathologic murmurs and presumably innocent murmurs with other signs, symptoms or findings of cardiovascular disease were found to be Appropriate for an echocardiogram. In pediatrics, chest pain and syncope are generally benign and echocardiography has been shown to be low-yield; specifically, syncope with no other symptoms or signs of cardiac disease has been rated as Appropriate in the adult AUC, but rated as Rarely Appropriate for pediatric patients, albeit with additional qualifiers of a benign family history and a normal ECG. Use of echocardiography as a primary screen versus after pediatric cardiology consultation depends on many factors and needs to be given due consideration on a case-by-case basis, and if more than one indication could apply, clinicians need to use their judgment in picking the scenario that most closely fits the individual patient.

### Usefulness of a new sound spectral averaging technique to distinguish an innocent systolic murmur from that of aortic stenosis [^111Be1Cb]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

We present a new method to record and display heart sounds that uses a hand-held computer and stethoscopic recording device. It allows for rapid spectral and waveform displays of murmurs and provides a means for signal averaging of spectral frequency content. Compared with aortic stenosis, innocent murmurs primarily contain frequencies of < 300 Hz and persist for a shorter duration at the upper-frequency levels. This method provides for rapid characterization of innocent murmurs, a means for comparison with other murmurs, and transmission of acoustic data to distant sites.

### Asymptomatic young man with an incidental murmur [^116yv5pz]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical Introduction

A 32-year old man was referred to our institution for transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) following detection of an incidental murmur on physical examination before blood donation.

### Phono-spectrographic analysis of heart murmur in children [^1164rWah]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

The first evaluation of children's heart murmur is one of the basic tasks of welfare clinic practitioners and school medical officers. However, based on their frequently limited auscultation experience, they might not be able to recognize the innocence of a heart murmur. Even the auscultation skills of pediatric residents have been found to be suboptimal. Several healthy children are referred to pediatric cardiologists or for echocardiography. Parental anxiety may also be a reason to refer the patient for unnecessary examinations, and it is important to recognize an innocent murmur as soon as it is found. Auscultation training will naturally improve practitioners' listening skills.

Previous studies have shown that pediatric cardiologists, based on clinical examination, can differentiate innocent from pathological murmurs with high sensitivity (82.92%) and specificity (76.99%). Even better results have been attained by using advanced signal processing and pattern recognition tools. Artificial neural network-based screening is reported to have 100% sensitivity and specificity.

The capability of a doctor or a computerized system to differentiate between pathological and innocent murmurs depends on the quality of the pathological murmurs. It is easy to recognize loud murmurs as pathological by means of clinical or digital analysis. Serious defects are seldom missed, and the challenge is actually to detect mild defects. Small muscular VSD, mild PS or AS causes no hemodynamic harm, but they may require endocarditis prophylaxis. ASD secundum may also be hard to diagnose only by auscultation.

The purpose of this article was to demonstrate the capabilities of a modern digital system for phonocardiographic recording and analysis and to evaluate its potential for differentiating the characteristic features of heart murmurs in children. Another goal was to investigate how the numerical features measured from a phono-spectrogram can be used to distinguish innocent systolic murmurs from pathological murmurs, which are generally hard to identify in a routine clinical examination. This article additionally concludes more than ten years' experience of studying heart sounds.

Circulation (2008). Medium credibility.

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) — postrepair clinical examination: The typical postrepair patient has a soft ejection systolic murmur from the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT); a low-pitched, delayed diastolic murmur in the pulmonary area is consistent with pulmonary regurgitation, and such patients usually have an absent P2 component of the second sound. Additional findings may include a pansystolic murmur of a VSD patch leak and a diastolic murmur of aortic regurgitation (AR). Some adults may present after only a palliative shunt, and such patients usually have cyanosis and clubbing with a continuous murmur if the shunt is patent.

### Phono-spectrographic analysis of heart murmur in children [^112TRM75]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

Over 90% of heart murmurs in children are physiological. Moreover, 75% of them are innocent vibratory murmurs (39, 40, 41, 42). The physician needs to quickly confirm the benign nature of the heart murmur and thus to avoid misdiagnosis. The combination of a spectrogram and a traditional phonocardiogram can be an adequate method for distinguishing innocent murmurs from pathological. When quantitative analysis is used systematically, the clinician should know what signals the system is processing and how. Visual analysis is the first step towards understanding automatic analysis, and it is a more reliable way to classify the findings as pathological or non-pathological than auscultation alone. Interpretation of the spectrogram helps to understand the hemodynamic events and the origin of heart sounds. Laminar flow will cause a harmonic wave movement in surrounding tissues, as exemplified by vibratory murmur with a peak frequency of approximately 150 Hz, which has also been reported in earlier studies. Rapid flow will cause turbulence. The faster the flow velocity, the higher the sound frequencies. These findings are also illustrated by the analysis of aortic stenosis or ventricular septal defect.

### Phono-spectrographic analysis of heart murmur in children [^11435sjy]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

More than 90% of heart murmurs in children are innocent. Frequently the skills of the first examiner are not adequate to differentiate between innocent and pathological murmurs. Our goal was to evaluate the value of a simple and low-cost phonocardiographic recording and analysis system in determining the characteristic features of heart murmurs in children and in distinguishing innocent systolic murmurs from pathological.

Methods

The system consisting of an electronic stethoscope and a multimedia laptop computer was used for the recording, monitoring and analysis of auscultation findings. The recorded sounds were examined graphically and numerically using combined phono-spectrograms. The data consisted of heart sound recordings from 807 pediatric patients, including 88 normal cases without any murmur, 447 innocent murmurs and 272 pathological murmurs. The phono-spectrographic features of heart murmurs were examined visually and numerically. From this database, 50 innocent vibratory murmurs, 25 innocent ejection murmurs and 50 easily confusable, mildly pathological systolic murmurs were selected to test whether quantitative phono-spectrographic analysis could be used as an accurate screening tool for systolic heart murmurs in children.

Results

The phono-spectrograms of the most common innocent and pathological murmurs were presented as examples of the whole data set. Typically, innocent murmurs had lower frequencies (below 200 Hz) and a frequency spectrum with a more harmonic structure than pathological cases. Quantitative analysis revealed no significant differences in the duration of S1 and S2 or loudness of systolic murmurs between the pathological and physiological systolic murmurs. However, the pathological murmurs included both lower and higher frequencies than the physiological ones (p < 0.001 for both low and high frequency limits). If the systolic murmur contained intensive frequency components of over 200 Hz, or its length accounted for over 80% of the whole systolic duration, it was considered pathological. Using these criteria, 90% specificity and 91% sensitivity in screening were achieved.

Conclusion

Phono-spectrographic analysis improves the accuracy of primary heart murmur evaluation and educates inexperienced listener. Using simple quantitative criterias a level of pediatric cardiologist is easily achieved in screening heart murmurs in children.

### Murmur clinic: validation of a new model for detecting heart valve disease [^117Njb84]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Analysis

Auscultation was classed as normal if there was no murmur heard or a likely benign systolic flow murmur (soft, short ejection systolic murmur with a well-heard second sound). Auscultation was classed as abnormal if there was a loud, long ejection systolic murmur or a soft, or absent second sound or a pansystolic or diastolic murmur. The point-of-care scan was classed as normal if there was no more than minimal thickening or trivial regurgitation. It was classed as abnormal if there was anything more than mild thickening or trivial regurgitation. The TTE was classed as: normal, mildly abnormal (advised to have serial TTE after 3 years as per international guidelines), moderately abnormal (offered follow-up in a specialist valve clinic) and severely abnormal (requiring an immediate cardiology opinion). For the purposes of comparison with auscultation or point-of-care echocardiography, the three grades of abnormal (mild, moderate and severe) were combined.

Mean age was calculated. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, accuracy and positive and negative likelihood of auscultation and point-of-care scans against standard echocardiography were calculated. Comparison of results for auscultation and point-of-care scans against standard TTE was with a two-tailed exact McNemar's test. The results of auscultation between scientist and cardiologist was with a two-sided Fisher's exact test. Calculations were performed using Stata V.14.2. Costs were estimated using the current National Health Service tariff of £81.73 for a standard simple echocardiogram in an adult. An estimate of £27.24 was made for a point-of-care scan since three can be performed in the time taken for one standard study.

### Aortic sclerosis: not an innocent murmur but a marker of increased cardiovascular risk [^112TxnD4]. Heart (2005). Low credibility.

The detection of an ejection systolic murmur in the aortic valve region often corresponds to a diagnosis of aortic sclerosis or minor disruption of the aortic valve with associated turbulence but minimal obstruction. Aortic sclerosis has two important clinical implications. Firstly, aortic sclerosis is an antecedent to clinically significant aortic valve obstruction and, secondly, it acts as a marker of increased risk of cardiovascular events. This article reviews the evidence that aortic sclerosis is a useful adjunctive tool in cardiovascular risk stratification and that its progression to haemodynamically significant aortic stenosis is a potential focus for individual monitoring and for interventional studies.

### Murmurs other than the early diastolic murmur in aortic dissection [^112u4TXu]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The purpose of this review is to draw attention to the presence and significance of murmurs other than the murmur of aortic regurgitation, in patients with aortic dissection. For that purpose, a literature search was conducted using Pubmed and Googlescholar. The search terms were "dissecting aneurysm of the aorta", "systolic murmurs", "ejection systolic murmurs", "holosystolic" murmurs, "continuous murmurs", and "Austin-Flint" murmur. Murmurs other than the murmur of aortic regurgitation, which were associated with aortic dissection, fell into the categories of systolic murmurs, some of which were holosystolic, and continuous murmurs, the latter attributable to fistulae between the dissecting aneurysm and the left atrium, right atrium, and the pulmonary artery, respectively. Mid-diastolic murmurs were also identified, and these typically occurred in association with both the systolic and the early diastolic murmurs. Among patients with systolic murmurs clinical features which enhanced the pre-test probability of aortic dissection included back pain, stroke, paraplegia, unilateral absence of pulses, interarm differences in blood pressure, hypertension, shock, bicuspid aortic valve, aortic coarctation, Turner's syndrome, and high D-dimer levels, respectively. In the absence of the murmur of aortic regurgitation timely diagnosis of aortic dissection could be expedited by increased attention to parameters which enhance pretest probability of aortic dissection. That logic would apply even if the only murmurs which were elicited were systolic murmurs.

### The impact of computer-assisted auscultation on physician referrals of asymptomatic patients with heart murmurs [^111JPzDt]. Clinical Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

As many as 50–70% of asymptomatic children referred for specialist evaluation or echocardiography because of a murmur have no heart disease.

Hypothesis

Computer-assisted auscultation (CAA) can improve the sensitivity and specificity of referrals for evaluation of heart murmurs.

Methods

Seven board-certified primary care physicians were evaluated both without and with use of a computer-based decision-support system using 100 prerecorded patient heart sounds (55 innocent murmurs, 30 pathological murmurs, 15 without murmur). The sensitivity and specificity of their murmur referral decisions relative to American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines, and sensitivity and specificity of murmur detection and characterization (innocent versus pathological) were measured.

Results

Sensitivity for detection of murmurs significantly increased with use of CAA from 76.6 to 89.1% (p < 0.001), while specificity remained unaffected (80.0 versus 81.0%). Computer-assisted auscultation improved sensitivity of correctly identifying pathological murmur cases from 82.4 to 90.0%, and specificity of correctly identifying benign cases (with innocent or no murmurs) from 74.9 to 88.8%. (p < 0.001). Referral sensitivity increased from 86.7 to 92.9%, while specificity increased from 63.5 to 78.6% using CAA (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Computer-assisted auscultation appears to be a promising new technology for informing the referral decisions of primary care physicians.

### Auscultation while standing: a basic and reliable method to rule out a pathologic heart murmur in children [^115qn7N3]. Annals of Family Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

The distinction between physiologic (innocent) and pathologic (organic) heart murmurs is not always easy in routine practice, leading too often to unnecessary cardiology referrals and expensive investigations. We aimed to test the hypothesis that the complete disappearance of murmur on standing can exclude cardiac disease in children.

Methods

From January 2014 to January 2015, we prospectively included 194 consecutive children aged 2 to 18 years who were referred for heart murmur evaluation to pediatric cardiologists at 2 French medical centers. Heart murmur characteristics while supine and then while standing were recorded, and an echo-cardiogram was performed.

Results

Overall, 30 (15%) of the 194 children had a pathologic heart murmur as determined by an abnormal echocardiogram. Among the 100 children (51%) who had a murmur that was present while they were supine but completely disappeared when they stood up, only 2 had a pathologic murmur, and just 1 of them needed further evaluation. Complete disappearance of the heart murmur on standing therefore excluded a pathologic murmur with a high positive predictive value of 98% and specificity of 93%, albeit with a lower sensitivity of 60%.

Conclusions

Disappearance of a heart murmur on standing is a reliable clinical tool for ruling out pathologic heart murmurs in children aged 2 years and older. This basic clinical assessment would avoid many unnecessary referrals to cardiologists.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Pediatric transthoracic echocardiography appropriate use criteria — key clinical definitions include Arrhythmia as "Documented irregular and/or abnormal heart rate or rhythm" and Palpitations as "An unpleasant sensation of rapid, irregular, and/or forceful beating of the heart". Desaturation is defined for pediatric patients other than newborns as "an oxygen saturation < 95% as measured by pulse oximeter", and for newborns "for newborns ≥ 24 hours of age, an oxygen saturation that is (a) < 90% in the initial screen or in repeat screens", with additional criteria "(b) < 95% in the right hand and foot on 3 measures, each separated by 1 hour, or (c) a > 3% absolute difference in oxygen saturation between the right hand and foot on 3 measures, each separated by 1 hour". Hypertension is "Average systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure that is ≥ 95th percentile for gender, age, and height on 3 or more occasions". Innocent murmurs are characterized by "most innocent murmurs are soft (less than or equal to grade 2/6), heard in early systole, characterized as crescendo-decrescendo type, and may vary with position", whereas a Pathologic murmur includes "grade 3/6 systolic murmur or louder" and murmurs that are "provoked or become louder with changes in position (from squatting to standing) or during the strain phase of a Valsalva maneuver". A Neonate is "A child that is less than or equal to 28 days old". Neurocardiogenic syncope is defined as "A type of syncope typically occurring in the upright position, in which the triggering of a neural reflex results in a usually self-limited episode of systemic hypotension and/or bradycardia or asystole", and Syncope is "Sudden temporary loss of consciousness associated with a loss of postural tone and with spontaneous recovery that does not require electrical or chemical cardioversion".

### Management of echocardiography requests for the detection and follow-up of heart valve disease: a consensus statement from the British heart valve society [^1161nxm9]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

1.3.3 Recommendation 3

Requests in asymptomatic murmur without a previous echocardiogram, a basic/level 1 study should be used to triage the need for a minimum standard TTE.

1.3.3.1 Background to Recommendation 3

In TTE indicated for a murmur, the yield of moderate or severe HVD is 11%–18%. Over half have no disease and many do not even have a murmur when auscultated at a specialist murmur clinic.

Differentiating a flow murmur from a pathological murmur from the request alone is usually impossible, since the required characteristics for example, soft second heart sound are not included. Furthermore, the accuracy of auscultation skills of clinicians is declining therefore making the original description of the murmur less reliable.

It is therefore inappropriate use of resources to perform comprehensive studies in all patients referred with a diagnosis of a murmur as the majority will have no valve disease.

The basic/level 1 study needs to be performed by a fully accredited and experienced clinical scientist or physiologist who can recognize signs of mild disease requiring a minimum standard TTE (Table 1).

One model, as used at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals, London, is a murmur clinic but requests can also be included in a general basic/level 1 list. An alternative model is a focussed study with "add‐ons" of a pulmonary valve view and a color map of the ventricular septum in the 4‐chamber view.

Further time saving can be arranged locally using health care assistants to prepare patients for all scans including basic/level 1 studies, an approach we highly recommend as it allows the physiologist to focus on the echo studies, be more efficient and is cost‐effective.

### Managing a "New" murmur in healthy children and teens [^1152ZNc8]. Clinical Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

An asymptomatic child with a murmur can be challenging practice management conundrum. Some providers refer all patients with a "new" murmur to a cardiologist, likely resulting in excessive resource utilization and parental anxiety. This study examines whether the prevalence of significant cardiac pathology differs in asymptomatic patients aged 2 to 18 years who were referred for a murmur that was "new" versus those referred for a murmur that was known to exist and followed conservatively during the previous 2 years. Of 473 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 33/473 (7.0%) were diagnosed with cardiac pathology, with 21/357 (5.9%) occurring among "new" murmur referrals and 12/116 (10.3%) occurring among "known" murmur referrals. Notably, 34/357 (9.5%) patients referred for a "new" murmur had no murmur present when assessed by the cardiologist. This study suggests that asymptomatic children with a "new" murmur may be conservatively managed. This may lessen health care resource utilization rates and overall parental anxiety.

### Deep learning algorithms to detect murmurs associated with structural heart disease [^113MwjC9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

We foresee that these algorithms will improve the screening for SHD, ultimately improving health outcomes and reducing the overall cost of care. Earlier detection of SHD could allow more patients to be monitored and treated at appropriate time points, before the development of advanced or refractory disease. Additionally, discriminating murmurs associated with SHD from those not associated (ie, innocent murmurs) could both reduce expensive and unnecessary tests (eg, echocardiography) and properly triage resources when they are scarce. As such, even a small increase in the sensitivity of SHD detection could result in meaningful benefit for both the patient and provider.

There are several limitations to this work to be addressed in future research. First, the current algorithm analyzes individual recordings instead of a composite 4‐point auscultation. Standard practice incorporates auscultation from multiple locations with a patient history to localize a potential structural defect and guide any imaging studies. Incorporating data from multiple locations has been the focus of other investigations. Because many of the subjects in this data set have a complete 4‐point auscultation, this will be a continuing area of research for us. Second, as with previous murmur classification algorithms, we have not yet assessed how these algorithms function directly in clinical practice, so we have not directly assessed their effects on patient care. However, given the findings we present here, this limitation should motivate real‐world studies wherein the algorithm is used under controlled clinical environments to assess the effect on patient outcomes. This is also an area of active research for our research group. Third, our ground truth assessment of disease pathology comes from a clinical echocardiogram read, which is less standardized than a centralized read from a core research echocardiography laboratory. However, this mirrors routine practice, increasing the generalizability of our study to the clinic. We additionally note the unbalanced, predominantly White, racial breakdown of the testing data sets, and therefore we are unable to confidently comment on the generalization of the algorithms to other racial groups. Last, we note that our algorithm requires the presence of a murmur to diagnose a disease state. We plan to explore further disease‐specific algorithms in the future to address clinical situations where no murmur is present.

### Murmur clinic: validation of a new model for detecting heart valve disease [^111kjxZe]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Comparison with existing literature

Point-of-care scans have been shown to be safe and effective in acute medical presentationsbut have not previously been examined in patients with a murmur, although their use has been suggested in an international opinion paper. We found that only 30% of patients with an asymptomatic murmur had any grade of valve disease which is similar to the 29% and 31% frequencies shown in large series of open access echocardiograms in the UKand Holland. This is also consistent with recently published workshowing that auscultation by general practitioners has a sensitivity of only 44% and specificity of 69% for the detection of significant valve disease on TTE. In an analysis of open access echocardiography, we detected significant valve disease in 127 (18%) of 706 patients referred because of a murmur but in 267 (15%) of 1745 patients when we extended the indications for echocardiography to include a potentially cardiac symptom, or atrial fibrillation. Furthermore, descriptive surveyssuggest that general practitioners may not have time to auscultate. A murmur auscultated by a general practitioner will remain important but echocardiography is the 'gold standard' for detection. A point-of-care scan would allow basic echocardiography to be more widely available to patients with any risk factor for valve disease including abnormalities on the history, examination or ECG or potentially age > 75.

Murmur Classification

We next assessed the performance of the murmur classification algorithm for all recordings with good signal quality by both the experts (signal quality ≥ 2) and the signal quality detection algorithm (N = 1895). The initial panel of experts consisted of 3 board‐certified cardiologists who annotated all recordings, yielding a κ statistic of 0.61, indicating modest agreement. In the cases where a consensus annotation was not achieved (N = 1175), an independent fourth board‐certified cardiologist provided an additional annotation such that for this subset of recordings, the majority vote was used as the ground truth label. We defined a structural murmur as one in which both an audible murmur was detected by the annotators and SHD was identified on the echocardiogram. We observed high test performance for this task, with a sensitivity of 85.6% and specificity of 84.4% (Tables 6 and 7).

Upon stratifying murmurs by grade, we observed progressively better test characteristics with louder murmurs (Table 8).

Test characteristics for the algorithm were similar across auscultation locations (Table S4). The algorithm performed slightly better in an adult population than a pediatric population (Table S5). However, for clearly audible murmurs, defined as a mean annotation of grade ≥ 2, the structural murmur detection algorithm showed similarly excellent sensitivity (98%) in both populations (Table 9).

Repeat TTE is also appropriate in patients with AS who are exposed to increased hemodynamic demands, either electively, such as with noncardiac surgery or pregnancy, or acutely, such as with a systemic infection, anemia, or gastrointestinal bleeding.

Murmur Timing

We then assessed the murmur timing algorithm among the structural murmurs identified by both the expert annotators and the murmur detection algorithm. Owing to the low prevalence of diastolic murmurs (n = 3) in the Eko test data set, we also assessed murmur timing assignments in the Eko murmur timing data set, which includes 26 diastolic murmurs. We observed excellent sensitivity and specificity (97.5% and 100%, respectively) for systolic murmur detection in the test data set, and lower sensitivity and specificity, relative to the systolic murmur detection algorithm (80.8% and 89.8%, respectively) for diastolic murmur detection in the murmur timing data set (Table 10).

Clinician Comparisons

Assessment Against Independent Clinicians

To best assess the clinical usefulness of our tools, we directly compared the performance of our murmur classification algorithm in detecting a structural murmur against 10 independent clinicians given the same task. Notably, the clinicians were provided an idealized, distraction‐free listening environment to optimize their performance. Despite this, the algorithm performed significantly better than the average clinician (P < 0.001, 84.7% versus 77.9% accuracy; Table 11). Moreover, no individual clinician outperformed the algorithm (Table 11; Figure 3).

Table 3
Duration of S1, S2, systolic murmur and relative duration of systolic murmur

Although the pathological systolic murmurs were somewhat louder than the physiological ones, there were no significant differences between the groups (Relative Amplitude in Table 4). This confirmed that the series fulfilled our aim to select easily confusable cases. However, the pathological murmurs included both lower and higher frequencies than physiological ones (p < 0.001 for both low and high frequency limits).

Relative amplitude and low and high frequency limits of systolic murmur

Sensitivity of 76% and specificity of 84% were achieved using a cut-off value of 65% for the relative duration of systolic murmur to differentiate between pathological and physiological murmurs (Table 5 and Figure 9 – upper left). Using that cut-off, 12 (24%) pathological and 12 (16%) physiological murmurs were misclassified.

### Deep learning algorithms to detect murmurs associated with structural heart disease [^111HNHTp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Previously, the application of machine learning to heart sound analysis has been hindered by inconsistent data sets, a lack of true clinical validation, and the inherent subjectivity of the auscultatory exam when defining the ground truth. Here, we demonstrated the ability of a novel suite of machine learning algorithms to automate the evaluation of heart sounds on the largest and most diverse database to date. Our algorithm performed well across both adults and children over a wide range of diseases. The data set was collected in real clinical environments and annotated with the best subjective ground truth possible, that of a panel of expert cardiologists. Furthermore, as a newly Food and Drug Administration‐cleared tool on a commercially available device, these algorithms can be brought immediately to clinical practice for maximal impact.

The signal quality algorithm behaves intuitively when compared against the expert annotators. Consistent with the recordings being taken in actual clinical environments, the good signal rate reflects actual clinical experience, differing only by 3.1% between the algorithm (84.3%) and the expert annotators (87.4%). Because signal quality is inherently a subjective measure, we used the average value for the final signal quality label. There may well be instances wherein one annotator cannot detect heart sounds, yet the others can. A recording could thus be labeled as poor signal quality from an averaged signal quality score, falsely lowering the expert good signal rate. The algorithm's good signal rate of 33.5% on recordings with the lowest signal quality annotation (Figure 2B) may be explained by this phenomenon.

Among the included studies, only one study described an algorithm in which Echo was performed in all newborns with pathologic murmurs regardless of symptoms and in some newborns with innocent murmurs present > 48 h after birth. Cardiac murmur is the most common reason for referral to a cardiologist and shows a relatively higher Echo diagnostic yield than other indications, such as palpitation or chest pain. Moreover, abnormal echocardiographic findings are most frequently observed within the first year of life among pediatric patients with cardiac murmurs. Although Echo is the gold standard for the diagnosis of CHD and is easily accessible in developed countries, there is no consensus on whether to use Echo in newborns with ANCM. Nevertheless, a few physicians have performed Echo in full term newborns with ANCM. Although there are issues with cost-effectiveness and technical accessibility, Echo is currently widely used, even in the NICU, by neonatologists. New approaches for the utilization of Echo in newborns with ANCM are warranted.

Early diagnosis and timely management of CHD in newborns are critical to improve clinical outcomes. With the increase in artificial fertilization and preterm births, CHD incidence is expected to increase in the future. A thorough cardiac evaluation with careful auscultation before hospital discharge should be performed to screen for CHD. Because accuracy of the assessment of pathologic murmurs varies among physicians, a stepwise approach to evaluating cardiac murmurs is required. Considering the difficulties in distinguishing pathologic murmurs from innocent murmurs in newborns, the use of Echo in newborns with ANCM is recommended to prevent further cardiac complications. If access to Echo is limited, early referral to a pediatric cardiologist may be another option.

All studies included in this review were observational studies. A meta-analysis was impossible because of the study designs. However, this systematic review applied a comprehensive and structured search strategy to four different databases. Two reviewers independently performed quality assessment, thereby reducing selection and publication bias.

### Recommendations for noninvasive evaluation of native valvular regurgitation: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography developed in collaboration with the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance [^1113Tz7P]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Physical examination limits and lesion-specific clues — mitral, aortic, and tricuspid regurgitation: In left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, "patients with LV dysfunction and secondary MR often have very soft murmurs even when the MR is severe", and "it is also important to recognize that even mild degrees of MR… identify patients at considerable risk of heart failure and death in the setting of LV dysfunction and secondary MR". For aortic regurgitation (AR), "the diastolic murmur of AR is often barely audible or may be completely absent, and the only appreciable murmur may be a systolic outflow murmur related to the high SV", with "additional physical findings such as a wide pulse pressure or bounding carotid pulses" suggesting significant AR; "AR is often first identified on echocardiograms performed to investigate a systolic murmur". For tricuspid regurgitation (TR), "TR is also often not identified clinically prior to echocardiography but identified as an important concomitant lesion in patients with MR", and in primary TR, "there are often no clinical manifestations when the TR is mild", whereas "severe TR caused by primary disorders is almost invariably associated with a systolic murmur with respiratory variation, elevated V waves in the jugular venous pulse, and an RV heave as evidence of RV volume overload".

Results

Illustrative examples of most common heart murmurs

The system was able to display and reproduce cardiovascular sound events. The musical murmur caused by harmonic movements of the heart or the vasculature, of which vibratory innocent murmur is a good example, was usually visualized as a well-defined area or line in the spectrogram. Innocent systolic murmur appeared to have a lower peak frequency, below 200 Hz, and shorter duration than pathological murmurs, and it always faded before the second heart sound. The higher the velocity of flow in echogardiography, the more intensive the murmur and the wider the frequency scale. This phenomenon was clearly visible in the spectrogram.

The attached illustrations (Figures from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) show examples of the most typical murmurs in children. The upper part is a traditional phonocardiogram showing the relative amplitude of the sound. The lower part, i.e. the spectrogram, shows the sound intensity as colors on a frequency scale of 0–1000 Hz. The corresponding intensity scale in decibels is shown on the left. The duration, peak frequency and volume of the murmur were estimated based on a mean of three sequential beats. Volume was compared to the mean of the amplitudes of S1 and S2, obtained from the traditional phonocardiogram.

Quantitative comparison of innocent and confusing pathological systolic murmurs

The mean and standard deviation of the patients' ages for the three groups are presented in Table 2. The patients with innocent vibratory murmurs were referred for examination at a younger age than those with ejection murmurs, which seemed confusing to the examiners and were referred closer to school age. The pathological murmurs in this series included recordings of both new patients and repeated control recordings of outpatients.

Table 2
Mean and standard deviation of patients' ages in the three groups

There were no significant differences in the duration of S1 and S2 between the pathological and physiological systolic murmurs (Table 3). Although S2 was constantly split in ASDs, the duration of S2 in these cases did not differ from the average in the series. By contrast, the pathological murmurs, measured in either absolute or relative terms, were longer than the innocent vibratory or ejection systolic murmurs (p < 0.001).

### Deep learning algorithm for automated cardiac murmur detection via a digital stethoscope platform [^112bBpTf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our results suggest that the algorithm would be a useful decision support tool in detecting murmurs attributed to "clinically significant" VHD. To put this in perspective, in the elderly population, where the prevalence of surgically intervenable AS reaches 5%, 32 a negative test, carrying a negative likelihood ratio of 0.08, will nearly rule out the diagnosis, reducing its probability to < 0.5%. Conversely, a positive test, with a positive likelihood ratio of 6.68, will increase disease probability to 26%. Because we compared cases with severe disease with disease‐free controls in our study, a positive AS screening result in a separate population could also indicate nonsurgical AS (ie, AS of moderate severity or less). Even with this caveat, the test outcome is likely to influence clinical management in this common clinical scenario. Moreover, because the algorithm results are intended to be combined with a provider's clinical interpretation, the overall accuracy of a clinical VHD diagnosis may be even higher. 33 In addition, to our knowledge, our validation set represents the world's largest adult echocardiogram‐paired heart sound recording database. Looking ahead, this database may facilitate the development of future algorithms to differentiate between innocent and pathologic murmurs, identify specific types of VHD, or correlate other cardiac pathological features to a patient's auscultatory signature.

### Innocent murmurs: a suspect diagnosis in non-pregnant adults [^116fv56o]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

The physics of turbulence include Reynolds numbers, but they argued that these do not apply for biomedical applications. However, the 2 key variables, viscosity and flow velocity, are conceptually useful. They also warned that turbulence and murmurs are not equivalent, obvious from Doppler studies of children with innocent murmurs who demonstrate no turbulence or abnormal velocities. The musical Still's murmur contrasts with the noise generated by abnormalities of heart valves. McKusick compared the Still's murmur with the Aeolian harp's strings set into vibration by the wind. He looked for analogues in the heart and suggested false chords, but he failed to acknowledge that these become flaccid during systole. McKusick did not suggest the normal chords of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve that are tightened in systole by papillary muscles and traverse the pulmonary outflow, nor has anyone else, to the author's knowledge. The location of the Still's murmur was found in the pulmonary outflow by microphonic catheterization. The innocent ejection murmurs in children and pregnant women are not musical but are associated with decreased hematocrit and increased ejection velocity compared to nonpregnant adults. The aorta has been suggested as the origin of Still's murmur, but that study was done in older adults with angina who presumably had aortic valvular sclerosis. In conclusion, innocent murmurs in childhood are not normally found in adults, except for pregnant women whose blood viscosity and velocity resemble children's. When murmurs are found in nonpregnant adults, echocardiography is prudent.

1.3.4 Recommendation 4

Determine whether echocardiography is indicated or not. If indicated, determine what level of echocardiography is appropriate for the clinical question (Figure 3).

1.3.4.1 Background to Recommendation 4

Triage requires collaboration between the clinician and echocardiographer. The decision is based on:
The likelihood of disease (e.g. lower in asymptomatic young patient with murmur).
Symptoms.
The results of previous studies.
The clinical question.

1.3.4.1.1 Examples of Indications Suitable for an Initial Basic/Level 1 Study

Asymptomatic murmur. These can be assigned to a murmur clinic or a general outpatient basic/level 1 echocardiography session.

1.3.4.1.2 Examples of Indications Suitable for a Focussed Study

The cardiologist has a specific clinical question that can be answered by a focussed scan usually in the context of a specialist valve clinic where the clinical assessment and echocardiogram are done at the same time. These are therefore unlikely to appear on a general outpatient list:
In an asymptomatic patient to look for thickening of a biological aortic valve replacement.
In a patient with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis or moderate or severe mitral regurgitation to detect a fall in LV ejection fraction or a rise in the peak velocity of tricuspid regurgitation.
Previous mild HVD to detect progression requiring a minimum standard study.

1.3.4.1.3 Examples of Indications Requiring a Minimum Standard Study

Previous studies show significant HVD, and the request is at a guideline‐compliant frequency or otherwise clinically justified.

1.3.4.1.4 Examples of Studies Not Indicated are

Repeat studies for any HVD earlier than recommended by guidelines in the absence of a clinical change.
Repeat studies for normally functioning biological valves (without any clinical symptoms/signs to suggest failure) before guideline indications.
Repeat study for most patients with mild native valve regurgitation and for studies previously shown to be normal.
Repeat studies in the absence of symptoms/signs, for patients who received TAVI, who would not be suitable for re‐intervention.

### Phono-spectrographic analysis of heart murmur in children [^115VATYc]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

The three most common innocent murmurs, i.e. vibratory murmur, pulmonary ejection murmur and venous hum, and the five most common congenital heart defects, i.e. ventricular septal defect (VSD), aortic valve stenosis (AS), pulmonary valve stenosis (PS), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and atrial septal defect (ASD), are presented as examples of the whole data set.

To differentiate between innocent and pathological murmurs, 50 vibratory innocent heart murmurs, 25 innocent pulmonary or aortic ejection murmurs and 50 mild pathological systolic murmurs with intensity equal to or less than grade 3/6 were selected from a larger heart sound database for more detailed analysis. 14 of the selected pathological cases were small VSD, 5 hemodynamically loading ASD secundum, 8 PS with a pressure gradient less than 30 mmHg, 8 AS with a pressure gradient less than 30 mmHg, 3 bicuspid aortic valves with velocity less than 2.0 m/s, 1 mild CoA with a measured 15 mmHg RR difference, 1 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HOCM) with a septum thickness of 12 mm but with laminar aortic flow, 5 mitral leakage with or without prolapse (MI) and 3 tricuspid valve leakage (TI).

Dextro-transposition of the great arteries after atrial baffle — follow-up and clinical examination emphasize periodic specialist care and recognition of systemic tricuspid regurgitation (TR) features. "All operated d-TGA patients should be seen at least annually by a specialist in an ACHD regional center", and "Stress testing, including cardiopulmonary stress testing, should be applied selectively", with "more frequent follow-up visits" if abnormalities are found or if symptomatic. On examination, "features of RV enlargement and TR are present", "A loud A2 is usually present owing to the anterior position of the aorta and should not be confused with the loud P2 of PAH", and "A harsh systolic murmur may be a feature of a residual VSD or subpulmonary stenosis". "Heart failure with features of systemic TR occurs with increasing frequency with longer duration of follow-up", and "Sudden cardiac death also occurs in a small percentage of patients".

### Management of echocardiography requests for the detection and follow-up of heart valve disease: a consensus statement from the British heart valve society [^1177bSgM]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Solutions Incorporating Basic/Level 1 Studies and Focussed Studies

This demand/activity imbalance in the face of inadequate staffing levels requires a rethink of attitudes to echocardiography, to enable more patients to be scanned quicker but maintaining safety.

It would not appear appropriate for every single case to require a full comprehensive study as stipulated by some Imaging Societies. Such comprehensive scan takes a minimum 45 min with the help of a support worker. Whilst the rationale for this approach is to avoid missing pathology in the patients that do receive a scan, it fails to acknowledge the large demand in echocardiography at the moment, and the significant number of patients with a clinically detected murmur, that will not be able to receive their scan for months. Therefore the safety of the patients with a known murmur who are unable to get an echocardiogram for many months or even more than a year, is compromised. As such HVD patients remain without a diagnosis on a waiting list, with potentially adverse outcomes. What transpires, is that in the apparent pursuit of safety for an individual case, the safety of the wider community is compromised. Reassuringly, there is abundant evidence that basic (or level 1) and focussed echocardiograms are safe and sufficient to answer most clinical questions when performed by appropriately trained and experienced specialists. Minimum standard and disease‐specific studies can then be done only when clinically indicated (Table 1).

### Learning on the web. case 8: systolic murmur in an asymptomatic 70 year old man [^111czMQn]. Heart (2005). Low credibility.

A 70 year old man with hypertension underwent echocardiography for an asymptomatic murmur and was found to have aortic valve sclerosis. Over the next eight years, annual echocardiography showed progressive valve calcification with an increase in transaortic velocity and pressure gradient and a decrease in valve area. He eventually developed decreased exercise tolerance and was referred for aortic valve replacement. The purpose of this interactive case presentation is to illustrate the diagnosis and clinical implications of aortic valve sclerosis and the progression of sclerosis to significant stenosis, and its appropriate diagnosis and management.

### 2020 focused update of the 2017 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on the management of mitral Regurgitation: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^113yZD8w]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Mitral regurgitation — auscultatory clues distinguishing primary versus secondary MR: In primary MR, the presence of a diastolic filling complex (S3 plus short diastolic murmur) is usually associated with a significant regurgitant volume and severe MR, and one or more non‑ejection clicks may be audible. Differential radiation can suggest leaflet pathology, with murmurs from anterior leaflet flail directed to the axilla and left infrascapular area, whereas murmurs from posterior leaflet flail radiate anteriorly and can be confused with systolic ejection murmurs. With secondary MR, the murmur is usually best heard at the apex and radiates to the axilla, and an S3 gallop is harder to interpret because it may reflect underlying LV dysfunction.

### 10 issues for the clinician in tricuspid regurgitation evaluation and management: 2025 ACC expert consensus decision pathway: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^112Cqw8q]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) clinical presentation — most encountered cases, symptom progression, and examination findings are described as follows: Most TR cases clinically encountered are secondary in nature and not related to primary diseases of the valve leaflets or chordae, such as infective endocarditis, rheumatic heart disease, carcinoid, and Ebstein anomaly. Mild-to-moderate degrees of TR are usually well tolerated in the short to intermediate term and may be clinically silent, but with increasing TR severity, symptoms of systemic venous congestion, such as edema and those reflective of reduced forward cardiac output, including dyspnea and fatigue, may emerge, and more advanced manifestations of right-sided congestion, such as abdominal bloating, worsening peripheral edema, weight gain, and anorexia, are ominous. Most patients with chronic severe secondary TR are older and have a significant burden of other cardiac and systemic comorbidities, and women outnumber men in most large observational series and atrial fibrillation (AF) is common. TR on bedside physical examination is more often "seen" than "heard", with severe TR showing elevated venous pressure and a prominent, systolic cv wave with a rapid y descent (in the absence of tricuspid stenosis), and the murmur of chronic TR being holosystolic in timing, high or medium pitched, and best heard at the lower left sternal border. An increase in murmur intensity during inspiration (Carvallo sign) can help distinguish it from other holosystolic murmurs, but when right atrial (RA) pressure is very high the murmur may not increase with inspiration, and in rare severe TR a diastolic murmur of functional tricuspid stenosis owing to enhanced diastolic flow can be appreciated.

### Physical determinants of systolic murmur intensity in aortic stenosis [^115GBJdL]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

We investigated which physical parameter has the greatest impact on the perceived loudness of a systolic murmur in aortic stenosis. Loudness of murmur in aortic stenosis correlated best with peak momentum transfer — and thus with body size — so that loud murmurs predict severe disease less reliably in larger patients.

### Murmur clinic: validation of a new model for detecting heart valve disease [^112RtmSy]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications

A point-of-care scan can be seen as an 'ultrasonic stethoscope'and is useful primarily as an extension of the clinical examination to reduce the need for relatively time-consuming and costly TTEs. The organisation of our clinic means that a TTE can be performed immediately if clinically indicated. Furthermore, not all clinicians requesting echocardiography may have competencies in the management of valve disease and the murmur clinic allows protocol-led application of agreed standards of care. Patients with moderate or severe valve disease are referred directly to a specialist valve clinic.

However, a community setting may be geographically more convenient for patients. This might increase the attendance rate since 91 (40%) of 225 people invited to our clinic failed to attend. Those with normal scans would not need to travel to hospital and those with minor abnormalities requiring periodic follow-up could have this within the community. It would be possible to run community clinics with portable or hand-held deviceswhich compare well against high-end machines for detection of valve disease. However, it is essential that community-based systems have robust processes to deal with abnormalities including quick access to comprehensive TTE within a hospital-based specialist valve clinic.

### Assessing children's heart sounds at a distance with digital recordings [^116Mut6c]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to assess whether computer-stored digital sound recordings can be used to distinguish innocent from pathologic systolic murmurs.

Methods

Recordings of 55 children aged 1 month to 19 years were made remotely with the use of a digital stethoscope and were e-mailed to a computer in our center for later assessment. Eight-second recordings were made by a physician in 2 to 4 locations on the chest. Three cardiologists who were blinded to the diagnosis reviewed the recordings independently using stethophones to assess the splitting of the second heart sound and whether murmurs were innocent or pathologic. Diagnoses were confirmed with echocardiography.

Results

Seventeen children had innocent murmurs and 38 had pathologic murmurs. For the 3 cardiologists, sensitivity was 0.87 to 1.0, specificity was 0.82 to 0.88, negative predictive value was 0.75 to 1.0, and positive predictive value was 0.93 to 0.95. Assessment of splitting of second heart sound was highly accurate.

Conclusions

Digital recordings of children's heart sounds allow reliable differentiation between innocent and pathologic murmurs. Use of this technology may allow remote diagnosis of childhood murmurs and avoid the expense and stress of travel to pediatric cardiology centers for some children. Cardiologists who use recordings should assess their diagnostic accuracy before clinical application.

### Screening of asymptomatic rheumatic heart disease among refugee / migrant children and youths in Italy [^116CQfUE]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

The fact that RHD almost disappeared in developed nations has led to a generalized neglect of the disease in recent years: the results of our study calls for reviving its medical education, attention and vigilance, as medical doctors and health systems have become unfamiliar with the condition.

Second, the presence of a systolic murmur was strongly predictive of 'definite RHD' (p < 0.001 and OR of 5.2 [CI 95% (1.7–15.2]). Twelve out of 17 'definite RHD' were associated with a systolic murmur. The same significant association was observed among those showing a 'borderline RHD'. However, while its PPV was > 80%, the 70.7% NPV of the valve murmur cannot be considered a stand-alone clinical criterion for defining/selecting patients who will access second-level cardiac investigation, as this will equate to under-diagnosis (missed cases) and under-treatment in roughly more than one third of patients who do not present systolic murmur. Thus, the findings of this study represent an additional element supporting the recommendation of systematically providing echocardiographic investigation among the vulnerable population of migrant/refugee children, irrespective of the presence of a valve murmur.

### Management of echocardiography requests for the detection and follow-up of heart valve disease: a consensus statement from the British heart valve society [^114UrdnT]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

1.4.1 Recommendation 5

Discuss clinical urgency and level of echocardiography with a clinician.

1.4.1.1 Background to Recommendation 5

The need for clinical collaboration is greater for inpatient than for outpatient requests since the presentation may be acute, not necessarily associated with a murmur and the dangers of progression much higher.

There can be no safe target time‐delays and every case must be considered individually.

No level of echocardiography is universally applicable. A combination of a basic/level 1 study can be used to exclude life‐threatening pathology and a minimum standard study performed at greater leisure if required.

1.4.1.1.1 Examples of Indications Suitable for an Initial Basic/Level 1 Study

Incidental murmur in a patient admitted with a nonvalve problem for example, neck of femur fracture. It is reasonable to perform a basic/level 1 study in patients with a murmur as an emergency if identifying HVD will change management.

After insertion of an electrical device or other invasive intervention a basic/level 1 study is frequently sufficient to exclude a new pericardial effusion.
In an acutely unwell patient, a basic/level 1 study may indicate the need for immediate life‐saving treatment.

1.4.1.1.2 Examples of Indications Suitable for a Focussed Study

Predischarge after cardiac surgery to detect pathology that might require immediate management for example, large pericardial effusion or LV dysfunction or prosthetic valve dysfunction.

1.4.1.1.3 Examples of Indications Requiring a Minimum Standard Study

Patients with known HVD admitted with heart failure.
Murmur after acute myocardial infarction since it may indicate mitral regurgitation or a VSD.
Urgent echocardiography should be done if there is unexplained LV failure or shock since these might complicate critical HVD.

1.4.1.1.4 Examples of Studies Often Not Indicated

Fever with a low clinical likelihood of infective endocarditis (see recommendation 6).
Recent TTE with no evidence of clinical deterioration.

### Evaluation of heart murmurs in children: cost-effectiveness and practical implications [^114VrkLM]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the cost-effectiveness of various strategies to evaluate heart murmurs in children.

Methods

We modeled 6 strategies to follow the initial examination by the pediatrician: (1) refer suspected pathologic murmurs to a cardiologist, (2) obtain a chest radiograph (CXR) and electrocardiogram (ECG) and refer suspected pathologic murmurs to a cardiologist, (3) refer suspected pathologic murmurs for an echocardiogram (ECHO), (4) obtain a CXR and ECG and refer suspected pathologic murmurs for an ECHO, (5) refer all patients with murmurs to a cardiologist, or (6) refer all patients with murmurs for an ECHO.

Results

The least effective was strategy 1, which detects 82% of pathologic murmurs at $72 per patient evaluated. Strategy 5 detects 95% of pathologic murmurs at $38,000 per additional case detected over strategy 1. The most effective, strategy 6, detects 100% of pathologic murmurs at $158,000 per additional case detected over strategy 5. Strategies 2, 3, and 4 were not cost-effective. The results were sensitive to the costs of cardiology referral and ECHO.

Conclusions

Adding a CXR and ECG to the pediatrician's evaluation, or selectively referring directly to ECHO increases costs with little gain in accuracy. Given the current cost constraints present in health care, whether the optimal strategy involves referring to a cardiologist or obtaining an ECHO for all patients with murmurs depends on how much society should allocate to diagnose pathologic murmurs.

### Congenital heart disease diagnosed with echocardiogram in newborns with asymptomatic cardiac murmurs: a systematic review [^111Zz3sB]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

CHD incidence varied greatly among the studies, which could be attributable to CHD prevalence variations between different countries. Information on antenatal ultrasound screening for CHD according to the country where the study was conducted was not available. Only one study reported that the lower CHD incidence in their study compared to previous studies could be attributed to active prenatal detection of most of the major and critical cases of CHD. The incidence of CHD among full term newborns with ANCM found in this systematic review (37.3%) was much higher than the updated prevalence of CHD at birth. Among the subtypes of CHD, shunt lesions such as VSD, atrial septal defect (ASD), and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) were most frequently observed, which is consistent with the worldwide prevalence of CHD at birth.

With regard to the severity of CHD in newborns, three studies classified CHD severity as follows: mild, moderate, and severe. Of the 267 newborns with CHD in the three studies, 3.4% were diagnosed as having severe CHD and thus required immediate interventions, such as heart surgery or interventional catheterization, before hospital discharge. In this systematic review, even though acyanotic severe heart diseases, such as large VSD, ASD, and PDA as well as critical aortic or pulmonary stenosis, were not included, 2.5% had severe CHD. The majority of the newborns had moderate CHD requiring outpatient cardiology follow-up.

Cardiac murmurs heard in the first few days of life are mostly associated with physiologic variants, such as peripheral pulmonary stenosis, and typically disappear within 3 to 6 months of life. Cardiac murmurs due to CHD are more easily auscultated after the decrease in pulmonary resistance that occurs after several weeks of life. Nevertheless, we observed a high CHD incidence in the included studies that performed initial cardiac evaluations within five days of life. Generally, pathologic murmurs that are described as louder than 2/6 in intensity, diastolic, and pansystolic and are associated with rubs, clicks, or gallops are relevant to CHD; however, we observed that CHD includes not only pathologic murmurs but also innocent murmurs, such as ANCM. While pathologic murmurs are associated with a higher CHD incidence, newborns with innocent murmurs showed a CHD incidence rate of 0.6–70%.

### An unusual finding in a 57-year-old woman with new onset hypertension and a diastolic murmur [^116qRMWm]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical Introduction

A 57-year-old woman presented to our clinic with breathlessness brought on while walking uphill. She had been recently diagnosed with systemic hypertension. There was no known family history of cardiac disease, or prior smoking habit. On examination, pulse was 73bpm and blood pressure 155/73mmHg, which was asymmetrical in her arms. Auscultation revealed a readily audible early diastolic murmur in the aortic area and bilateral subclavian bruits. ECG showed sinus rhythm with no abnormality. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated mild-to-moderate aortic regurgitation, and normal left ventricular size and function. The ascending aorta was mildly dilated (41mm), with para-aortic thickening noted. Owing to the abnormal appearance of the aortic wall, cardiac MRI, and subsequently 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scan was performed (figure 1).

### High rates of echocardiographic abnormalities in an underserved population [^111JX3cJ]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

The most common indications for echocardiography were a murmur (n = 109, 37.5%), palpitations/arrhythmia (n = 90, 30.9%), unexplained dyspnea (n = 76, 26.1%), ischemic evaluation (n = 59, 20.3%), and suspected heart failure/cardiomyopathy (n = 40, 13.8%). When classified according to the American Society of Echocardiography Appropriate Use Indications, 72.5% of echocardiograms were appropriate, 10.3% were maybe appropriate and 17.2% were rarely appropriate. The rates of abnormal findings were 53.6%, 43.3%, and 20% in appropriate, maybe appropriate and rarely appropriate indications, respectively.

A total of 133 (46%) echocardiograms were abnormal with 100 (34%) of these being new diagnoses. Clinically significant findings, defined as abnormalities that would change management of the patient, were identified in 72 (24.7%) patients (Table 1). This included important congenital, valvular, or cardiomyopathic disease in 60 patients (20.6%), pulmonary hypertension in 6 patients, pericardial effusion ≥ mild in 5 patients, dilated ascending aorta in 10 patients, and right ventricular enlargement in 13 patients (some patients had more than 1 finding).

This population was comprised of 43 patients with 60 actionable findings including severe aortic stenosis (n = 2), severe mitral regurgitation (n = 1), pulmonic stenosis (n = 2), patent ductus arteriosus (n = 1), ventricular septal defect (n = 6), bicuspid aortic valve (n = 5), and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (n = 20). Implementation of at least 1 guideline directed intervention occurred in 35 (81.4%) of patients in response to 45 (75%) of the significant findings on echocardiography within 3 months of the echocardiogram. The most common reasons for recommendations not being put into practice were cost, lack of insurance, transportation problems, or relocation out of the service area.

### An unusual finding in a 57-year-old woman with new onset hypertension and a diastolic murmur [^116oPYzt]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical introduction

A 57-year-old woman presented to our clinic with breathlessness brought on while walking uphill. She had been recently diagnosed with systemic hypertension. There was no known family history of cardiac disease, or prior smoking habit. On examination, pulse was 73 bpm and blood pressure 155/73 mm Hg, which was asymmetrical in her arms. Auscultation revealed a readily audible early diastolic murmur in the aortic area and bilateral subclavian bruits. ECG showed sinus rhythm with no abnormality. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated mild-to-moderate aortic regurgitation, and normal left ventricular size and function. The ascending aorta was mildly dilated (41 mm), with para-aortic thickening noted. Owing to the abnormal appearance of the aortic wall, cardiac MRI, and subsequently 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scan was performed (figure 1).

Question

### 2021 AHA / ACC / ASE / CHEST / SAEM / SCCT / SCMR guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^117M4SFf]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Intermediate–high risk stable chest pain with no known CAD — left ventricular function assessment and sequential/add-on testing: In patients who have pathological Q waves, symptoms or signs suggestive of heart failure, complex ventricular arrhythmia, or a heart murmur with unclear diagnosis, use of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is effective for diagnosis of resting left ventricular systolic and diastolic ventricular function and detection of myocardial, valvular, and pericardial abnormalities. For patients with known coronary stenosis of 40% to 90% in a proximal or mid coronary segment on CCTA, fractional flow reserve CT (FFR-CT) can be useful for diagnosis of vessel-specific ischemia and to guide decision-making regarding coronary revascularization. After an inconclusive or abnormal exercise ECG or stress imaging study, CCTA is reasonable; after inconclusive CCTA, stress imaging is reasonable. For patients undergoing stress testing, the addition of CAC testing can be useful. After a negative stress test but with high clinical suspicion of CAD, CCTA or invasive coronary angiography (ICA) may be reasonable.

### Artificial intelligence-assisted auscultation of heart murmurs: validation by virtual clinical trial [^112p5ctm]. Pediatric Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has potential to improve the accuracy of screening for valvular and congenital heart disease by auscultation. However, despite recent advances in signal processing and classification algorithms focused on heart sounds, clinical acceptance of this technology has been limited, in part due to lack of objective performance data. We hypothesized that a heart murmur detection algorithm could be quantitatively and objectively evaluated by virtual clinical trial. All cases from the Johns Hopkins Cardiac Auscultatory Recording Database (CARD) with either a pathologic murmur, an innocent murmur or no murmur were selected. The test algorithm, developed independently of CARD, analyzed each recording using an automated batch processing protocol. 3180 heart sound recordings from 603 outpatient visits were selected from CARD. Algorithm estimation of heart rate was similar to gold standard. Sensitivity and specificity for detection of pathologic cases were 93% (CI 90–95%) and 81% (CI 75–85%), respectively, with accuracy 88% (CI 85–91%). Performance varied according to algorithm certainty measure, age of patient, heart rate, murmur intensity, location of recording on the chest and pathologic diagnosis. This is the first reported comprehensive and objective evaluation of an AI-based murmur detection algorithm to our knowledge. The test algorithm performed well in this virtual clinical trial. This strategy can be used to efficiently compare performance of other algorithms against the same dataset and improve understanding of the potential clinical usefulness of AI-assisted auscultation.
