## Question

Can dulaglutide be used to treat pseudotumor cerebri?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether dulaglutide can be used to treat idiopathic intracranial hypertension: based on current evidence, dulaglutide should not be used specifically to treat pseudotumor cerebri/IIH outside a clinical trial, as there are no dulaglutide-specific data demonstrating intracranial pressure reduction or IIH symptom benefit, while emerging class signals come primarily from exenatide and observational cohorts, and any such use would be off-label [^1115poSJ] [^1146DBAS] [^113fpNzf].

> Evidence summary: there are no randomized or prospective data testing dulaglutide in IIH, and dulaglutide's approved indications are limited to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular risk reduction, with no labeling claims related to IIH or intracranial pressure; large outcome trials with dulaglutide, such as REWIND, did not include IIH endpoints or ICP measures, whereas a double-blind randomized trial of exenatide in active IIH demonstrated rapid and sustained ICP reductions, and mechanistic work supports GLP-1 receptor expression in the choroid plexus and reduced CSF secretion, with meta-analyses and real-world data suggesting improved papilledema, visual outcomes, and headache days with GLP-1 or GIP/GLP-1 agonists, though the signal is driven largely by exenatide and observational designs rather than dulaglutide-specific trials [^1115poSJ] [^112UGfLz] [^1146DBAS] [^117Wy4ad] [^111cEdZr] [^11219kht] [^116q32gw].

> Extrapolation caveat: pharmacologic differences across the GLP-1 RA class mean the exenatide IIH signal cannot be assumed to translate to dulaglutide without direct study; kinetics, molecular backbones, and tissue distribution vary by agent, and current systematic reviews emphasize the small number of studies, heterogeneity, and risk of bias, underscoring the need for phase 3 trials before endorsing a class-wide ICP-lowering effect or dulaglutide-specific efficacy in IIH [^11287hxo] [^113ukGGJ] [^113fpNzf].

> Safety and population context: dulaglutide commonly causes gastrointestinal adverse effects that may affect adherence in IIH patients, and carries risks including pancreatitis, potential acute kidney injury with severe GI losses, and a boxed contraindication for patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or MEN2; no data indicate that dulaglutide worsens ICP, renal dosing is generally feasible down to eGFR ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73 m² with monitoring, and observational IIH cohorts receiving GLP-1 RAs have shown lower BMI and reduced odds of headaches and acetazolamide use, but these data are nonrandomized and not dulaglutide-specific [^115hP6bK] [^112mtPkA] [^11629Sdq] [^113e8dXm] [^1123ZhXr] [^115hYuyv].

> Practical guidance: continue to treat IIH per standard care with weight reduction as disease-modifying therapy, acetazolamide as first-line pharmacologic therapy, and neurosurgical options such as CSF diversion or venous sinus stenting when indicated; consider GLP-1 RAs, including dulaglutide, for metabolic indications such as diabetes or obesity where appropriate, but do not rely on dulaglutide to lower ICP in the absence of drug-specific evidence, and consider referral to or enrollment in trials evaluating GLP-1–based therapies in IIH, given the randomized exenatide data and meta-analytic signals that justify further study but not routine dulaglutide use for IIH at this time [^117Wy4ad] [^115w2sV3] [^114ZCSrv] [^1146DBAS] [^113fpNzf].

Dulaglutide is not currently recommended for pseudotumor cerebri (PTC/IIH), as there is no direct clinical evidence supporting its use in this condition [^111cEdZr]. While GLP-1 receptor agonists have shown potential to reduce intracranial pressure and improve symptoms in IIH [^1146DBAS], these findings derive from other agents (e.g. exenatide), not dulaglutide [^117Wy4ad]. Dulaglutide is approved for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular risk reduction [^112UGfLz] and has common gastrointestinal side effects [^115hP6bK] and rare risks, such as pancreatitis and thyroid C-cell tumors [^1115poSJ] [^112mtPkA]. Until dedicated trials are completed, dulaglutide should not be used for PTC/IIH outside of research settings.

---

## Mechanism of action relevant to pseudotumor cerebri

Dulaglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that mimics endogenous GLP-1, enhancing glucose-dependent insulin secretion, suppressing glucagon, slowing gastric emptying, and promoting satiety and weight loss [^11287hxo]. These effects are relevant to PTC/IIH because obesity is a major modifiable risk factor, and **weight loss** can reduce intracranial pressure and improve symptoms [^11219kht] [^117Wy4ad]. Preclinical data suggest that GLP-1 receptor agonists may **reduce CSF production** and intracranial pressure via choroid plexus GLP-1 receptors, providing a plausible mechanism for benefit in PTC/IIH [^11219kht] [^115hYuyv]. However, these effects have not been specifically demonstrated for dulaglutide.

---

## Clinical evidence for dulaglutide in pseudotumor cerebri

There is currently no direct clinical evidence evaluating dulaglutide in PTC/IIH; existing evidence for GLP-1 receptor agonists in IIH comes from other agents, including exenatide and semaglutide [^111cEdZr] [^113fpNzf]. A randomized controlled trial of exenatide in IIH demonstrated significant reductions in intracranial pressure and improvements in visual outcomes, supporting the potential utility of GLP-1 receptor agonists in this condition. However, these findings **cannot be directly extrapolated to dulaglutide** without specific clinical trials.

---

## Safety profile and potential risks

Dulaglutide has a **well-characterized safety profile** in its approved indications (type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular risk reduction) [^114EmRi9]. Common adverse effects include gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain), injection site reactions, and mild hypoglycemia when combined with insulin or sulfonylureas [^115hP6bK] [^1115poSJ] [^112mtPkA].

Serious, though rare, adverse effects include:

- **Acute pancreatitis**: Increased risk, including fatal and non-fatal cases [^112mtPkA] [^114L8tsR].
- **Thyroid C-cell tumors**: Contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or MEN2 [^1115poSJ] [^11629Sdq].
- **Acute renal failure**: Particularly in patients with severe gastrointestinal reactions [^112mtPkA] [^113e8dXm].
- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Including anaphylaxis and angioedema [^1115poSJ] [^114L8tsR].

These risks should be **weighed carefully**, particularly in patients with pre-existing conditions or those taking other medications that may interact with dulaglutide.

---

## Comparison with existing standard treatments

Current standard treatments for PTC/IIH include acetazolamide, topiramate, and surgical interventions (e.g. optic nerve sheath fenestration, CSF shunting) [^115w2sV3] [^114ZCSrv]. These treatments have **established efficacy** in reducing intracranial pressure and improving visual outcomes, but are associated with significant side effects and limitations. GLP-1 receptor agonists, including dulaglutide, may offer advantages, such as weight loss and metabolic improvements [^11287hxo]; however, without direct clinical evidence, dulaglutide **cannot currently be recommended** as a replacement for, or adjunct to standard treatments [^111cEdZr].

---

## Ongoing clinical trials and research

Currently, there are **no registered clinical trials** specifically investigating dulaglutide in PTC/IIH [^111cEdZr]. Ongoing research primarily focuses on other GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as semaglutide and exenatide [^1146DBAS] [^111cEdZr]. These studies may clarify the role of GLP-1 receptor agonists in PTC/IIH, but evidence specific to dulaglutide remains lacking.

---

## Patient populations and clinical scenarios

Given the lack of direct evidence, dulaglutide is **not recommended** for any specific PTC/IIH patient population or clinical scenario. Its use should remain limited to its approved indications (type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular risk reduction) until further research is available.

---

## Regulatory considerations and guidelines

Dulaglutide is **not currently approved** or recommended by any regulatory authorities or clinical guidelines for the treatment of PTC/IIH [^1115poSJ]. Its use in this context is off-label and should be limited to clinical trials or carefully monitored clinical practice.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Dulaglutide is **not currently recommended** for pseudotumor cerebri due to the absence of direct clinical evidence [^111cEdZr]. While GLP-1 receptor agonists have shown potential benefits in IIH, these findings cannot be extrapolated to dulaglutide without specific clinical trials. Clinicians should continue to use established treatments for PTC/IIH and consider dulaglutide only in clinical trials or carefully monitored clinical practice.

### The effect of GLP-1RA exenatide on idiopathic intracranial hypertension: A randomized clinical trial [^1146DBAS]. Brain (2023). High credibility.

Therapeutics to reduce intracranial pressure are an unmet need. Preclinical data have demonstrated a novel strategy to lower intracranial pressure using glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor signalling. Here, we translate these findings into patients by conducting a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to assess the effect of exenatide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, on intracranial pressure in idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Telemetric intracranial pressure catheters enabled long-term intracranial pressure monitoring.

The trial enrolled adult women with active idiopathic intracranial hypertension (intracranial pressure > 25 cmCSF and papilloedema) who received subcutaneous exenatide or placebo. The three primary outcome measures were intracranial pressure at 2.5 h, 24 h, and 12 weeks, with alpha set a priori at less than 0.1. Among the 16 women recruited, 15 completed the study (mean age 28 ± 9, body mass index 38.1 ± 6.2 kg/m², intracranial pressure 30.6 ± 5.1 cmCSF). Exenatide significantly and meaningfully lowered intracranial pressure at 2.5 h -5.7 ± 2.9 cmCSF (P = 0.048); 24 h -6.4 ± 2.9 cmCSF (P = 0.030); and 12 weeks -5.6 ± 3.0 cmCSF (P = 0.058). No serious safety signals were noted.

These data provide confidence to proceed to a phase 3 trial in idiopathic intracranial hypertension and highlight the potential to utilize GLP-1 receptor agonist in other conditions characterized by raised intracranial pressure.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of dulaglutide SC (also known as Trulicity):

- **Acute pancreatitis**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as dulaglutide has been associated with an increased risk of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. Discontinue dulaglutide if acute pancreatitis is suspected.

- **Acute kidney injury (AKI)**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as dulaglutide has been associated with an increased risk of acute renal failure and worsening of chronic renal failure. Monitor renal function when initiating or up-titrating dulaglutide in patients with severe adverse gastrointestinal reactions.

- **Decreased blood glucose**: Use caution in patients taking insulin or insulin secretagogues. Consider reducing the insulin or insulin secretagogue dose.

- **Exacerbation of diabetic retinopathy**: Use caution in patients with diabetic retinopathy. Monitor patients for disease progression.

- **Gallstone disease**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as dulaglutide has been associated with an increased risk of cholelithiasis and cholecystitis.

### The effect of GLP-1RA exenatide on idiopathic intracranial hypertension: A randomized clinical trial [^117Wy4ad]. Brain (2023). High credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a gut neuropeptide secreted by the distal small intestine in response to a meal. GLP-1 receptor agonists are existing therapeutic agents used in the treatment of diabetes. GLP-1 stimulates glucose-dependent insulin secretion and inhibits glucagon release, thereby lowering blood glucose without causing hypoglycemia. GLP-1 receptor agonists also signal at the hypothalamus to regulate satiety and weight, which has led to their licensing for promoting weight loss in the setting of obesity.

Relevant to this trial is the role of GLP-1 receptor agonists in regulating fluid secretion. These agonists have been shown to reduce sodium reabsorption and promote diuresis through actions in the renal proximal tubule. GLP-1 receptors are expressed in the choroid plexus, the predominant cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-secreting structure in the brain. Our preliminary data have demonstrated that GLP-1 receptor agonism reduces CSF secretion and intracranial pressure (ICP) in an in vivo rodent model with elevated ICP. The reduction in ICP was of a greater magnitude than that observed with the commonly used drugs for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).

IIH is characterized by increased ICP with no identifiable cause. Recent weight gain is the major risk factor for the development of the condition, which is most commonly observed in women of reproductive age with obesity. Weight loss is disease-modifying, and if maintained, can induce remission. As the incidence of IIH is rising in line with global obesity trends, targeted treatments are an unmet need.

### Efficacy and safety of GLP-1 and dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists in idiopathic intracranial hypertension: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113fpNzf]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). High credibility.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, treatment with GLP-1 or dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists (RAs) was associated with a significantly reduced risk of papilledema and visual disturbances or blindness, along with a near-significant reduction in headache risk compared with standard-of-care IIH treatment. By contrast, the secondary efficacy and safety outcomes were derived exclusively from studies of GLP-1 RAs. GLP-1 RA treatment was associated with a significant reduction in monthly headache days (MHD), with an average decrease of 3.6 to 4.8 days per month in GLP-1 RA-treated IIH patients versus controls between baseline and 3 months, and between baseline and the end of follow-up, respectively. These estimates align with or even marginally exceed the previously established cut-off of 2 MHD for clinically meaningful treatment benefits in IIH and chronic migraine RCTs. Notably, as indicated in practice guidelines, despite the significant headache morbidity in IIH, no RCT data are available to guide headache management; thus, the findings advocate for larger, well-designed trials to robustly evaluate the efficacy of GLP-1 and dual GIP/GLP-1 RAs in IIH.

The prior results should also be viewed in conjunction with recently published data from the IIH Pressure Trial (ISRCTN12678718). The double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase I trial by Mitchell et al. assessed the effects of the GLP-1 RA exenatide on intracranial pressure (ICP) in a cohort of 15 patients with active IIH, of whom 7 received exenatide and 8 received a placebo.

### Efficacy and safety of GLP-1 and dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists in idiopathic intracranial hypertension: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111cEdZr]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Repurposing glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists (RAs) for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) represents an attractive alternative to treatments, supported by evidence of potent metabolic effects and reductions in cerebrospinal fluid secretion and intracranial pressure in vivo.

- **Methods**: We evaluated the safety and efficacy of GLP-1 RAs and GIP/GLP-1 RAs in IIH. MEDLINE and Scopus databases were searched for randomized-controlled trials (RCT), non-randomized clinical trials, or registries in adults with IIH.

- **Results**: Two clinical trials (one RCT and one non-randomized case-control) and two registries, comprising 1550 IIH patients (768 receiving GLP-1 or GIP/GLP-1 RAs), were included. Compared with standard-of-care, GLP-1 or GIP/GLP-1 RAs were associated with a significantly lower risk of papilledema (RR: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.15–0.43; p < 0.01) and visual disturbances or blindness (RR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.18–0.92; p = 0.03), and a near-significant trend toward reduced headache risk (RR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.34–1.07; p = 0.08). Additionally, GLP-1 RAs significantly reduced monthly headache days at 3 months (MD = -3.64; 95% CI: -6.26 to -1.03; p < 0.01) and at the end of follow-up (MD = -4.82; 95% CI: -8.80 to -0.85; p = 0.02). No association was detected between GLP-1 RAs and body mass index. No serious adverse events or treatment discontinuations were reported; mild gastrointestinal adverse events and nausea occurred in 88% (95% CI: 0.46–1.00) of GLP-1 RA-treated patients.

- **Conclusions**: GLP-1 and dual GIP/GLP-1 RAs are associated with a significant improvement in patient outcomes for those with IIH.

### Comparison of liraglutide versus other incretin-related anti-hyperglycaemic agents [^11287hxo]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

The two classes of incretin-related therapies, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), have become important treatment options for patients with type 2 diabetes. Sitagliptin, saxagliptin, vildagliptin, and linagliptin, the available DPP-4 inhibitors, are oral medications, whereas the GLP-1 RAs — twice-daily exenatide, once-weekly exenatide, and once-daily liraglutide — are administered subcutaneously. By influencing levels of GLP-1 receptor stimulation, these medications lower plasma glucose levels in a glucose-dependent manner with low risk of hypoglycaemia, affecting postprandial plasma glucose more than most other anti-hyperglycaemic medications. The use of GLP-1 RAs has been shown to result in greater glycaemic improvements than DPP-4 inhibitors, probably due to higher levels of GLP-1 receptor activation. GLP-1 RAs can also produce significant weight loss and may reduce blood pressure, having beneficial effects on other cardiovascular risk factors.

Although both classes are well tolerated, DPP-4 inhibitors may be associated with infections and headaches, whereas GLP-1 RAs are often associated with gastrointestinal disorders, primarily nausea. Pancreatitis has been reported with both DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs, but a causal relationship between the use of incretin-based therapies and pancreatitis has not been established. In clinical trials, liraglutide has shown efficacy and tolerability and resulted in certain significant benefits when compared with exenatide and sitagliptin.

### Concurrent use of a lumboperitoneal shunt with programmable valve and ventricular access device in the treatment of pseudotumor cerebri: review of 40 cases [^115w2sV3]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

The authors evaluated the efficacy of treating patients with pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) and headaches due to increased intracranial pressure (ICP) using a lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt with a programmable valve and ventricular access device (VAD).

Forty patients diagnosed with PTC were treated using LP shunts with programmable valves and wand-guided placement of a VAD. All patients had papilledema and high opening pressure during spinal tap. The mean follow-up was 18 months, ranging from 3 to 72 months. When patients complained of headaches suggesting shunt malfunction, the ventricular reservoir was tapped at the bedside to assess ICP. The programmable valve was adjusted based on the patient's headache and ICP.

The VAD was tapped in 21 patients, and the LP valve was redialed in 14. Shunt malfunction was diagnosed accurately. Among the 10 patients undergoing revision, all were found to have shunt obstruction except for 1, whose valve was replaced because it could not be reprogrammed. No patient treated with a shunt developed a Chiari malformation. The VAD was exposed in 4 patients with infection or wound breakdown. The LP shunt was revised in 2 patients who developed a pseudomeningocele. In 1 patient, a small bowel obstruction responded to conservative management. Seven patients had headaches despite documented normal ICP, indicating the headaches were unrelated to shunt function, and these patients were referred to a pain management clinic.

Lumboperitoneal shunts with programmable valves effectively controlled the outflow of lumbar cerebrospinal fluid.

### The effect of dulaglutide on stroke: An exploratory analysis of the REWIND trial [^114EmRi9]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

Cardiovascular outcome trials have suggested that glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists might reduce strokes. We analyzed the effect of dulaglutide on stroke within the researching cardiovascular events with a weekly incretin in diabetes (REWIND) trial.

- **Methods**: REWIND was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 371 sites in 24 countries. Men and women (aged ≥ 50 years) with established or newly detected type 2 diabetes, whose HbA1c was 9.5% or less (with no lower limit) on stable doses of up to two oral glucose-lowering drugs with or without basal insulin therapy, were eligible if their body-mass index was at least 23 kg/m². Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to weekly subcutaneous injections of either masked dulaglutide 1.5 mg or the same volume of masked placebo (containing the same excipients but without dulaglutide). Randomization was done by a computer-generated random code with an interactive web response system with stratification by site. Participants, investigators, the trial leadership, and all other personnel were masked to treatment allocation until the trial was completed and the database was locked. During the treatment period, participants in both groups were instructed to inject the study drug on the same day at around the same time each week.

Strokes were categorized as fatal or non-fatal, and as either ischemic, hemorrhagic, or undetermined. Stroke severity was assessed using the modified Rankin scale. Participants were seen at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and then every 3 months for drug administration and assessment.

### Pseudotumor cerebri syndrome: Venous sinus obstruction and its treatment with stent placement [^114ZCSrv]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2003). Low credibility.

Pseudotumor cerebri, or benign intracranial hypertension, is a condition characterized by raised intracranial pressure in the absence of a mass lesion or cerebral edema. It manifests through symptoms such as headache and visual deterioration, potentially leading to blindness. Venous sinus obstruction is a causative factor in an unknown percentage of cases. This study aimed to explore the role of cerebral venous sinus disease in pseudotumor cerebri and assess the potential of using endoluminal venous sinus stent placement as a treatment option.

Nine consecutive patients diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri were examined using direct retrograde cerebral venography (DRCV) and manometry to investigate the morphological features and venous pressures in their cerebral venous sinuses. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure was simultaneously measured in two patients. If patients presented with an amenable lesion, they underwent treatment using an endoluminal venous sinus stent. Five patients exhibited morphological obstruction of the venous transverse sinuses (TSs). All lesions were associated with a distinct pressure gradient and increased proximal venous sinus pressures. Four patients received stent insertion in the venous sinuses and reported immediate improvement in headaches, with sustained relief at 6 months. Vision improved for three patients, while one patient's vision remained poor despite normalized CSF pressures.

Patients with pseudotumor cerebri should be evaluated using DRCV and manometry due to the likelihood of venous TS obstruction.

### Impact of GLP-1 receptor agonists on idiopathic intracranial hypertension clinical and neurosurgical outcomes: a propensity-matched multi-institutional cohort study [^1123ZhXr]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2025). High credibility.

This study evaluated the efficacy of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1-RAs) in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), focusing on their effects on clinical outcomes, management escalation, and mortality.

- **Methods**: The authors conducted a cohort study using the TriNetX Research Network, comparing IIH patients treated with GLP-1-RAs to untreated patients. They employed propensity score matching. Clinical outcomes, including headaches, visual and cognitive deficits, acetazolamide use, surgery, and mortality, were assessed at 6-month and 1-year follow-up (FU).

- **Results**: At 6-month FU, 5750 patients in the GLP-1-RA cohort were matched to 5750 in the control group. At 1-year FU, 4968 patients in the GLP-1-RA cohort were matched to 4968 in the control group. The GLP-1-RA group demonstrated a significant reduction in BMI (p < 0.001) at 6 months, with a standardized mean difference of 1.083 kg/m2, which increased to 1.635 kg/m2 at 1 year. The control group showed a smaller reduction (p = 0.006), with a standardized mean difference of 0.695 kg/m2 at 6 months and 0.758 kg/m2 at 1 year. Furthermore, GLP-1-RA users had significantly lower odds of new-onset headache (OR 0.660, 95% CI 0.543–0.799, p < 0.001), visual deficits (OR 0.423, 95% CI 0.324–0.546, p < 0.001), cognitive deficits (OR 0.368, 95% CI 0.246–0.539, p < 0.001), and acetazolamide use (OR 0.295, 95% CI 0.249–0.348, p < 0.001) at 6 months. These trends persisted at 1 year for visual deficits (OR 0.606, 95% CI 0.489–0.747, p < 0.001) and cognitive deficits (OR 0.590, 95% CI 0.432–0.801, p = 0.006).

### Efficacy and safety of GLP-1 and dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists in idiopathic intracranial hypertension: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115hYuyv]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Notably, weight-independent mechanisms may also account for the previous findings. In fact, early effects of GLP-1 RAs in IIH are unlikely to be related to weight loss, as evidenced by the significant ICP reduction measured via implanted telemetric catheters in IIH patients as early as 2.5 hours following exenatide administration. This observation arguably reinforces the preclinical data of reduced CSF production and direct alterations in ICP via GLP-1 RA-mediated increase in the intracellular concentration of cyclic adenosine monophosphate and inhibition of the Na+/K+ ATPase pump in the choroid plexus.

With respect to safety outcomes, no SAEs or AEs leading to premature discontinuation of GLP-1 RAs were reported, while the pooled incidence of mild gastrointestinal AEs and nausea was 88% for each outcome among GLP-1 RA-treated IIH patients. Although gastrointestinal AEs are typically mild and self-limited in patients receiving GLP-1 RA treatment, they may represent a relevant limitation in RCT designs, likely introducing unmasking bias in patients undergoing active treatment. The inclusion of robust physiological primary outcome measures, including optic nerve ultrasound, standardized visual acuity, visual field, and OCT assessments, alongside CSF opening pressure measurements, should thus be considered in future trial designs.

Certain limitations of this meta-analysis should be acknowledged. Two TriNetX registry-based retrospective studies, one of which evaluated tirzepatide as the only available dataset on a GIP/GLP-1 RA in IIH at the time of writing, alongside one phase I RCT and one non-completed…

Boxed warnings regarding the use of dulaglutide SC (also known as Trulicity):

- **Medullary thyroid carcinoma**: Do not use dulaglutide in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer or in patients with MEN2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for and symptoms of medullary thyroid carcinoma.

- **Thyroid cancer**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as dulaglutide has been associated with a potential risk of a dose-related and treatment-duration-dependent increase in the incidence of thyroid C-cell tumors.

### Dulaglutide and cardiovascular outcomes in type 2 diabetes (REWIND): A double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial [^112UGfLz]. Lancet (2019). High credibility.

The study, REWIND, was published in 2019 in the journal Lancet. It is related to diabetes mellitus type 2. The trial question was: what is the role of dulaglutide in middle-aged and older patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who either have previous cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors?

The study design was a multi-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. The study population consisted of 9,901 patients, including 4,589 females and 5,312 males. Inclusion criteria were patients aged ≥ 50 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had either a previous cardiovascular event or cardiovascular risk factors. Key exclusion criteria included an eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m², cancer in the previous 5 years, severe hypoglycemia in the previous year, life expectancy < 1 year, coronary or cerebrovascular event within the previous 2 months, and plans for revascularization.

- **Interventions**: Participants were assigned to either a dulaglutide group (n = 4,949) receiving weekly subcutaneous injections of 1.5 mg or a placebo group (n = 4,952) receiving a matching placebo.

- **Primary outcome**: There was a significant decrease in the first occurrence of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes (12% vs. 13.4%; HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.99).

- **Secondary outcomes**: There was no significant difference in myocardial infarction (4.5% vs. 4.7%; HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.15). However, there was a significant decrease in stroke (3.2% vs. 4.1%; HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94) and no significant difference in death from all causes (10.8% vs. 12%; HR 0.9, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.01).

### Efficacy and safety of GLP-1 and dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists in idiopathic intracranial hypertension: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^11219kht]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Repurposing glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) and GIP/GLP‐1 receptor agonists (RAs) for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) represents an attractive alternative to treatments. This is supported by evidence of potent metabolic effects and reductions in cerebrospinal fluid secretion and intracranial pressure in vivo.

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of GLP‐1 RAs and GIP/GLP‐1 RAs in IIH. MEDLINE and Scopus databases were searched for randomized-controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomized clinical trials, or registries in adults with IIH.

Two clinical trials (one RCT and one non-randomized case–control) and two registries, comprising 1,550 IIH patients (768 receiving GLP‐1 or GIP/GLP‐1 RAs), were included. Compared with standard-of-care, GLP‐1 or GIP/GLP‐1 RAs were associated with a significantly lower risk of papilledema (RR: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.15–0.43; p < 0.01) and visual disturbances or blindness (RR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.18–0.92; p = 0.03), alongside a near-significant trend toward reduced headache risk (RR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.34–1.07; p = 0.08). Additionally, GLP‐1 RAs significantly reduced monthly headache days at 3 months (MD = −3.64; 95% CI: −6.26 to −1.03; p < 0.01) and at the end of follow‐up (MD = −4.82; 95% CI: −8.80 to −0.85; p = 0.02). No association was detected between GLP‐1 RAs and body mass index. No serious adverse events or treatment discontinuations were reported; mild gastrointestinal adverse events and nausea occurred in 88% (95% CI: 0.46–1.00) of GLP‐1 RA-treated patients.

GLP‐1 and dual GIP/GLP‐1 RAs are associated with these clinical outcomes, which suggests further exploration of these treatments could be beneficial.

- **Overdosage**: Treatment of acute overdose should focus on reversing hypoglycemia. Oral glucose or food should be consumed. If the overdose results in loss of consciousness, intravenous glucose or parenteral glucagon may be required to reverse the hypoglycemic effects.

A small number of overdose cases have been reported in the post-marketing experience. In one case of acute overdose, a 3-year-old patient experienced hypoglycemia after receiving one 4 mg dose of INCRELEX (a 10-fold increase beyond the prescribed dose). The event resolved following treatment with IV glucose. Long-term overdosage with INCRELEX may result in signs and symptoms of acromegaly.

### Efficacy and safety of GLP-1 and dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists in idiopathic intracranial hypertension: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116q32gw]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Overview of outcomes**: The primary and secondary outcomes in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension treated with GLP‐1 receptor agonists (RAs) compared to controls were examined.

- **Forest plot analysis**: Refer to Figure 1 for a forest plot that compares the risk of (a) papilledema, (b) visual disturbances or blindness, and (c) headache in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) patients treated with GLP‐1 or GIP/GLP‐1 RAs versus controls.

Regarding secondary efficacy outcomes, treatment with GLP‐1 RAs demonstrated a significant reduction in monthly headache days (MHD) at 3 months [Mean Difference (MD) = −3.64; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): −6.26 to −1.03; p < 0.01; 2 studies; I² = 0%; p for Cochran's Q = 0.48; Figure 2a] and at the end of follow-up (MD = −4.82; 95% CI: −8.80 to −0.85; p = 0.02; 2 studies; I² = 0%; p for Cochran's Q = 0.68; Figure 2b).

No association was found with body mass index (BMI) at 3 months (MD = −0.07; 95% CI: −1.05 to 0.90; p = 0.88; 2 studies; I² = 34%; p for Cochran's Q = 0.22; Figure S4) or at the end of follow-up (MD = −0.57; 95% CI: −2.62 to 1.48; p = 0.59; 2 studies; I² = 79%; p for Cochran's Q = 0.03; Figure S5). However, Krajnc et al. reported a significant BMI reduction at 6 months.

Pooled analysis for body weight was not possible as only one study reported significant reductions at 3 and 6 months compared with usual care. Similarly, data pooling was not possible for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure or changes in intracranial pressure (ICP), as only one study reported a significant ICP reduction in IIH patients treated with the GLP‐1 RA exenatide versus placebo‐treated controls. This reduction, measured using an implanted telemetric ICP catheter, was evident as early as 2.5 hours after GLP‐1 RA administration, with a recorded ICP reduction of −4.2 mmHg.

### Recorded diagnosis of overweight/obesity in primary care is linked to obesity care performance rates [^1148gmR3]. Pediatric Research (2025). High credibility.

In both sexes of the older age group, the rates of recorded diagnoses for dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and polycystic ovaries were higher among children with recorded diagnoses than those without (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Among children with obesity, the rates of recorded diagnoses for type 2 diabetes and pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) were higher among those with recorded diagnoses compared to those without (P < 0.001 for both comparisons).

In all comparison groups, except for children with obesity without a recorded formal diagnosis, recorded diagnoses of dyslipidemia and pseudotumor cerebri were more prevalent in females than males, and hypertension was less prevalent (P < 0.001 for all these comparisons).

Table 3 presents rates of referral for evaluating obesity-related comorbidities, such as dietitian and endocrine evaluations, prescriptions of anti-obesity medications, and changes in BMI-Z scores during a 1–2-year interval. These were analyzed according to the presence of overweight or obesity, and the recording of a formal diagnosis of overweight or obesity. In both age groups and both sexes, for children with overweight and obesity, the rates of referral to several evaluations were higher among children with recorded diagnoses of overweight or obesity compared to those without (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). These evaluations included referrals for blood pressure measurement, blood tests, and imaging tests.

### Efficacy of tirzepatide dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. A real-world propensity score-matched study [^1126MTwT]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a neurological disorder characterized by elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) without an identifiable underlying cause. The condition predominantly affects women of reproductive age with obesity, manifesting through debilitating symptoms including chronic headaches and papilledema, which can lead to permanent visual impairment if left untreated. The pathophysiology of IIH is complex and multifactorial, involving obesity-related mechanisms such as increased intra-abdominal pressure affecting cerebral venous drainage and adipose tissue functioning as an endocrine organ, releasing factors that influence ICP and neuroinflammation.

Standard management approaches include medical therapies such as acetazolamide, which reduces cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production; topiramate, which combines ICP-lowering and migraine prophylaxis effects; and other diuretics. In cases refractory to medical management, surgical interventions, including venous sinus stenting, optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF), and CSF shunting procedures, may be necessary.

However, management options face significant limitations. Medical therapies often produce suboptimal responses, with many patients experiencing persistent symptoms or intolerable side effects that lead to poor compliance. Surgical interventions, while effective in selected cases, carry inherent risks and may require revision procedures. Furthermore, while weight loss has demonstrated effectiveness in IIH management, achieving and maintaining significant weight reduction remains challenging.

### Transient bilateral oculomotor palsy in pseudotumor cerebri [^1112ib5i]. Journal of Child Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Pseudotumor cerebri is a clinical condition marked by papilledema, normal cerebrospinal fluid composition, normal or small ventricles on radiography, and absence of an intracranial mass. Headache, tinnitus, dizziness, blurred vision, and diplopia are frequently observed in this condition. The cause is often unknown, but it can occur with certain drug ingestions or systemic inflammatory and metabolic diseases. Treatment primarily focuses on correcting the underlying cause and reducing the raised intracranial pressure.

The most important complication is optic atrophy, which results in visual loss. The sixth cranial nerve is most commonly affected; however, involvement of the third cranial nerve is distinctly unusual. This report describes a unique case of bilateral oculomotor palsy with sparing of the papillary fibers, which resolved promptly on administration of acetazolamide.

### Presumed levothyroxine-induced pseudotumor cerebri in a pediatric patient being treated for congenital hypothyroidism [^112racbF]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

Papilledema is considered a neuro-ophthalmic emergency because of its capacity to induce irreversible end-organ damage and the often grave nature of its precipitating factors. Even more concern is warranted when papilledema presents in a pediatric setting. After excluding the contributions of intracranial masses, congenital malformations, ischemic insults, and acute infections, the investigation must focus on determining the contributions of other uncharacteristic causes of pediatric pseudotumor cerebri.

Pediatric pseudotumor cerebri is a rare clinical entity that shares few commonalities with the adult condition regarding its predicating factors or symptoms. Without adequate medical history questioning, funduscopic evaluation, and ancillary testing, the possibility of an erroneous diagnosis is plausible. This case report aims to disclose the toxic role levothyroxine sodium tablets (Synthroid®, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA) played in inducing pseudotumor cerebri in a pediatric patient being treated for congenital hypothyroidism.

### Reduction in syrinx size and severity after venous sinus stenting in a patient with pseudotumor cerebri and Chiari malformation: Technical case report [^116WCNCo]. Operative Neurosurgery (2016). Low credibility.

Pseudotumor cerebri and Chiari I malformation are found to coexist in a subset of patients. Surgical cranial decompression has been the mainstay of Chiari malformation management, whereas venous sinus stenting has emerged as an effective treatment modality for pseudotumor cerebri. Gaps in our understanding of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation and the pathophysiology behind CSF-related disorders present difficulties in the simultaneous management of these conditions. A case is presented of the successful management of both conditions with venous sinus stenting, with sustained improvement in symptoms and structural abnormalities of the Chiari malformation and associated syrinxes.

- **Clinical presentation**: An obese woman in her 20s with a history of occipital headaches who presented with progressively worsening intermittent visual obscurations was diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri, Chiari I malformation, and associated spinal syrinxes. Magnetic resonance venography demonstrated right transverse sinus narrowing with an elevated pressure gradient. Successful endovascular intervention with venous sinus stenting achieved normalization of the venous sinus pressure gradient and symptomatic improvement. After stenting, the cervical syrinx was observed to have decreased in size, with a decrease in the extent of cerebellar tonsillar herniation and an increase in CSF signal around the cerebellar tonsils.

- **Conclusion**: Venous sinus stenting for the treatment of concomitant pseudotumor cerebri and Chiari I malformation can be effective in patients.

### Liraglutide reduces CNS activation in response to visual food cues only after short-term treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes [^111MzmAR]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are associated with reduced appetite and body weight. We investigated whether these effects could be mediated by the central nervous system (CNS).

We performed a randomized crossover study in obese patients with type 2 diabetes (n = 20, mean age 59.3 ± 4.1 years, mean BMI 32 ± 4.7 kg/m²) consisting of two periods of 12-week treatment with either liraglutide 1.8 mg or insulin glargine. Using functional MRI, we determined the effects of treatment on CNS responses to viewing food pictures in the fasted condition and 30 minutes after meal intake.

After 12 weeks, the decrease in HbA1c was larger with liraglutide versus insulin glargine (Δ-0.7% vs. -0.2%, P < 0.001). Body weight decreased during liraglutide versus insulin glargine (Δ-3.3 kg vs. 0.8 kg, P < 0.001). After 10 days, patients treated with liraglutide, compared with insulin glargine, showed decreased responses to food pictures in the insula and putamen (P ≤ 0.02). In addition, liraglutide enhanced the satiating effect of meal intake on responses in the putamen and amygdala (P ≤ 0.05). Differences between liraglutide and insulin glargine were not observed after 12 weeks.

Compared with insulin, liraglutide decreased CNS activation significantly only after short-term treatment, suggesting that these effects of GLP-1RA on the CNS may contribute to the induction of weight loss, but not necessarily to its maintenance, in view of the absence of an effect of liraglutide on CNS activation in response to food pictures after 12 weeks.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: The association between weight loss and the requirement for systemic treatment [^114Ff39P]. BMC Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

To determine whether weight loss is significantly associated with a discontinuation of treatment for idiopathic intracranial hypertension, the notes of 36 patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension under regular review for at least 12 months by a single neuro-ophthalmologist were retrospectively reviewed. Weight was recorded at each assessment, and weight loss was recommended. Treatment was adjusted according to symptoms and visual function, including visual fields and optic disc appearance only. Patients were divided according to the duration of continuous follow-up and then subdivided based on whether they were on treatment at the most recent review and whether weight loss had been achieved compared to presentation. Survival analysis was performed to assess the probability of remaining on treatment after losing weight.

- **Results**: Considering the patients as three groups — those with at least 12 months follow-up (n = 36), those with at least 18 months follow-up (n = 24), and those with 24 months or more follow-up (n = 19) — only the group with 24 months or more follow-up demonstrated a significant association between weight loss and stopping systemic treatment (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.04). Survival analysis demonstrated that the probability of being on treatment at 5 years after gaining weight was 0.63 and after losing weight was 0.38 (log rank test, p = 0.04). The results suggest that the final absolute body mass index is more important than the change in body mass index for patients who stop treatment (Mann Whitney U, p = 0.05).

### Association of adrenal insufficiency with pediatric pseudotumor cerebri syndrome [^114LTMmY]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

Pediatric pseudotumor cerebri syndrome pathophysiology is complex and not well delineated. Therefore, it is important to identify potential contributors or targets underlying the primary pathogenesis for its development.

- **Objective**: To report cases highlighting the association of pediatric pseudotumor cerebri syndrome with adrenal insufficiency.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This noncontrolled, observational case series included pediatric patients diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri syndrome and adrenal insufficiency at an urban academic children's hospital in Houston, Texas, from June 2015 to October 2019.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Monitoring optic nerve edema by clinical examination, fundus photography, and optical coherence topography images of the optic nerve.

- **Results**: Data were collected from 5 pediatric patients (age range, 5–10 years) diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri syndrome and adrenal insufficiency. One was a girl; all were White and prepubertal. Three patients had unrecognized glucocorticoid exposure. All patients had bilateral optic nerve edema that was initially treated with acetazolamide or topiramate, but cortisol functional testing by either 8 am cortisol or cosyntropin stimulation tests revealed a diagnosis of central adrenal insufficiency. Treatment with physiological doses of hydrocortisone resulted in resolution of optic nerve edema and clinical symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri syndrome, as well as a shorter time receiving medical therapy.

In this case series, adrenal insufficiency was associated with both pediatric pseudotumor cerebri syndrome and optic nerve changes.

### Glp-1 receptor agonists for type 2 diabetes and their role in primary care: An Australian perspective [^114LufW4]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) management has shifted from a 'one size fits all' approach to a more holistic, patient-centered approach that aligns management goals, such as glycemic targets and risk factor control (e.g. weight or cardiovascular risk), with patient preferences and characteristics. Involving patients in treatment decisions also helps with adherence to therapy, which is a major challenge in T2DM. In an Australian study, approximately a third of patients with T2DM were found to have suboptimal adherence to their diabetes medication.

- **Adherence strategies**: Strategies that address convenience in terms of simplicity of drug regimens, formulations, and delivery devices have been shown to improve adherence. GLP-1RAs have evolved over time, decreasing dosing frequency from twice-daily (exenatide, BD) to once-daily (liraglutide, lixisenatide), and to once-weekly (dulaglutide, exenatide QW, semaglutide), suggesting a higher adherence potential for the longer-acting agents. Moreover, improvements in drug formulations, such as those which do not require reconstitution or dose titration, and injection devices with hidden and pre-attached needles, which together serve to reduce treatment complexity, may lead to a more positive injection experience for patients.

Note: liraglutide and lixisenatide are not government reimbursed.

It is crucial to address adherence challenges effectively as they significantly impact the overall management and success of treatments in T2DM.

### Venous endothelial injury in central nervous system diseases [^112gM7DZ]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Increased intracranial venous pressure without venous leakage or demyelination: pseudotumor cerebri.

Venous vascular leakage attributed to multiple sclerosis (MS) might be intuitively explained as the result of increased intracranial venous pressure (IVP), although this explanation has not been fully accepted. Of relevance to this issue is the disorder pseudotumor cerebri (PC), also known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension. In PC, prolonged and demonstrably high intracranial pressures are not associated with venous leakage or demyelination.

PC belongs to a set of disorders including hydrocephalic states and spontaneous (primary) intracranial hypotension, in which the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation interfaces with the blood circulatory system. CSF moves by bulk flow and pulsatile forces (transferred from the cerebral arteries) from the ventricles into the spinal and cortical subarachnoid spaces. CSF is largely absorbed via the arachnoid villi into the superior sagittal sinus (SSS). The pressure of the CSF (intracranial pressure, ICP) must always exceed blood pressure in the SSS for this absorption to take place.

With reversal of this gradient, such as in newborns with stenosis of the jugular foramina, hydrocephalus results. The unfused cranial sutures allow for an expansion of the ventricles, which accumulate CSF. With sutures closed, a fully myelinated, healthy brain will resist ventricular expansion, although ICP will rise, a condition predisposing to PC.

PC is a disorder mainly affecting females aged 15 to 45 years, with the greatest incidence in young adulthood. It is characterized by high ICP, papilledema, and headaches.

### Economic evaluation of liraglutide vs dulaglutide or oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review [^112569mk]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Low credibility.

The management of type 2 diabetes not only requires effective medications to regulate blood glucose levels but also needs to consider the economic implications. Liraglutide, dulaglutide, and semaglutide, three widely used glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, have shown significant efficacy in diabetes treatment. This review aimed to systematically assess the cost-effectiveness of liraglutide in comparison to dulaglutide or oral semaglutide for treating type 2 diabetes.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane. Studies published up to December 31, 2024, were retrieved. Two independent reviewers carefully screened the titles, abstracts, and full-text articles, and any disagreements were resolved with the involvement of a third reviewer. Data extraction was carried out following a pre-designed form.

- **Results**: Twelve studies were included, evaluating liraglutide vs. dulaglutide (n = 8) and liraglutide vs. oral semaglutide (n = 6). The minimum consolidated health economic evaluation reporting standards score for the studies was 0.75. The included studies exhibited similar results in cost-effectiveness. Oral semaglutide would be more effective and cost-saving in the US, Netherlands, Spain, and the UK. According to the available studies, liraglutide vs. dulaglutide or oral semaglutide for the treatment of type 2 diabetes is considered not to be cost-effective.

Cost-effectiveness also plays a vital role in the inclusion of these drugs in healthcare reimbursement policies.

### A phase 3 randomized clinical trial using a once-weekly glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in adolescents and young adults with hypothalamic obesity [^116Fecsj]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) in patients with hypothalamic obesity (HO).

- **Materials and methods**: A two-arm, randomized, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in individuals aged 10 to 25 years with hypothalamic injury following intracranial tumour and HO. Participants were randomized to receive either once-weekly subcutaneous injections of the GLP-1 RA exenatide 2 mg (ExQW) or a placebo for 36 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the 36-week percentage change in body mass index (BMI). Secondary outcomes included changes in body composition evaluated by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry.

- **Results**: Forty-two participants were randomized to either the ExQW group (n = 23) or the placebo group (n = 19). Participants were 5 ± 2 years (mean ± SD) post-diagnosis and development of HO, with a BMI of 37.3 ± 7.1 kg/m². In the intention-to-treat analysis, the effect of 36-week ExQW versus placebo on % Δ BMI was not significant (estimated treatment difference -1.7 ± 1.8%, 95% CI -4.1 to 0.6%, P = .40). However, total body fat mass was reduced (estimated treatment difference -3.1 ± 1.4 kg, 95% CI -5.7 to -0.4 kg, P = .02). There was a significant reduction in waist circumference (estimated effect of treatment -3.5 cm, 95% CI -5.5 to -1.6 cm, P = .004). All patients treated with placebo showed an increase in adipose tissue percentage, while 50% of those treated with ExQW had reductions (P < .001). Mean HbA1c, glucose tolerance, and serum lipids did not change significantly with therapy. ExQW was well tolerated, with the most frequent adverse events being transient gastrointestinal disturbances (ExQW vs. placebo).

### Managing cardiovascular events, hyperglycemia, and obesity in type 2 diabetes through microRNA regulation linked to glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists [^114jk7wN]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Low credibility.

This narrative review underlines the important roles of miRNAs targeting GLP-1RAs in the management of comorbidities from T2DM, mainly regarding cardiovascular health, weight control, and hyperglycemia (Fig. 2; Table 1). The combination of liraglutide or BYDUREONTM, together with metformin, exerts a profound epigenetic regulatory effect in T2DM through the upregulation of protective miRNAs such as miR-27b, miR-130a, and miR-210, which are linked to improved lipid profiles, endothelial function, and predictive of improved cardiovascular outcomes. Among GLP-1RAs, semaglutide, dulaglutide, and liraglutide are the most active in the reduction of HbA1c levels in T2DM patients. Semaglutide causes the most significant effects with respect to HbA1c reduction and body weight loss. At the level of miRNA expression, higher levels of miR-378–3p and miR-126–3p were related to better glycemic control after one year of treatment with liraglutide and dulaglutide. Importantly, miR-375–5p was characterized as a predictor of HbA1c levels, whereas higher miR-378–3p and miR-126–3p levels were associated with significant reductions in both HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose. Liraglutide exerts a protective effect against pancreatic β-cell apoptosis by downregulating miR-139–5p involved in β-cell death via caspase-3 and Bcl-2.

- **Methods**:

- **Standard protocol approvals and registrations**: Reporting adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. As per the study design, which is a systematic review and meta-analysis, no Ethical Committee approval was required. The study protocol, comprising a pre-determined PICOS (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, and Study) framework, was a priori designed and registered at the PROSPERO database (CRD42025650082).

- **Data sources and searches**: Two independent reviewers (MIS, IC) conducted a search for published randomized-controlled clinical trials (RCTs), matched non-randomized clinical trials, or registries on GLP-1 or GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists (RAs) in adults with IIH. Eligible studies were identified by a systematic search in MEDLINE (via PubMed) and Scopus databases. The combination of search strings for all database queries included terms such as "GLP-1 receptor agonist", "GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist", "semaglutide", "lixisenatide", "exenatide", "albiglutide", "liraglutide", "dulaglutide", or "tirzepatide", and "idiopathic intracranial hypertension" or "pseudotumor cerebri". The full search algorithms used in MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases are provided in the Supporting Information. Our search was restricted to clinical trials or registries, with no language restrictions applied. The search spanned from each electronic database's inception to August 12th, 2025. A manual search of bibliographies of articles meeting the study inclusion criteria was additionally performed to ensure the comprehensiveness of the literature.

### Enlargement of the sella turcica in pseudotumor cerebri [^114zU9qX]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2014). Low credibility.

The sella turcica usually appears partially empty in MR images obtained from patients with chronic elevation of intracranial pressure. The authors measured the size of the sella turcica to determine if enlargement of the pituitary fossa explains the partially empty sella associated with pseudotumor cerebri.

- **Methods**: The medical records from 2005 to 2011 of a single neuro-ophthalmologist were searched to identify consecutive patients with pseudotumor cerebri. Age-matched control patients were selected from the same practice. The sella turcica and pituitary gland were measured on sagittal T1-weighted MR images.

- **Results**: Measurements were obtained for 48 patients with pseudotumor cerebri and 48 controls. The cross-sectional area of the sella was 38% greater in the patients with pseudotumor cerebri, with only a slight reduction in mean pituitary gland size.

- **Conclusions**: Chronic elevation of intracranial pressure is associated with bony enlargement of the sella turcica. Enlargement of the sella turcica contributes to its partially empty appearance.

### Secondary pseudotumor cerebri in pediatric oncology and hematology: an unpredictable condition of varying etiology [^1159tnNa]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2007).

Secondary pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) in pediatric oncology and hematology is an unpredictable and under-recognized condition. It is characterized by increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure of more than 25 cm H(2)O in the absence of underlying structural causes. Numerous conditions and medications have been implicated in the etiology of secondary PTC. Patients may suffer from incapacitating headaches and permanent visual loss if not managed properly. We retrospectively analyzed the records of eight children diagnosed with secondary PTC with an underlying hematological or oncological disease. Our study highlights the clinical features, contributing factors, and treatment options of this syndrome in children.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists: Beyond diabetes-what the neurosurgeon needs to know [^112UpysY]. Neurosurgery Practice (2024). Low credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have gained increasing popularity since the approval of semaglutide by the United States Food and Drug Administration for chronic weight management. Significant benefits have been noted in glycemic control and cardiovascular health. However, as increasing numbers of patients are started on these medications, it is important for neurosurgeons to have knowledge of any perioperative considerations and side effects related to this class of drugs.

- **Methods**: We performed a qualitative literature review using the PubMed and Embase databases, using the following keywords: GLP-1 RAs adverse events; GLP-1 RAs and anesthesia; substance use disorders; and addiction, functional neurosurgery, nervous system rehabilitation, and spinal cord injury. Articles of relevance to perioperative management of these medications and specific benefits in the neurosurgical field were discussed.

- **Results**: Recent guidance from the American Society of Anesthesiologists demonstrates the importance of tailored management of GLP-RA drugs for surgical patients. In addition, certain positive effects have been noted in relation to substance use disorders, neural protection and rehabilitation, and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

- **Conclusion**: In this article, we review what the neurosurgeon needs to know about the perioperative management of GLP-1 RAs and discuss existing literature in clinical and preclinical studies for potential indications and benefits of these medications, which can influence the management of neurosurgical patients.

### Efficacy and safety of dulaglutide monotherapy compared with glimepiride in EAST-Asian patients with type 2 diabetes in a multicentre, double-blind, randomized, parallel-arm, active comparator, phase 3 trial [^1141obie]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

The present double-blind, double-dummy study showed that monotherapy with either dulaglutide 1.5 or 0.75 mg was associated with a significantly greater decrease from baseline in HbA1c than with glimepiride (P < 0.001) after 26 weeks of treatment in East-Asian patients with early-stage T2D. Sensitivity analysis of the per-protocol population confirmed the results of the primary objective of our study (data not included).

It is noteworthy that this greater HbA1c reduction occurred without an increased risk of hypoglycemia (−16.18 mmol/mol [−1.48%] for dulaglutide 1.5 mg, −13.34 mmol/mol [−1.22%] for dulaglutide 0.75 mg) compared with the global AWARD‐3 study, which had a similar study design but included primarily white patients (−0.78% for dulaglutide 1.5 mg, −0.71% for dulaglutide 0.75 mg). Possible explanations for the observation of greater HbA1c reductions with dulaglutide monotherapy in the present study include:

- **Lower baseline mean body mass index**: A lower baseline mean body mass index (26.1 kg/m²) compared with AWARD‐3 (33.5 kg/m²), which may have led to a larger drug exposure in East-Asian patients with acceptable safety profiles.

- **OAM-naïve T2D patients**: A larger proportion of OAM-naïve T2D patients and/or a higher mean HbA1c at baseline, which are well-established baseline factors positively associated with HbA1c responses to antidiabetic drugs in clinical research.

- **Diabetes self-management**: As fewer resources for diabetic education are available in China compared with Western countries, the intensified diabetes self-management might have played a role in the improved glycemic control.

### Transorbital sonography: A non-invasive bedside screening tool for detection of pseudotumor cerebri syndrome [^112Mpd9U]. Cephalalgia (2022). High credibility.

Our objective was to assess optic nerve sheath diameter (a marker of elevated intracranial pressure) and optic disc elevation (a marker of papilledema) in pseudotumor cerebri syndrome using transorbital sonography.

- **Methods**: The study was a prospective case-control study. We included patients with new-onset pseudotumor cerebri syndrome and matched healthy controls. All participants underwent fundoscopy, lumbar puncture with opening pressure, and transorbital sonography. Sonography was assessed by a blinded observer.

- **Results**: We evaluated 45 patients and included 23 cases. We recruited 35 controls. Optic nerve sheath diameter was larger in pseudotumor cerebri syndrome compared to controls (6.3 ± 0.9mm versus 5.0 ± 0.5mm, p < 0.001), and so was optic disc elevation (0.9 ± 0.4mm versus 0.4 ± 0.1mm, p < 0.001). The optimal cut-off point for optic nerve sheath diameter was 6mm with a sensitivity of 74% for prediction of pseudotumor cerebri syndrome and 68% for prediction of elevated opening pressure. Specificity was 94%. The optimal cut-off point for optic disc elevation was 0.6mm. Sensitivity was 100% and specificity 83% for prediction of pseudotumor cerebri syndrome.

- **Conclusion**: Optic disc elevation and optic nerve sheath diameter are increased in new-onset pseudotumor cerebri syndrome. Optic disc elevation achieved high specificity and excellent sensitivity for diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri syndrome. Transorbital sonography (TOS) is a potential, non-invasive screening tool for pseudotumor cerebri syndrome in headache clinics.

### Efficacy and safety of GLP-1 and dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists in idiopathic intracranial hypertension: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1118z1UC]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

For relevant domains of each included study, the risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias RoB2 tool and the ROBINS‐I tool ("Risk Of Bias In Non‐randomised Studies — of Interventions") for RCTs and non‐randomized trials or registries, respectively. Three independent reviewers performed quality control and bias assessment, and in case of disagreement, consensus after discussion with the corresponding author was reached. Data including the first author name, publication year, study design and duration, patient population, sample size, and outcomes were extracted from individual studies in structured reports.

An aggregate data meta‐analysis was performed including all identified studies. The primary efficacy outcomes were the risk of (i) papilledema; (ii) visual disturbances or blindness; and (iii) headache. Secondary efficacy outcomes comprised changes in (i) monthly headache days (MHD); (ii) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure or intracranial pressure (ICP); (iii) body weight (kg); (iv) body mass index (BMI; calculated using the formula: BMI = weight [kg]/height [m]^2); (v) visual acuity, assessed by the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) chart of the most affected eye; (vi) visual field of the most affected eye, measured by perimetric mean deviation (PMD) in decibels (dB) with the Humphrey visual field analyzer; and (vii) papilledema severity, evaluated by optical coherence tomography (OCT) using as a surrogate marker the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness.

### The role of lumboperitoneal shunts in managing chronic hydrocephalus with slit ventricles [^111TDapV]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Lumboperitoneal (LP) shunts have a role not only in pseudotumor cerebri, but also in patients with slit-like ventricles who are treated with CSF shunting on a chronic basis. Hesitation to utilize LP shunts is based on previous conventional beliefs, including the tendency for overdrainage, difficulties accessing the shunt to tap or revise, and risk of progressive cerebellar tonsillar herniation. The authors hypothesized that the use of horizontal-vertical (HV) valves may reduce the risk of these complications, particularly overdrainage and development of Chiari malformation.

- **Methods**: All pediatric cases involving patients treated with an LP shunt at the Children's Hospital of Michigan were reviewed in this retrospective case series. A total of 143 patients with hydrocephalus were treated with LP shunts from 1997–2015 (follow-up range 8 months-8 years, median 4.2 years). Patients with pseudotumor cerebri underwent placement of an LP shunt as a primary procedure. In patients with slit ventricles from chronically treated hydrocephalus or repeated shunt malfunctions from proximal catheter obstruction, a lumbar drain was inserted to assess candidacy for conversion to an LP shunt. In patients who tolerated the lumbar drain and demonstrated communication of the ventricles with the spinal cisterns, treatment was converted to an LP shunt. All patients included in the series had undergone initial shunt placement between birth and age 16 years.

- **Results**: In 30% of patients (n = 43), LP shunts were placed as the initial shunt treatment; in 70% (n = 100), treatment was converted to LP shunts.

### Efficacy and safety of GLP-1 and dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists in idiopathic intracranial hypertension: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113ukGGJ]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Results**: The systematic database search yielded a total of 34 and 35 records from the MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases, respectively (Figure S1). After excluding duplicates and initial screening, we retrieved the full text of 18 records that were considered potentially eligible for inclusion. After reading the full-text articles, 14 were further excluded (Table S1). Finally, we identified 4 eligible studies for inclusion in the systematic review and meta-analysis, comprising a total of 1550 patients with IIH: 768 in the treatment group, receiving either GLP-1 RAs (n = 575) or GIP/GLP-1 RAs (n = 193), versus 782 in the control group, receiving either the standard of care (n = 774) or placebo (n = 8) (Table 1).

- **Quality control of included studies**: The risk of bias assessment of included studies using the Cochrane risk-of-bias (RoB 2) tool and the ROBINS-I tool is presented in Figures S2 and S3. The phase I RCT by Mitchell et al. presented low to moderate risk of bias, while the case-control study by Krajnc et al. and the registry-based studies by Azzam et al. and Sioutas et al. presented an overall moderate to serious risk of bias as detailed in the Supporting Information.

### Why don't ventricles dilate in pseudotumor cerebri? A circuit model of the cerebral windkessel [^1171nNZG]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Pseudotumor cerebri is a disorder of intracranial dynamics characterized by elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) and chronic cerebral venous hypertension without structural abnormalities. A perplexing feature of pseudotumor is the absence of the ventriculomegaly found in obstructive hydrocephalus, although both diseases are associated with increased resistance to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) resorption. Traditionally, the pathophysiology of ventricular dilation and obstructive hydrocephalus has been attributed to the backup of CSF due to impaired absorption, and it is unclear why backup of CSF with resulting ventriculomegaly would not occur in pseudotumor. In this study, the authors used an electrical circuit model to simulate the cerebral windkessel effect and explain the presence of ventriculomegaly in obstructive hydrocephalus but not in pseudotumor cerebri.

- **Methods**: The cerebral windkessel is a band-stop filter that dampens the arterial blood pressure pulse in the cranium. The authors used a tank circuit with parallel inductance and capacitance to model the windkessel. They distinguished the smooth flow of blood and CSF and the pulsatile flow of blood and CSF by using direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) sources, respectively. They measured the dampening notch from arterial blood pressure (ABP) to ICP as the band-stop filter of the windkessel.

- **Results**: In obstructive hydrocephalus, loss of CSF pathway volume impaired the flow of AC power in the cranium, causing windkessel impairment, to which ventriculomegaly is an adaptation. In pseudotumor, venous hyperten

### Overweight and obesity in pediatric secondary pseudotumor cerebri syndrome [^113kFGhz]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to examine the clinical, demographic, and anthropometric patient characteristics of secondary pseudotumor cerebri syndrome in children and adolescents based on the recently revised diagnostic criteria.

The study is designed as a retrospective observational case series. Patients seen at a tertiary children's hospital for pseudotumor cerebri syndrome were classified into two categories: primary idiopathic (n = 59) and secondary pseudotumor cerebri syndrome (n = 16), as defined by the recently revised diagnostic criteria. The outcomes measured included body mass index Z-scores (BMI-Z), height and weight Z-scores, demographics, and clinical features at presentation, such as headache, sixth nerve palsy, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure.

In the cohort studied, associated conditions and exposures found in definite secondary pseudotumor cerebri syndrome included tetracycline-class antibiotics (n = 11), chronic kidney disease (n = 3), withdrawal from chronic glucocorticoids (n = 1), and lithium (n = 1). Possible associations in the secondary pseudotumor cerebri syndrome group included Down syndrome, vitamin A derivatives, and growth hormone. When compared to primary pseudotumor cerebri syndrome, patients with definite secondary pseudotumor cerebri syndrome were, on average, older (15.0 vs. 11.6 years; p = 0.003, Mann-Whitney test). According to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) classifications, 79% of children with secondary pseudotumor cerebri syndrome were either overweight or obese (36% overweight [n = 5] and 43% obese [n = 6]), as compared to 32% nationally.

### Accutane [^115Q2ziC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Accutane use has been associated with a number of cases of pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines. Concomitant treatment with tetracyclines should therefore be avoided. Early signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri include papilledema, headache, nausea and vomiting, and visual disturbances. Patients with these symptoms should be screened for papilledema and, if present, they should be told to discontinue Accutane immediately and be referred to a neurologist for further diagnosis and care (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Neurological).

- **Serious skin reactions**: There have been post-marketing reports of erythema multiforme and severe skin reactions (e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)) associated with isotretinoin use. These events may be serious and result in death, life-threatening events, hospitalization, or disability. Patients should be monitored closely for severe skin reactions, and discontinuation of Accutane should be considered if warranted.

- **Pancreatitis**: Acute pancreatitis has been reported in patients with either elevated or normal serum triglyceride levels. In rare instances, fatal hemorrhagic pancreatitis has been reported. Accutane should be stopped if hypertriglyceridemia cannot be controlled at an acceptable level or if symptoms of pancreatitis occur.

### Phenotyping non-idiopathic pseudotumor cerebri syndrome - A prospective cohort study [^111nCTtc]. Cephalalgia (2022). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to identify the most frequent causes of secondary pseudotumor cerebri syndrome and compare the phenotype, clinical presentation, and symptoms with those of the primary form, idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

- **Methods**: The study utilized a prospective cohort approach, including patients with new-onset pseudotumor cerebri syndrome. A standardized diagnostic work-up was conducted, and patients were diagnosed with either secondary pseudotumor cerebri syndrome or idiopathic intracranial hypertension according to the revised Friedman criteria. Patients with secondary pseudotumor cerebri syndrome were categorized into five causes: medication, systemic causes, sleep apnea, cerebrovascular causes, and several competing causes. The phenotype, clinical presentation, symptoms, and neuroimaging findings were compared between groups.

- **Results**: Out of 278 cases, 28 patients with secondary pseudotumor cerebri syndrome and 120 patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension were included. The most frequent causes of secondary pseudotumor cerebri syndrome were medication (n = 8, 28.6%) and systemic causes (n = 8, 28.6%), followed by sleep apnea (n = 5, 17.9%), cerebrovascular causes (n = 4, 14.3%), and several competing causes (n = 3, 10.7%). Both groups were phenotypically alike, predominantly female, premenopausal, and obese. Symptoms and objective findings at disease onset were similar between the groups.

- **Conclusion**: Secondary pseudotumor cerebri syndrome should be considered in all patients with suspected pseudotumor cerebri syndrome.

### Adherence, persistence, glycaemic control and costs among patients with type 2 diabetes initiating dulaglutide compared with liraglutide or exenatide once weekly at 12-month follow-up in a real-world setting in the United States [^114Vna2V]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

In a recent consensus statement, the American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes recommended a patient-centred glycaemic management approach for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are given increased emphasis in the treatment approach after metformin because of the low associated risk of hypoglycaemia, potential for weight loss, and proven cardiovascular effects for some of these agents. The consensus report also recommends considering GLP-1RAs prior to insulin as a first injectable option for treatment intensification in asymptomatic patients with T2D not at glycaemic goal.

In the United States, exenatide twice daily, liraglutide, exenatide once weekly (as pen and auto-injector), dulaglutide, and semaglutide are the GLP-1RAs approved and available for management of glycaemic control in patients with T2D. Controlled clinical trials have shown that GLP-1RAs differ in the magnitude of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) reduction, weight loss, and possible cardiovascular benefits, as well as in the frequency of gastrointestinal adverse events, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Currently, liraglutide is the only agent indicated for reduction of cardiovascular risk in patients with established cardiovascular disease. In addition to differences in clinical profiles, these GLP-1RAs have substantial differences in dosing regimen, need/length of dose titration, and administration device features such as need for reconstitution, single-dose vs. multi-dose devices.

### Pseudotumor cerebri after surgical remission of Cushing's disease [^116CJNSf]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Pseudotumor cerebri has only been described after successful surgery for Cushing's disease (CD) in case reports. We sought to establish the incidence and timing of its occurrence, identify predisposing factors, characterize the clinical presentations and their severity, and examine the effects of treatment in patients who underwent surgery for CD.

- **Setting**: This study was conducted at two tertiary care centers: The University of Virginia and the National Institutes of Health.

- **Patients**: We conducted a retrospective review of 941 surgeries for CD (723 adults, 218 children) to identify patients who developed pseudotumor cerebri after surgery for CD and examine the associated clinical features.

- **Results**: Seven children (four males, three females; 3%), but no adults, developed pseudotumor cerebri postoperatively. All underwent resection of an ACTH-secreting adenoma, and postoperative serum cortisol reached a nadir of less than 2 microg/dl. After surgery, all were placed on tapering hydrocortisone replacement therapy. Within 3–52 weeks, all seven patients experienced symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri and had ophthalmological examinations demonstrating papilledema. One patient had diplopia due to a unilateral VIth nerve palsy. Six patients were still on steroid replacement at the onset of symptoms. In three patients, a lumbar puncture demonstrated elevated opening pressure. Four patients were treated successfully with a lumbar puncture, steroids, and/or Diamox. Three patients did not receive treatment, and their symptoms resolved over several months. There was no correlation between…

### Clinical resolution of severely symptomatic pseudotumor cerebri after gastric bypass in an adolescent [^1149n76v]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Pseudotumor cerebri is a disease characterized by increased intracranial pressure, often manifested by headaches and occasionally leading to severe visual impairment or even blindness. Most cases in adolescents, as in adults, are associated with obesity. We report a 16-year-old morbidly obese adolescent girl (body mass index 42.3 kg/m²) with severely symptomatic pseudotumor cerebri who had progressive visual field deficits and elevated intracranial pressure (opening pressure on lumbar puncture of 50 cm H₂O) despite intensive medical management and placement of both ventriculoperitoneal and lumboperitoneal shunts.

Six months after she underwent gastric bypass surgery, she had lost 43% of her excess body weight and had near complete regression of her visual field deficits, along with normalization of her intracranial pressures. This case demonstrates the dramatic reversal of symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri with surgically induced weight loss. Gastric bypass should be considered as a treatment option for adolescents with severe and progressive pseudotumor cerebri.

### Efficacy and safety of GLP-1 and dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists in idiopathic intracranial hypertension: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1141RuRW]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). High credibility.

- **Visual outcomes**: A near-significant trend toward improved visual acuity with GLP-1 RA treatment was observed at 3 months (MD = −0.08; 95% CI: −0.17 to 0.01; p = 0.07; 2 studies; I² = 0%; p for Cochran's Q = 0.45; Figure 3a); however, this trend did not reach statistical significance at the end of follow-up (MD = −0.04; 95% CI: −0.20 to 0.12; 2 studies; p = 0.63; I² = 53%; p for Cochran's Q = 0.14; Figure 3b). No associations were observed between GLP-1 RA treatment and changes in the visual field of the most affected eye at 3 months (SMD = −0.54; 95% CI: −1.41 to 0.34; p = 0.23; 2 studies; I² = 49%; p for Cochran's Q = 0.16; Figure S6) or at the end of follow-up (SMD = −0.54; 95% CI: −1.41 to 0.33; p = 0.23; 2 studies; I² = 48%; p for Cochran's Q = 0.16; Figure S7).

- **RNFL thickness**: Similarly, no associations were observed for changes in RNFL thickness of the most affected eye at 3 months (SMD = 0.33; 95% CI: −0.39 to 1.04; p = 0.37; 2 studies; I² = 32%; p for Cochran's Q = 0.22; Figure S8) or at the end of follow-up (SMD = 0.13; 95% CI: −0.43 to 0.69; p = 0.65; 2 studies; I² = 0%; p for Cochran's Q = 0.52; Figure S9).
