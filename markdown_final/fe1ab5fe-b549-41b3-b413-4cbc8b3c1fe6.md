## Question

What to do for elevated albumin creatinine ratio in random urine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to do for an elevated urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) reported on a random urine sample. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about verifying what "elevated" means and confirming the units and thresholds. Then, I should check for transient factors and pre-analytical issues that can falsely elevate ACR. Next, I'll ensure proper sample collection and plan repeat testing to confirm persistence. After that, I need to review the broader kidney assessment, apply KDIGO GFR-albuminuria risk stratification, and adjust urgency based on comorbidities. Finally, I'll define monitoring frequency, implement guideline-directed therapy if albuminuria is confirmed, and note special populations and laboratory quality considerations before summarizing key takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the definition of "elevated". I should verify the reported ACR value and units (mg/g vs mg/mmol), because diagnostic thresholds are expressed as ACR ≥ 30 mg/g (≥ 3 mg/mmol) for moderately increased albuminuria (A2) and > 300 mg/g (> 30 mg/mmol) for severely increased albuminuria (A3) per KDIGO 2024; some diabetes guidelines use slightly lower thresholds in specific populations, such as 2.0 mg/mmol in Canadian diabetes guidance, so I need to check the clinical context and local lab reference ranges before labeling the result as abnormal [^1175ZuJn] [^114sgUjW] [^112DjRHa].

> Wait, let me verify potential transient or reversible causes before I jump to labeling CKD. I need to check recent vigorous exercise, acute febrile illness or infection, marked hypertension or hyperglycemia, heart failure exacerbation, dehydration or overhydration with very dilute urine, recent high-protein intake, menstrual contamination, and orthostatic proteinuria, since any of these can transiently raise ACR and should be addressed before confirmation; if present, I should correct the factor and recheck ACR after a short interval once resolved [^111Q3X9u] [^115ue12H].

> Next, I should review sample quality. I need to ensure it was a clean-catch midstream specimen and clarify whether it was truly random or a first-morning void; because posture, activity, and diet influence albumin excretion, first-morning voids are preferred for diagnostic confirmation and reduce intra-individual variability, so I should repeat testing with first-morning samples whenever feasible [^114dapSw] [^1175ZuJn] [^115ue12H] [^1124NKxH].

> Hold on, I should verify the confirmation protocol. Given high biological variability in UACR, guidelines converge on repeating testing: collect 2–3 specimens over 3–6 months, using first-morning voids if possible, and confirm persistence when at least 2 of 3 are abnormal; use quantitative laboratory ACR rather than semi-quantitative methods when accessible, because reproducibility matters for diagnosis and monitoring [^1151kJym] [^113oert1] [^1175ZuJn]. Hmm, wait a minute, I also recall within-person variability can approach 40–50%; that reinforces why single random elevations should never trigger definitive therapy without confirmation [^115F1pHd].

> I will now examine the concurrent kidney assessment while awaiting confirmation. I need to check serum creatinine and calculate eGFR with a recommended equation, measure blood pressure (ideally including home BP), perform a urinalysis to screen for hematuria or other abnormalities, and consider further evaluation if findings suggest another renal process; this aligns with KDIGO, VA/DoD CKD guidance, and ESC hypertension recommendations that pair ACR with eGFR for risk prediction and follow-up planning [^112P3426] [^1148ACz5] [^1114ry3p].

> But wait, what if I skipped a step? The outline labels here suggest I may have lost the numbering around staging; let me correct that now by explicitly applying KDIGO risk stratification after confirmation. I should confirm the albuminuria category (A1 < 30 mg/g, A2 30–300 mg/g, A3 > 300 mg/g) and combine with GFR category (G1–G5) to place the patient on the KDIGO "heat map" for prognosis and follow-up intensity; even "high-normal" ACR values below 30 mg/g are associated with elevated risks of hypertension, cardiovascular events, and mortality, so I must consider global cardiovascular risk as I interpret an "almost normal" ACR [^1175ZuJn] [^113JZNhu] [^117DJLUo] [^114kH6RT].

> I need to address modifiable contributors before I confirm diagnosis. That means optimizing BP control toward < 130/80 mmHg when albuminuria is present unless contraindicated, tightening glycemic control in diabetes, treating intercurrent illness (e.g., infection or decompensated heart failure), counseling to avoid strenuous exercise 24 hours before sampling, and ensuring consistent hydration; if a reversible factor was present, I should recheck ACR within 1–2 weeks after resolution rather than waiting months [^1114ry3p] [^111Q3X9u] [^111YSYzJ].

> Let me think about monitoring cadence once albuminuria is confirmed. For diabetes with established kidney involvement, ADA suggests 1–4 checks per year depending on CKD stage and progression risk, while ESC advises at least annual reassessment of creatinine, eGFR, and ACR for hypertension patients with moderate-to-severe CKD; country-specific diabetes guidance also recommends at least annual ACR/eGFR in CKD, with more frequent testing in advanced disease, so I should tailor frequency to the KDIGO risk category and rate of change [^111YSYzJ] [^1114ry3p] [^112mg1fG] [^111YkekA].

> I should confirm when to initiate treatment. If persistent A2/A3 albuminuria is verified, first-line therapy includes ACE inhibitor or ARB titrated to the maximally tolerated dose for patients with hypertension or diabetic kidney disease, adding SGLT2 inhibitors for type 2 diabetes with albuminuria when eGFR is adequate, and considering nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists such as finerenone in persistent albuminuria on background RAAS blockade; all of this is layered on strict BP control, comprehensive cardiovascular risk reduction, and lifestyle measures including dietary sodium moderation, with implementation calibrated to eGFR and albuminuria category [^111YSYzJ] [^1175ZuJn].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations that require deviations from standard interpretation. In pregnancy, ACR and protein-to-creatinine ratio are used variably, and many programs still confirm significant proteinuria with timed collections because spot tests have heterogeneous diagnostic accuracy; in obesity, ACR tends to underestimate true 24-hour albuminuria so I may need alternative approaches or adjusted interpretation; conversely, in low muscle mass (elderly, frail, amputees), ACR may overestimate albuminuria due to low urinary creatinine, suggesting cautious interpretation or use of timed collections or estimated AER; in renal transplant recipients, lower sex-specific UACR cutoffs around 21 mg/g (men) and 24 mg/g (women) may be more sensitive for microalbuminuria detection [^112kZRzm] [^11664w8v] [^113rGDyi] [^112Fb8uy].

> I need to ensure laboratory method and quality safeguards are in place. I should use quantitative immunoassay-based albumin measurements with creatinine to calculate ACR, confirm any semiquantitative positives with a lab method, and prefer first-morning samples; labs should participate in external quality assessment programs for albumin and creatinine, and I should be aware that processing delays and storage conditions can affect ACR if not stabilized, which argues for standardized handling when repeating tests [^114dapSw] [^1175ZuJn] [^117JSXLg] [^116ZSdyP].

> Let me reconsider education and documentation so nothing is missed. I should document dates, values, units, sample timing, concurrent conditions, and medications for every specimen; I also need to provide clear written instructions for first-morning clean-catch collection, hydration guidance, avoidance of intense exercise beforehand, and the need for confirmatory testing to prevent overdiagnosis and overtreatment, with counseling on kidney and cardiovascular implications and lifestyle measures that reduce albuminuria [^1124NKxH] [^115ue12H].

> Key takeaway, and I should double-check this: an isolated elevated ACR in a random urine sample should not trigger definitive treatment; standard of care is to repeat with first-morning voids and confirm persistence on at least 2 of 3 samples over 3–6 months, interpret within KDIGO GFR-albuminuria risk, and then apply guideline-directed therapy and monitoring if confirmed [^1151kJym] [^113oert1] [^1175ZuJn].

For an elevated albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) in a random urine sample, confirm with two additional first-morning ACRs [^1175ZuJn] over 3–6 months [^111Q3X9u] to account for biological variability and transient causes. If confirmed, evaluate for CKD and cardiovascular risk by assessing eGFR [^112P3426], blood pressure, and metabolic risk factors [^1148ACz5] [^1114ry3p]. Manage with ACE inhibitors or ARBs [^1175ZuJn] [^1148ACz5], optimize blood pressure and glycemic control [^111YSYzJ] [^1114ry3p], and address lifestyle factors; monitor ACR and eGFR at least annually [^111YSYzJ], or every 3–6 months if CKD is advanced or progressing [^112mg1fG].

---

## Confirmation of elevated ACR

For confirmation of elevated ACR, repeat testing [^1151kJym] with two additional first-morning urine samples [^114dapSw] over 3–6 months [^113oert1] is recommended to reduce variability and rule out transient elevations. Before repeating, exclude **transient causes** such as recent exercise, fever, infection, uncontrolled hypertension, or hyperglycemia [^113oert1].

---

## Clinical evaluation and risk assessment

CKD evaluation should include assessing **eGFR** [^112P3426] and repeating **ACR** to stage CKD and guide management [^1148ACz5]. In parallel, assess **cardiovascular risk** [^1114ry3p] by evaluating blood pressure, lipid profile, and glycemic control, as elevated ACR increases cardiovascular risk [^117DJLUo].

---

## Management strategies

### Pharmacological interventions

- **ACE inhibitors/ARBs**: Initiate and titrate to reduce albuminuria and slow CKD progression [^1175ZuJn] [^1148ACz5].

- **Blood pressure control**: Target < 130/80 mmHg in CKD or diabetes [^1114ry3p] [^111YSYzJ].

- **Glycemic control**: Optimize HbA1c in diabetes to reduce albuminuria [^111YSYzJ].

---

### Lifestyle modifications

- **Dietary changes**: Reduce sodium and protein intake as appropriate [^1175ZuJn].

- **Weight management**: Achieve healthy BMI [^1175ZuJn].

- **Smoking cessation**: Strongly recommended [^1114ry3p].

- **Physical activity**: Regular exercise to improve cardiovascular and renal outcomes [^1114ry3p].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Undertake **regular monitoring** of ACR and eGFR at least annually [^111YSYzJ], increasing to every 3–6 months if CKD is advanced or progressing [^112mg1fG]. Adjust management continuously by modifying therapy based on trends in **ACR**, **eGFR**, and cardiovascular risk factors.

---

## Indications for specialist referral

Pursue a **nephrology referral** if ACR ≥ 300 mg/g, there is rapid CKD progression, or the etiology is uncertain; consider a **cardiology referral** if significant cardiovascular risk or disease is present [^1175ZuJn].

---

## Patient education and counseling

Provide **education** on the significance of elevated ACR and the importance of adherence to therapy and lifestyle changes, and encourage **self-monitoring** with home blood pressure monitoring and regular follow-up [^111YSYzJ].

---

- **Assessment of albuminuria status and renal function**: Screening for increased urinary albumin excretion can be performed by measuring the albumin-to-creatinine ratio in a random spot collection; 24-hour or timed collections are more burdensome and add little to prediction or accuracy. Measurement of a spot urine for albumin only, whether by immunoassay or dipstick test specific for microalbumin, without simultaneously measuring urine creatinine, is somewhat less expensive but susceptible to false-negative and false-positive determinations as a result of variation in urine concentration due to hydration and other factors.

Abnormalities of albumin excretion and the linkage between the albumin-to-creatinine ratio and 24-hour albumin excretion are defined in Table 11. Because of variability in urinary albumin excretion, two of three specimens collected within a 3- to 6-month period should be abnormal before considering a patient to have developed increased urinary albumin excretion or had a progression in albuminuria. Exercise within 24 hours, infection, fever, congestive heart failure, marked hyperglycemia, and marked hypertension may elevate urinary albumin excretion over baseline values.

Table 11: Definitions of abnormalities in albumin excretion

The presence of abnormal urine albumin excretion, in addition to the level of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), may be used to stage chronic kidney disease (CKD). The National Kidney Foundation classification, detailed in Table 12, is primarily based on GFR levels and therefore differs from other systems where staging is primarily based on urinary albumin excretion. Studies have found decreased GFR in the context of these classification systems.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic kidney disease, specifically in evaluating albuminuria, the KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend using more accurate methods when albuminuria is detected via less accurate methods:

- **Confirm reagent strip positive albuminuria and/or proteinuria**: By quantitative laboratory measurement and express as a ratio to urine creatinine wherever possible. Quantify the albumin-to-creatinine ratio or protein-to-creatinine ratio if initial semiquantitative tests are positive.

- **Confirm albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g (≥ 3 mg/mmol)**: On a random untimed urine sample with a subsequent first morning void in the urine sample.

### Microalbumin measurement alone or calculation of the albumin/creatinine ratio for the screening of hypertension patients [^116WWChH]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Spot urine sampling seems to be a reliable screening method for the detection of microalbuminuria in hypertensive patients. It remains unclear whether microalbumin measurement alone or the calculation of the albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) is more reliable for the detection of microalbuminuria in non-selected hypertensive patients.

- **Methods**: Following collection of a spot, midstream urine sample, urine was collected for 24 hours for the measurement of microalbumin in 264 hypertensive patients. We compared microalbumin concentration in the spot urine with microalbumin measured in the 24-hour urine sample and examined the utility of the ACR in evaluating microalbuminuria in hypertensive patients. Pathologic microalbuminuria was assumed when the microalbumin concentration exceeded 30 mg/l in the 24-hour urine sample. Diagnostic performance is expressed in terms of specificity, sensitivity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV), and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC).

- **Results**: A total of 47 samples (17.8%) showed pathologic microalbuminuria in the 24-hour urine sample. The diagnostic performance expressed as AUC was 0.94 (95% CI 0.90–0.98) for microalbumin measurement alone and 0.94 (95% CI 0.89–0.97) for ACR. The PPV and NPV were 44.2 and 97.9% for microalbumin measurement alone. ACR revealed a PPV of 29.3% and a NPV of 96.2% for males and 42.9 and 98% for females if a cut-off value of 2.5 mg/mmol for males and 4.0 mg/mmol for females was used.

- **Conclusions**: The ACR did not provide any advantage compared with microalbumin measurement alone.

### A comparison of the utility of the urine dipstick and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio for predicting microalbuminuria in patients with non-diabetic lifestyle-related diseases - a comparison with diabetes [^112cD1E9]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Low credibility.

The study investigated the correlation between urine dipstick and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio in predicting microalbuminuria among patients with lifestyle-related diseases, comparing non-diabetic and diabetic individuals. The median age was 70.8 years for non-diabetic and 68.9 years for diabetic patients, and a higher BMI was observed in diabetic patients compared to their non-diabetic counterparts. Despite showing a significant positive correlation between BMI and uACR, as well as BMI and uPCR in non-diabetic patients, the study found no such correlations in diabetic patients.

Abdominal circumference, which was higher in diabetic patients, showed a significant positive correlation with both uPCR and uACR in non-diabetic men. Hypertensive non-diabetic patients had higher uACR and uPCR levels, an observation that did not extend to diabetic patients. Analysis by G stage indicated significant increases in uACR and uPCR levels in G3a and G3b among diabetic patients, unlike their non-diabetic counterparts. Furthermore, both uACR and uPCR levels rose significantly with increased urinary protein qualitative findings across both diabetic and non-diabetic patients.

- **Microalbuminuria**: Defined by uACR (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio) of 30–299 mg/gCr, observed at least twice over three measurements.

This analysis highlights the utility of urine dipstick and uPCR in assessing kidney function deterioration, offering key insights into differences between diabetic and non-diabetic populations.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^114dapSw]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic kidney disease, particularly in the evaluation of albuminuria, the KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend using the following measurements. These should preferably be conducted on a midstream sample of the first morning void for initial testing of albuminuria, in descending order of preference:

- **Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio**: This is the preferred method for albuminuria testing.
- **Reagent strip urinalysis for albumin and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio with automated reading**: This method can be considered following the preferred measurement.

### Conversion of urine protein-creatinine ratio or urine dipstick protein to urine albumin-creatinine ratio for use in chronic kidney disease screening and prognosis: An individual participant-based meta-analysis [^113ETzN7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Although measuring albuminuria is the preferred method for defining and staging chronic kidney disease (CKD), total urine protein or dipstick protein is often measured instead.

- **Objective**: To develop equations for converting urine protein-creatinine ratio (PCR) and dipstick protein to urine albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) and to test their diagnostic accuracy in CKD screening and staging.

- **Design**: Individual participant-based meta-analysis.

- **Setting**: 12 research and 21 clinical cohorts.

- **Participants**: 919,383 adults with same-day measures of ACR and PCR or dipstick protein.

- **Measurements**: Equations to convert urine PCR and dipstick protein to ACR were developed and tested for purposes of CKD screening (ACR ≥ 30 mg/g) and staging (stage A2: ACR of 30 to 299 mg/g; stage A3: ACR ≥ 300 mg/g).

- **Results**: Median ACR was 14 mg/g (25th to 75th percentile of cohorts, 5 to 25 mg/g). The association between PCR and ACR was inconsistent for PCR values less than 50 mg/g. For higher PCR values, the PCR conversion equations demonstrated moderate sensitivity (91%, 75%, and 87%) and specificity (87%, 89%, and 98%) for screening (ACR > 30 mg/g) and classification into stages A2 and A3, respectively. Urine dipstick categories of trace or greater, trace to +, and ++ for screening for ACR values greater than 30 mg/g and classification into stages A2 and A3, respectively, had moderate sensitivity (62%, 36%, and 78%) and high specificity (88%, 88%, and 98%).

For individual risk prediction, the estimated 2-year 4-variable kidney failure risk equation using predicted ACR from PCR had discrimination capabilities consistent with the study objectives.

### Detection and measurement of urinary protein [^116qeBca]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

The measurement of urine total protein and albumin is central to the diagnosis and management of subjects with kidney disease and in assessing cardiovascular risk. Accurate assessment is vital to enable detection and management of the patient with proteinuria.

Recent studies suggest that the spot urine protein test is an acceptable alternative to 24-hour urine collections for screening to exclude significant proteinuria (> 1 g/day). However, data are lacking for the quantification of proteinuria and in assessing response to therapy. For albuminuria, while 24-hour urinary albumin excretion remains the gold standard, spot urine samples are appropriate for screening.

The optimal technique for the laboratory determination of urinary albumin has been questioned, with the high-performance liquid chromatography-based method demonstrating significantly more albumin in the urine. Population-based studies have found dramatic increases in the prevalence of microalbuminuria with the new high-performance liquid chromatography assay. Whether this extra immunounreactive albumin detected by high-performance liquid chromatography is clinically important remains to be established.

Twenty-four-hour urine collection remains the gold standard for the accurate determination of both total urinary protein and albumin. Spot urine samples can be used for screening patients for albuminuria and proteinuria. The optimal method for measuring urinary albumin concentration remains to be established.

### Optimization of screening strategy for chronic kidney disease by urine test strips using the albumin-creatinine read-out [^114FXSq1]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Summary of agreement**: The agreement between the albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) and protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) determined by test strip analysis, as compared to the quantitative lab test in the validation cohort, is assessed in this study.

Abbreviations: ACR: albumin-to-creatinine ratio; PPV: positive predictive value; NPV: negative predictive value; LR+: positive likelihood ratio; LR-: negative likelihood ratio; PCR: protein-to-creatinine ratio.

Of note, only in a minority of patient samples (3.3% of the cohort), quantitative albumin measurement was initially requested by the physician, while 18.3% of the samples showed an ACR of > 30 mg/g creatinine. These data reflect a known underdiagnosis of albuminuria and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

### Association between urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio within normal range and hypertension among adults in the United States: Data from the NHANES 2009–2018 [^116USfFg]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Low credibility.

- **Outcome ascertainment**: The main outcome variable, blood pressure (BP), was measured using a mercury sphygmomanometer by trained personnel following standardized protocols. After a 5-minute quiet rest in the seated position, three BP readings were taken consecutively, and the participant's maximum inflation level was determined. If the blood pressure measurement was interrupted or incomplete, a fourth measurement could be taken.

	- All systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements were taken at the Mobile Examination Center. In this study, we calculated the average of the systolic and diastolic BP readings for further analyses. If only one BP reading was available, it was used as the final record. Hypertension was defined as a mean SBP ≥ 130 mmHg, a mean DBP ≥ 80 mmHg, taking hypertension medication, or having been informed of a hypertension diagnosis by a physician or health professional.

### Unexpected random urinary protein:creatinine ratio results-limitations of the pyrocatechol violet-dye method [^114dgy6A]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

These results helped to explain both our clinical observations that some women with elevated random urinary PrCr results had a normal pregnancy outcome, as well as the findings of a previous report of unexplained proteinuria of 0.38 g/d associated with high water intake (and low 24-hour urinary creatinine concentration of 2.9 mM) in 63 people in a community screening study. In that published study, the Vitros 950 autoanalyser was used to measure protein, and when 56 of the subjects agreed to decrease their water intake, urine protein significantly decreased (to 0.16 g/d), associated with an increase in urinary creatinine concentration to 6.9 mM.

The manufacturer of the Vitros urine protein assay (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Rochester, NY) has documented that when urinary SG is ≤ 1.010, measurement of 24-hour urine protein excretion may be falsely elevated as a limitation of the assay. We found, however, that urine creatinine < 3 mM was more effective than urine SG ≤ 1.010 for identifying dilute samples in which random urinary PrCr was overestimated; the inaccuracy of urine dipstick SG compared to other measures of urine concentration is well documented, whereas the use of creatinine to correct for variability in urine concentration is the premise of PrCr assessment. The overestimation is attributed to the fact that the accuracy of pyrocatechol violet molybdate dye-binding relies on the ionic strength of the urine. Lower ionic strength (as seen in dilute urine) may result in more dye-binding and higher measured protein concentrations.

### Accuracy of the urinary albumin to creatinine ratio as a predictor of albuminuria in adults with sickle cell disease [^114KZUW1]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

To test the usefulness of a random urine specimen albumin to creatinine ratio (A/C) in predicting 12-hour urinary albumin excretion (12UA) in patients with sickle cell disease, researchers carried out a study involving 72 patients with the condition.

- **Methods**: 12UA and A/C were measured in nocturnal urine collections and random morning urine samples, respectively.

- **Results**: The correlation of A/C values with 12UA values did not support the use of random urine specimens for predicting urinary albumin excretion (UAE) in these patients. However, A/C values ≥ 0.45 and < 0.45 were indicative of raised and normal UAE, respectively. The test's sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 100.0%, 87.2%, and 91.7%, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: This method cannot be recommended for predicting 12UA in patients with sickle cell disease. However, it is useful for selecting patients who should collect 12-hour urine samples for the estimation of UAE.

### Chronic kidney disease in diabetes: A clinical practice guideline [^111YkekA]. Canadian Journal of Diabetes (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for diabetic nephropathy, specifically in laboratory follow-up, the DC 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining eGFR and spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio assessments at least annually in patients with diabetes and CKD, with more frequent testing every 3–6 months when eGFR is below 20 mg/mmol.

### A dipstick protein and specific gravity algorithm accurately predicts pathological proteinuria [^114JuWAi]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The proper strategy to screen for early chronic kidney disease is debatable, but protein-creatinine ratio from a random urine sample (UPC) is commonly used. The purpose is to determine whether dipstick data effectively identify patients with increased UPC ratios. Because urine concentration affects proteinuria interpretation, we hypothesized that dipstick protein (DSP) and specific gravity (SG) are sufficient for screening.

- **Methods**: A hospital laboratory database was searched for urine samples simultaneously assayed for UPC ratio, DSP, and SG (n = 2,098). A random 70% of the cohort was used to generate a development model, which was validated in the remaining 30%. Samples were stratified according to DSP and SG values. A DSP versus SG matrix was created, and each sample was allocated to a discrete DSP-SG category. Proportions of samples with overt (UPC ratio ≥ 500 mg/g) and nephrotic-range proteinuria (UPC ratio ≥ 3,000 mg/g) were calculated for all 40 cells.

- **Results**: Optimum correlations between DSP-SG cells and UPC ratios were determined for the development model, yielding 97.0% negative predictive value (NPV) for a UPC ratio of 500 mg/g or less and 97.5% positive predictive value (PPV) for a UPC ratio of 500 mg/g or greater. NPV for a UPC ratio of 3,000 mg/g or less was 99.7%. Application of the model to the validation sample showed a 96.5% NPV for a UPC ratio of 500 mg/g or less, 99.4% PPV for a UPC ratio of 500 mg/g or greater, and 99.0% NPV for a UPC ratio of 3,000 mg/g or less.

- **Conclusion**: DSP and SG values effectively identify patients requiring further investigation for proteinuria.

### Albumin-to-creatinine ratio underestimates true 24-hour albuminuria in obesity: Clinical relevance for vascular risk stratification [^11664w8v]. Diabetes/metabolism research and reviews (2025). Low credibility.

This study investigates the accuracy of the albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) in estimating true 24-hour albuminuria among obese patients. The research highlights the clinical relevance for vascular risk stratification, suggesting that the standard ACR might not accurately reflect these patients' vascular health risks. The findings call for a reevaluation of current diagnostic guidelines for albuminuria in populations with obesity, emphasizing the need for improved risk assessment tools tailored to this demographic.

### Diagnostic accuracy of spot urinary protein and albumin to creatinine ratios for detection of significant proteinuria or adverse pregnancy outcome in patients with suspected pre-eclampsia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112kZRzm]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Figure 2 shows a summary of the quality assessment of the included studies. We found good compliance with appropriate population spectrum, adequately described selection criteria, appropriate reference standards, and adequate description of index and reference standards. Blinding of the assessors of the outcome measure to the results of the albumin to creatinine ratio or protein to creatinine ratio was poorly reported in 3 out of 20 studies. No studies reported on the use of any treatment between the albumin to creatinine ratio or protein to creatinine ratio and delivery, or whether the results of the tests were used in determining patients' management.

Verification bias was minimized, as more than 90% of eligible women progressed to the reference standard in 18 out of 20 studies. Five studies used less than 80% of included women in the final analysis, due to reasons such as exclusion after trial entry, lack of verification with reference standard, and loss to follow-up. In 379 cases (13%), this was due to incomplete 24-hour urine collection.

### How to measure proteinuria [^114Riz3B]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

To examine the use of urine total protein compared with albumin measurements to assess and monitor patients with chronic kidney disease, recent findings indicate that urine albumin or total protein-to-creatinine ratio measurements on a single-voided specimen provide a convenient and reliable alternative to 24-hour urine measurements. The majority of studies that inform renoprotective strategies have relied upon urine total protein measurements. Urine albumin measurements are required to detect microalbuminuria. The proportion of urinary protein composed of albumin is variable and may depend on the underlying renal disease.

Urine protein-to-creatinine measurements should continue to be used for the assessment and monitoring of patients with nondiabetic chronic kidney disease. Urine albumin-to-creatinine measurements should be reserved for detecting microalbuminuria and monitoring patients with diabetic nephropathy. Further research is required to investigate the relationship between urine total protein and albumin in different renal diseases and to compare the prognostic significance of urine total protein with that of albumin.

### Screening, identifying, and treating chronic kidney disease: why, who, when, how, and what [^1148AzFB]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

The former gold standard for detection and quantification of albuminuria is a 24-hour urine collection, which is cumbersome and subject to over- and under-collection. Instead, measuring a spot uACR correlates well with the 24-hour excretion and is currently recommended for routine practice. Urinary albumin concentration can be increased by physical activity, fever, stress, metabolic perturbations, and other conditions, making first-morning samples optimal. Given the variability in albumin excretion, confirming elevated uACR with repeat testing should be emphasized. The uACR is in the process of being standardized.

- **Semi-quantitative approaches**: While quantitative tests for albuminuria are standard, semi-quantitative approaches have been studied because they may reduce costs, expand access to clinics without laboratory services, and are point-of-care, which may allow for immediate identification for clinical counseling and treatment decisions. When studied, semi-quantitative tests have shown reasonable sensitivity, but do not match the quantitative uACR. Given their potential benefits for expansion of access, semi-quantitative is a reasonable screening test in the absence of quantitative uACR availability. Semiquantitative or qualitative screening tests should be positive in more than 85% of individuals with A2 or moderately increased albuminuria to be useful for patient screening. A recent international CKD screening review addressed differing approaches to screening versus case finding in low-income, middle-income, and high-income countries, considering less expensive urine protein dipstick methods.

### The urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio: Assessment of its performance in the renal transplant recipient population [^112Fb8uy]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Microalbuminuria predicts graft loss and death in the renal transplant population. Measurement of the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) is recommended for its detection. There is uncertainty regarding the optimal UACR cutoff values. Few studies have examined the accuracy of UACR in the general population, and none have been conducted in renal transplant recipients. The aim of this study is to determine the performance of UACR in the renal transplant population.

- **Design, setting, participants & measurements**: Renal transplant recipients with a daily urinary albumin excretion rate of up to 300 mg accurately carried out a 24-hour urine collection and provided a morning urine sample for the measurement of albuminuria and UACR. The performance measures of UACR for the detection of microalbuminuria (30 to 300 mg/d) were calculated using different cutoffs.

- **Results**: Median albuminuria was 23 mg/d, and median UACR was 17 mg/g. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was 0.94 in men and 0.98 in women. The optimal cutoff was 21 mg/g in men and 24 mg/g in women. In men, the 30-, 17-, and 21-mg/g cutoffs provided a sensitivity of 0.79, 0.89, and 0.87, respectively. In women, the 30-, 25-, and 24-mg/g cutoffs provided a sensitivity of 0.90, 0.97, and 1.0, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: These data show that in the renal transplant population, lower gender-specific cutoffs should be used for the detection of microalbuminuria than the recommended 30-mg/g cutoff. These data support the need for a reappraisal of the 30-mg/g cutoff for the detection of microalbuminuria.

### Diagnostic accuracy of spot urinary protein and albumin to creatinine ratios for detection of significant proteinuria or adverse pregnancy outcome in patients with suspected pre-eclampsia: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^1172ioxm]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of two "spot urine" tests for significant proteinuria or adverse pregnancy outcome in pregnant women with suspected pre-eclampsia.

- **Design**: Systematic review and meta-analysis.

- **Data sources**: Searches of electronic databases from 1980 to January 2011, reference list checking, hand searching of journals, and contact with experts.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Diagnostic studies, in pregnant women with hypertension, that compared the urinary spot protein to creatinine ratio or albumin to creatinine ratio with urinary protein excretion over 24 hours or adverse pregnancy outcome. Study characteristics, design, and methodological and reporting quality were objectively assessed.

- **Data extraction**: Study results relating to diagnostic accuracy were extracted and synthesized using multivariate random effects meta-analysis methods.

- **Results**: Twenty studies, testing 2,978 women (pregnancies), were included. Thirteen studies examining the protein to creatinine ratio for the detection of significant proteinuria were included in the multivariate analysis. Threshold values for the protein to creatinine ratio ranged between 0.13 and 0.5, with estimates of sensitivity ranging from 0.65 to 0.89 and estimates of specificity from 0.63 to 0.87. The area under the summary receiver operating characteristics curve was 0.69. On average, across all studies, the optimum threshold (that optimizes sensitivity and specificity combined) seems to be between 0.30 and 0.35 inclusive. However, no threshold provided a summary estimate above 80% for both sensitivity and specificity.

### Developments in albuminuria testing: A key biomarker for detection, prognosis and surveillance of kidney and cardiovascular disease-a practical update for clinicians [^115ue12H]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

A random spot urine sample, collected at any time of the day, is a convenient and minimally burdensome option for clinical practice. However, its results are subject to variability due to factors such as posture, physical activity, and dietary protein intake. A first-morning void, collected immediately upon waking, minimizes variability from these factors, making it the preferred method for diagnosing and monitoring albuminuria. This method has a strong correlation with 24-hour albumin excretion and exhibits low intraindividual variability. However, implementation may be challenging, as nephrology offices must provide containers and instructions for home collection. As a practical alternative, early-morning voids, collected shortly after waking, are acceptable, though they exhibit slightly greater variability.

Urinary albumin concentration can be measured from these samples; however, it varies within individuals due to fluctuations in urine concentration and dilution over time. Since creatinine is excreted at a relatively constant rate per unit of time, it serves as a normalizing factor, allowing adjustments for urine tonicity and reducing intraindividual variability. Albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) measurement eliminates the need for timed collections, including 24-hour samples, making ACR a practical alternative for assessing urinary albumin excretion.

### Diagnostic accuracy of spot urinary protein and albumin to creatinine ratios for detection of significant proteinuria or adverse pregnancy outcome in patients with suspected pre-eclampsia: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^117W8iAV]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

The main findings of our systematic review were that, on average across all studies, the optimum threshold (to maximize sensitivity and specificity) for protein to creatinine ratio to detect significant proteinuria is between 0.30 and 0.35, relating to sensitivity and specificity values above 75%. However, no threshold gave a summary estimate above 80% for both sensitivity and specificity, and considerable heterogeneity existed in diagnostic accuracy across studies at most thresholds. Thus, although the protein to creatinine ratio shows promising diagnostic value, how it should be implemented in clinical practice is unclear from the evidence.

For albumin to creatinine ratio, meta-analysis was not possible; the results are based on single studies and show that albumin to creatinine ratio shows potential to be a good diagnostic test. No studies assessed protein to creatinine ratio to predict adverse pregnancy outcome, and only one study assessed this for albumin to creatinine ratio, so insufficient evidence exists for us to comment on the use of these tests in this context.

The finding of "significant proteinuria" is key to the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia, stratification of perinatal risk, and hence the management of pregnant women with hypertension. Women with significant proteinuria are at increased risk of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Accurate diagnosis and thus diagnostic tests are important to limit inappropriate intervention in the form of further testing or treatment. In the United Kingdom, the standard testing is for women to have a 24-hour urine collection.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2024 [^113oert1]. Diabetes Care (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for diabetic nephropathy, especially in pediatric patients, the ADA 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio at the time of diagnosis and annually thereafter.

### Value of urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio as a predictor of type 2 diabetes in pre-diabetic individuals [^115ibogz]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

With the explosive growth of incident diabetes, type 2 diabetes has become a major international public health challenge. Moreover, an increasing number of individuals have evidence of a pre-diabetic state, which indicates significant future risk of developing diabetes. Fortunately, accumulating evidence suggests that type 2 diabetes can be delayed or prevented in individuals with pre-diabetes by either lifestyle modification or medication. However, because prevention is a fundamental public health goal, there is clearly a great need for effective strategies to identify high-risk individuals. Unfortunately, the best available risk stratification method is an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which is both costly and difficult to perform in a clinical setting.

The albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) in a single untimed urinary specimen is a reflection of urinary albumin excretion and is increasingly being accepted as a marker that predicts several important health outcomes, including hypertension, kidney failure, cardiovascular events, and mortality. These associations have been observed throughout the biological range, even at levels far below those previously considered to be pathological, such as microalbuminuria.

The ACR is also closely linked to cardiometabolic risk factors, vascular disease, and insulin resistance and might therefore play a clinically important role in predicting future onset of diabetes. Observational studies have shown an association between ACR and other markers of urinary albumin excretion and incident diabetes.

### Atherogenic lipids and vascular complications in a selected diabetic population with normal urinary albumin/creatinine ratios [^112NQXyB]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that at different urinary albumin/creatinine ratios within the normal ranges, diabetics have a low but similar prevalence of metabolic and microvascular disease.

- **Methods**: The study sample consisted of normotensive diabetics not taking any medications known to affect blood pressure and lipids. The data were collected from the Diabetes Register. The diabetics were subgrouped according to the urinary albumin/creatinine ratios. Microalbuminuria (MA) is defined as present if the albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) is more than 2 mg/mmol.

- **Results**: MA was present in 16% of the 152 diabetics. Total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, and triglycerides were significantly high in diabetics with an ACR ≥ 1 < 2 compared with < 1. The prevalence rates for retinopathy and neuropathy in the MA group were also significantly high. However, a large number of diabetics without MA had established complications (37% retinopathy, 40% neuropathy, and 16% peripheral vascular disease). Because these results were based on single early morning urine samples, we reviewed their MA in the past year. After exclusion of regressed and progressed groups, the complications rate remained the same.

- **Conclusion**: The high prevalence of metabolic and vascular complications seen even in the absence of MA indicates a need for early intervention. Diabetics should not wait until cardiovascular disease risk scores rise to receive preventive treatment.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, particularly in pediatric patients, the KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining a first morning urine sample for initial testing of albuminuria and proteinuria. The preferred methods, in descending order of preference, are:

- **Urine protein-to-creatinine ratio and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio**: These should be prioritized for accuracy.

- **Reagent strip urinalysis for total protein and for albumin with automated reading**: Offers a reliable preliminary assessment.

- **Reagent strip urinalysis for total protein and for albumin with manual reading**: Although less preferred, this method remains viable.

### Measuring albuminuria or proteinuria: Does one answer fit all [^113bgsG9]. Kidney International (2023). High credibility.

Measurement of proteinuria is critical for diagnosing and monitoring kidney disease. A variety of measures are available to clinicians and can identify all urinary proteins (proteinuria) or urine albumin alone (albuminuria). Proteinuria and albuminuria can be measured in either a random urine sample or a timed urine collection (often over 24 hours). Although an international guideline advocates the use of the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio for most purposes, this measure is not universally available worldwide and historically has been more costly than alternatives. In addition, there may be important differences in accuracy between the albumin-to-creatinine ratio and others based on the magnitude of albuminuria, sex, and certain clinical contexts.

In this mini-review, we review recommendations from international guidelines and discuss specific contexts where the optimal measure of proteinuria is unclear and, in some situations, controversial. We discuss the evidence supporting recommendations for the choice of measure, including the clinical settings of glomerulonephritis, transplantation, and pregnancy. We also discuss how patient sex and cost may impact this decision.

### Association of urine albumin to creatinine ratio with cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^117DJLUo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Albuminuria is recognized as a reliable indicator of systemic endothelial dysfunction and is considered a sensitive prognostic marker for assessing an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) is the recommended method for detecting albuminuria. The American Diabetes Association recommends that patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) undergo a UACR test at least annually to identify those at high risk of experiencing severe outcomes. Previous studies have shown that patients with T2DM and a higher UACR are at an increased risk of mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), heart failure, and peripheral neuropathy. Our study had similar findings. After adjusting for several potential confounding factors, for each 1 SD increase in ln (100 × UACR), participants had a 29% higher risk of developing MACEs and a 38% higher total mortality risk.

Previous studies have demonstrated a positive association between microalbuminuria (UACR, 30–300 mg/g) or macroalbuminuria (UACR > 300 mg/g) and an elevated risk of total mortality and cardiovascular disease. Our study further revealed that patients with T2DM had an increased risk of total mortality and MACEs even when they exhibited a high normal UACR. We categorized ln (100 × UACR) into three equal tertiles: the tertile ranges of ln (100 × UACR) were low (4.27–6.73 mg/g), middle (6.73–7.88 mg/g), and high (7.88–14.07 mg/g), and the corresponding UACRs were low (0.72–8.33), middle (8.33–26.52), and high (26.52–12,908.16), respectively. The middle ln (100 × UACR) value was within the normal albuminuria range (UACR < 30 mg/g). Compared to those with low ln (100 × UACR), participants with T2DM with a mid-level of ln (100 × UACR) were at a higher risk.

### Elevated urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio increases the risk of new-onset heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes [^114kH6RT]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). High credibility.

The study investigated the impact of elevated urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) on the risk of developing new-onset heart failure (HF) in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

- **Study cohort**: A total of 1820 T2D patients participated in the 5th physical examination, which included urine albumin and creatinine tests; 8827 patients participated in the 6th physical examination, which also included these tests. After excluding 167 patients with incomplete urine albumin and creatinine data and 188 patients with a history of HF before the physical examination, 9642 patients were included in the study. Subsequently, 9287 patients with T2D were finally included in the statistical analysis (see Fig. 1).

- **Baseline characteristics**: The observed patients' baseline age was 61.10 ± 9.97 years and included 6815 males (73.37%) and 2472 females (26.63%). The systolic blood pressure (SBP) averaged 146.70 ± 20.69 mmHg, HbA1c was 7.60 ± 1.65% (57.36 ± 18.21 mmol/mol), and the median uACR was 1.67 (0.80, 4.61) mg/mmol. In the overall population, 65.9% had uACR in the normal range (n = 6120), while 28.1% had microalbuminuria and 6.0% had macroalbuminuria. Patients with microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria exhibited higher SBP, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides, HbA1c, BMI, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), heart rate, hypertension prevalence, and HF prevalence, as well as a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) level.

These findings underscore the importance of monitoring uACR levels in T2D patients to predict the risk of new-onset heart failure.

### U-shaped association between central body fat and the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio and microalbuminuria [^111EhnTe]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

The prevalence of obese and overweight patients has increased dramatically worldwide. Both are common risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD), as indicated by a diminished estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or microalbuminuria. This study aimed to investigate whether anthropometric parameters — waist circumference (WC), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), and body mass index (BMI) — are associated with renal function in a population-based study of Caucasian subjects.

- **Methods**: Data from 3,749 subjects (1,825 women) aged 20 to 81 years from the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) were analysed. Renal indices, including the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR), microalbuminuria, eGFR, and CKD, were studied. Parameters of anthropometry (WC, WHtR, and BMI) were categorised into sex-specific quintiles.

- **Results**: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) models, adjusting for age, sex, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, revealed that a high and low WC or WHtR and low BMI were independently related to a higher uACR. Logistic regression models confirmed these results with respect to uACR and showed that subjects with a high or low WC or a high WHtR had increased odds of microalbuminuria. The ANOVA models revealed no relations of the investigated anthropometric parameters with eGFR. However, subjects with high values for these parameters had increased odds of CKD.

- **Conclusions**: Our results demonstrate U-shaped associations between markers of central fat distribution and uACR or microalbuminuria in the general population, suggesting that both obese and very thin subjects are at risk.

### Low muscular mass and overestimation of microalbuminuria by urinary albumin/creatinine ratio [^113rGDyi]. Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Microalbuminuria is a mild urinary albumin elevation and is associated with cardiovascular disease. The urinary albumin/creatinine ratio is recommended for microalbuminuria assessment because it reflects urinary albumin excretion. Muscular mass could affect this ratio since urinary creatinine reflects muscular mass. The study investigated the high albumin/creatinine ratio attributed to low urinary creatinine without microalbuminuria.

The Gubbio Population Study for ages 45 to 64 collected data on weight, skinfold, urinary albumin, urinary creatinine, and coronary heart disease. Weight and skinfold thickness were used to calculate fat and nonfat mass, with urinary creatinine serving as a marker of muscular mass. Microalbuminuria was defined as a urinary albumin of 20 to 199 microg/min, and a high albumin/creatinine ratio was defined as a ratio of 17 to 250 microg/mg in men and of 25 to 355 microg/mg in women. Persons with macroalbuminuria (urinary albumin ≥ 200 microg/min) were excluded to focus analyses on microalbuminuria. Coronary heart disease was defined by ECG and questionnaire.

The target cohort consisted of 1,623 men and women, ages 45 to 64. The prevalence was 8.5% for a high albumin/creatinine ratio (n = 138), 4.3% for microalbuminuria (n = 69), 5.2% for a high albumin/creatinine ratio without microalbuminuria (n = 85), and 1.0% for a nonhigh albumin/creatinine ratio with microalbuminuria (n = 16). A high albumin/creatinine ratio without microalbuminuria was inversely associated with nonfat mass and urinary creatinine (P < 0.04). Compared with persons with a nonhigh albumin/creatinine ratio, coronary…

### Association between urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio within normal range and hypertension among adults in the United States: Data from the NHANES 2009–2018 [^115C259J]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Recently, it was suggested that the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR), even within the normal range, can be associated with hypertension. However, only a few studies have examined this association. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the association between normal range uACR and the prevalence of hypertension.

- **Methods**: The research utilized data from the 2009 to 2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which included 14,919 participants. We defined the uACR as the amount of albumin (mg/dL) divided by creatinine (g/dL) in randomly voided urine. Hypertension was defined as mean systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mmHg, diastolic ≥ 80 mmHg, or participants who were taking hypertension medication or informed of a hypertension diagnosis by a physician/health professional.

- **Results**: In multivariable-adjusted models, for every 5 mg/g increment in uACR, the prevalence of hypertension increased 1.31-fold (OR, 1.31; 95% CI 1.23–1.40). The odds [95% confidence interval (CI)] for hypertension prevalence were 2.25 (1.86–2.72) for those in the highest quartile compared to those in the lowest quartile. A nonlinear relationship between hypertension prevalence and uACR was identified by visually assessing images (p for nonlinearity < 0.001). Additionally, in the subgroup analysis stratified by body mass index (BMI), a lower BMI corresponded with a stronger association between uACR and hypertension prevalence.

- **Conclusions**: Even within the normal range, subtly elevated uACR was associated with an increased prevalence of hypertension in the U.S. general population, and this association may be enhanced in individuals with low BMI.

### Diagnostic accuracy of spot urinary protein and albumin to creatinine ratios for detection of significant proteinuria or adverse pregnancy outcome in patients with suspected pre-eclampsia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116F8o15]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Study selection and data extraction procedures:

Two reviewers (RKM and MD) independently abstracted the data. They recorded characteristics of the study, such as authors, journal, year of publication, country, study design, objectives, type of medical center, and period or duration of the study. They also noted characteristics of the participants, including study population, method of selection, inclusion and exclusion criteria, whether consecutive cases were used, the number of participants, number of excluded participants along with reasons for exclusion, personal and medical characteristics of enrolled women, inpatients compared with outpatients, and level of activity.

Information on how the diagnostic tests were conducted and the results were documented. This included the timing of protein to creatinine ratio or albumin to creatinine ratio compared with 24-hour urine collection, the method of assessment for the completeness of 24-hour urine collection, number of incomplete collections, prevalence of significant proteinuria (significant > 300 mg/24 hours, severe > 5000 mg/24 hours), range of proteinuria, laboratory methods for measurement of protein and creatinine, and results of diagnostic tests.

Definitions of adverse outcomes for the mother or baby were recorded, accepting any reported by the authors of the included studies. Methods for assessing the diagnostic accuracy of the tests and the results were detailed, including the number of true positives, number of true negatives, sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, method of agreement, receiver operating characteristics curve, area under the curve, and the proposed diagnostic cut-off point.

### Estimated albumin excretion rate versus urine albumin-creatinine ratio for the assessment of albuminuria: A diagnostic test study from the Prevention of Renal and Vascular Endstage Disease (PREVEND) study [^116hyTiz]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

The albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) in spot urine samples is recommended for albuminuria screening instead of the measured albumin excretion rate (mAER) in 24-hour urine collections. In patients with extremes of muscle mass, differences in spot urine creatinine values may lead to under- or overestimation of mAER by ACR. We hypothesized that calculating the estimated AER (eAER) using spot ACR and the estimated creatinine excretion rate (eCER) may improve albuminuria assessment.

- **Study design**: Diagnostic test study.

- **Setting and participants**: 2,711 community-living individuals from the general population of the Netherlands participating in the PREVEND (Prevention of Renal and Vascular Endstage Disease) study.

- **Index test**: eAER was computed as the product of ACR and eCER. eCER was computed using three previously validated methods: Ix, Ellam, and Walser.

- **Reference test**: mAER, based on two 24-hour urine collections. Accuracy of the eAER and ACR were defined as the percentage of participants falling within 30% (P30) of mAER.

- **Results**: Mean age was 49 years, 46% were men, mean estimated glomerular filtration rate was 84 ± 15 mL/min/1.73 m², and median mAER was 7.2 (IQR, 5.4–11.0) mg/d. Mean measured CER was 1,381 mg/d, and median ACR was 4.9 mg/g. Using the Ix equation, median eAER was 6.4 mg/d. In the full cohort, eAER was more accurate and less biased compared to ACR (P30, 48.9% vs. 33.6%; bias, -34.2% vs. -14.1%, respectively). In subgroup analysis, improvement was most notable in the middle and highest weight tertiles and in men. Using the other methods for eCER produced similar results.

### Diagnostic accuracy of spot urinary protein and albumin to creatinine ratios for detection of significant proteinuria or adverse pregnancy outcome in patients with suspected pre-eclampsia: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^113K2zxJ]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

The multivariate meta-analysis for the protein to creatinine ratio aimed to detect significant proteinuria compared with a 24-hour urine collection. For many studies, we extracted test accuracy results for the protein to creatinine ratio at multiple thresholds. For instance, in the study by Al Ragip et al, a two-by-two table was available that expressed the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for each of five protein to creatinine ratio thresholds (0.13, 0.18, 0.19, 0.2, and 0.49).

Multiple test accuracy results within the same study are correlated as the same patients contribute data to each threshold. We expect a strong positive correlation between test accuracy results at neighboring thresholds. This within-study correlation between thresholds should be accounted for in the meta-analysis by synthesizing all thresholds simultaneously since it includes important information that is otherwise lost.

By utilizing the within-study correlations, one can "borrow strength" across thresholds. This means, for example, that if a study presents results for a threshold of 0.2 but not for a threshold of 0.3, then with knowledge of the within-study correlation between estimates at 0.2 and 0.3 in other studies, this study can still provide indirect information about test accuracy at threshold 0.3.

### The diagnostic accuracy of a urine albumin-creatinine ratio point-of-care test for detection of albuminuria in primary care [^114dBjMk]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Albuminuria is an important sign of chronic kidney disease and is detected routinely by measurement of urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR). A Siemens CLINITEK test designed for use at the point of care is available that can semiquantitatively measure ACR.

- **Study design**: Diagnostic accuracy study evaluating a urinary ACR point-of-care test.

- **Setting & participants**: The semiquantitative ACR test was evaluated at the point of care in a representative primary care population (those with or at increased risk of chronic kidney disease) of 642 patients under standard operational conditions and compared with the reference standard of ACR measurement in the clinical laboratory.

- **Index test**: The point-of-care CLINITEK semiquantitative ACR test uses dye-binding and catalytic assays for albumin and creatinine, respectively, on a Microalbumin 9 strip, which is read by the CLINITEK Status Analyzer, and ACR is calculated automatically.

- **Reference test**: Laboratory measurement of albumin and creatinine on an Abbott Architect analyzer by immunoturbidimetric and enzymatic assays, respectively, and calculation of ACR.

- **Results**: The prevalence of albuminuria (laboratory ACR ≥ 30 mg/g) in the study population was 20.2%. Sensitivity and specificity of the point-of-care test for detecting albuminuria were 83.2% and 80.0%, respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were 51.2% and 95.0%, respectively; positive and negative likelihood ratios were 4.16 and 0.21, respectively. Twenty-three (3.6%) samples measured at the point of care were not analyzed in the central laboratory.

### Urine albumin/creatinine ratio below 30 mg/g is a predictor of incident hypertension and cardiovascular mortality [^113p9p4Y]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

In general, urinary albumin excretion is classified as normoalbuminuria (< 30 mg/day), microalbuminuria (30–300 mg/day), and macroalbuminuria (> 300 mg/day or UACR > 300 mg/g). Thus, it is important to note that all individuals included in this study in all quartiles of UACR would be classified as having normoalbuminuria. Consequently, our results strongly suggest that even within the normal range of urinary albumin excretion, an increase in UACR is associated with CVD mortality and an increased risk of developing incident hypertension during follow-up.

Low levels of eGFR are associated with renal impairment and albuminuria, but our results clearly show that the association between low-grade albuminuria and mortality outcomes and incident hypertension is independent of eGFR levels. A previous cohort study undertaken in North and South America and Europe, which followed individuals aged ≥ 55 years for a median of 4.5 years, showed that any degree of albuminuria was a risk factor for CV events. Another multicenter cohort study involving patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy also showed an association between UACR and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, with no threshold of UACR contributing to increased risk. These results are in keeping with our results and with our previous study in which we showed an association between different cardiovascular risk factors and low-grade albuminuria. However, the baseline characteristics of subjects in these studies were very different from the baseline characteristics.

### Diagnostic accuracy of spot urinary protein and albumin to creatinine ratios for detection of significant proteinuria or adverse pregnancy outcome in patients with suspected pre-eclampsia: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^114vySbW]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of two "spot urine" tests for significant proteinuria or adverse pregnancy outcomes in pregnant women with suspected pre-eclampsia, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis.

The data were obtained from searches of electronic databases from 1980 to January 2011, which included reference list checking, hand searching of journals, and contact with experts.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Diagnostic studies in pregnant women with hypertension that compared the urinary spot protein to creatinine ratio or albumin to creatinine ratio with urinary protein excretion over 24 hours or adverse pregnancy outcome were considered. Study characteristics, design, and methodological and reporting quality were objectively assessed.

- **Data extraction**: Study results relating to diagnostic accuracy were extracted and synthesized using multivariate random effects meta-analysis methods.

- **Results**: Twenty studies, testing 2,978 women (pregnancies), were included. Thirteen studies examining the protein to creatinine ratio for the detection of significant proteinuria were incorporated into the multivariate analysis. Threshold values for the protein to creatinine ratio ranged between 0.13 and 0.5, with estimates of sensitivity ranging from 0.65 to 0.89 and estimates of specificity from 0.63 to 0.87; the area under the summary receiver operating characteristics curve was 0.69. On average, across all studies, the optimum threshold (that optimizes sensitivity and specificity combined) appears to be between 0.30 and 0.35 inclusive. However, no threshold provided a summary estimate above 80% for both sensitivity and specificity.

### The urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and kidney function after nephrectomy [^113KkYxZ]. The Journal of Urology (2020). Low credibility.

Patients with kidney cancer are at risk for chronic kidney disease after radical and partial nephrectomy. We determined if the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio is independently associated with progressive chronic kidney disease after nephrectomy.

- **Materials and methods**: We performed a cohort study based within a large, integrated health care system. We identified patients who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy from 2004 to 2014 with the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio measured in the 12 months before surgery. We fit multivariable models to determine if the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio was associated with the time to chronic kidney disease progression (defined as reaching stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease, estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 30 ml/minute/1.73 m²). We performed a parallel analysis measuring the time to stage 3b, 4, or 5 chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 45 ml/minute/1.73 m²) among patients with normal or near normal preoperative kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate 60 ml/minute/1.73 m² or greater). We also examined the association between the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and survival.

- **Results**: A total of 1,930 patients underwent radical or partial nephrectomy and had preoperative urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and preoperative and postoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate assessed. Of these patients, 658 (34%) and 157 (8%) had moderate (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio 30 to 300 mg/g) or severe albuminuria (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio greater than 300 mg/g), respectively.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^1124NKxH]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

- **Recommendation: Acceptable samples**: Acceptable samples to test for increased urinary albumin excretion are timed collections (e.g. 12 or 24 hours) for measurement of the albumin concentration and timed or untimed samples for measurement of the albumin–creatinine ratio B (moderate).

- **Recommendation: The optimal time**: The optimal time for spot urine collection is the early morning. All collections should be at the same time of day to minimize variation. The patient should not have ingested food within the preceding 2 hours but should be well-hydrated (i.e. not volume depleted) GPP.

- **Preanalytical**: Collection of 24-hour samples has disadvantages, specifically because many samples are collected inadequately and because total creatinine is not routinely checked to evaluate the adequacy of collection. The albumin–creatinine ratio is the superior method to predict renal events in patients with type 2 diabetes. The ratio has a within-person biological variation similar to that of the excretion rate and correlates well with both timed excretion and the albumin concentration in a first morning void of urine. For the ratio, a first morning void sample is preferable because this sample has a lower within-person variation than the ratio for a random urine sample taken during the day. Although the ratio appears entirely acceptable for screening, limited data are available on its use in monitoring the response to therapy. Recent post hoc analyses of clinical trials, however, have found that the albumin–creatinine ratio is a reasonable method to assess change over time. For screening, an untimed sample for albumin measurement is suitable.

### Urine albumin/creatinine ratio below 30 mg/g is a predictor of incident hypertension and cardiovascular mortality [^113JZNhu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). High credibility.

Microalbuminuria is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, but whether lower levels of urine albumin excretion similarly predict CVD is uncertain. We investigated associations between urine albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR) < 30 mg/g, and incident hypertension, incident diabetes mellitus, and all-cause and CVD mortality during a maximum of 11 years of follow-up.

- **Methods and results**: Individuals (37,091) in a health screening program between 2002 and 2012 with baseline measurements of UACR were studied. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for incident hypertension, incident diabetes mellitus, and mortality outcomes (lowest UACR quartile as reference) at follow-up. For linear risk trends, the quartile rank was used as a continuous variable in regression models. Nine hundred sixty-three cases of incident hypertension, 511 cases of incident diabetes mellitus, and 349 deaths occurred during follow-up. In the fully adjusted models, there was a significant HR for the association between UACR and incident hypertension (highest UACR quartile HR 1.95 [95% CI 1.51, 2.53], P-value for trend across UACR quartiles P < 0.001). In contrast, the association between UACR and incident diabetes mellitus was not significant (highest UACR quartile, HR 1.15 [95% CI 0.79, 1.66], P-value for trend P = 0.20). For CVD mortality, with increasing UACR quartiles, there was a significant increase in HR across quartiles, P = 0.029 (for all-cause mortality, P = 0.078).

- **Conclusions**: Low levels of albuminuria, UACR below 30 mg/g, are associated with incident hypertension and CVD mortality, highlighting their potential as predictive markers.

### Assessing proteinuria in chronic kidney disease: Protein-creatinine ratio versus albumin-creatinine ratio [^111hKcKx]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2010). Low credibility.

Quantification of proteinuria is important in the assessment of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The aim of this study was to investigate the optimal test to identify significant proteinuria.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively assessed the relationship between total protein:creatinine ratio (TPCR), albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR), and 24-hour urine total protein in 6,842 patients with CKD, focusing on performance at thresholds of 0.5 and 1 g/day of proteinuria.

- **Results**: The relationship between ACR and TPCR is non-linear. TPCR is highly correlated with 24-hour urine protein (Spearman's rho = 0.91), though ACR also performs well (rho = 0.84). Using receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis, TPCR outperforms ACR at predicting 0.5 g/day [area under the curve (AUC) 0.967 vs. 0.951, P < 0.001]. Furthermore, TPCR outperforms ACR at all ages, though the threshold of 0.5 g is less satisfactory in patients > 79 years. Non-albumin proteinuria was a lower proportion of total proteinuria in patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockade than in those who were not (P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: TPCR is a more sensitive screening test than ACR.

### Urine albumin-creatinine ratio accurately reflects daily albuminuria in nonobese patients but requires body weight correction in obese [^116v7qsH]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2025). Low credibility.

The urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) is widely used to estimate daily albuminuria. Despite efforts to improve the accuracy of the estimated albumin excretion rate, the individual contributions of age, sex, and body weight remain unexplored.

- **Methods**: This hospital-based cohort study examined the explanatory power of various factors and compared total R² values across different sets of factors to determine the optimal estimated albumin excretion rate model.

- **Results**: An analysis of 304 24-hour urine samples revealed a median value of 0.538 g (interquartile range: 0.091–2.080 g), identifying UACR and body weight as significant factors with high partial R² values in estimating daily albuminuria. A novel model using only UACR and body weight demonstrated performance comparable to previous models that included additional variables (total R² values: ours 0.922 vs. 0.923, P = 0.893; ours 0.922 vs. 0.925, P = 0.727) and outperformed the model that excluded body weight (total R² values: ours 0.922 vs. 0.855, P < .001).

Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified 78.1 kg (body mass index [BMI] of 28.5 kg/m²) as the optimal cutoff for predicting underestimation of daily albuminuria by UACR in the heavier half of our patient cohort (area under the curve: 0.865). For individuals with body weight less than 78.1 kg (0th-75.4th percentile), daily albuminuria (g) could be estimated as: 0.033 + 0.999 × UACR (mg/mg) (total R²: 0.966). Conversely, for those weighing ≥ 78.1 kg (75.5th-100th percentile), the estimation formula was as follows: -3.885 + 1.538 × UACR (mg/mg).

### Use of a random urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio for the diagnosis of significant proteinuria during pregnancy [^112Fu6jd]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether a random urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio is a clinically useful predictor of significant proteinuria (300 mg/24 hour).

The medical records of 138 women who completed both a random urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio and a 24-hour urine collection for the evaluation of preeclampsia were reviewed. Urine samples for the random protein-to-creatinine ratio were collected before the 24-hour urine collection. With the use of a protein level of at least 300 mg in the 24-hour urine sample as the gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of the random protein-to-creatinine ratio for the diagnosis of significant proteinuria were determined with a range of cutoffs.

Fifty percent of the study population had significant proteinuria. The data suggest that a cutoff below 0.14 ruled out significant proteinuria. The best cutoff of ≥ 0.19 yields a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 70%. All of the false-negative test results had 24-hour urine protein levels below 400 mg; 13 of the 21 false-positive results had levels that ranged from 250 to 300 mg.

The random urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio is strongly associated with the 24-hour total protein excretion. A level below 0.14 can rule out significant proteinuria. A best cutoff of ≥ 0.19 is a good predictor of significant proteinuria. With further study, the random urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio could replace the 24-hour urine collection as a simpler, faster, more useful method for the diagnosis of significant proteinuria.

### Chronic kidney disease in diabetes: A clinical practice guideline [^1177CBvm]. Canadian Journal of Diabetes (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of diabetes mellitus type 1, specifically in the context of managing diabetic nephropathy with laboratory follow-up, the DC 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining eGFR and spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio assessments at least annually in patients with diabetes and CKD. More frequent testing every 3–6 months is advised when the eGFR is below 20 mg/mmol.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2024 [^111XL8Yu]. Diabetes Care (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, the ADA 2024 guidelines recommend assessing urinary albumin, such as spot urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and eGFR at least annually. This applies to patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) with a duration of ≥ 5 years and to all patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) regardless of treatment.

### Diagnostic accuracy of spot urinary protein and albumin to creatinine ratios for detection of significant proteinuria or adverse pregnancy outcome in patients with suspected pre-eclampsia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1126ZMbV]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

When considering the most appropriate diagnostic threshold for a test in practice, one must evaluate the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity that relates to the threshold. What is acceptable in clinical practice will be determined by the place of the test in the management pathway (such as add-on, triage, or replacement) and the nature of the disease. For pre-eclampsia, an ideal replacement test should limit the number of false negative results to prevent undetected pre-eclampsia, which carries a risk of serious morbidity and mortality. Women with false positive results will be subjected to increased monitoring and possibly pre-term delivery. Thus, a protein to creatinine ratio as a replacement test would ideally use a threshold that maximizes sensitivity and specificity.

If used as a triage test, where patients who test positive go on to have a 24-hour urine collection to verify significant proteinuria, the focus should be on minimizing false negatives, as false positives will be identified by the second test. Therefore, sensitivity can be maximized at the expense of specificity. Our results can be used to determine the most appropriate threshold for each of these situations.

The findings from the multivariate meta-analysis pertain to the accuracy of the protein to creatinine ratio at the summary level, averaged across all studies. Considerable heterogeneity exists at any threshold for which two or more studies provide evidence, thus affecting the performance of protein to creatinine ratio testing.

### Spot urinary albumin-creatinine ratio predicts left ventricular hypertrophy in young hypertensive African-American men [^116MkLd7]. American Journal of Hypertension (2000). Low credibility.

Hypertensive patients with target organ damage are at increased cardiovascular risk and should be treated most aggressively. The association between urinary albumin excretion and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in prior studies is inconsistent and has not been described using a single, random spot urine specimen. Therefore, we evaluated the association between the urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) and left ventricular (LV) mass and also tested the hypothesis that a simple random, single-void urine ACR would identify high-risk young, hypertensive, African-American men.

We measured echocardiographic LV mass and a random spot urinary ACR in 109 untreated, hypertensive, young, inner-city African-American men. The mean age was 41 ± 6 years, and the mean blood pressure (BP) was 157 ± 19/107 ± 13 mm Hg. Microalbuminuria (ACR 30 to 300 mg/g) was present in 22% of subjects. The ACR is higher in the men with LVH than in the men without LVH (P < 0.05). An ACR > 30 mg/g has a sensitivity of 33% and a specificity of 82% for the diagnosis of echocardiographic LVH.

In conclusion, elevated random spot ACR is a marker of increased LV mass, independent of BP, in young urban African-American men with hypertension and may help to determine the aggressiveness of antihypertensive therapy in this high-risk group.

### Influence of urine creatinine on the relationship between the albumin-to-creatinine ratio and cardiovascular events [^114mptUd]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

- **Objectives**: In the albumin-to-creatinine ratio (spot-ACR), urine creatinine corrects for tonicity but also reflects muscle mass. Low muscle mass is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). We hypothesized that the spot-ACR would be higher in women, lower-weight persons, and older individuals, independent of timed urine albumin excretion (24hr-UAE), and accordingly, that spot-ACR would be more strongly associated with CVD events than 24hr-UAE in these subgroups.

- **Design, setting, participants, & methods**: 2627 PREVEND (Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-stage Disease) participants with 24hr-UAE < 0.06 participated in the study.

- **Conclusions**: In community-living individuals with 24hr-UAE < 30 mg/d, spot-ACR is higher in women, older persons, and lower-weight persons, independent of other factors.

### Effect of processing delay and storage conditions on urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [^116ZSdyP]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Because there is substantial biologic intraindividual variation in albumin excretion, randomized trials of albuminuria-reducing therapies may need multiple urine samples to estimate daily urinary albumin excretion. Mailing spot urine samples could offer a convenient and cost-effective method to collect multiple samples, but urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio stability in samples stored at ambient temperatures for several days is unknown.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: Patients with kidney disease provided fresh urine samples in two tubes (with and without boric acid preservative). Reference aliquots from each participant were analyzed immediately, whereas remaining aliquots were subject to different handling/storage conditions before analysis, including delayed processing for up to 7 days at three different storage temperatures (4°C, 18°C, and 30°C), multiple freeze-thaw cycles, and long-term frozen storage at -80°C, -40°C, and -20°C. We calculated the mean percentage change in urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio for each condition and we considered samples stable if the 95% confidence interval was within a ± 5% threshold.

- **Results**: Ninety-three patients provided samples with detectable albuminuria in the reference aliquot. Median (interquartile range) urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio was 87 (20–499) mg/g. The inclusion of preservative had minimal effect on fresh urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio measurements but reduced the changes in albumin and creatinine in samples subject to processing delay and storage conditions.

### Urine albumin-creatinine ratio variability in people with type 2 diabetes: Clinical and research implications [^115F1pHd]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Evidence has demonstrated that albuminuria is a key diagnostic and prognostic marker of diabetic chronic kidney disease, but the impact of its day-to-day variability has not been adequately considered. This study quantified within-individual variability of albuminuria in people with type 2 diabetes to inform clinical albuminuria monitoring.

- **Study design**: Descriptive cross-sectional analysis.

- **Setting and participants**: People with type 2 diabetes (n = 826; median age, 67.1 years [IQR, 60.3–72.4]; 64.9% male) participating in the Progression of Diabetic Complications (PREDICT) cohort study.

- **Exposure**: Four spot urine collections for measurement of urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) within 4 weeks.

- **Outcome**: Variability of UACR.

- **Analytical approach**: We characterized within-individual variability using the coefficient of variation (CV), 95% limits of random variation, and intraclass correlation coefficient. A calculator was developed displaying probabilities that any observed difference between a pair of UACR values truly exceeded a 30% difference, and we estimated ranges of diagnostic uncertainty to inform the need for additional UACR collections to exclude or confirm albuminuria. Multiple linear regression examined factors influencing UACR variability.

- **Results**: We observed high within-individual variability (CV 48.8%). The 95% limits of random variation showed a repeated UACR could be as high/low as 3.78/0.26 times the first. If a single-collection UACR increased from 2 to 5 mg/mmol, the probability that UACR actually increased by at least 30% was only 50%, rising to 97% when two collections were performed.
