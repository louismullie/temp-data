## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which two numbers between 60 and 70 divide (2^{48} - 1). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the algebraic factorization of (2^{48} - 1) and which factors could land in the 60s. Then, I should verify which candidates in that range are prime and which are composite, because primality affects divisibility. Next, I will apply modular arithmetic to test divisibility for each candidate, and finally, I will cross-check the results against the answer choices to confirm the correct pair.

> Let me first confirm the factorization strategy. The expression (2^{48} - 1) is a difference of squares and can be factored repeatedly, yielding factors of the form (2^k - 1) where (k) divides 48; specifically, (2^{48} - 1 = (2^{24} - 1)(2^{24} + 1) = (2^{12} - 1)(2^{12} + 1)(2^{24} + 1) = \\dots) and so on, so any divisor of (2^d - 1) for (d \\mid 48) will divide (2^{48} - 1). I should double-check that this recursive factorization indeed captures all algebraic factors, and yes, it does, which means I can look for factors of (2^d - 1) with (d \\mid 48) that fall between 60 and 70 [^notfound].

> Now, I need to enumerate the relevant divisors of 48 to guide which (2^d - 1) expressions to consider. The divisors of 48 include 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 48, so I should check (2^d - 1) for these (d) values to see which produce factors in the 60s. Wait, let me verify a few: (2^6–1 = 63), which is in range; (2^5–1 = 31), too small; (2^7–1 = 127), too large; so 63 is a promising candidate. I should also keep in mind that 61 is prime, so if 61 divides (2^{48} - 1), it must do so by Fermat's little theorem or order considerations, which I'll examine shortly [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the candidate numbers between 60 and 70 and their primality, because that will shape how I test divisibility. The candidates are 61, 63, 65, 67, and 69; among these, 61 and 67 are prime, 63 is composite ((3^2 \\times 7)), 65 is composite ((5 \\times 13)), and 69 is composite ((3 \\times 23)). Hold on, I should verify that I'm not missing any; 62, 64, 66, 68, and 70 are even and thus cannot divide an odd number like (2^{48} - 1), so they can be excluded outright [^notfound].

> I will now examine 63. Since (63 = 2^6–1), and 6 divides 48, it follows directly that (2^6–1) divides (2^{48} - 1), so 63 is a divisor. Let me double-check that this is rigorous: yes, (a^m - 1) divides (a^n - 1) whenever (m \\mid n), so (2^6–1 \\mid 2^{48} - 1), confirming 63 as one of the two numbers [^notfound].

> Now, I should test 61. Because 61 is prime, I can use Fermat's little theorem: if 61 divides (2^{48} - 1), then (2^{60} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{61}), and the order of 2 modulo 61 must divide both 60 and 48. Let me compute the order carefully. The order of 2 mod 61 divides 60, and I need to check whether it divides 48; if it does, then (2^{48} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{61}). I should confirm the order by checking successive divisors of 60; after working through the powers, I find that the order is indeed 60, which does not divide 48, so (2^{48} \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{61}). Wait, let me verify this conclusion; yes, if the order is 60, then (2^{48} \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{61}), so 61 does not divide (2^{48} - 1). Hold on, I should double-check my order calculation before concluding definitively; I initially thought the order might be 12, but on rechecking, it is 60, so 61 is not a divisor [^notfound].

> Next, I should review 65. Since 65 is composite, I can test divisibility by 5 and 13 separately. For 5: powers of 2 modulo 5 cycle as 2, 4, 3, 1, so (2^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}); then (2^{48} = (2^4)^{12} \\equiv 1^{12} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}), so 5 divides (2^{48} - 1). For 13: powers of 2 modulo 13 cycle with order 12, so (2^{48} = (2^{12})^4 \\equiv 1^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}), so 13 divides (2^{48} - 1). Since both 5 and 13 divide (2^{48} - 1) and they are coprime, their product 65 divides (2^{48} - 1). I should confirm that this logic is sound; yes, it is correct, so 65 is the second divisor [^notfound].

> Let me consider 67 to ensure I'm not missing anything. Because 67 is prime, I would need the order of 2 modulo 67 to divide 48. I should double-check the order; after examining the powers, the order of 2 mod 67 is 66, which does not divide 48, so (2^{48} \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{67}), and 67 is not a divisor. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost concluded 67 might work based on proximity, but the order calculation clearly rules it out [^notfound].

> Finally, I should review 69. Since 69 = 3 × 23, I need to check divisibility by 3 and 23. For 3: powers of 2 modulo 3 alternate 2, 1, so (2^{48} \\equiv (2^2)^{24} \\equiv 1^{24} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}), so 3 divides (2^{48} - 1). For 23: I need to check the order of 2 modulo 23; the order is 11, which does not divide 48, so (2^{48} \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{23}), meaning 23 does not divide (2^{48} - 1). Therefore, 69 is not a divisor even though 3 is, because 23 is not. I should confirm that this mixed result still means 69 does not divide the expression; yes, that's correct [^notfound].

> Putting this together, the two numbers between 60 and 70 that divide (2^{48} - 1) are 63 and 65. I should double-check the answer choices: option (c) matches 63 and 65, which aligns with my derivations. Therefore, the correct answer is (c) 63 and 65 [^notfound].

---

The two numbers between 60 and 70 that divide (2^{48} - 1) are **63 and 65**. This is because (2^{48} - 1) is divisible by (2^6–1 = 63) (since 6 divides 48) and by (2^{12} - 1 = 4095), which is divisible by 65 (since 65 = 5 × 13 and both 5 and 13 divide (2^{12} - 1)). The correct option is **(c) 63 and 65**.

---

## Factorization of (2^{48} - 1)

The key is to use the **difference of squares** and the fact that (a^n - 1) is divisible by (a^d - 1) when (d) divides (n):

[
2^{48} - 1 = (2^{24} - 1)(2^{24} + 1) = (2^{12} - 1)(2^{12} + 1)(2^{24} + 1) = (2^6–1)(2^6 + 1)(2^{12} + 1)(2^{24} + 1)
]

Thus, (2^{48} - 1) is divisible by (2^6–1 = 63) and by (2^{12} - 1 = 4095), which is divisible by 65.

---

## Verification of divisibility

### Divisibility by 63

Since 6 divides 48, (2^{48} - 1) is divisible by (2^6–1 = 63). Therefore, **63 is a divisor**.

---

### Divisibility by 65

We need to check that 65 divides (2^{48} - 1). Since 65 = 5 × 13, it suffices to show divisibility by 5 and 13:

- **Divisibility by 5**: (2^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}), so (2^{48} = (2^4)^{12} \\equiv 1^{12} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}). Thus, (2^{48} - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}).
- **Divisibility by 13**: (2^{12} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}), so (2^{48} = (2^{12})^4 \\equiv 1^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}). Thus, (2^{48} - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{13}).

Since both 5 and 13 divide (2^{48} - 1), **65 is a divisor**.

---

## Conclusion

The two numbers between 60 and 70 that divide (2^{48} - 1) are **63 and 65**, corresponding to option **(c)**.

Scarce healthcare resources can be allocated in many ways. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the UK focuses on the size of the benefit relative to costs, yet we know that there is support among clinicians and the general public for reducing inequalities in health. This paper shows how the UK general public trade-off these sometimes competing objectives, and the data we gather allow us to show the weight given to different population groups, for example, 1 extra year of life in full health to someone who would otherwise die at the age of 60 years is worth more than twice as much as an additional year of life to someone who would otherwise die at the age of 70 years. Such data can help inform the rationing decisions faced by all healthcare systems around the world.

Cost-effectiveness threshold for U.S. clinical guidelines — the writing committee "recommend the use of $120 000 per QALY as the cost-effectiveness threshold for clinical guidelines," with the threshold to be "periodically reexamined," "not be adjusted annually for inflation," and "revised every 10 years (or sooner…)." Supporting estimates include a 2024 Personal Consumption Expenditure update that "suggests a cost-effectiveness threshold of $117 000 per QALY," a welfare economics approach indicating willingness to pay tied to income ("per capita disposable income of $60 300… approximately $142 000 (range: $120 000-$175 000) for 1 QALY"), and a population-level framework using World Bank data estimating "$95 958 ($81 672-$120 181) per QALY," translating to "$112 000 ($96 000-$141 000) per QALY" after GDP growth; while "no single method… can be considered the 'gold standard,'" these three approaches "produced similar results."

### Reducing uncertainty in health-care resource allocation [^f7f3a77b]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Expected QALY gains between 0.5 and 1.0 constitute typical limits for health care interventions in many Western countries, when the treatment cost to achieve the gain is in the interval US$ 40 000–80 000. We calculated the expected QALY gain for the GIST patients comprising the material in 0.5 year increments starting at the time of surgery. Only patients who were alive, and without detected tumour recurrence at the starting point, contributed to the calculation. The number of GIST patients with QALY gain limits above 1.00, 0.67 and 0.50 are listed in Table 4.

Only patients who were alive, and without detected tumour recurrence within the specified period after surgery, are available for adjuvant treatment. Assuming current health care legislation accepts treatment costs up to US$ 60 000 per 1 QALY gained, and that the actual cost for the treatment is 40 000, results in a QALY gain limit of 0.67 (40 000 out of 60 000). Table 4 shows that 11 patients are above a QALY gain limit of 0.67 two years after surgery. The total treatment cost then amounts to US$ 440 000 (11 × US$ 40 000). If the pharmaceutical company providing the drug would accept a lower price of US$ 30 000, the QALY gain limit decreases to 0.50 (30 000 out of 60 000). Table 4 shows that 17 patients are above a QALY gain limit of 0.50 two years after surgery. The total treatment cost now amounts to US$ 510 000 (17 × US$ 30 000). The lower drug price thus generates a 16% gross profit increase for the pharmaceutical company, while at the same time drug availability to patients is improved by 55%.

### Number needed to treat (or harm) [^d0b683ae]. World Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

The effect of a treatment versus controls may be expressed in relative or absolute terms. For rational decision-making, absolute measures are more meaningful. The number needed to treat, the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction, is a powerful estimate of the effect of a treatment. It is particularly useful because it takes into account the underlying risk (what would happen without the intervention?). The number needed to treat tells us not only whether a treatment works but how well it works. Thus, it informs health care professionals about the effort needed to achieve a particular outcome. A number needed to treat should be accompanied by information about the experimental intervention, the control intervention against which the experimental intervention has been tested, the length of the observation period, the underlying risk of the study population, and an exact definition of the endpoint. A 95% confidence interval around the point estimate should be calculated. An isolated number needed to treat is rarely appropriate to summarize the usefulness of an intervention; multiple numbers needed to treat for benefit and harm are more helpful. Absolute risk reduction and number needed to treat should become standard summary estimates in randomized controlled trials.

### Number needed to treat and number needed to harm are not the best way to report and assess the results of randomised clinical trials [^f243221a]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Low credibility.

The inverse of the difference between rates, called the 'number needed to treat' (NNT), was suggested 20 years ago as a good way to present the results of comparisons of success or failure under different therapies. Such comparisons usually arise in randomised controlled trials and meta-analysis. This article reviews the claims made about this statistic, and the problems associated with it. Methods that have been proposed for confidence intervals are evaluated, and shown to be erroneous. We suggest that giving the baseline risk, and the difference in success or event rates, the 'absolute risk reduction', is preferable to the number needed to treat, for both theoretical and practical reasons.

### Using the number needed to treat in clinical practice [^646ae153]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2004). Low credibility.

The number needed to treat (NNT) is gaining attention as a method of reporting the results of clinical trails with dichotomous outcome measures. The NNT is defined as the number of patients who would need to be treated, on average, with a specific intervention to prevent 1 additional bad outcome or to achieve 1 desirable outcome in a given time period. Because it reports outcomes in terms of patient numbers, it is extremely useful to clinicians for making decisions about the effort expended with a particular intervention to achieve a single positive outcome. This special communication describes the NNT statistic and its utility for choosing clinical interventions.

### Understanding the number needed to treat [^d75bb01d]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2024). Medium credibility.

The number needed to treat (NNT) is the inverse of the absolute risk difference, which is used as a secondary outcome to clinical trials as a measure relevant to a positive trial, supplementing statistical significance. The NNT requires dichotomous outcomes and is influenced by the baseline disease or symptom severity, the particular population, the type and intensity of the interventional, the duration of treatment, the time period to assessment of response, and the comparator response. Confidence intervals should always accompany NNT for the precision of its estimate. In this review, three meta-analyses are reviewed, which included the NNT in the analysis of response.

The evidence base supporting the use of many common tests and treatments for older adults is described as inadequate, in part because older adults are significantly underrepresented in clinical trials.

Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Table 1
Global all-age DALYs and age-standardised DALY rates in 1990, 2006, and 2016 with mean percentage changes between 1990 and 2016, 2006 and 2016, and 1990 and 2016 for all causes

From 1990 to 2016, global HALE at birth increased from 56·9 years to 63·1 years, with 160 of 195 locations registering significant improvements. Global HALE increased by an average of 6·24 years (95% UI 5·97–6·48) for both sexes combined. Globally, HALE at birth increased from 55·38 years (53·27–57·31) in 1990 to 61·42 years (59·01–63·58) in 2016 for males and from 58·42 years (55·80–60·77) to 64·91 years (61·88–67·54) for females, rising 6·04 years (5·74–6·27) for males and 6·49 years (6·08–6·77) for females (Table 2, Table 3). The total number of years of functional health lost (life expectancy minus HALE) increased from 1990 to 2016, from 8·22 years to 9·34 years. The gap between life expectancy at birth and HALE, which represents years of functional health lost, grew between 1990 and 2016 from 7·32 years (life expectancy 62·70 [62·42–62·99] vs HALE 55·38 [53·27–57·31]) to 8·37 years (69·79 [69·29–70·22] vs 61·42 [59·01–63·58]) for males and from 9·15 years (67·57 [67·33–67·77] vs 58·42 [55·80–60·77]) to 10·42 years (75·33 [74·95–75·64] vs 64·91 [61·88–67·54]) for females. Globally, in 2016, life expectancy at age 65 years was 18·57 years (18·37–18·72) for females and 15·72 years (15·61–15·83) for males, whereas HALE was 13·88 years (12·57–15·02) for females and 11·87 years (10·83–12·80) for males. HALE increased by 1·96 years (1·69–2·13) from 11·92 (10·88–12·89) in 1990 for females and by 1·78 years (1·61–1·93) from 10·09 years (9·22–10·87) for males.

We made every effort to eliminate redundant amounts from the monetary values we used to estimate cost sums. First, we removed values that were obvious re-estimates of older values (with the more recent estimates tending to be more reproducible than older ones; for example, Supplementary Data 1, column E). We further separated costs into 'extrapolation' versus 'actual estimate' categories (columns G and H in Supplementary Data 1, respectively). Further removing those estimates already deemed irreproducible (column F), column I indicates with absolute certainty which estimates should be retained to avoid any potential case of double counting (that is, species with reproducible estimates that do not include both extrapolated and actual estimates).

The sum of estimates in column I ($22,629,029,314) versus our sum of the total costs (US$25,166,603,981) reported in the main text is only 10.1%, which suggest that even in the unlikely case of double counting, the bias is minimal, and well within the margin of error expected for a sum of median cost rates across the globe. It is essential to note that even if a species includes both extrapolations and actual values, it does not necessarily equate to double counting because often the different estimates apply to different regions of the insect's distribution or different economic components of their costs. However, this does not exclude the possibility of double counting within the irreproducible category, simply because we cannot verify how the estimates were derived to check for instances of potential double counting.

### Compression of disability between two birth cohorts of US adults with diabetes, 1992–2012: a prospective longitudinal analysis [^36d1bc57]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

The life expectancy of the average American with diabetes has increased, but the quality of health and functioning during those extra years are unknown. We aimed to investigate the net effect of recent trends in diabetes incidence, disability, and mortality on the average age of disability onset and the number of healthy and disabled years lived by adults with and without diabetes in the USA. We assessed whether disability expanded or was compressed in the population with diabetes and compared the findings with those for the population without diabetes in two consecutive US birth cohorts aged 50–70 years.

Methods

In this prospective longitudinal analysis, we analysed data for two cohorts of US adults aged 50–70 years from the Health and Retirement Study, including 1367 people with diabetes and 11414 without diabetes. We assessed incident disability, remission from disability, and mortality between population-based cohort 1 (born 1931–41, follow-up 1992–2002) and cohort 2 (born 1942–47, follow up 2002–12). Disability was defined by mobility loss, difficulty with one or more instrumental activities of daily living, and difficulty with one or more activities of daily living. We entered age-specific probabilities representing the two birth cohorts into a five-state Markov model to estimate the number of years of disabled and disability-free life and life-years lost by age 70 years.

Findings

In people with diabetes, compared with cohort 1 (n = 1067), cohort 2 (n = 300) had more disability-free and total years of life, later onset of disability, and fewer disabled years. Simulations of the Markov models suggest that in men with diabetes aged 50 years, this difference between cohorts amounted to a 0·8–2·3 year delay in disability across the three metrics (mobility, 63·0 [95% CI 62·3–63·6] to 64·8 [63·6–65·7], p = 0·01; instrumental activities of daily living, 63·5 [63·0–64·0] to 64·3 [63·0–65·3], p = 0·24; activities of daily living, 62·7 [62·1–63·3] to 65·0 [63·5–65·9], p < 0·0001) and 1·3 fewer life-years lost (ie, fewer remaining life-years up to age 70 years; from 2·8 [2·5–3·2] to 1·5 [1·3–1·9]; p < 0·0001 for all three measures of disability). Among women with diabetes aged 50 years, this difference between cohorts amounted to a 1·1–2·3 year delay in disability across the three metrics (mobility, 61·3 [95% CI 60·5–62·1] to 63·2 [61·5–64·5], p = 0·0416; instrumental activities of daily living, 63·0 [62·4–63·7] to 64·1 [62·7–65·2], p = 0·16; activities of daily living, 62·3 [61·6–63·0] to 64·6 [63·1–65·6], p < 0·0001) and 0·8 fewer life-years lost by age 70 years (1·9 [1·7–2·2] to 1·1 [0·9–1·5]; p < 0·0001 for all three measures of disability). Parallel improvements were gained between cohorts of adults without diabetes (cohort 1, n = 8687; cohort 2, n = 2727); within both cohorts, those without diabetes had significantly more disability-free years than those with diabetes (p < 0·0001 for all comparisons).

Interpretation

Irrespective of diabetes status, US adults saw a compression of disability and gains in disability-free life-years. The decrease in disability onset due to primary prevention of diabetes could play an important part in achieving longer disability-free life-years.

### Country performance against COVID-19: rankings for 35 countries [^08935251]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Data on cases and deaths by age, as well as on excess all-cause mortality, remain to be systematically reported and, in consequence, this analysis uses an overall measure of COVID-19 mortality rather than an age-specific one. That said, it is reasonable to expect systematic reporting of excess all-cause mortality to become available and that should then be used in addition to COVID-19 specific mortality. Economists in the US Federal Reserve Bank system have pointed to reasons for favouring use of COVID-19 specific rather than excess all-cause mortality.

We use the trajectories of the cumulative numbers of cases and deaths to assess country performance: how quickly, at any point in time, is a country flattening the rise in cumulative cases (or deaths) over time? The more nearly flat the cumulative curve is at a point in time, the longer it will take for these numbers to double, and our metrics of performance at time t are the doubling times at time t of cases and of deaths, DT c (t) and DT d (t). Time is measured in days from the start date. We calculate DT for t = 25, 65 and 135 with rank orderings displayed for t = 135.

Doubling time is calculated in two steps. Let C(t) and D(t) be the cumulative number of cases and of deaths at time t. Then the average daily rate of growth in the cumulative number of cases, r, is calculated for the 5-day period centred at t. It is also possible to calculate 1-day values of r from the difference C(t+1)−C(t), then average these over a 5-day period and we briefly explored this calculation. The difference is very small except when t is small, that is, under 15–20 days. The value for r is given by

r(t) = ln[C(t+2)/C(t−2)]/4.

From r, doubling time follows:

DT c (t) = ln2/r(t).

Doubling times for deaths were similarly calculated. As we seek doubling time at about time t, we do not use the possible alternative of looking at the number of days, t*, before t when C(t) = 2 [C(t−t*)]).

Sepsis — early energy and protein targets (N4) recommend trophic feeding with precise targets: "we suggest the provision of trophic feeding (defined as 10–20 kcal/h or up to 500 kcal/d) for the initial phase of sepsis, advancing as tolerated after 24–48 hours to > 80% of target energy goal over the first week. We suggest delivery of 1.2–2 g protein/kg/d." For energy assessment, "IC is recommended, if available… with follow-up measurement every 4 days," and if not feasible due to factors such as "Fio2 > 0.60," then "simplistic weight-based equations (25 kcal/kg/d) or published equations may be used." Observational data indicate potential ranges: "provision of a range of 25%–66% of calculated energy requirements may be optimal," and a strategy "advancing after 24–48 hours to 60%–70% of target over the first week may be most appropriate and optimal." Correlation data note estimates were "within 8% of each other."

### Edoxaban versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation [^682dc0e8]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

The study ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 60 mg) was published by Giugliano RP and colleagues in 2013 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Atrial fibrillation, Acute ischemic stroke and Transient ischemic attack. In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 60 mg) study, the trial question was: is edoxaban noninferior to warfarin in patients with AF? In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 60 mg) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 60 mg) study, the population was: 14071 patients (5310 female, 8761 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with AF at moderate-to-high AF risk. The key exclusion criteria were AF due to a reversible disorder; high risk of bleeding; use of dual antiplatelet therapy; moderate-to-severe MS; other indications for anticoagulation therapy; acute coronary syndromes, coronary revascularization, or stroke in the past 30 days. In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 60 mg) study, the interventions were: n = 7035 high-dose edoxaban (60 mg/day) n = 7036 warfarin (dose-adjusted to achieve an INR of 2.0–3.0). In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 60 mg) study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in stroke or systemic embolic events (1.18% vs. 1.5%; HR 0.79, 97.5% CI 0.63 to 0.99). In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 60 mg) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in stroke, systemic embolism, or death from cardiovascular causes (3.85% vs. 4.43%; HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.96) Significant decrease in death from cardiovascular causes (2.74% vs. 3.17%; HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.97) No significant difference in myocardial infarction (0.7% vs. 0.75%; HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.19). In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 60 mg) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in stroke and systemic embolic events. significant difference in major bleeding events (2.75% vs. 3.43%). In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 60 mg) study, the conclusion was: in patients with AF at moderate-to-high AF risk, high-dose edoxaban was noninferior to warfarin with respect to stroke or systemic embolic events.

Effect of Finerenone on HF-Associated Outcomes

HF-associated time-to-event outcomes in the total study population were significantly reduced with finerenone compared with placebo. These included a reduction in the composite of time to cardiovascular death or first HHF (finerenone, 290/3686 [7.9%]; placebo, 351/3666 [9.6%]; HR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.70–0.95]; P = 0.011); the composite of time to HF-related death or first HHF (finerenone, 120/3686 [3.3%]; placebo, 173/3666 [4.7%]; HR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.54–0.86]; P = 0.0013); and time to first HHF (finerenone, 117/3686 [3.2%]; placebo, 163/3666 [4.4%]; HR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.56–0.90]; P = 0.0043; Figure 2). The absolute risk reduction observed using Kaplan-Meier estimates at month 48 for the composite outcome of time to cardiovascular death or first HHF was 1.8%, corresponding to a number needed to treat to prevent 1 such event of 55 (95% CI, 29–393). For the composite outcome of time to HF-related death or first HHF, the absolute risk reduction at month 48 was 1.7%, with a number needed to treat of 60 (95% CI, 35–177). For first HHF, the absolute risk reduction at month 48 was 1.4%, with a number needed to treat of 70 (95% CI, 39–292).

### ACG clinical guidelines: prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections [^297d0891]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Bezlotoxumab (BEZ) for prevention of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection — recommendation and key evidence — states: We suggest bezlotoxumab (BEZ) be considered for prevention of CDI recurrence in patients who are at high risk of recurrence (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Considering benefit concentration, we recommend this drug be considered for patients aged 65 years or older with at least one of: second episode within the past 6 months, immunocompromised, or severe CDI. In pooled MODIFY I/II analyses (modified intention-to-treat), sustained cure at 12 weeks was higher with BEZ 63.5% vs 53.7% among 2,655 adults, with an adjusted difference of 9.7 percentage points (95% CI 4.8–14.5; P < 0.0001) and a number needed to treat of 10. Post hoc, BEZ did not show significant benefits in patients without risk factors 29.0% vs 18.8%; the greatest absolute difference occurred in those with a history of CDI and ≥ 1 other risk factor (−35.7% [95% CI −60.5% to −2.8%]), and the number needed to treat to prevent 1 recurrent CDI was only 6 for patients aged 65 years or older and for those with ≥ 1 CDI episode within the past 6 months. Cost-effectiveness models reported an ICER of $19,824 per QALY overall, $15,252/QALY in patients aged 65 years or older, and $12,597/QALY in immunocompromised patients. There are no absolute contraindications, but caution is advised for patients with a history of congestive heart failure; trials observed higher heart failure incidence 2% vs 1%, more treatment-emergent adverse events 83.8% vs 70.2%, serious adverse events 53.4% vs 48%, deaths 19.5% vs 12.5%, and cardiovascular deaths 8 [14.3%] vs 4 [6.8%]; based on these data, we do not recommend BEZ use in patients with a history of heart failure and that it be used with caution in patients with severe underlying cardiovascular comorbidities.

### Trabectedin is a feasible treatment for soft tissue sarcoma patients regardless of patient age: a retrospective pooled analysis of five phase II trials [^41032954]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Treatment delivery

Median number of cycles received was 3, ranging from 1 to 48 and 1 to 59 cycles for younger and older patients, respectively. Patients received a median dose intensity of 0.42 mg m –2 per week over a median treatment duration of 10 weeks (range: 3.0–181.1) in the younger and 0.40 mg m –2 per week over a median treatment duration of 12 weeks (range: 3.0–236.7) in the older cohort (Table 2). In the younger and older cohort, 25.1% and 27.7% of patients received 7 or more cycles and 18.4% and 12.0% received 10 or more cycles, respectively, with a maximum of 48 and 59 cycles per cohort. Patients aged ⩾70 years had shorter median treatment duration (7.5 weeks; range: 3.0–37.3) mainly because of non-treatment-related events and received a median of two trabectedin cycles (range: 1−12). However, these patients reached a median dose intensity of 0.41 mg m –2 per week, representing 89% of the planned dose intensity, comparable with that given to patients younger than 70 years (Table 2).

Response rate and survival

Regarding the overall trabectedin activity, the ORR was 10.0% (2 CR and 33 PR; 95% confidence interval (CI): 7.1–13.6%) with no significant differences between patients aged < 60 years (10.1%) and ⩾60 years (9.6%). A numerically lower overall ORR (1 PR, 4.2% 95% CI: 1.1–21.1%) was observed among the 24 patients aged ⩾70 years. SD was recorded in 40.4%, 47.0% and 45.8% of patients aged < 60, ⩾60 and ⩾70 years, respectively, and 17.2%, 21.7% and 20.8% of whom maintained SD for ⩾6 months for an DCR of 27.3%, 31.3% and 25.0% in each of these age-based groups (Table 3).

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^4ad523f0]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Strategy Report provides clinicians with an annually updated evidence-based strategy for asthma management and prevention, which can be adapted for local circumstances (e.g., medication availability). This article summarizes key recommendations from GINA 2021, and the evidence underpinning recent changes. GINA recommends that asthma in adults and adolescents should not be treated solely with short-acting β 2 -agonist (SABA), because of the risks of SABA-only treatment and SABA overuse, and evidence for benefit of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Large trials show that as-needed combination ICS-formoterol reduces severe exacerbations by ≥ 60% in mild asthma compared with SABA alone, with similar exacerbation, symptom, lung function, and inflammatory outcomes as daily ICS plus as-needed SABA. Key changes in GINA 2021 include division of the treatment figure for adults and adolescents into two tracks. Track 1 (preferred) has low-dose ICS-formoterol as the reliever at all steps: as needed only in Steps 1–2 (mild asthma), and with daily maintenance ICS-formoterol (maintenance-and-reliever therapy, "MART") in Steps 3–5. Track 2 (alternative) has as-needed SABA across all steps, plus regular ICS (Step 2) or ICS-long-acting β 2 -agonist (Steps 3–5). For adults with moderate-to-severe asthma, GINA makes additional recommendations in Step 5 for add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists and azithromycin, with add-on biologic therapies for severe asthma. For children 6–11 years, new treatment options are added at Steps 3–4. Across all age groups and levels of severity, regular personalized assessment, treatment of modifiable risk factors, self-management education, skills training, appropriate medication adjustment, and review remain essential to optimize asthma outcomes.

### Average remaining lifetimes can increase as human populations age [^15c585b3]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

Increases in median ages, the most commonly used measure of population ageing, are rapid in today's wealthier countries, and population ageing is widely considered to be a significant challenge to the well-being of citizens there. Conventional measures of age count years since birth; however, as lives lengthen, we need to think of age also in terms of years left until death or in proportion to the expanding lifespan. Here we propose a new measure of ageing: the median age of the population standardized for expected remaining years of life. We show, using historical data and forecasts for Germany, Japan and the United States, that although these populations will be growing older, as measured by their median ages, they will probably experience periods in which they grow younger, as measured by their standardized median ages. Furthermore, we provide forecasts for these countries of the old-age dependency ratio rescaled for increases in life expectancy at birth. These ratios are forecasted to change much less than their unscaled counterparts, and also exhibit periods when the population is effectively growing younger.

Number needed to treat (NNT) for LDL-C lowering by therapy and risk group — Table 4 provides "Examples of 5-y NNT estimates for 20, 50, or 65 percent reductions in LDL-C," with columns "Ezetimibe LDL-C ↓ 20%," "PCSK9 mAb LDL-C ↓ 50%," and "PCSK9 mAb LDL-C ↓ 65%." For extremely high risk (45% 10-y ASCVD risk), initial LDL-C 190 mg/dL corresponds to NNTs 21, 8, and 6, and at 100 mg/dL to 39, 16, and 12, respectively. For very high risk (30% 10-year ASCVD risk), initial LDL-C 190 mg/dL corresponds to 32, 13, and 10, and at 100 mg/dL to 61, 25, and 19. For high risk (20% 10-year ASCVD risk), initial LDL-C 190 mg/dL corresponds to 48, 19, and 15, and at 100 mg/dL to 92, 37, and 28.

### Global, regional, and national disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 359 diseases and injuries and healthy life expectancy (HALE) for 195 countries and territories, 1990–2017: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2017 [^cde2367d]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Results

Levels and trends in life expectancy and HALE at birth

Globally, life expectancy at birth for both sexes combined increased by 7·4 years (95% UI 7·1–7·8), rising from 65·6 years (65·3–65·8) in 1990 to 73·0 years (72·7–73·3) in 2017 (appendix 2). The increase in life expectancy at birth was 7·3 years (6·9–7·7) for males (from 63·2 years [62·9–63·4] in 1990 to 70·5 years [70·1–70·8] in 2017) and 7·5 years (7·2–7·9) for females (from 68·0 years [67·8–68·3] in 1990 to 75·6 years [75·3–75·9] in 2017; table 1). During the same period, global HALE at birth for both sexes combined increased by 6·3 years (5·9–6·7), from 57·0 years (54·6–59·1) in 1990 to 63·3 years (60·5–65·7) in 2017 (appendix 2). The increase in HALE at birth was 6·2 years (5·8–6·7) for males (from 55·6 years [53·5–57·5] in 1990 to 61·8 years [59·4–64·0] in 2017) and 6·4 years (6·0–6·8) for females (from 58·4 years [55·7–60·8] in 1990 to 64·8 years [61·7–67·4] in 2017; table 1). The number of years lived in poor health from birth increased globally by 1·1 years (95% UI 0·9–1·4), in the low SDI countries by 1·5 years (1·2–1·9), and in the high SDI countries by 1·3 years (1·0–1·7; appendix 2).

### Stability of high-quality warfarin anticoagulation in a community-based atrial fibrillation cohort: the anticoagulation and risk factors in atrial fibrillation (ATRIA) study [^c3078de4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Figure 2
The distribution ofvalues in the second 6‐month period (2, months 10–15) among the 987 warfarin‐treatedatrial fibrillation cohort patients whosein the first 6‐month period (1: months 4–9) was ≥ 70% and who continued warfarin with a calculablein period 2. An additional 58 patients had 1 ≥ 70% but discontinued warfarin in period 2. These last patients are included in a sensitivity analysis. Note that the initial 3 months on warfarin (months 1–3) were excluded because time is needed to establish warfarin dosing. The mean percentage of time below2.0 and above3.0, respectively, for the 5 ordered categories of 2 were (1) 2 ≥ 70%: 8.6% and 5.4%; (2) 2 65–69%: 20.5% and 12.1%; (3) 2 60–64%: 25.5% and 11.6%; (4) 2 50–59%: 29.3% and 15.6%; and (5) 2 < 50%: 48.6% and 16.6%. ATRIA indicates anticoagulation and risk factors in atrial fibrillation; TTR, time in the therapeutic range.

Cost-effectiveness plane (Figure 1) — when a new intervention produces less health and lower costs compared with the comparator, it may be considered cost-effective if the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is greater than the cost-effectiveness threshold; however, this situation does not arise often because patients, clinicians, and health systems rarely accept worse health outcomes even if it reduces spending, and the figure includes labels "Intervention is cost-saving ("dominant") or always acceptable" and "Intervention is inferior ("dominated") or never acceptable".

### Step counter use in type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^bf4d4642]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Data synthesis and analysis

For trials that reported the standard error (SE) of a mean, the standard deviation (SD) was obtained by multiplying by the square root of the sample size from the appropriate arm. If the 95% confidence interval (CI) was shown instead of an SD, the SD was calculated by dividing the length of the CI by 3.92, and multiplying by the square-root of the sample size (n), provided that n was more than 60. For some trials that compared multiple step counter interventions with a single control group, an approach was applied that combined the multiple intervention arms into a single one to overcome the unit-of-analysis error. If trials had an outcome at 2 time-points, the shorter-term follow-up data were used in the primary analyses. Both final values and change scores from baseline of steps/d and HbA1c were entered in the same meta-analysis, as suggested in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews. Data from intention-to-treat (ITT) or per-protocol analyses were entered when available in included studies.

The analyses used Stata Software (Version 11.0, College Station, TX, USA). Summary estimates were analyzed with a random-effects model, which coincides with a fixed-effects model when no heterogeneity is presented. The Cochran Q test was used to assess heterogeneity among the studies, with a threshold P- value of 0.1 being considered statistically significant. The degree of inconsistency among trials was estimated by the I 2 statistic, where an I 2 value greater than 50% was considered substantially heterogenic. Heterogeneity was explored using 3 strategies: first, sensitivity analyses were conducted by removing each study individually to check whether it could explain heterogeneity; second, univariate meta-regression analyses helped to assess whether the clinical or methodological variables influenced the outcome estimates; and third, subgroup analyses were performed based on meta-regression analyses and pre-specified relevant study characteristics. Publication bias was detected and assessed by Begg's test and Egger's test.

### Cutting edge or blunt instrument: how to decide if a stepped wedge design is right for you [^471f52f2]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

When might I consider doing a stepped wedge trial?

Research designs are shaped as much by practical constraints as by abstract schemes, and it is always a good idea to start with the constraints and work towards a design, rather than start with a design and try to fit it to constraints. These constraints will be unique to each research context, and box 1 lists some areas to think about. Still, there are some common features of settings where a stepped wedge trial might be considered as a possible design, and we now review these.

Box 1
Practical constraints on the design of a longitudinal cluster randomised trial

Are there limits on the time available to complete the evaluation, on the number of clusters, or on the number of participants (or the rate at which you can recruit participants) at each cluster? These constraints put limits on the overall scale of the evaluation, or force trade-offs between different design characteristics.
How will participants and their data be sampled in your study: as a series of cross-sectional surveys, as a continuous stream of incident cases, as a cohort followed over time, or some other way? Does the timescale divide into cycles, seasons or milestones that influence how you will sample participants and data?
Is there a limit on how many clusters can implement the intervention at the same time in the evaluation? If this is constrained by research resources (eg, if there are only enough trained research staff to implement the intervention one cluster at a time) then implementation must be staggered in some way.
If implementation is to be staggered, is there a minimum 'step length'? If the same team delivers the intervention in different clusters at different steps, then bear in mind it may take some time to get the intervention fully operational at a site, and the team will also need time to relocate from one cluster to the next.

### The practice of intensive care in latin America: a survey of academic intensivists [^22bce555]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Workload, clinical rounds, and competencies

The median weekly workload was 60 (IQR, 47–70) h, mostly spent in the ICU (Additional file 4: Figure S2), without differences between academic and nonacademic centers (median 60 [IQR, 46–70] vs. 60 [IQR, 48–68] h; p = 0.7). The duration and characteristics of clinical rounds varied widely across countries, with differences between academic and nonacademic units (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3
Proportion of intensive care unit rounds according to their academic status and (a) length of morning round, (b) presence of evening round, and (c) number of specialists involved in the morning round

Fifty-two percent of intensivists worked daily and also did night shifts. Twenty-two percent worked only in day shifts, and 22% only in night shifts. The median number of night shifts was 1 (IQR, 1–2) per week. Younger intensivists did more night shifts per week (p < 0.001). According to position, staff intensivists performed the higher number of shifts per week (median, 2 [IQR, 1–3]), followed by residents (median, 2 [IQR, 1–2]) (p < 0.001). The number of beds covered per intensivist varied from 3 to 12 per night shift. Most ICUs (76%) had consultants available during night shifts. Overall, survey respondents considered themselves very competent to perform many common procedures. There were significant differences according to position, age, and years of experience in the ICU (Table 2).

### The ALT-70 cellulitis model maintains predictive value at 24 and 48 hours after presentation [^75037ff5]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The clinical calculator "ALT-70 score for cellulitis" for cellulitis, skin abscess and animal bites.

The ALT-70 is a clinical prediction rule for cellulitis. It is used to differentiate cellulitis from pseudocellulitis in adult patients presenting with lower extremity redness. The acronym ALT-70 stands for Age (over 70), Lesion characteristics (asymmetry, well-demarcated border), Temperature (37.9°C or higher), and White blood cell count (more than 10,000 cells/mm³). Each of these four factors is assigned a score, and the total score is used to predict the likelihood of true cellulitis. This calculator is particularly useful in emergency departments and outpatient settings to guide treatment decisions and avoid unnecessary antibiotic use. It should not be used in patients with known skin infections other than cellulitis, or in patients with skin changes due to chronic conditions like venous insufficiency or lymphedema.

The ALT-70 score for cellulitis is a tool designed to assess the likelihood of cellulitis in patients by considering four key clinical factors. Each factor is rated with a specific point value, and the total score informs the probability of cellulitis.

You input four true or false answers related to these clinical factors:

- Presence of asymmetric skin abnormalities
- Age of 70 years or older
- White blood cell count of 10,000/mcL or more
- Heart rate of 90 beats per minute or more

The scoring for these factors is as follows:

- Asymmetric skin abnormalities contribute 3 points
- Age of 70 years or older adds 2 points
- White blood cell count of 10,000/mcL or more adds 1 point
- Heart rate of 90 beats per minute or more also adds 1 point

To compute the ALT-70 score, you sum the points of all true responses, resulting in a total score ranging from 0 to 7.

Interpreting the score:

- A score of 0 to 2 suggests a low probability of cellulitis. It's advisable to explore other diagnoses.
- A score between 3 and 4 indicates an intermediate probability and suggests consulting a specialist for further evaluation.
- A score from 5 to 7 implies a high probability of cellulitis, for which initiating treatment may be recommended.

### Owning the cost of emergency medicine: beyond 2% [^4f829d55]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

This article evaluates current evidence on the cost of emergency care. First, we reviewed data from national data sets and found that aggregate spending on emergency care is 5% to 6% of national health expenditures but could be as high as 10%. These figures are significantly higher than those previously published. Second, we reviewed the literature on economic models of the cost of emergency care and found that the results are inconclusive and incomplete. As an alternative, we discussed activity-based cost accounting and concluded that it is a promising research methodology for emergency medicine. We conclude by advocating for a strategy to demonstrate the value and strategic importance of emergency medicine rather than minimizing its role in national health care costs.

### Effectiveness and safety of a novel care model for the management of type 2 diabetes at 1 Year: an open-label, non-randomized, controlled study [^e93e50fc]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Time Course of Biomarker Change in CCI

Over the course of the intervention at baseline, 70 days, and 1 year, the proportion of participants in the total imputed CCI with HbA 1c below 48 mmol mol −1 (< 6.5%) increased from 19.5 ± 2.4 to 60.7 ± 3.1 to 69.8 ± 3.1%; the proportion with fasting glucose below 6.99 mmol L −1 (< 126 mg dL −1) increased from 34.9 ± 3.3 to 55.5 ± 3.3 to 58.4 ± 3.9%, and the proportion with class III obesity decreased from 45.5 ± 3.1, to 30.2 ± 3.1, to 19.6 ± 2.8%.

The time course of biomarker changes also differed by variable (see Table S3 in the electronic supplementary material). Most of the 1-year improvements in diabetes risk factors were achieved during the first 70 days of the intervention including 84% of the HbA 1c decrease, 90% of the fasting glucose decrease, 73% of the fasting insulin decrease, 64% of the C-peptide decrease, and 87% and 74% of the decreases in HOMA-IR as estimated from fasting insulin and C-peptide concentrations, respectively. Improvements in blood pressure also mostly occurred in the initial 70 days, as did reductions in alkaline phosphatase, serum creatinine, and eGFR. Most of the plasma triglyceride decrease occurred during the first 70 days (87%), whereas essentially all the substantial increase in HDL-cholesterol occurred between the initial 70 days of the intervention and 1 year (99%). About 60% of weight loss occurred in the first 70 days.

Suppose thatis the number of infected people at timewhen lockdowns are introduced at k for k = 0, 1, 2…

Assume that

The percentage of growth in the number of infected people during the 4 time intervals for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, are, say, for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, respectively. These growth percentages are computed as

The secondary infections caused by an infected individual (Fig. 1) are the people who were not traced by the system. This step assumes that all of the infected people who were identified by the system were either quarantined or were controlled not to spread the virus further. Only a proportion of infected people who were tested and identified during lockdowns was reported, and others were either not diagnosed or not reported. Asymptomatic individuals could be anywhere in the process; that is, they were part of the identified and reported group or were among those who had not been contact traced or diagnosed. The mean (geometric) number of secondary infections would be appropriate because we were considering proportionate secondary infections. Hence, the mean number of secondary infections during is given by

### Listing criteria for heart transplantation: International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation guidelines for the care of cardiac transplant candidates – 2006 [^03fc204f]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2006). Medium credibility.

International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) cardiac transplant listing — age criteria and outcomes state that patients should be considered for cardiac transplantation if they are ≤ 70 years of age (Level of Evidence: C), and that carefully selected patients > 70 years of age may be considered for cardiac transplantation; for centers considering these patients, the use of an alternate-type program (i.e., use of older donors) may be pursued (Level of Evidence: C). Supporting data report comparable long-term survival across age strata, with a 10-year follow-up of recipients > 65 years of age (n = 66) versus < 60 years (n = 679) and 60 to 64 years (n = 137) showing 10-year survival similar in all groups (< 60 years: 53.7%; 60 to 64 years: 53.1%; > 65 years: 60.2%; p = not statistically significant [NS]), and significantly fewer rejection episodes in the older patient group (freedom from rejection: 74.9 vs 83.5 vs 90.6, respectively; p = 0.03). In a study of 15 patients ≥ 70 years of age, actuarial survival at 1 year was 93.3% vs 88.3% and at 4 years was 73.5% vs 69.1% compared with younger patients; in 2002, 10% of patients undergoing cardiac transplantation were > 65 years old, and the United Network for Organ Sharing policy specifies that organs from donors < 18 years be offered to recipients < 18 years.

### Understanding the limitations of the journal impact factor [^1684cfe4]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2003). Low credibility.

The impact factor, a simple mathematical formula reflecting the number of citations of a journal's material divided by the number of citable materials published by that same journal, has evolved to become one of the most influential tools in modern research and academia. The impact factor can be influenced and biased (intentionally or otherwise) by many factors. Extension of the impact factor to the assessment of journal quality or individual authors is inappropriate. Extension of the impact factor to cross-discipline journal comparison is also inappropriate. Those who choose to use the impact factor as a comparative tool should be aware of the nature and premise of its derivation and also of its inherent flaws and practical limitations.

### Incorporating economic evidence in clinical guidelines: a framework from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^4483eea4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Figure 1 — comparative value of interventions — categorizes value by clinical net benefit and incremental cost for quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) with intervention versus comparator, where the incremental cost dimension reflects the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per QALY gained. For favorable clinical net benefit, higher cost corresponds to high value (< $100 000), intermediate value ($100 000 to $200 000), or low value (> $200 000) with the intervention more effective and more costly; lower cost corresponds to high value with the intervention more effective and less costly (cost-saving). For unfavorable clinical net benefit, higher cost indicates no value with the intervention less effective and more costly (cost-dominated), and lower cost indicates no value with the intervention less effective and less costly.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^9286264e]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Importance of cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) in cardiovascular care: Over the next 30 years, cardiovascular disease health care costs in the United States are expected to quadruple, from $338 billion in 2020 to $1.4 trillion in 2050, increasing from 2.7% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020 to 4.6% of projected GDP in 2050. CEAs can help promote efficient allocation of finite societal resources by weighing intervention effectiveness against incremental resource use; they are not simply about minimizing costs but about evaluating the incremental cost-effectiveness of an intervention relative to the next best alternative to maximize population health benefits, and they provide efficiency estimates to inform decision-making at the policy and system level.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^68cfa501]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness thresholds — framework and updates explain that the 2014 ACC/AHA statement provided per–capita GDP–based thresholds such that an intervention with an ICER < $50 000 per QALY gained should be considered high value, $50 000 to < $150 000 (1-3x per capita GDP) per QALY gained should be considered intermediate value, and ≥ $150 000 per QALY gained should be considered low value. The World Health Organization's program suggested that costs less than 3 times the national annual GDP per capita per disability-adjusted life year averted should be considered cost-effective, whereas costs less than 1 times should be considered highly cost-effective; however, experts have argued this approach lacks theoretical justification, and World Health Organization experts now also advise against the use of per capita GDP-based cost effectiveness thresholds and instead suggest considering cost-effectiveness information alongside other contextual information in a transparent multicriterion decision process. The writing committee reviewed alternative approaches, including relying on US-based studies; for example, a health opportunity cost analysis estimated that at 2019 prices, for every $1000000 increase in health care expenditures 1860 persons were projected to become uninsured with 81 QALYs lost due to mortality and 15 QALYs lost due to morbidity, implying a cost-effectiveness threshold of $104 000 per QALY ($51 000 to $209 000 per QALY) in 2019 US dollars, and in the probabilistic analysis 40% of the simulations suggested the threshold was less than $100 000 per QALY.

12-week to 48-week Parallel-Arm Design Trials in Adults

The program for persistent asthma in adult patients included one 12-week (Trial 1), two replicate 24-week (Trials 2 and 3), and two replicate 48-week (Trials 4 and 5) randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in a total of 3,476 asthma patients (673 receiving SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 2.5 mcg once-daily, 1,128 receiving SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 5 mcg once-daily, 541 receiving salmeterol 50 mcg twice daily, and 1,134 receiving placebo) on background treatment of at least ICS. Trial 1 evaluated three treatments: SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 2.5 mcg once-daily, SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 5 mcg once-daily, and placebo. Trials 2 and 3 evaluated four treatments: SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 2.5 mcg once-daily, SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 5 mcg once-daily, salmeterol 50 mcg twice daily, and placebo. Trials 4 and 5 evaluated two treatments: SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 5 mcg once-daily and placebo. All trials enrolled patients who had a diagnosis of asthma, were 18 to 75 years of age, and were not current smokers. Patients enrolled in Trials 4 and 5 were required to have airway obstruction that was not fully reversible (post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC, 0.70). The majority of the 3,476 patients in the adult asthma trials were female (60%), Caucasian (61%) or Asian (31%), and had never smoked (81%) with a mean age of 46 years. The patient characteristics for the 12 week to 48 week trials in adult patients with asthma are summarized in Table 6.

### Cardiorespiratory fitness and mortality in patients aged 60 to 90 years [^7b52bd9b]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronological age alone does not fully reflect a patient's prognosis. We sought to assess the association of cardiorespiratory fitness (quantified by METs) with all-cause mortality among patients aged 60 to 90 years. This retrospective study included patients who underwent exercise treadmill testing at an integrated healthcare system from 2011 to 2019. Patients were categorized into age groups: 60 to < 70 years, 70 to < 80 years, and 80 to 90 years; and cardiorespiratory fitness level: low (< 5 METs), moderate (5 to 10 METs), and high fitness (> 10 METs). Mean follow-up was 3.5 years. A total of 40,520 patients were included (mean age 67.7 ± 4.7 years, 48.6% women). Of whom, 27,021 were 60 to < 70 years old (66.7%); 12,638 70 to < 80 years old (31.2%); and 1,861 80 to 90 years old (4.6%). There were 3,494 patients categorized as low (8.6%), 21,863 as moderate (54%), and 15,163 as high fitness (37.4%). Low fitness level was independently associated with lower survival (hazard ratio [HR] 1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15 to 2.24). Using age 60 to 70 group with high fitness level as reference, the age 80 to 90 group with high fitness level had better survival than their younger counterparts with low fitness level (age 80 to 90 years high fitness level: HR 2.9, 95% CI 1.2 to 7.2; age 60 to 70 years low fitness level: HR 4.3, 95% CI 3.1 to 5.9; age 70 to 80 years low fitness level: HR 6.8, 95% CI 5.2 to 8.9) on adjusted analysis. In conclusion, higher cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with better survival. Patients > 80 years old with high fitness level have comparable or even better survival than their younger counterparts with submoderate fitness levels. Chronological age alone should not be the only factor when considering prognosis.

### Are there circumstances in which phase 2 study results should be practice-changing? [^293b9755]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2007). Low credibility.

New pharmaceuticals, innovative combinations of approved agents, and novel treatment modalities have resulted in a marked increase in the need for clinical trials. Evidence for treatment efficacy is best derived from large phase 3 randomized, controlled clinical trials. However, phase 3 investigations are lengthy and expensive, and consume patient resources. Furthermore, some diseases and treatment indications are rare, and adequate numbers of patients for a definitive phase 3 trial do not exist. Consequently, it is imperative for clinicians to understand phase 2 trial design, since their interpretation is required to apply the findings in clinical practice appropriately. The complexity of phase 2 studies is explored, including unique designs, possible use of randomization, and other key elements necessary for interpretation of phase 2 trials. Specific examples and application of these concepts are discussed in this review.

Cardiovascular risk estimation in older adults — frailty and calibration context are described, with increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) in frail populations (hazard ratio [HR] 1.70, 95% CI, 1.18–2.45) and prefrail populations (HR 1.23, 95% CI, 1.07–1.36) compared with robust patients; for patients aged 70 years or older the estimated cardiovascular risk (CVR) was calculated via SCORE2-OP without a calibration factor and "may also tend to overestimate the CVR in the Colombian population"; the scales "were validated in Colombia," but "this validation was performed using a population between 40 and 69 years old," while they "applied these scales to older people of 60 years old or more"; compared with the PURE validation cohort, this study had higher prevalence of hypertension and diabetes (51.70% vs 38.7% and 15.28% vs 6.7%, respectively); and health system affiliation in the cohort was 2.60% not affiliated, 55.12% subsidized, and 40.39% contributory.

### Use of clinical trial characteristics to estimate costs of new drug development [^945e3485]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Despite their importance to patients, health, and industry, the magnitude of investments in drug research and development (R&D) remain nebulous. New policies require more granular and transparent R&D cost estimates to better balance incentives for innovation and returns to developers.

Objective

To estimate per-drug R&D costs using a novel, reproduceable approach and to describe firm-level R&D costs per discrete unit of R&D activity (1 patient-month).

Design, Setting, and Participants

This economic evaluation used cross-sectional data to estimate 2014 to 2019 costs per patient-month. Costs per patient-month were calculated using data from 268 US publicly traded drug developers, contributing 1311 firm-year observations, that were highest ranked by assets or market capitalization, after exclusions. Per-drug costs were calculated from all R&D activity through approval for a cohort of 38 new drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2019. Data were analyzed from January 2022 to July 2024.

Exposure

R&D activity, measured in terms of clinical trial patient-months.

Main Outcomes and Measures

This study used a 2-step approach to estimate R&D costs, first allocating firm-year-level total R&D spending across similarly aggregated patient-months, and then aggregating these incremental costs to estimate drug-level R&D costs per new drug.

Results

Among 268 developers assessed, 20 large firms accounted for 80.8% of all patient-months and had 27.4% lower mean and 26.7% lower median costs per patient-month compared with other firms. Each 1% increase in patient-months was associated with a 0.9% increase in R&D costs. R&D costs per new drug were highly skewed, with a lower median (IQR), at $708 million ($247 million to $1.42 billion) than mean (SD), at $1.31 ($1.92) billion, after adjusting for the cost of capital and discontinued products. Without these adjustments, direct costs per new drug were a median (IQR) of $150 ($67.6-$453) million and a mean (SD) $369 of ($684) million. While estimated R&D costs varied in sensitivity analyses, mean costs were always substantially greater than median costs.

Conclusions and Relevance

This economic evaluation found median per-drug R&D costs toward the lower end of the range from prior studies, with a mean closer to the middle of the existing range despite the broad scope of included costs. These findings suggest parallel development across indications, adjustment for discontinued products, and a small number of expensive development programs are particularly important drivers of R&D costs.

Neurologic disease and U.S. health spending burden is quantified, noting prevalence and costs. "Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, stroke, and multiple sclerosis affect approximately 15 million people and account for more than $290 billion in health care spending annually in the United States." "According to estimates from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the United States spent $2.7 trillion (17.9% of the gross domestic product [GDP]) on health care in 2011." Projections state that "health care spending is projected to constitute 25% of the GDP by 2025," and inefficiency estimates note that "The Institute of Medicine estimates that $750 billion was spent on wasted medical services, including unnecessary services, inefficiently delivered services, and missed prevention opportunities, in 2009 alone."

Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) — importance and projected cardiovascular disease costs are outlined: Over the next 30 years, health care costs attributable to cardiovascular disease in the United States are expected to quadruple, even after accounting for inflation — from $338 billion in 2020 to $1.4 trillion in 2050, an increase from 2.7% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020 to 4.6% of the projected GDP in 2050. CEAs can help promote efficient allocation of finite societal resources by weighing the effectiveness of an intervention against the incremental use of resources, and it is important to note that CEAs are not simply about minimizing costs: they systematically evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of an intervention relative to the best alternative to maximize the population health benefits, given finite available resources.

Risk estimation tables — application and race/ethnicity considerations: For combinations of risk factors, if a patient's levels are more adverse than a table cell that shows 8%, then the estimated 10-year risk would be ≥ 8%. To avoid instability at extremes, the risk probabilities are truncated at 1% and 30%, and proportions are presented for the US adult population 40 to 79 years of age. Compared with non-Hispanic whites, estimated risk is generally lower in Hispanic-American and Asian-American populations and higher in American-Indian populations; in the interim, providers may consider using the equations for non-Hispanic whites for these patients, noting that the estimated risks may be overestimates, especially for Hispanic and Asian Americans.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness thresholds for cardiovascular cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) — The 2014 ACC/AHA cost-value methodology statement provided thresholds to identify high-, intermediate-, and low-value care based on U.S. per capita gross domestic product, and the writing committee determined that an intervention with an ICER < $50 000 per QALY gained should be considered high value, $50 000 to < $150 000 (1–3× per capita GDP) per QALY gained should be considered intermediate value, and ≥ $150 000 per QALY gained should be considered low value. WHO-origin GDP benchmarks suggested an intervention that costs less than 3 times the national annual GDP per capita per disability-adjusted life year averted should be considered cost-effective and that costs less than 1 times should be considered highly cost-effective, but critics note they "set such a low bar for cost effectiveness that very few interventions with evidence of efficacy can be ruled out"; WHO experts now also advise against per capita GDP-based thresholds and suggest considering cost-effectiveness alongside other contextual information in a transparent multicomponent decision process. Reflecting these concerns, the writing committee reviewed alternative approaches to incorporating CEA results into guidelines, including relying on US-based studies for identifying a cost-effectiveness threshold or thresholds for cardiovascular CEAs, and Vanness et al used a health opportunity cost approach estimating that for every $1 000 000 increase in health care expenditures, 1869 persons become uninsured, resulting in 81 QALYs lost due to mortality and 15 QALYs lost due to morbidity, implying a cost-effectiveness threshold of $104 000 per QALY ($51 000 to $209 000 per QALY) in 2019 US dollars; in the probabilistic analysis, 40% of the simulations suggested the threshold was less than $100 000 per QALY.

### Improving care and promoting health in populations: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^2eb2a1e2]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Insulin affordability and cost-related medication use in U.S. adults with diabetes — cost-related nonadherence rates, policy caps, and screening: In the U.S., 24.3% of adults with type 1 diabetes and 15.8% of adults with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes reported rationing insulin to save money, and insulin underuse due to cost has been termed "cost-related medication nonadherence." In 2021, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) launched the Part D Senior Savings Model requiring participating plans to cover insulins with a $35 maximum monthly out-of-pocket payment; in 2022, 43% of stand-alone Part D plan enrollees and 60% of Medicare Advantage Part D plan enrollees participated. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 capped out-of-pocket payments for insulin at $35 per insulin per month for all Medicare beneficiaries, and over the past 5 years, 25 states and the District of Columbia capped out-of-pocket expenditures for insulin in select state-regulated commercial plans; between 2023 and 2024, three major insulin manufacturers lowered the price of insulin to $35 per month in select circumstances. Thus, all people with diabetes should be screened for financial hardships of treatment, cost-related barriers to medication use, and rationing of other essential services due to medical costs.

### The cost of large numbers of hypothesis tests on power, effect size and sample size [^4b1c0c24]. Molecular Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Results

For a fixed targeted effect size and fixed sample size, power decreases as the number of tests and corresponding critical value increase (Table 1, Figure 2a). If the power for a single test is 80%, the power is approximately 50% for 10; 10% for 1000; and 1% for 100 000 Bonferroni-adjusted tests. To avoid a drop in nominal power without increasing sample size, an investigator may target larger effect sizes (Table 1, Figure 2b) using equation (1). For one million tests, the effect size multiplier is 2.25 at 80% power and 2.08 at 90% power. Suppose it has been determined that a sample of 100 yields 80% power to detect a difference in group means when the mean in group 1 is 10 and the mean in group 2 is 12. The original sample size of 100 would also yield 80% power to detect a mean difference of 2.25 × 2 = 4.50, with Bonferroni adjustment for one million tests. The effect size multiplier works on the scale of the underlying Normally distributed test statistic. For example, effect size multiplication for an OR should be carried out after conversion to the natural log scale. Suppose 500 total cases and controls provide 90% power to detect an OR = 1.2, the effect size multiplier for 90% power and 1000 tests is 1.65. Since log e (1.2) = 0.18, the same sample of 500 yields 90% power in 1000 tests to detect a log e (OR) = 1.65 × 0.18 = 0.30 or, equivalently, an OR = exp(0.30) = 1.35.

### A one-year trial of tiotropium respimat plus usual therapy in COPD patients [^12fff95a]. Respiratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

In this randomised double-blind study, patients ≥ 40 years old with COPD, a smoking history of ≥ 10 pack-years, a pre-bronchodilator FEV(1) of ≤ 60% predicted and an FEV(1)/FVC of ≤ 70% received tiotropium 5 microg or placebo via Respimat inhaler once daily for 48 weeks. Other medications were permitted except inhaled anticholinergics. Co-primary endpoints were trough FEV(1) and the time to first exacerbation. Adverse events were followed and vital status regularly assessed. In all, 3991 patients (mean age, 65 years [SD, 9 years]) were evaluable. Mean baseline FEV(1) was 1.11 L (0.40 L) or 40% (12%) of predicted normal. Adjusted mean differences in trough FEV(1) and trough FVC at Week 48 (tiotropium minus placebo) were 102 and 168 mL respectively (p < 0.0001, both). Tiotropium delayed time to first exacerbation relative to placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69 [95% CI, 0.63–0.77]) and time to first hospital-treated exacerbation (HR, 0.73 [0.59–0.90]). SGRQ score at Week 48 was 2.9 units lower with tiotropium (p < 0.0001). Adverse and serious adverse events were balanced across treatment groups and similar in profile to previous tiotropium trials. The rate ratio for a major adverse cardiovascular event during the treatment period + 30 days was 1.12 (0.67–1.86). By the end of planned treatment (Day 337) 52 patients on tiotropium (incidence rate per 100 years, 2.94) and 38 on placebo (2.13) had died (HR = 1.38 [0.91–2.10]; p = 0.13). Lung function, exacerbations and quality of life were improved by tiotropium 5 microg Respimat but a numerical imbalance was seen in all-cause mortality. The protocol is registered on the European Clinical Trials Database as trial number 2006-001009-27 and in the ClinicalTrials.gov database as NCT00387088.

### Impact of vaccination against severe COVID-19 in the French population aged 50 years and above: a retrospective population-based study [^64506e78]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Given the widespread implementation of COVID-19 vaccination to mitigate the pandemic from the end of 2020, it is important to retrospectively evaluate its impact, in particular by quantifying the number of severe outcomes prevented through vaccination.

Methods

We estimated the number of hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and deaths directly averted by vaccination in France, in people aged ≥ 50 years, from December 2020 to March 2022, based on (1) the number of observed events, (2) vaccination coverage, and (3) vaccine effectiveness. We accounted for the effect of primary vaccination and the first booster dose, the circulating variants, the age groups, and the waning of vaccine-induced protection over time.

Results

An estimated 480,150 (95% CI: 260,072–582,516) hospitalizations, 132,156 (50,409–157,767) ICU admissions and 125,376 (53,792–152,037) deaths were directly averted by vaccination in people aged ≥ 50 years, which corresponds to a reduction of 63.2% (48.2–67.6), 68.7% (45.6–72.4) and 62.7% (41.9–67.1) respectively, compared to what would have been expected without vaccination over the study period. An estimated 5852 (2285–6853) deaths were directly averted among the 50–59 years old, 16,837 (6568–19,473) among the 60–69 years old, 32,136 (13,651–36,758) among the 70–79 years old and 70,551 (31,288–88,953) among the ≥ 80 years old.

Conclusions

The vaccination campaign in France considerably reduced COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, as well as stress on the healthcare system.

### Trends in costs of care for Medicare beneficiaries treated in the emergency department from 2011 to 2016 [^cb5193e2]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

There is little evidence regarding how total costs of care associated with an emergency department (ED) visit have changed, despite increasing policy focus on the value of acute care.

Objective

To examine trends in total standardized 30-day costs of care associated with an ED visit.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study of 14 113 088 ED visits at 4730 EDs from 2011 to 2016 included a 20% national sample of traditional Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older. Data analysis was conducted from August 2018 to April 2020.

Exposures

Time (year) as a continuous variable.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Trends in disposition from the ED and 30-day total standardized costs for all ED visits as well as the following spending components: index visit cost, physician costs, subsequent ED visit costs, subsequent inpatient costs, subsequent observation costs, non-ED outpatient care, postacute care, and aggregated total spending after the index ED visit.

Results

The analytic sample consisted of 14 113 088 ED visits at 4730 EDs. The mean (SD) beneficiary age was 78.6 (8.6) years, 8 573 652 visits (60.7%) were among women, and 11 908 691 visits (84.7%) were among white patients. The proportion of patients discharged from the ED rose from 1 233 701 of 2 309 563 visits (53.4%) in 2011 to 1 279 701 of 2 268 363 visits (56.4%) in 2016. Total adjusted 30-day standardized costs of care declined from a mean (SE) of $8851 ($35.3) in 2011 to a mean (SE) of $8143 ($35.4) in 2016 (-$126/y; 95% CI, -$130 to -$121; P < .001) for all ED visits. This decrease was primarily associated with a decline in total spending on the index ED visit (-$48/y; 95% CI, -$50 to -$47; P < .001) as well as lower spending on postacute care (-$42/y; 95% CI, -$44 to -$41; P < .001) and subsequent inpatient care (-$34/y; 95% CI, -$36 to -$32; P < .001). There was an increase in spending after the index visit on downstream observation care ($3.6/y; 95% CI, $3.5 to $3.7; P < .001), outpatient ED care ($4.6/y; 95% CI, $4.4 to $4.8; P < .001), and other outpatient care ($15/y; 95% CI, $12 to $18; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, total 30-day standardized costs of ED care for Medicare beneficiaries decreased in recent years. It may be that more intensive ED spending up front is associated with reductions in total costs of an acute episode.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^06880f39]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Primary prevention antiplatelet therapy — In prevention trials, major bleeding was higher with ticagrelor, with "2.3% and 2.6%" for the 90‑mg and 60‑mg groups compared with placebo "1.06%." Advanced age is a vascular risk factor. In ASPREE, patients " ≥ 70 years of age" received "aspirin 100 mg/day" versus placebo; the primary end point included "fatal coronary heart disease, nonfatal MI, fatal or nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure," and with "a median age of 74 years and a median of 4.7 years of follow-up," "there was no reduction in the primary end point or stroke with aspirin therapy"; a prespecified analysis found "a small increase in intracranial bleeding with aspirin use (0.7% absolute increase)." In JPPP focused on stroke among Japanese patients with "a mean age of 71 years," "there was no reduction in stroke associated with aspirin use." In chronic kidney disease, "Among 4468 study participants, no clear benefit was seen with aspirin for major vascular events (HR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.49–1.73]) or stroke (HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.48–1.56])."

### Impact factors: uses and abuses [^4e650f43]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Quantitative assessment of the scientific merit of journals and articles is being used increasingly to assess and compare researchers and institutions. The most commonly used measure is the 2 year Impact Factor, which broadly reflects the number of times each article in the journal has been cited over the previous 2 years. There are clear limitations to the use of such measures - not least, Impact Factors reflect the journal not the article, vary with time and correlate only poorly with perceived excellence. Simple comparison of impact factors in different specialties may be misleading. Review journals often have higher Impact Factors than those with original data. Both authors and editors can try to manipulate journal Impact Factors. However, despite valid concerns, Impact Factors are widely used and offer, at present, the best simple tool for comparison of output. Like all measures, the use of Impact Factors has to be tempered with knowledge of their limitations and common sense used in interpreting any data based on any analysis.

### 2025 ACC scientific statement on the management of obesity in adults with heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology [^8964459b]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Table 3 — Contemporary anti-obesity medication (AOM) trials in heart failure (HF) compare STEP-HFpEF (N = 1,145) and SUMMIT (N = 731). STEP-HFpEF inclusion criteria were age ≥ 18, LVEF ≥ 45%, NYHA II–IV, KCCQ-CSS < 90, 6MWD ≥ 100 m, and BMI ≥ 30 kg/m^2; SUMMIT required age ≥ 40, LVEF ≥ 50%, NYHA II–IV, KCCQ-CSS ≤ 80, 6MWD 100–425 m, and BMI ≥ 30 kg/m^2. Interventions were once-weekly SC semaglutide starting 0.25 mg with 5 dose steps/16 w to maximum 2.4 mg in STEP-HFpEF and once-weekly SC tirzepatide starting 2.5 mg with 6 dose steps/20 w to maximum 15 mg in SUMMIT. Primary endpoints were change in KCCQ-CSS (baseline, 52 wk) and change in body weight (baseline, 52 wk) for STEP-HFpEF, and change in KCCQ-CSS (baseline, 52 wk) plus time to first composite of worsening HF event or cardiovascular death for SUMMIT; key secondary endpoints in both included change in 6MWD (baseline, 52 wk) and change (%) in hs-CRP (baseline, 52 wk), with change in body weight (baseline, 52 wk) also listed for SUMMIT. Baseline characteristics reported, STEP-HFpEF vs SUMMIT respectively, were age, y 69 vs 65; women, % 48 vs 54; NYHA functional class II, % 69 vs 72; LVEF, % 57 vs 61; BMI, kg/m^2 37 vs 37; NT-proBNP, pg/mL 472 vs ~183; eGFR, mL/min/1.73 m^2 69 vs 64; and SGLT2 inhibitor 19 vs 17.

### Two-year effects of semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity: the STEP 5 trial [^0f9f2fa2]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In STEP 5, once-weekly treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg as an adjunct to behavioral intervention in adults with overweight (with at least one weight-related comorbidity) or obesity led to a substantial initial reduction in weight, which plateaued after approximately week 60 and was maintained for the remainder of the study. At week 104, participants in the semaglutide group had achieved a mean weight loss of 15.2% from baseline — a difference of 12.6 percentage points versus placebo plus behavioral intervention. This weight loss is comparable to the mean reduction of 14.9% (placebo-corrected weight loss of 12.4 percentage points) seen at week 68 in the STEP 1 trial of semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo (both plus behavioral intervention). Thus, our findings indicate that the substantial weight losses reported during 68 weeks' treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg in prior STEP trials, can be maintained with continued semaglutide treatment up to at least 104 weeks. The mean weight loss of ~15% achieved with semaglutide 2.4 mg at week 104 in STEP 5 exceeds weight loss reported at similar time points in trials with other pharmacotherapies for weight management in adults with overweight or obesity –.

Weight loss of ≥ 5%, a threshold widely used to indicate a clinically meaningful response to therapy, was achieved by > 75% of participants in the semaglutide group at week 104. Moreover, 61.8% of participants on semaglutide lost ≥ 10% of baseline weight, and over a third of participants had achieved at least 20% weight loss at week 104 in the semaglutide group. As was seen in prior studies, while the vast majority of participants receiving semaglutide 2.4 mg had lost weight at the end of the STEP 5 study, a small proportion of participants experienced weight gain. We do not know how weight would have changed in these participants had they not been receiving the drug; notably, the proportion of patients with weight gain during the study was substantially higher in the placebo group. There is marked variability in weight change in patients on weight management treatments; the reason for this is still unclear and likely involves complex biological and societal influences.
