## Question

How do i manage copd exacerbation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage a COPD exacerbation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding mimics. Then, I should assess severity and decide on the care setting. Next, I will initiate core pharmacologic therapy, including bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics when indicated. After that, I need to consider ventilatory support for respiratory failure. I will then address comorbidities and triggers, implement a discharge and follow-up plan, and finally outline prevention strategies and special populations, making sure each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and exclude mimics, because patients with COPD who present with worsening dyspnea may actually have pneumonia, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, or anxiety, and misclassification is common and consequential for outcomes and readmissions, so I should verify with history, exam, and targeted testing such as chest radiography, ECG, and D-dimer or troponin when indicated [^89aa16ee] [^bfa577f7].

> Wait, let me verify the severity and care setting next, since this drives everything downstream. Severe exacerbations requiring hospitalization or emergency care are those associated with respiratory failure or marked hypoxemia, while more than 80% are managed as outpatients; I should check for respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, mental status, and signs of respiratory distress to decide on ED versus outpatient management and whether to escalate to ventilatory support [^25761199] [^27a42c82].

> I will now examine the core pharmacologic foundation: short-acting inhaled bronchodilators are first-line to relieve symptoms and improve airflow. I should confirm that albuterol with or without ipratropium is used promptly, ideally via MDI with spacer or nebulizer depending on access and severity, and titrate to effect while monitoring for tremor or tachycardia [^995f8786] [^53c9ba8b].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of systemic corticosteroids. A short course of oral prednisone 30–40 mg daily for 5 days improves FEV1, oxygenation, and shortens recovery and hospitalization without added benefit from higher doses or longer courses, so I need to ensure I do not extend beyond 5–7 days unless there is a compelling reason and document the rationale if I do [^bc848390] [^89aa9f94].

> Next, I should review antibiotics, and I need to be careful not to overgeneralize. Let me think about the Anthonisen criteria: increased dyspnea, increased sputum volume, and increased sputum purulence support a bacterial component, and in such cases a 5-day course reduces treatment failure and shortens recovery; however, in mild, nonpurulent exacerbations, antibiotics may not help and stewardship is important, so I should confirm indications before prescribing and tailor to local resistance patterns with options like amoxicillin-clavulanate, macrolides, tetracyclines, or respiratory fluoroquinolones when appropriate [^d6fce20b] [^388209fb] [^a24359ce].

> But wait, what if the patient has acute respiratory failure with hypercapnia? I should double-check that noninvasive ventilation is indicated and initiated early, because in COPD with acute or acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis, NIV improves gas exchange, reduces intubation, shortens hospital stay, and improves survival; I need to ensure there are no absolute contraindications and maximize NIV hours in the first 24 hours when tolerated [^d99d1768] [^42fec73b] [^1486a390].

> I need to ensure oxygen is titrated cautiously. Target SpO2 88–92% in those with risk of hypercapnia to avoid oxygen-induced hypoventilation, and I should monitor ABGs when feasible to track PaCO2 and pH, adjusting oxygen flow to maintain the target range rather than giving uncontrolled high-flow oxygen [^a9180eac].

> Let me consider comorbidities and triggers, because they often drive poor outcomes and readmissions. I should actively screen for and treat heart failure, arrhythmias, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, anxiety or depression, and address modifiable risks like smoking and poor inhaler technique, since these are common and can mimic or worsen exacerbations and are linked to high readmission rates [^89aa16ee] [^619f7a2d].

> Next, I should review the discharge and follow-up plan, and I need to ensure it is actionable. A structured bundle with medication reconciliation, inhaler technique teach-back, written action plan, smoking cessation support, vaccination review, and follow-up within about a week reduces readmissions and improves transitions; I should confirm that pulmonary rehabilitation is arranged within 3 weeks post-discharge when feasible, as this improves recovery and reduces recurrence risk [^be29e2ba] [^be29e2ba] [^166bfb2f].

> Hold on, I should verify prevention strategies because the acute episode is a teachable moment. Escalating to LAMA or LABA/LAMA for frequent exacerbators, adding ICS only when indicated for asthma overlap or persistent exacerbations despite LABA/LAMA, smoking cessation, vaccinations, and structured self-management with action plans reduce future events; I should also consider long-term macrolides in carefully selected frequent exacerbators after weighing risks and benefits [^db17c630] [^9a49e3b8] [^be29e2ba].

> I should double-check special populations and settings. In older adults, exacerbations carry higher mortality and longer recovery, so I need a lower threshold for hospitalization and closer follow-up; in primary care, I should avoid rescue packs and instead provide individualized action plans with clear stop criteria; in resource-limited settings, hospital-at-home models with remote monitoring can be safe and effective alternatives to inpatient care when appropriately selected [^3dcdc2ea] [^feb0f551] [^c3694902].

> Let me reconsider the overall flow to ensure nothing is missing: confirm diagnosis and exclude mimics, assess severity to choose setting, initiate SABA ± SAMA promptly, add systemic corticosteroids for most moderate–severe cases, give antibiotics when bacterial features are present, escalate to NIV for respiratory failure, address comorbidities and triggers, implement a robust discharge bundle with early follow-up, and embed prevention strategies to reduce recurrence, aligning each step with GOLD and contemporary guidelines [^53c9ba8b] [^27a42c82].

COPD exacerbations are managed with a **stepwise approach** based on severity: use short-acting bronchodilators for all, add systemic corticosteroids for moderate-to-severe cases, and give antibiotics when bacterial infection is suspected. Noninvasive ventilation is indicated for acute respiratory failure with hypercapnia. Monitor oxygen to avoid CO2 narcosis, correct reversible causes, and arrange close follow-up with self-management education to reduce recurrence [^53c9ba8b] [^d99d1768] [^a9180eac].

---

## Initial assessment and severity classification

- **Severity assessment**: Classify as mild, moderate, or severe based on symptoms, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, arterial blood gases, and mental status [^notfound].

- **Severity classification**: Mild (outpatient, no respiratory failure), moderate (outpatient/inpatient, no respiratory failure), severe (inpatient, respiratory failure or altered mental status) [^25761199].

- **Differential diagnosis**: Exclude pneumonia, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, and asthma exacerbation [^89aa16ee].

---

## Pharmacological management

### Bronchodilators

Use **short-acting bronchodilators** (SABA ± SAMA) as first-line therapy for all exacerbations to relieve symptoms and improve airflow [^995f8786] [^53c9ba8b]. Increase frequency and dose as needed, and consider adding a long-acting bronchodilator once stable [^c25bdd85].

---

### Systemic corticosteroids

Indicated for **moderate-to-severe exacerbations** to improve FEV1, oxygenation, and shorten recovery and hospital stay [^bc848390]. Use prednisone 40 mg orally once daily for 5 days; longer courses are not recommended [^89aa9f94].

---

### Antibiotics

Indicated when there is **increased sputum purulence plus increased volume/dyspnea** or when mechanical ventilation is required [^d6fce20b]. Use amoxicillin-clavulanate, macrolide, or doxycycline for 5 days; tailor to local resistance patterns [^d6fce20b] [^a24359ce].

---

### Noninvasive ventilation (NIV)

Indicated for **acute respiratory failure with hypercapnia (pH ≤ 7.35)** to improve gas exchange, reduce intubation, and improve survival [^d99d1768] [^42fec73b]. Contraindications include facial trauma, vomiting, or inability to protect the airway.

---

## Non-pharmacological management

- **Oxygen therapy**: Target SpO2 88–92% to avoid CO2 narcosis; monitor ABGs in hypercapnic patients [^a9180eac].

- **Fluid and electrolyte management**: Correct imbalances and monitor renal function.

- **Pulmonary rehabilitation**: Start within 3 weeks post-discharge to improve recovery and reduce recurrence [^166bfb2f] [^4fe98a1f].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Track **respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, mental status, and ABGs** in severe cases. Watch for complications such as respiratory failure, pneumonia, and cardiac arrhythmias. Arrange follow-up within 4 weeks with spirometry, medication review, and self-management education [^notfound].

---

## Prevention strategies

- **Smoking cessation**: Strongly recommended to reduce exacerbations and slow progression [^notfound].

- **Vaccinations**: Influenza, pneumococcal, and COVID-19 vaccines are recommended [^notfound].

- **Self-management education**: Teach symptom recognition and action plans to enable early treatment [^be29e2ba].

- **Long-term pharmacotherapy**: LAMA, LABA, or LABA/LAMA with or without ICS based on exacerbation risk and symptoms [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

In **elderly patients**, use caution with sedatives and monitor closely for complications. In **comorbidities**, actively manage cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and osteoporosis. In **recurrent exacerbations**, consider long-term macrolides or roflumilast in selected patients [^9a49e3b8].

---

Effective COPD exacerbation management requires a **stepwise approach** — bronchodilators for all, corticosteroids and antibiotics as indicated, and NIV for respiratory failure — plus close monitoring, prevention strategies, and follow-up to reduce recurrence and improve outcomes [^53c9ba8b].

### Guidelines for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^a06ec887]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory condition characterized by progressive decline in lung function. It imposes a considerable burden on patients, healthcare services and society that is likely to increase in the future. It is, therefore, important to ensure that this disease is managed as effectively as possible. In many therapeutic areas, management guidelines have been developed in an attempt to ensure that physicians are aware of optimal disease management and cost-effective use of healthcare resources. Such guidelines are usually prepared by consensus among clinical experts or following a systematic review of the evidence. However, there are a number of barriers to the implementation of treatment guidelines, including the sheer weight of guidelines in all therapeutic areas, a focus on scientific knowledge rather than on clinical practice, lack of trust in the recommendations, practical considerations (e.g. time, resources, budget) and failure to include the perspective of patients. The management guidelines most likely to be implemented are those that are quick and easy to use, relevant to the user's practice and from a credible source. In COPD, over 40 guidelines have been developed, mainly by local respiratory societies as a result of local expert consensus. The guidelines developed by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) are evidence-based and have the backing of international experts. Local implementation plans have been developed to help ensure that GOLD recommendations are implemented in practice. In all COPD guidelines, however, lung function measures feature prominently with limited reference to outcome measures of interest to patients and healthcare payers (e.g. frequency of exacerbations requiring hospitalization). Low expectations among physicians and patients may also impair implementation. In conclusion, guidelines may improve the management of COPD, but the main challenge is to ensure implementation.

### Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: in search of diagnostic biomarkers and treatable traits [^336252de]. Thorax (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are associated with a significant mortality, health and economic burden. Their diagnosis, assessment and management remain suboptimal and unchanged for decades. Recent clinical and translational studies revealed that the significant heterogeneity in mechanisms and outcomes of exacerbations could be resolved by grouping them etiologically. This is anticipated to lead to a better understanding of the biological processes that underlie each type of exacerbation and to allow the introduction of precision medicine interventions that could improve outcomes. This review summarises novel data on the diagnosis, phenotyping, targeted treatment and prevention of COPD exacerbations.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a need for action [^a5714eb5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, with exacerbations contributing strongly to the overall severity and burden of disease at the individual level. Many patients with COPD are managed predominantly in the primary care setting; therefore, primary care physicians (PCPs) must be aware of and understand the causes, effects, and management of COPD exacerbations. This review offers practical information about how exacerbations are defined in the treatment setting, pathogenic and environmental causes, options for exacerbation treatment and prevention, and suggestions for improving care in the clinic. Exacerbations have a strong negative effect on patients and are associated with an increased risk of further exacerbations and decreases in lung function. Thus, it is important that exacerbations not requiring hospitalization be identified and confidently managed in the clinical setting. Understanding treatment options for acute exacerbations and maintenance treatment to prevent future exacerbations may help PCPs better understand what they can do to support their patients. This review aims to provide useful guidance for PCPs to identify exacerbations and adjust their practice for optimal management of exacerbations in patients with COPD. It also aims to encourage PCPs that they have an important task in integrating effective COPD management into the primary care setting.

### Management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a state of the art review [^2eb27961]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are important events in the natural history of this prevalent and devastating condition. This review provides a concise, state of the art summary on prevention and management of exacerbations. Considerable new data underpins evidence in support of many preventative interventions, pharmacological and non-pharmacological, that are now available. Challenges remain in developing new approaches, and delivering those that already exist to the right patient at the right time. Management of an exacerbation remains stepwise according to clinical severity, but there is now additional focus on addressing comorbidities and taking the opportunity at acute events to optimise preventative strategies for the future. Ultimately, exacerbations are heterogeneous events in a heterogeneous disease, and an individualised approach is paramount.

### Controversies in treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^27196cb6]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic disorder with substantial comorbidity and major effects attributable to the high morbidity and mortality rates. Despite an increasing evidence base, some important controversies in COPD management still exist. The classic way to define COPD has been based on spirometric criteria, but more relevant diagnostic methods are needed that can be used to describe COPD severity and comorbidity. Initiation of interventions earlier in the natural history of the disease to slow disease progression is debatable, there are many controversies about the role of inhaled corticosteroids in the management of COPD, and long-term antibiotics for prevention of exacerbation have had a resurgence in interest. Novel therapeutic drugs are urgently needed for optimum management of the acute COPD exacerbation. COPD is a complex disease and consists of several clinically relevant phenotypes that in future will guide its management.

### Hospital management of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^0cd3f95f]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is often complicated by episodes of acute worsening of respiratory symptoms, which may lead to escalation of therapy and occasionally emergency department visits and hospitalization. Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) have a negative impact on quality of life and hasten the decline of lung function. They also significantly contribute to the direct and indirect healthcare costs of this disease. Severe exacerbations (those leading to hospital admission) have been associated with significant poor outcomes including an increased risk of readmissions and mortality. COPD is currently the fourth leading cause of hospital readmission in the United States. In this review, we will provide a broad overview on the etiology, assessment, management, discharge planning, and follow-up care of patients hospitalized with AECOPD.

### Impact of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations on patients and payers [^a9929985]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is not only an established major cause of mortality and morbidity but is increasing in worldwide prevalence despite current medical interventions. The natural history of COPD is punctuated by periods of acute symptomatic, physiologic, and functional deterioration or exacerbations. These events are responsible for considerable additional morbidity and mortality and impact on patients' long-term health status. Despite advances in understanding disease mechanisms and in treatment, exacerbations continue to be the major cause of COPD-associated hospitalization, and provision for their management incurs considerable health care costs. Although pharmacologic therapies may improve clinical outcomes, these benefits must be optimized by prompt diagnosis and delivery. This will require improved understanding of this complex disease by physicians and patients alike.

### Goals of COPD treatment: focus on symptoms and exacerbations [^9c993736]. Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is currently a leading cause of death worldwide, and its burden is expected to rise in the coming years. Common COPD symptoms include dyspnea, cough and/or sputum production. Some patients may experience acute worsening of symptoms (known as an exacerbation), and therefore require additional therapy. Exacerbations are mainly triggered by respiratory infections and environmental factors. Healthcare professionals face many challenges in COPD management, including the heterogeneity of the disease and under-reporting of symptoms. The authors review these challenges and provide recommendations for the best methods to assess COPD. The goals of COPD treatment include recognising the impact that both symptoms and exacerbations have on patients' lives when considering optimal patient-focused management. The review discusses the need for COPD management strategies to include both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic approaches and provides recommendations for monitoring treatment outcomes and adjusting management strategies accordingly. Novel treatment strategies including precision medicine and point-of-care testing are also discussed.

### Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a Primer for emergency physicians [^ab8db19b]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) impose a significant burden on patients and the emergency health care system. Patients with COPD who present to the emergency department (ED) often have comorbidities that can complicate their management.

Objective

To discuss strategies for the management of acute exacerbations in the ED, from initial assessment through disposition, to enable effective patient care and minimize the risk of treatment failure and prevent hospital readmissions.

Discussion

Establishing a correct diagnosis early on is critical; therefore, initial evaluations should be aimed at differentiating COPD exacerbations from other life-threatening conditions. Disposition decisions are based on the intensity of symptoms, presence of comorbidities, severity of the disease, and response to therapy. Patients who are appropriate for discharge from the ED should be prescribed evidence-based treatments and smoking cessation to prevent disease progression. A patient-centric discharge care plan should include medication reconciliation; bedside "teach-back", wherein patients demonstrate proper inhaler usage; and prompt follow-up.

Conclusions

An effective assessment, accurate diagnosis, and appropriate discharge plan for patients with AECOPD could improve treatment outcomes, reduce hospitalization, and decrease unplanned repeat visits to the ED.

### Antibiotics for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^40d50e7b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Many patients with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are treated with antibiotics. However, the value of antibiotics remains uncertain, as systematic reviews and clinical trials have shown conflicting results.

Objectives

To assess effects of antibiotics on treatment failure as observed between seven days and one month after treatment initiation (primary outcome) for management of acute COPD exacerbations, as well as their effects on other patient-important outcomes (mortality, adverse events, length of hospital stay, time to next exacerbation).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and other electronically available databases up to 26 September 2018.

Selection Criteria

We sought to find randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including people with acute COPD exacerbations comparing antibiotic therapy and placebo and providing follow-up of at least seven days.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened references and extracted data from trial reports. We kept the three groups of outpatients, inpatients, and patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) separate for benefit outcomes and mortality because we considered them to be clinically too different to be summarised as a single group. We considered outpatients to have a mild to moderate exacerbation, inpatients to have a severe exacerbation, and ICU patients to have a very severe exacerbation. When authors of primary studies did not report outcomes or study details, we contacted them to request missing data. We calculated pooled risk ratios (RRs) for treatment failure, Peto odds ratios (ORs) for rare events (mortality and adverse events), and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes using random-effects models. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. The primary outcome was treatment failure as observed between seven days and one month after treatment initiation.

Main Results

We included 19 trials with 2663 participants (11 with outpatients, seven with inpatients, and one with ICU patients). For outpatients (with mild to moderate exacerbations), evidence of low quality suggests that currently available antibiotics statistically significantly reduced the risk for treatment failure between seven days and one month after treatment initiation (RR 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56 to 0.94; I² = 31%; in absolute terms, reduction in treatment failures from 295 to 212 per 1000 treated participants, 95% CI 165 to 277). Studies providing older antibiotics not in use anymore yielded an RR of 0.69 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.90; I² = 31%). Evidence of low quality from one trial in outpatients suggested no effects of antibiotics on mortality (Peto OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.49 to 3.30). One trial reported no effects of antibiotics on re-exacerbations between two and six weeks after treatment initiation. Only one trial (N = 35) reported health-related quality of life but did not show a statistically significant difference between treatment and control groups. Evidence of moderate quality does not show that currently used antibiotics statistically significantly reduced the risk of treatment failure among inpatients with severe exacerbations (i.e. for inpatients excluding ICU patients) (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.12; I² = 50%), but trial results remain uncertain. In turn, the effect was statistically significant when trials included older antibiotics no longer in clinical use (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.00; I² = 39%). Evidence of moderate quality from two trials including inpatients shows no beneficial effects of antibiotics on mortality (Peto OR 2.48, 95% CI 0.94 to 6.55). Length of hospital stay (in days) was similar in antibiotic and placebo groups. The only trial with 93 patients admitted to the ICU showed a large and statistically significant effect on treatment failure (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.45; moderate-quality evidence; in absolute terms, reduction in treatment failures from 565 to 107 per 1000 treated participants, 95% CI 45 to 254). Results of this trial show a statistically significant effect on mortality (Peto OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.72; moderate-quality evidence) and on length of hospital stay (MD -9.60 days, 95% CI -12.84 to -6.36; low-quality evidence). Evidence of moderate quality gathered from trials conducted in all settings shows no statistically significant effect on overall incidence of adverse events (Peto OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.63; moderate-quality evidence) nor on diarrhoea (Peto OR 1.68, 95% CI 0.92 to 3.07; moderate-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Researchers have found that antibiotics have some effect on inpatients and outpatients, but these effects are small, and they are inconsistent for some outcomes (treatment failure) and absent for other outcomes (mortality, length of hospital stay). Analyses show a strong beneficial effect of antibiotics among ICU patients. Few data are available on the effects of antibiotics on health-related quality of life or on other patient-reported symptoms, and data show no statistically significant increase in the risk of adverse events with antibiotics compared to placebo. These inconsistent effects call for research into clinical signs and biomarkers that can help identify patients who would benefit from antibiotics, while sparing antibiotics for patients who are unlikely to experience benefit and for whom downsides of antibiotics (side effects, costs, and multi-resistance) should be avoided.

### Practical management problems of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the elderly: acute exacerbations [^3dcdc2ea]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ECOPDs) have numerous causes and are associated with increased mortality and hospitalization, especially in older patients. The urgent need to identify and enable timely treatment of ECOPDs is a necessity for physicians worldwide. This review will highlight the causes and optimal combinations of available treatments for such events in older populations.

Recent Findings

The exact definition of exacerbations is lacking; however, it is agreed that such events are considered episodes of worsening of symptoms, leading to morbidity and death. The aging process is a consistent determinant for ECOPD events and is associated with worsening of COPD stages. The incidence of ECOPD rises across the worsening stages of COPD. Studies have shown that the frequency of exacerbations increases with age and correlated clinical outcomes are poorer than in younger patients. The risk of mortality has also been shown to be significantly higher after a hospital admission following an acute exacerbation. At the moment, the need to rapidly and correctly treat acute exacerbations is crucially important in the rapidly growing elderly population.

Summary

ECOPDs are extremely dangerous events for older patients with severe stages of COPD. There is an urgent need to identify risk factors, identify tolerable treatment guidelines and manage acute exacerbations in older patients with COPD.

### Complexity in clinical diagnoses of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^bfa577f7]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare cost. The 2022 GOLD guidelines define AECOPD as an acute worsening of respiratory symptoms that results in additional therapy. However, it is increasingly recognized that AECOPD is heterogenous. Exacerbations have a range of underlying etiologies and clinicopathological processes manifesting with similar syndromic phenotypes, each of which could have different prognosis and response to therapy. A diagnosis of AECOPD relies on subjective symptoms, and non-specific clinical features, which can be confounded by several associated comorbidities that are highly prevalent in the COPD population. It is not uncommon that COPD patients presenting with dyspnea receive a diagnosis of AECOPD, pneumonia, and congestive heart failure all in one setting. This ambiguity leads to a broad, complex, and potentially unnecessary treatment regimen.

We aimed to identify clinical, radiographic, and laboratory characteristics that might help distinguish AECOPD from symptoms secondary to another dominant disease in patients with a history of COPD.

The vision: personalised management of COPD exacerbations

Assessment, management and prevention of exacerbations are anticipated to change significantly in the future. As described, the heterogeneity in mechanisms and outcomes of COPD exacerbations can be resolved by grouping them aetiologically. Therefore, the main challenge to tackle is the development and validation of accurate biomarkers for early characterisation of the different types of exacerbations, which clearly extend beyond bacterial, viral and eosinophilic exacerbations that were discussed in detail here (figure 1). Such biomarkers could facilitate optimisation of exacerbation management and development of novel, targeted treatments. Since most exacerbations are addressed in primary care, the selected biomarkers will need to be measurable rapidly, near the patient, and simple, to facilitate implementation in primary care. RCTs focusing on the management of specific exacerbation subgroups are needed. These are likely to improve the clinical outcomes of exacerbations, but also COPD in general.

### Management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a state of the art review [^0cd090e9]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Affecting 10% of the population over the age of 40 years, the burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has reached epidemic proportions. COPD is defined by the presence of poorly reversible airflow obstruction and an abnormal inflammatory response in the lung to noxious particles or gases. Punctuating the decline in lung function are acute deteriorations in respiratory health, termed exacerbations. As discussed further below, exacerbations are important events in the natural history of COPD. This review provides a critical summary of present exacerbation therapies and aims to update the reader on recent developments in the treatment and prevention of exacerbations in COPD.

### Management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a state of the art review [^f310acaf]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Exacerbations are important events in COPD. Management of the acute event remains dependent on inhaled short-acting bronchodilators, oral corticosteroids and antibiotics, with or without oxygen and ventilatory support. Comorbidities should be addressed. Given the importance of these events, effective care should also include deployment of strategies, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, to reduce future exacerbations. Although new approaches are in development, a major current challenge is to understand which strategies to use in which patients at which stage of their disease. COPD exacerbations are heterogeneous events occurring in a heterogeneous disease and there is no 'one size fits all' approach to COPD exacerbation management and prevention.

### Research opportunities in the management of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^91de9a1a]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are a common problem in the emergency department. Despite considerable research involving the management of this disease over the past decade, much remains unclear from an emergency medicine perspective. Increased research would better guide the management of these complex patients from the perspectives of the patient, the caregiver, and society. The major areas of research can be divided into diagnosis, therapy, and education. The reliability and validity of different definitions of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease need to be assessed. The utility and performance characteristics of diagnostic testing need to be determined for this difficult patient population. Specific diagnostic tests include measures of dyspnea, spirometry and exercise tolerance, measures of gas exchange, airway inflammation, and chest imaging. It remains unclear which patient-specific therapies (oxygen, bronchodilators, corticosteroids, antibiotics, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, and methylxanthines) should be used and monitored. Finally, the utility of education of both health care providers and patients and how it may be applied to the acute setting need to be addressed.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease management: the evidence base [^b80663a0]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

In long-term management of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a number of medications improve pulmonary function test results. The long-term clinical benefits of those drugs would seem intuitive, but there is very little strong evidence that long-term outcomes in COPD are substantially affected by those drugs. Nevertheless, symptom improvement such as dyspnea reduction is certainly strong reason to use those agents. The 2 most compelling bodies of evidence in stable COPD are for oxygen therapy in the chronically hypoxemic patient and pulmonary rehabilitation to improve exercise tolerance and dyspnea. Inhaled corticosteroids also appear to be useful in patients at risk for frequent exacerbations. In acute exacerbations, the rationale for therapy comes in part from the large body of literature regarding acute asthma therapy. Bronchodilator therapy and corticosteroids both seem to reduce the severity and the duration of exacerbations. Moreover, routine antibiotic use seems beneficial, and the role of noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation with patients suffering impending respiratory failure from acute COPD exacerbations is well supported by the literature.

### Management of acute exacerbation of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the emergency department [^10fc1cda]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Acute asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations are the most common respiratory diseases requiring emergent medical evaluation and treatment. Asthma and COPD are chronic, debilitating disease processes that have been differentiated traditionally by the presence or absence of reversible airflow obstruction. Asthma and COPD exacerbations impose an enormous economic burden on the US health care budget. In daily clinical practice, it is difficult to differentiate these 2 obstructive processes based on their symptoms, and on their nearly identical acute treatment strategies; major differences are important when discussing anatomic sites involved, long-term prognosis, and the nature of inflammatory markers.

### Antibiotics for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^08e61463]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Many patients with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are treated with antibiotics. However, the value of antibiotics remains uncertain as systematic reviews and clinical trials have shown conflicting results.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics in the management of acute COPD exacerbations on treatment failure as observed between seven days and one month after treatment initiation (primary outcome) and on other patient-important outcomes (mortality, adverse events, length of hospital stay).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and other electronically available databases up to September 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in people with acute COPD exacerbations comparing antibiotic therapy and placebo with a follow-up of at least seven days.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened references and extracted data from trial reports. We kept the three groups of outpatients, inpatients and patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) separate for benefit outcomes and mortality because we considered them to be clinically too different to be summarised in one group. We considered outpatients to have a mild to moderate exacerbation, inpatients to have a severe exacerbation and ICU patients to have a very severe exacerbation. Where outcomes or study details were not reported we requested missing data from the authors of the primary studies. We calculated pooled risk ratios (RR) for treatment failure, Peto odds ratios (OR) for rare events (mortality and adverse events) and weighted mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes using fixed-effect models. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

Sixteen trials with 2068 participants were included. In outpatients (mild to moderate exacerbations), there was evidence of low quality that antibiotics did statistically significantly reduce the risk for treatment failure between seven days and one month after treatment initiation (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.94; I(2) = 35%) but they did not significantly reduce the risk when the meta-analysis was restricted to currently available drugs (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.01; I(2) = 33%). Evidence of high quality showed that antibiotics statistically significantly reduced the risk of treatment failure in inpatients with severe exacerbations (ICU not included) (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.91; I(2) = 47%) regardless of whether restricted to current drugs. The only trial with 93 patients admitted to the ICU showed a large and statistically significant effect on treatment failure (RR 0.19; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.45; high-quality evidence). Evidence of low-quality from four trials in inpatients showed no effect of antibiotics on mortality (Peto OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.37 to 2.79). High-quality evidence from one trial showed a statistically significant effect on mortality in ICU patients (Peto OR 0.21; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.72). Length of hospital stay (in days) was similar in the antibiotics and placebo groups except for the ICU study where antibiotics statistically significantly reduced length of hospital stay (mean difference -9.60 days; 95% CI -12.84 to -6.36 days). One trial showed no effect of antibiotics on re-exacerbations between two and six weeks after treatment initiation. Only one trial (N = 35) reported health-related quality of life but did not show a statistically significant difference between the treatment and control group. Evidence of moderate quality showed that the overall incidence of adverse events was higher in the antibiotics groups (Peto OR 1.53; 95% CI 1.03 to 2.27). Patients treated with antibiotics experienced statistically significantly more diarrhoea based on three trials (Peto OR 2.62; 95% CI 1.11 to 6.17; high-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotics for COPD exacerbations showed large and consistent beneficial effects across outcomes of patients admitted to an ICU. However, for outpatients and inpatients the results were inconsistent. The risk for treatment failure was significantly reduced in both inpatients and outpatients when all trials (1957 to 2012) were included but not when the analysis for outpatients was restricted to currently used antibiotics. Also, antibiotics had no statistically significant effect on mortality and length of hospital stay in inpatients and almost no data on patient-reported outcomes exist. These inconsistent effects call for research into clinical signs and biomarkers that help identify patients who benefit from antibiotics and patients who experience no effect, and in whom downsides of antibiotics (side effects, costs and multi-resistance) could be avoided.

### Strategies to decrease exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: can they impact disease progression? [^b2e30159]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Preventing disease progression is a key element of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) management. COPD exacerbations are adverse events that can result in a decline of lung function that can persevere. Therefore, reducing exacerbation frequency has the potential to affect disease progression and improve health status of COPD patients. This narrative review explores monitoring for disease progression in COPD and its potential association with COPD exacerbations.

Recent Findings

Pharmacotherapy can slow down disease progression, but the effect is mediated only in part by reducing exacerbations. While disease progression is continuous, patients with established airflow obstruction in early stages appear more vulnerable to faster declines in lung function. Longitudinal monitoring of lung function and structure is necessary to identify patients with disease progression.

Summary

Pharmacotherapy is an effective option for preventing disease progression. A holistic approach including longitudinal pulmonary function testing, clinical symptoms and imaging may be necessary to detect disease progression for early intervention.

### Development of a patient-centred, evidence-based and consensus-based discharge care bundle for patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1194d0b8]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common, chronic lung disease characterised by progressive and not fully reversible airflow limitation. Acute exacerbations of COPD are defined by worsening in patients' baseline symptoms of dyspnoea, cough and sputum (quantity and purulence); exacerbations become more frequent and severe as the disease progresses. These events constitute the single most important determinant of health status in patients with COPDand account for increased morbidity, frequent emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalisations and death.

A cornerstone of COPD management is preventing acute exacerbations of COPD and breaking the cycle of recurrence. A large body of evidence supports both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to reduce the risk of acute exacerbations of COPD and improve overall health status. Despite this evidence, important care gaps remain as patients are often discharged from hospital or the ED following an acute exacerbation of COPD with no clear plan to prevent future episodes. Information exchange between hospital, ED and primary care physicians about the acute exacerbation of COPD is often incomplete or unavailable at the first postdischarge outpatient appointment. Often, patients and families assume care coordination responsibilities and personally convey follow-up instructions to primary care physicians. Information is sometimes provided verbally, and patients often struggle with health literacy issues. This creates a critical situation in which inaccurate information is translated from acute to community care settings. There is a need to improve transitions of care for patients with COPD across ED, hospital and community settings and ensure coordination and continuity of care.

Exacerbation prevention

In contrast to treatment of acute events, recent years have seen publication of landmark trials in COPD which inform on exacerbation prevention and we now have a wide range of options available, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, to reduce exacerbation frequency. These are listed in Table 1, which also includes interventions known to reduce COPD hospitalisation (a closely related concept). Perhaps the greatest remaining challenge is to establish which patient will benefit from which combination of approaches, though there is still the need for novel interventions as current approaches are incompletely effective.

### Quantifying of severity of exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: adaptations to the definition to allow quantification [^2ee7999a]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2007). Low credibility.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) offer a considerable clinical challenge for clinical practice and drug development. The underlying pathobiology of these characteristic events is unclear. We are far behind other disease areas, such as cardiology, where there are effective approaches for diagnosing and managing acute and potentially fatal events. A joint initiative has begun between the pharmaceutical industry, academia, and the Food and Drug Administration to produce a valid diary card measure of exacerbation severity: the EXAcerbations of Chronic pulmonary disease Test-Patient-Reported Outcome (EXACT-PRO). This article describes the background to this initiative, using the consensus definition of a COPD exacerbation as the starting point from which to propose a new method for quantifying the severity of the event. This approach takes into account the relationships between the symptoms that make up an exacerbation and shows that they can be used in a single continuous severity scale. Methods for defining exacerbation onset and cessation are also proposed.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: GOLD executive summary [^22664f95]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a global health problem, and since 2001, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) has published its strategy document for the diagnosis and management of COPD. This executive summary presents the main contents of the second 5-year revision of the GOLD document that has implemented some of the vast knowledge about COPD accumulated over the last years. Today, GOLD recommends that spirometry is required for the clinical diagnosis of COPD to avoid misdiagnosis and to ensure proper evaluation of severity of airflow limitation. The document highlights that the assessment of the patient with COPD should always include assessment of (1) symptoms, (2) severity of airflow limitation, (3) history of exacerbations, and (4) comorbidities. The first three points can be used to evaluate level of symptoms and risk of future exacerbations, and this is done in a way that splits patients with COPD into four categories-A, B, C, and D. Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of COPD match this assessment in an evidence-based attempt to relieve symptoms and reduce risk of exacerbations. Identification and treatment of comorbidities must have high priority, and a separate section in the document addresses management of comorbidities as well as COPD in the presence of comorbidities. The revised document also contains a new section on exacerbations of COPD. The GOLD initiative will continue to bring COPD to the attention of all relevant shareholders and will hopefully inspire future national and local guidelines on the management of COPD.

### 'Exacerbation-free time' to assess the impact of exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): a prospective observational study [^4985ddc6]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Many patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) experience exacerbations, which are defined as 'sustained worsenings of the patient's condition from the stable state, and beyond normal day-to-day variation, that are acute in onset and necessitate a change in regular medication'. Exacerbations lead to accelerated decline in lung function, worse health status, and increased health care utilisation, and are the main cause of COPD-related hospitalisationsand mortality. In order to decrease the burden of exacerbations, prevention and prompt treatment of exacerbations are important goals in COPD patient management.

Intervention studies in COPD often assess exacerbation frequency (i.e. a simple count of the number of exacerbation episodes within a certain time frame, usually a year) as a primary outcome measure. However, measuring just the frequency of exacerbations has limitations. First, the definitions and algorithms used to calculate exacerbation frequency vary considerably between studies, and the choice for a particular definition or algorithm may influence the results substantially. Also, exacerbation frequency may not be the most appropriate measure in every study. For example, interventions that focus on improving exacerbation self-management are not so much designed to prevent the occurrence of exacerbations, but to shorten the duration of an exacerbation and prevent its further escalation by early recognition and prompt treatment. Furthermore, exacerbation frequency is used in clinical settings to categorise COPD severity or to select patients for particular treatment options (for instance inhaled corticosteroids or long-acting bronchodilators), but is only moderately related to patient-reported outcomes such as quality of life.

### Management of severe COPD [^bc866025]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and the burden of the disorder will continue to increase over the next 20 years despite medical intervention. Apart from smoking cessation, no approach or agent affects the rate of decline in lung function and progression of the disease. Especially in the later phase, COPD is a multicomponent disorder, and various integrated intervention strategies are needed as part of the optimum management programme. This seminar describes largely non-pharmacological interventions aimed at improving health status and function of disabled patients. Exacerbations become progressively more troublesome as baseline lung function declines, commonly necessitating hospital admission and associated with the development of acute respiratory failure.

### Managing COPD exacerbations in primary care [^feb0f551]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common but underdiagnosed lung condition that is frequently managed inappropriately. It impacts poorest communities most, where health inequalities are greatest. New acute symptoms of breathlessness, cough, sputum production and wheeze should prompt clinical suspicion of underlying COPD in someone who is a current or ex-smoker (or has exposure to other risk factors) and be followed by referral for quality-assured spirometry once recovered. Management of COPD exacerbations in primary care includes use of short-acting bronchodilators if mild, and antibiotics and a short course of oral prednisolone if moderate/severe. Hospital at home schemes are safe and effective and should be considered for some patients exacerbating in the community; these are increasingly supported by remote monitoring ('virtual wards'). New or worsening hypoxia is an indication for hospital admission and therefore oxygen saturation monitoring is an important part of exacerbation management; clinicians should be aware of patient safety alerts around use of pulse oximeters. Exacerbations drive poor health status and lung function decline and therefore asking about exacerbation frequency at planned reviews and taking action to reduce these is an important part of long-term COPD care. An exacerbation is an opportunity to ensure that fundamentals of good care are addressed. Patients should be supported to understand and act on exacerbations through a supported self-management plan; prompt treatment is beneficial but should be balanced by careful antibiotic and corticosteroid stewardship. COPD rescue packs on repeat prescription are not recommended.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have a profound effect on the patient's health status and decline in lung function; they also impose a significant burden on healthcare resource utilization. Prevention and treatment of exacerbations is listed by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) as among the major objectives of COPD management, and it is therefore an important outcome measure when studying any new agent. This article discusses pharmacologic therapy and other measures for preventing exacerbations and hospitalizations due to exacerbations of COPD.

### Acute exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: should we use antibiotics and if so, which ones? [^5e0837ee]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute exacerbations are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with evidence suggesting at least 50% of exacerbations involve bacteria that benefit from antibiotic treatment. Here, we review the most relevant data regarding the use of antibiotics in exacerbations of COPD and provide insights on the selection of initial antibiotic therapy for their treatment.

Recent Findings

Identification of bacterial exacerbations still relies on clinical assessment rather than laboratory biomarkers. Several recent studies, including a meta-analysis and placebo-controlled trials, demonstrate improved outcomes with antibiotics in all but mild exacerbations of COPD, including both inpatient and outpatient. A broader antibiotic regimen should be used for patients who have risk factors for poor outcomes. A risk-stratification approach can guide antibiotic choice, although the stratification algorithm still needs to be validated in a randomized controlled trial.

Summary

The use of antibiotics for the treatment of moderate-to-severe suspected bacterial exacerbations in COPD is supported by published trials and evidence-based systematic reviews. Recent trials also show differences in outcomes based on antibiotic choice. More research is necessary to evaluate risk stratification approaches when selecting initial antibiotic therapy.

The biology and importance of COPD exacerbations

Exacerbations are key events in COPD, defined by the presence of worsening symptoms but also often associated with concurrent deteriorations in pulmonary function and increases in both local and systemic inflammation. Exacerbations are caused by those insults that increase airway inflammation, principally episodes of bronchial infection, but also pollutants or stimuli that directly affect expiratory flow limitation.

Although it is generally true that exacerbations become more frequent as the severity of the underlying COPD increases, there are large differences in exacerbation incidence rates ('exacerbation frequency') between individual patients, and patients susceptible to more frequent exacerbations ('frequent exacerbators') appear to be a distinct phenotype susceptible to a more rapid decline in lung function, poorer quality of life and increased mortality. They are therefore a particularly important group to target for the exacerbation prevention strategies that are described below. There is emerging evidence to suggest that a proportion of patients with milder COPD may be susceptible to frequent exacerbations.

Exacerbations are very heterogeneous events ranging from no more than troublesome increases in respiratory symptoms to life-threatening episodes of respiratory failure. A typical community-treated exacerbation in a patient with moderately severe COPD has a short prodrome and a median symptom duration of 7 days, though some are considerably longer and a proportion of patients may never completely return to their pre-exacerbation baseline. Exacerbations in more severe disease commonly require hospitalisation, and they are a much more common cause of emergency hospital admission than, for example, exacerbations of asthma. Therefore, in addition to significant personal detriment to the patient, exacerbations of COPD demand a considerable portion of healthcare expenditure. Moreover, with an ageing population and relatively greater reductions in mortality from other prevalent diseases (notably cardiovascular disease) the burden of exacerbations continues to rise.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation management — key points (Figure 4.6) state that short-acting inhaled beta2-agonists, with or without short-acting anticholinergics, are recommended as the initial bronchodilators to treat an acute exacerbation (Evidence C). Systemic corticosteroids can improve lung function (FEV₁), oxygenation and shorten recovery time and hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should not normally be more than 5 days (Evidence A). Antibiotics, when indicated, can shorten recovery time, reduce the risk of early relapse, treatment failure, and hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should normally be 5 days (Evidence B). Methylxanthines are not recommended due to increased side effect profiles (Evidence B). Non-invasive mechanical ventilation should be the first mode of ventilation used in COPD patients with acute respiratory failure who have no absolute contraindication because it improves gas exchange, reduces work of breathing and the need for intubation, decreases hospitalization duration and improves survival (Evidence A).

### Optimizing bronchodilation in the prevention of COPD exacerbations [^11f4aeb1]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The natural trajectory of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is punctuated by exacerbations, defined as an acute worsening of symptoms that results in additional therapy. In many cases, exacerbations are triggered by respiratory tract infections (predominantly viral, but also bacterial) and environmental factors such as air pollution, yet in approximately one third of cases, the cause remains unknown.

COPD exacerbations have a marked negative effect on both the patient and underlying disease processes, and can result in hospitalization and readmission, an increased risk of death and a significant reduction in health status. Exacerbations are also associated with long-term decline in lung function and a high socioeconomic cost. Thus, optimizing the prevention and management of COPD exacerbations is an important clinical issue.

A key step towards meeting this goal is to identify patients at greatest risk of exacerbation. The 'frequent exacerbator' phenotype (≥ 2 exacerbations/year) describes patients who are particularly susceptible to exacerbations, in contrast to infrequent exacerbators. The exacerbator phenotype, which remains relatively stable over time, has a complex pathophysiology and is prevalent across all disease severities, but is more common in patients with worse lung function.

The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) provides treatment recommendations for patients who are at high risk of exacerbation: a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) or a long-acting β₂-agonist (LABA)/LAMA combination are recommended as primary choice treatment for these patients. Although the GOLD strategy document was developed with an international audience in mind, some countries and regions (e.g. Spain, UK, South America, and Canada) follow guidance outlined in their own recommendations as well.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are recommended for patients at high risk of exacerbation with concomitant asthma, or who experience further exacerbations following initial bronchodilator treatment. However, there is widespread evidence of inappropriate use of ICS in patients at low risk of exacerbation. Considering the known risks associated with long-term ICS use, only patients carefully considered as suitable candidates should receive treatment with the appropriate ICS and associated dose, such that treatment benefit will outweigh any potential risk.

Exacerbation diagnosis and treatment

Exacerbations of COPD remain a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, and it is necessary to consider (and, where appropriate, rule out) other causes of increased breathlessness in patients with COPD presenting with symptom deteriorations. Conditions mimicking exacerbations include pneumonia, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolus and cardiac failure. Diagnosis of exacerbation therefore requires appropriate clinical assessment and may need further investigation with, for example, chest radiography.

The principles of exacerbation therapy have not changed greatly since the widespread introduction in the 1990s of non-invasive ventilation in preference to doxapram for the treatment of hypercapnoea at exacerbation of COPD. Therapies at exacerbation may be divided into those thought to have a disease-modifying effect, and those aiming to support respiratory function until disease-modifying therapies have had sufficient time to act.

Exacerbation therapy is administered stepwise according to the clinical severity of presentation, and a general scheme is presented in Figure 1. It is important to note that disentangling the concept of exacerbation severity from the severity of the underlying COPD is almost impossible: a patient needing intubation and ventilation at exacerbation may have milder disease with a greater acute deterioration, or more severe underlying disease and a trivial insult.

Figure 1
General scheme for management of a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation. Therapy is added stepwise according to the severity of the presentation. Mild exacerbations may respond to an increase in the dose and/or frequency of inhaled bronchodilators alone. Exacerbations not responding to this require systemic corticosteroids, with the addition of antibiotics if there has been a change in the character of expectorated sputum. Additional interventions such as theophylline may be required where the clinical response is still incomplete. Oxygen and/or ventilatory support may be necessary at any stage in the presence of new or established respiratory failure. Exacerbation management should also include an assessment and management of comorbidities, and the opportunity should be taken to optimise long-term therapies to reduce the risk of future exacerbations.

Exacerbation risk in COPD: Exacerbations of COPD (ECOPD) are episodes of acute respiratory symptom worsening often associated with increased local and systemic inflammation (see Chapter 4). ECOPD are key events in the natural history of the disease because they impact significantly on the health status of the patient (often for a prolonged period of time), enhance the rate of lung function decline, worsen the prognosis of the patient and are associated with most of the healthcare costs of COPD. ECOPD rates vary greatly between patients and during follow-up.

### The 2007 GOLD guidelines: a comprehensive care framework [^0424f736]. Respiratory Care (2009). Low credibility.

Comprehensive management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) includes proper assessment, monitoring of disease, reduction of risk factors, the management of stable COPD, and the prevention and management of exacerbations. The 2007 COPD guidelines from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease address each of these aspects of COPD management in detail and provide evidence-based recommendations for patients and health-care professionals. Reduction of risk factors emphasizes the importance of smoking cessation and control of environmental indoor and outdoor pollutants. The management of COPD must be individualized. Aerosol administration of bronchodilators is the most effective method of reducing the work of breathing and alleviating dyspnea. Glucocorticosteroid therapy is recommended to reduce the frequency of exacerbations and improve health-related quality of life for patients with stage 3 and 4 COPD. Pulmonary rehabilitation proves effective in relieving symptoms, improving quality of life, and increasing patients' physical and emotional participation in activities of daily life. Oxygen therapy is essential for patients with substantial hypoxia. Patients with COPD and respiratory failure may benefit from noninvasive ventilation. Surgery may play a limited role in the management of selected patients with COPD. Since exacerbations influence lung function and clinical decline in patients with COPD and contribute to the cost of caring for this disease, efforts must be directed at prevention and management of exacerbations. In addition to controlled oxygen therapy, antimicrobials, brief courses of systemic corticosteroids and, on occasion, noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation may play a role. The role of respiratory therapists in the prevention, diagnosis, and management of stable COPD and exacerbations is absolutely essential if the goals of the 2007 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines are to be attained.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a significant public health concern, affecting millions of individuals worldwide and imposing a substantial burden on healthcare systems. The diagnosis of COPD involves a comprehensive assessment of symptoms, lung function tests (spirometry), and physical examination. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) provides guidelines for diagnosis and staging, which inform treatment decisions. According to GOLD criteria, a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio < 0.7 is diagnostic for COPD. Managing COPD requires a multifaceted approach, including pharmacological interventions (such as steroids, bronchodilators, and antibiotics), pulmonary rehabilitation, and ventilator support. Stable COPD is characterized by a period of time when the patient's symptoms are stable and not experiencing an acute exacerbation. During this period, patients may experience symptoms such as dyspnea, wheezing, and coughing, but these symptoms are typically manageable with medication and other treatments. Conversely, post-exacerbation COPD (PECOPD) patients are those who have recently experienced an acute exacerbation of COPD and are in the recovery phase. These patients are at increased risk of recurrent exacerbations, hospital readmissions, and mortality, and require careful management to prevent further decline and improve outcomes.

### Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^89cb74bd]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2007). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and treatment of acute exacerbations (AEs) of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is controversial. In this section, we review (1) the epidemiology of this condition; (2) the etiology — many patients with AECOPD are thought to have a combination of viral and bacterial infections, which contribute to their exacerbation. Bacterial organisms are isolated more commonly after viral infections in patients with COPD. The role that bacterial infections play in AECOPD remains a very controversial topic; (3) the use of diagnostic procedures; (4) efficacy of antibiotics; (5) clinical parameters to stratify patients' severity; (6) different groups of antibiotics that can be used; and (7) other therapies, including bronchodilators. We summarize the current literature, with special emphasis on the assessment of the long-term impact of this condition.

### Risk factors for prolonged hospitalization as a marker for difficult-to-manage exacerbations of chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD): the DiMECO study [^495e530d]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the third leading cause of death worldwide, is characterized by varying severity of exacerbations which is an independent risk factor for COPD-related mortality. Twenty-two–40% of all COPD patients experience at least one moderate or severe exacerbation annually, while 9–16% of patients experience more than one exacerbation.

The cause, severity, impact, treatment and time course of the exacerbations vary among patients, communities, health care systems and countries. It is not unusual that, according to the former classification of exacerbation proposed by the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), patients with non-severe exacerbations may be hospitalized frequently. This may result in unfair healthcare utilization and increased burden on hospitals. Recently, the GOLD proposed a new and more objective classification of exacerbations, delineating severe exacerbations characterized by respiratory insufficiency. This classification highlights the significant burden of COPD-related morbidity and mortality. Although there are no comprehensive integrated clinical guidelines covering multiple dimensions of the management of COPD exacerbation, there are several evidence-based recommendations for the management of respiratory insufficiency, antibiotic therapy, bronchodilation and corticosteroid usage. The main goals of the management of exacerbations are to relieve symptoms, to prevent readmission and mortality, to return the level of oxygen and other supportive therapy to the home-maintenance level, to control comorbidities and to reassure patient engagement in follow-up bundles. The required length of hospital stay (LOS) for those goals is not certain and varies depending on several factors. This is usually 5–14 days in general.

The LOS is prolonged in some patients who do not respond in a timely manner to therapies and supportive care, which may lead to additional complications and costs and certainly vicious cycles for patients. We hypothesized that the situation could be defined as a "difficult to manage COPD exacerbation", for which a prolonged LOS could be a surrogate marker. A literature review revealed that there is also heterogeneity in defining prolonged LOS, which varies from 4 to 14 days. The risk factors for prolonged LOS have been analyzed in different settings. Heterogeneity in exacerbation phenotypes, comorbidities that mimic and aggravate exacerbation symptoms, baseline characteristics of disease severity, utilized pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment modalities and available healthcare services may all affect patient care and exacerbation-related outcomes that may affect the LOS.

In this study, we aimed to investigate different sets of variables to predict prolonged LOS in hospitalized COPD exacerbators that may associate with "difficult to manage COPD exacerbations".

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations — risks and action plans note that COPD exacerbations increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events, with heightened risk in the first 30 days persisting for up to 1–2 years, and that mortality risk may be heightened during spells of cold weather. An updated Cochrane review concluded that COPD exacerbation action plans with a single short educational component, in conjunction with ongoing support, reduced in-hospital healthcare utilization and increased the treatment of COPD exacerbations with corticosteroids and antibiotics.

### Evidence for management of COPD exacerbations… [^44456eb9]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

After an acute episode of exacerbation, patients with COPD have a significant decrease in quality of life that is either transient or permanent. In addition, nearly one half of these patients require readmission within six months after being discharged from the hospital. Therefore, the main treatment goal for patients with COPD is to reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations. In response to this goal, the American College of Physicians–American Society of Internal Medicine and the American College of Chest Physicians coordinated to develop an evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the management of acute exacerbations in COPD patients. The guidelines present the available evidence on risk stratification for relapse and six-month mortality, and diagnostic testing and treatments for acute exacerbations of COPD.

The guidelines define a patient as being at high-risk for outpatient relapse if, during their hospital visit, they have the following: lower baseline forced expiratory volume in one second; low partial pressure of oxygen; high partial pressure of carbon dioxide; low pH and more bronchodilator therapy. Unfortunately, none of the predictive models is accurate enough to warrant uniform use in practice. The authors also concluded that there is currently no reliable method of identifying patients at high risk of inpatient or six-month mortality. The group produced these eight recommendations for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in the treatment of patients with COPD presenting to the hospital with an acute exacerbation: chest radiographs performed at hospital admission may be useful; spirometry should not be used to diagnose an exacerbation of COPD or assess its severity; inhaled anticholinergic bronchodilators or short-acting beta.

2 agonists are beneficial; interventions in those with moderate or severe exacerbations include systemic corticosteroid therapy for up to two weeks, noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation under the supervision of trained physicians and oxygen with caution; narrow-spectrum antibiotics are preferred over the newer, broad-spectrum antibiotics; mucolytic medications, chest physiotherapy and methylxanthine bronchodilators are not useful; no reliable methods of risk stratification for relapse or inpatient mortality currently exist and future research should include the development of a "reproducible, transportable definition of acute exacerbation" in patients with COPD, and randomized, placebo-controlled trials of the newer antibiotics should be performed.

### Acute exacerbations and respiratory failure in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^c136fe87]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2008). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) describe the phenomenon of sudden worsening in airway function and respiratory symptoms in patients with COPD. These exacerbations can range from self-limited diseases to episodes of florid respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The average patient with COPD experiences two such episodes annually, and they account for significant consumption of health care resources. Although bacterial infections are the most common causes of AECOPD, viral infections and environmental stresses are also implicated. AECOPD episodes can be triggered or complicated by other comorbidities, such as heart disease, other lung diseases (e.g., pulmonary emboli, aspiration, pneumothorax), or systemic processes. Pharmacologic management includes bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics in most patients. Oxygen, physical therapy, mucolytics, and airway clearance devices may be useful in selected patients. In hypercapneic respiratory failure, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation may allow time for other therapies to work and thus avoid endotracheal intubation. If the patient requires invasive mechanical ventilation, the focus should be on avoiding ventilator-induced lung injury and minimizing intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure. These may require limiting ventilation and "permissive hypercapnia". Although mild episodes of AECOPD are generally reversible, more severe forms of respiratory failure are associated with a substantial mortality and a prolonged period of disability in survivors.

### Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: when are antibiotics indicated? A systematic review [^0caf9612]. Respiratory Research (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our systematic review informs the debate about appropriate prescription of antibiotics for COPD exacerbations. As long as exacerbations remain an ill-defined event, the distinction between in- and outpatient treatment may serve as simple guidance to decide for or against antibiotics. Patients with severe exacerbations requiring hospital admission benefit substantially from antibiotics. In outpatients with mild to moderate exacerbations, antibiotics appear to offer no benefits in general. Further research will show how the subgroup of patients with mild to moderate exacerbations, who might benefit from antibiotics, can be identified.

### Managing stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^b4a18843]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2001). Low credibility.

Over 26,000 people died of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in England and Wales in 1999. The disease is a common cause of consultations in primary care and accounts for as many as 1 in 8 medical admissions. Patients with stable COPD, the focus of this article, experience chronic symptoms such as breathlessness, cough, sputum production, wheeze and chest tightness, which worsen slowly over time. We do not deal here with the management of severe acute exacerbations, which are caused by an additional (often infective) process.

In 2010–2011 an audit of care against the 2010 'Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease' (GOLD) standards was performed in 16 018 patients from 384 hospitals in 13 countries. Clinicians prospectively identified consecutive COPD admissions over a period of 8 weeks, recording clinical care measures on a web-based data tool. Data were analysed comparing adherence to 10 key management recommendations. Adherence varied between hospitals and across countries. The lack of available spirometry results and variable use of oxygen and non-invasive ventilation (NIV) are high impact areas identified for improvement.

The characteristics and outcomes of the episodes that are captured when using each of these definitions or diagnostic criteria for exacerbations are very different. The modified Anthonisen criteria used in the London COPD cohort study led to the identification of twice as many exacerbations compared with those leading to healthcare utilisation by patients. Unfortunately, it is still unclear which of these episodes are associated with increased risk of death, disability, poor quality of life, disease progression or cardiovascular events, and require more aggressive management. Thus, there is an urgent need for accurate diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers to complement clinical characteristics.

### Global initiative for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive lung disease. the 2020 GOLD science committee report on COVID-19 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^bde7aacd]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has raised many questions about the management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and whether modifications of their therapy are required. It has raised questions about recognizing and differentiating coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from COPD given the similarity of the symptoms. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Science Committee used established methods for literature review to present an overview of the management of patients with COPD during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear whether patients with COPD are at increased risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2. During periods of high community prevalence of COVID-19, spirometry should only be used when it is essential for COPD diagnosis and/or to assess lung function status for interventional procedures or surgery. Patients with COPD should follow basic infection control measures, including social distancing, hand washing, and wearing a mask or face covering. Patients should remain up to date with appropriate vaccinations, particularly annual influenza vaccination. Although data are limited, inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting bronchodilators, roflumilast, or chronic macrolides should continue to be used as indicated for stable COPD management. Systemic steroids and antibiotics should be used in COPD exacerbations according to the usual indications. Differentiating symptoms of COVID-19 infection from chronic underlying symptoms or those of an acute COPD exacerbation may be challenging. If there is suspicion for COVID-19, testing for SARS-CoV-2 should be considered. Patients who developed moderate-to-severe COVID-19, including hospitalization and pneumonia, should be treated with evolving pharmacotherapeutic approaches as appropriate, including remdesivir, dexamethasone, and anticoagulation. Managing acute respiratory failure should include appropriate oxygen supplementation, prone positioning, noninvasive ventilation, and protective lung strategy in patients with COPD and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Patients who developed asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 should be followed with the usual COPD protocols. Patients who developed moderate or worse COVID-19 should be monitored more frequently and accurately than the usual patients with COPD, with particular attention to the need for oxygen therapy.

### Pharmacologic management of COPD exacerbations… [^aeda6aa7]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

The goals for management of acute exacerbations of COPD include symptom resolution and recovery from the exacerbation episode via improving airflow and gas exchange in addition to reducing lung inflammation. Prevention or reduction of severity of subsequent exacerbation episodes is also a goal for many management and prevention strategies. Typical interventions used for the management of COPD exacerbations include corticosteroids, systemic antibiotics, inhaled bronchodilators, and supplemental oxygen. Surprisingly, there is limited evidence for many of these treatments in this population. Several nonpharmacologic treatments have also been assessed for management and/or prevention of COPD exacerbations, including pulmonary rehabilitation programs, chest physiotherapy, and nutritional supplements. Chest physiotherapy includes the use of breathing techniques, vibration/percussion of the chest, and autogenic drainage.

Vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid supplements have also been highlighted as potential therapies for the prevention and management of acute exacerbations of COPD. Moderate quality of evidence showed that treatment of acute exacerbations with antibiotics improved the rate of clinical cure and decreased the rate of clinical failure in adult patients with COPD. TECHNIQUES FOR IMPLEMENTATION Chronic care management can be effectively implemented by primary care practices to manage patients with chronic conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and COPD. It is a model that has been used to educate and empower patients to track, prevent, and self-manage symptoms, leading to earlier reporting of COPD exacerbations to primary care physicians and reducing use of the emergency department. 52 Another study assessed the effectiveness of an integrative approach with both telemedicine and discharge bundles.

Patients in the integrative approach group had lower rates of hospital admissions and lower rates of readmission to the hospital for exacerbation episodes. 53 For acute treatment, integration of guideline recommendations for order sets have been used to standardize treatment of patients who present with acute exacerbations of COPD. Several services offered routinely in primary care are effective in preventing exacerbations of COPD, including smoking cessation counseling and immunizations. Hospitalization for acute exacerbations may serve as an opportunity to provide interventions for behavior change, such as smoking cessation counseling. 37, 38, 40 The AAFP recommendations for managing acute exacerbations of COPD are consistent with guidance from others. 37, 38 Both systemic antibiotics and corticosteroids were observed to significantly improve symptom resolution in this population as measured by increased clinical cure rates.

Treatment with antibiotics also decreased clinical failure rate. Treatment decisions should be based on clinical judgment and patient preferences and values, and involve shared decision-making by the patient and clinician.

### Optimizing bronchodilation in the prevention of COPD exacerbations [^070f74b3]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

The natural disease course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is often punctuated by exacerbations: acute events of symptom worsening associated with significant morbidity and healthcare resource utilization; reduced quality of life; and increased risk of hospitalization and death. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) recommend that patients at risk of exacerbations (GOLD Groups C and D) receive a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) or a long-acting β 2 -agonist (LABA)/LAMA combination, respectively, as preferred initial treatments. The latter recommendation is based on recent trial evidence demonstrating the superior efficacy of a fixed-dose LABA/LAMA over an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/LABA in exacerbation prevention. ICS in combination with a LABA is also indicated for prevention of exacerbations, but the use of ICS is associated with an increased risk of adverse events such as pneumonia, and offers limited benefits beyond those provided by LABA or LAMA monotherapy. In this review, we examine evidence from a number of pivotal studies of LABAs and LAMAs, administered as monotherapy or as part of dual or triple combination therapy, with a specific focus on their effect on exacerbations. We also discuss a new proposed treatment paradigm for the management of COPD that takes into account this recent evidence and adopts a more cautious approach to the use of ICS. In alignment with GOLD 2017, we suggest that ICS should be reserved for patients with concomitant asthma or in whom exacerbations persist despite treatment with LABA/LAMA.

Since 1998, the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) has worked with health care professionals, medical researchers, and public health officials around the world to optimize the prevention, treatment, and management of COPD. GOLD has continually worked to ensure COPD management strategy recommendations are aligned with current published research. The 2017 GOLD report represents a major revision to GOLD strategy guidelines, the first such major revision in the last 5 years. As such, the 2017 report has significant implications for the diagnosis of COPD, the management of stable disease, and the treatment of exacerbations. As respiratory therapists (RTs) are front-line clinical professionals throughout the COPD continuum of care, a thorough understanding of the new GOLD recommendations for practice is critical. New recommendations regarding diagnosis, severity assessment, and both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment of COPD are presented, and suggestions for how RTs can integrate these recommendations into COPD care practices are provided.

Managing the presenting problem. Is it a COPD exacerbation?

A COPD exacerbation is defined as 'an acute event characterised by a worsening of the patient's respiratory symptoms that is beyond normal day-to-day variation and leads to change in medications'. The worsening symptoms are usually increased dyspnoea, increased sputum volume and increased sputum purulence. All these symptoms are present in our patient who experiences an exacerbation triggered by a viral upper respiratory tract infection — the most common cause of COPD exacerbations. Apart from the management of the acute exacerbation that could include antibiotics, oral steroids and increased use of short-acting bronchodilators, special attention should be given to his on-going treatment to prevent future exacerbations. Short-term use of systemic corticosteroids and a course of antibiotics can shorten recovery time, improve lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV₁)) and arterial hypoxaemia and reduce the risk of early relapse, treatment failure and length of hospital stay. Short-acting inhaled β₂-agonists with or without short-acting anti-muscarinics are usually the preferred bronchodilators for the treatment of an acute exacerbation.

Reviewing his routine treatment

One of the concerns about this patient is that his COPD is inadequately treated. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) suggests that COPD management be based on a combined assessment of symptoms, GOLD classification of airflow limitation, and exacerbation rate. The modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnoea scoreor the COPD Assessment Tool (CAT)could be used to evaluate the symptoms/health status. History suggests that his breathlessness has begun to interfere with his lifestyle, but this has not been formally asssessed since the diagnosis 6 years ago. Therefore, one would like to be certain that these elements are taken into consideration in future management by involving other members of the health care team. The fact that he had two to three exacerbations per year puts the patient into GOLD category C–D (see Figure 1) despite the moderate airflow limitation. Our patient is only being treated with short-acting bronchodilators; however, this is only appropriate for patients who belong to category A. Treatment options for patients in category C or D should include long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) or long-acting β 2 -agonists (LABAs), which will not only improve his symptoms but also help prevent future exacerbations. Used in combination with LABA or LAMA, inhaled corticosteroids also contribute to preventing exacerbations.

### Heterogeneity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a two-axes classification proposal [^0a6b64e1]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are clinically relevant events with therapeutic and prognostic implications. Yet, they are heterogeneous and can need different therapeutic strategies. In this Viewpoint, we propose an admittedly crude approach to a COPD exacerbation classification that might eventually help to define the most appropriate pharmacological treatment and clinical treatment setting for these patients. Our suggestion is to combine a pathobiological axis (biomarkers) to guide treatment decisions (use of antibiotics, steroids, or both) with a clinical axis (severity score) to decide the organisational context in which to optimally treat the patient. Needless to say, this proposal needs to be researched and eventually validated, refined, or disproved, but we hope that this process will contribute to the improvement of personalised treatment for patients with COPD exacerbations.

Background

The ultimate treatment goals in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) management remain uniform across the majority of national and international COPD clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), and include reduced symptoms, reduced exacerbation risk and improved quality of life. To achieve these goals, CPGs require regular updates with recent and relevant state-of-the-art medical and scientific developments. Guidelines strive to improve the quality of healthcare and to reduce variations in the treatment and management of COPD.

Clinical practice guidelines provide recommendations on patient management based on available evidence and, in certain cases, educated opinion where there is no direct evidence available. The quality of the available evidence and the intended audience of CPGs remain core considerations for their development. In recent years, CPGs have further evolved in response to an increasing recognition of the need for more stringent, systematic approaches when recommending specific therapeutic interventions or strategies. The importance of rigorous processes to ensure that only accurate and appropriate treatment recommendations are made is now well-accepted among professional scientific societies. In fact, standards to guide the preparation of CPGs are now available. However, little attention is afforded to the challenges and pitfalls associated with the development of such documents.

A concerted effort between multiple stakeholders is needed to ensure precise, practical and up-to-date clinical recommendations for the diagnosis and optimal management of COPD. Guidelines must be locally relevant; therefore local expert stakeholders should offer local proposals, while referring to global evidence-based documents.

This review article highlights the challenges associated with the development and implementation of national CPGs for COPD in Europe and Russia.

Clinical presentation — patients with COPD typically report dyspnea, wheezing, chest tightness, fatigue, activity limitation, and/or cough with or without sputum, and may experience acute events of increased respiratory symptoms called exacerbations that influence health status and prognosis and require specific preventive and therapeutic measures; COPD patients frequently harbor comorbid diseases that influence their condition and prognosis, require specific treatment, and can mimic and/or aggravate an acute exacerbation.

### Differential diagnosis of suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations in the acute care setting: best practice [^89aa16ee]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may suffer from acute episodes of worsening dyspnea, often associated with increased cough, sputum, and/or sputum purulence. These exacerbations of COPD (ECOPDs) impact health status, accelerate lung function decline, and increase the risk of hospitalization. Importantly, close to 20% of patients are readmitted within 30 days after hospital discharge, with great cost to the person and society. Approximately 25% and 65% of patients hospitalized for an ECOPD die within 1 and 5 years, respectively. Patients with COPD are usually older and frequently have concomitant chronic diseases, including heart failure, coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, interstitial lung diseases, bronchiectasis, asthma, anxiety, and depression, and are also at increased risk of developing pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and pneumothorax. All of these morbidities not only increase the risk of subsequent ECOPDs but can also mimic or aggravate them. Importantly, close to 70% of readmissions after an ECOPD hospitalization result from decompensation of other morbidities. These observations suggest that in patients with COPD with worsening dyspnea but without the other classic characteristics of ECOPD, a careful search for these morbidities can help detect them and allow appropriate treatment. For most morbidities, a thorough clinical evaluation supplemented by appropriate clinical investigations can guide the healthcare provider to make a precise diagnosis. This perspective integrates the currently dispersed information available and provides a practical approach to patients with COPD complaining of worsening respiratory symptoms, particularly dyspnea. A systematic approach should help improve outcomes and the personal and societal cost of ECOPDs.

Module B: Management of acute COPD exacerbations — Patients presenting with an acute exacerbation to primary care are assessed/triaged and the need for emergency department or inpatient admission is determined. If there is such an indication, initiate short-acting acute bronchodilator therapy (albuterol ± ipratropium metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with spacer or via nebulizer) and administer oxygen if necessary. If no indication exists, obtain history, physical exam, and tests as clinically indicated to evaluate for alternate diagnoses, and initiate short-acting acute bronchodilator therapy (albuterol ± ipratropium MDI with spacer or via nebulizer) and administer oxygen if necessary. Acute symptoms are evaluated for resolution; if not resolved, consider: continuing short-acting bronchodilator therapy; initiating long-acting bronchodilator therapy; initiating steroid therapy (see Sidebar 4); initiating antibiotic therapy (see Sidebar 5). If symptoms are resolved, arrange follow-up, instruct the patient to contact clinic if the condition deteriorates, and return to the primary care pathway (see Module A).

### Pathogen-directed therapy in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^65b8ed20]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2007). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are important events in the natural history of this chronic lung disorder. These events can be caused by a large number of infectious and noninfectious agents and are associated with an increased local and systemic inflammatory response. Their frequency and severity have been linked to progressive deterioration in lung function and health status. Infectious pathogens ranging from viral to atypical and typical bacteria have been implicated in the majority of episodes. Most therapeutic regimens to date have emphasized broad, nonspecific approaches to bronchoconstriction and pulmonary inflammation. Increasingly, therapy that targets specific etiologic pathogens has been advocated. These include clinical and laboratory-based methods to identify bacterial infections. Further additional investigation has suggested specific pathogens within this broad class. As specific antiviral therapies become available, better diagnostic approaches to identify specific pathogens will be required. Furthermore, prophylactic therapy for at-risk individuals during high-risk times may become a standard therapeutic approach. As such, the future will likely include aggressive diagnostic algorithms based on the combination of clinical syndromes and rapid laboratory modalities to identify specific causative bacteria or viruses.
