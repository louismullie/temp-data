## Question

calcium chloride dose in digoxin toxicity

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate dose of calcium chloride in digoxin toxicity and whether it should be used at all. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical teaching that calcium is contraindicated in digoxin toxicity. Then, I should verify what contemporary guidelines and regulatory labeling say about calcium use with digoxin. Next, I will examine the clinical evidence, including any human data, to see if there is a safe dose or scenario. After that, I need to check mechanistic rationale and risk–benefit considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded recommendation, including what to do if calcium is absolutely necessary and what the first-line therapy should be instead.

> Let me first confirm the traditional teaching. Historically, many clinicians were taught that intravenous calcium is contraindicated in digoxin toxicity because it can precipitate malignant ventricular arrhythmias, and this warning appears in older drug safety literature and some textbooks, reflecting the pathophysiology of digoxin's calcium-mediated effects on excitability and automaticity [^115Ctcbc].

> Wait, let me verify the current regulatory stance before drawing conclusions. Multiple FDA labels for calcium chloride and calcium gluconate advise avoiding concomitant use with digoxin due to synergistic arrhythmias and hypercalcemia increasing digoxin toxicity risk; if calcium must be given, they recommend slow administration in small amounts with continuous ECG monitoring, which signals caution rather than a categorical prohibition [^111VUwzF] [^112nHnwq] [^113sVdAy] [^1143nBQ3].

> I need to check whether any high-quality guidelines endorse calcium in digoxin toxicity. Hold on, I should verify this carefully. Contemporary ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia and ventricular arrhythmia guidelines do not recommend intravenous calcium for digoxin toxicity; instead, they emphasize stopping digoxin, correcting electrolytes, and using digoxin-specific antibody fragments (Fab) for life-threatening toxicity, with no role for calcium as an antidote in this setting [^112CUZju] [^113seoZT] [^114YGzYA].

> Next, I should review the clinical evidence. A human study of 159 patients with digoxin toxicity found that 23 who received IV calcium had no immediate life-threatening dysrhythmias within 1 hour and mortality was similar to those who did not receive calcium; however, this was observational, not randomized, and cannot establish safety or benefit, so I should not over-interpret it as endorsing routine calcium use [^11611QSM].

> Let me consider the mechanistic rationale. Digoxin inhibits Na+/K+-ATPase, increases intracellular calcium, and predisposes to delayed afterdepolarizations and triggered arrhythmias; adding exogenous calcium can theoretically worsen this substrate, especially in the setting of hyperkalemia or conduction disease, which is why the balance of risk favors avoidance when alternatives exist [^115iJYFN] [^115Ctcbc].

> But wait, what if the patient has severe hyperkalemia from digoxin toxicity and needs cardioprotection? I should double-check the hyperkalemia algorithms. Modern resuscitation guidance supports IV calcium for hyperkalemia-induced cardiotoxicity using 10 mL of 10% calcium chloride given over 2–5 minutes with ECG monitoring, and this is generally applied irrespective of digoxin status because the immediate risk of VF from hyperkalemic membrane instability outweighs theoretical digoxin–calcium interaction risks; however, this is a different clinical question than using calcium to treat digoxin toxicity itself [^11611QSM].

> I will now examine what to do if calcium is absolutely necessary despite digoxin toxicity. If calcium is unavoidable (for example, refractory shock with hypocalcemia or concurrent hyperkalemia), use the lowest effective dose, administer slowly via a secure IV line, and monitor the ECG continuously; typical small boluses of 10% calcium chloride in the 0.5–1 g range given over several minutes with close hemodynamic and rhythm surveillance are reasonable rescue approaches in that narrow context, recognizing this is off-label and risk-mitigated rather than recommended [^111FpcLp].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment of digoxin toxicity itself. The first-line therapy for significant digoxin toxicity is digoxin-specific antibody fragments, with dosing based on ingested amount or serum concentration; in life-threatening presentations, 10–20 vials can be given empirically, and clinical response is usually within 30–45 minutes, which directly addresses the pathophysiology without the arrhythmic risk of calcium loading [^111h3Rjw] [^117EXBzG].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not missing anything. There is no established or recommended dose of calcium chloride for treating digoxin toxicity itself; calcium is not indicated as an antidote and should generally be avoided in digoxin toxicity because of synergistic arrhythmia risk. If calcium is used for a different indication (e.g., hyperkalemia with cardiotoxicity), give small, slow doses with continuous ECG monitoring, and prioritize stopping digoxin, correcting potassium and magnesium, and administering digoxin Fab for toxicity reversal [^111VUwzF] [^111h3Rjw].

---

Calcium chloride is **not recommended** in digoxin toxicity because it can precipitate severe arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation [^111VUwzF] [^114STwkW]. If calcium is absolutely necessary for concurrent hyperkalemia, give only 1 g IV over 10 minutes with continuous ECG monitoring and be ready to treat arrhythmias. The priority is to **administer digoxin immune Fab** [^111h3Rjw], correct electrolytes, and avoid calcium unless life-threatening hyperkalemia requires it [^11611QSM].

---

## Pharmacological rationale and risks

Calcium chloride increases intracellular calcium, which **enhances digoxin's effects** on the myocardium and can trigger malignant arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation [^111VUwzF] [^114STwkW]. Historically, calcium has been contraindicated in digoxin toxicity due to these risks [^114STwkW].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines**: Do not recommend calcium for digoxin toxicity; prioritize digoxin immune Fab, electrolyte correction, and supportive care [^notfound].
- **FDA warnings**: Calcium chloride is contraindicated in digitalis toxicity due to arrhythmia risk; if unavoidable, monitor ECG closely [^114STwkW] [^111VUwzF].
- **Human data**: A retrospective study found no immediate malignant arrhythmias after IV calcium, but mortality was similar and the study did not support routine calcium use in digoxin toxicity [^116n6DhX].

---

## Clinical scenarios and dosing considerations

Calcium chloride is **generally avoided** in digoxin toxicity. If life-threatening hyperkalemia requires calcium for cardioprotection, use extreme caution:

- **Dose**: 1 g IV over 10 minutes (about 100 mg/min).
- **Monitoring**: Continuous ECG and frequent calcium levels.
- **Readiness**: Be prepared to treat arrhythmias immediately.

---

## Alternative and preferred treatments

- **Digoxin immune Fab**: First-line for life-threatening digoxin toxicity; rapid reversal of toxicity [^111h3Rjw] [^111MQCnq].
- **Electrolyte correction**: Correct potassium and magnesium to reduce arrhythmia risk [^115FUKx9].
- **Supportive care**: Atropine, pacing, or vasopressors for bradyarrhythmias or hemodynamic instability [^1123wEpk].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Calcium chloride use** | **Recommended dose** | **Monitoring** |
|-|-|-|-|
| General digoxin toxicity | Not recommended | N/A | N/A |
| Life-threatening hyperkalemia with cardiotoxicity | Only if absolutely necessary | 1 g IV over 10 minutes | - Continuous ECG <br/> - Frequent calcium levels |
| Preferred treatment | Digoxin immune Fab | Per guideline dosing | Clinical response |

---

Calcium chloride is **not recommended** in digoxin toxicity due to arrhythmia risk; if used for life-threatening hyperkalemia, limit to 1 g IV over 10 minutes with close monitoring, and prioritize digoxin immune Fab and electrolyte correction [^111VUwzF] [^111h3Rjw].

### Dose-dependent hemodynamic effect of digoxin therapy in severe verapamil toxicity [^114k4grJ]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Calcium chloride (CaCl(2)) alone is an ineffective antidote in severe calcium channel antagonist overdoses. Digoxin has been evaluated as a therapy to increase the effectiveness of calcium in severe calcium channel antagonist overdoses.

Objective

To determine if there is a dose-dependent hemodynamic effect of digoxin in the setting of severe verapamil toxicity treated with high-dose CaCl(2).

Methods

Eight dogs were instrumented to measure systolic and diastolic blood pressure, cardiac output, pulmonary artery pressures, and left ventricular pressures. Verapamil toxicity (50% decrease in mean arterial pressure) was induced with verapamil 6 mg/kg/hr and maintained for 30 minutes by titrating the verapamil rate. Following verapamil toxicity, each dog received one dose of digoxin equivalent to 0, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 times the loading dose of digoxin (0.009 mg/kg). The verapamil rate was changed to 4 mg/kg/hr and continued for the next five hours. CaCl(2) boluses were given (0.5 g immediately following verapamil toxicity and 1 g at one, two, and three hours). Measurements were compared with the loading dose of digoxin using linear regression analysis.

Results

Digoxin resulted in a dose-dependent increase in systolic blood pressure at 4 hours (10.23 mm Hg/loading dose of digoxin, 95% CI = 2.74 to 17.73), 4 hours, 15 minutes (13.9 mm Hg/loading dose of digoxin, 95% CI = 8.75 to 19.01), and 5 hours (17.04 mm Hg/loading dose of digoxin, 95% CI = 1.76 to 32.32). Digoxin resulted in a dose-dependent increase in maximal ventricular pressure at the end of hour 3 (8.55 mm Hg/loading dose of digoxin, 95% CI = 3.41 to 13.69), 3 hours, 15 minutes (11.81 mm Hg/loading dose of digoxin, 95% CI = 4.89 to 18.73), hour 4 (8.26 mm Hg/loading dose of digoxin, 95% CI = 1.03 to 15.48), and 4 hours, 15 minutes (9.74 mm Hg/loading dose of digoxin, 95% CI = 4.47 to 15.00). The authors were unable to detect a dose-dependent increase in other parameters, including diastolic relaxation (diastolic change in pressure over time) and time to onset of death. No ventricular arrhythmias developed in any dogs.

Conclusions

There is a dose-dependent effect of digoxin on systolic blood pressure and maximal ventricular pressure in the setting of severe verapamil toxicity treated with high-dose CaCl(2).

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^114V4dTT]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Calcium channel blocker poisoning/overdose — prehospital clinical considerations include that "The avoidance of administering calcium chloride or calcium gluconate to a patient on cardiac glycosides (e.g., digoxin) as this may precipitate toxicity and associate fatal arrhythmias is felt to be a historical belief and not supported". "Glucagon has a side effect of increased vomiting at these doses and ondansetron prophylaxis should be considered". "A single pill can kill a toddler. It is very important that a careful assessment of medications the toddler could have access to is done by EMS and suspect medications brought into the ED". "Calcium channel blockers can cause many types of rhythms that can range from sinus bradycardia to complete heart block". "Hyperglycemia is the result of the blocking of L-type calcium channels in the pancreas. This can help differentiate these ingestions from beta-blockers. There may also be a relationship between the severity of the ingestion and the extent of the hyperglycemia". "Atropine may have little or no effect (likely to be more helpful in mild overdoses)", and "Hypotension and bradycardia may be mutually exclusive, and the blood pressure may not respond to correction of bradycardia".

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^116dGRPH]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Toxicity from cardiac drugs is associated with a large number of fatalities and significant morbidity. Furthermore, the advice given by poison control centers are often not followed. Consensus recommendations were published for out-of-hospital management of calcium channel blocker (CCB) ingestion, but recommendations for in-hospital care have not been systematically developed.

In the absence of formally recognized guidelines, we convened a workgroup of experts involved in the care of poisoned patients to develop evidence-based recommendations to guide the in-hospital management of CCB poisoning. Considering the very low level of evidence found in the literature, the workgroup agreed on developing expert consensus recommendations to propose a management approach and facilitate knowledge translation. In light of the variable pharmacokinetics among the available CCBs, the altered pharmacokinetics following overdose and the loss of selectivity at very high CCB doses, the workgroup adopted a pragmatic clinical approach and did not focus on individual agents (for complementary information concerning CCB poisoning, see Appendix 1, Supplemental Digital Content 1).

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Digoxin: Avoid concomitant use with Calcium Chloride Injection. If concomitant use is unavoidable, monitor ECG closely during administration of Calcium Chloride Injection. (5.3, 7.1)
Calcium Channel Blockers: Avoid concomitant use with Calcium Chloride Injection. If concomitant use is unavoidable, monitor blood pressure closely during administration of Calcium Chloride Injection. (7.2)
Drugs That Increase the Risk of Hypercalcemia: Increase the frequency of calcium concentration monitoring in patients taking Calcium Chloride Injection concomitantly with other drugs that increase the risk of hypercalcemia. (7.3)

7.1 Digoxin

Avoid the concomitant use of Calcium Chloride Injection with digoxin. If concomitant use is unavoidable, monitor ECG closely during administration of Calcium Chloride Injection.

Synergistic arrhythmias may occur with concomitant use. The use of Calcium Chloride Injection may result in hypercalcemia which increases the risk of digoxin toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

7.2 Calcium Channel Blockers

Concomitant use of Calcium Chloride Injection and calcium channel blockers may reduce the response to calcium channel blockers. Avoid concomitant use. If concomitant use is unavoidable, monitor blood pressure closely during administration of Calcium Chloride Injection.

7.3 Drugs That Increase the Risk of Hypercalcemia

Increase frequency of monitoring of calcium concentrations in patients taking concomitant Calcium Chloride Injection and other drugs that increase the risk of hypercalcemia (e.g., calcipotriene, estrogen, lithium, parathyroid hormone, teriparatide, thiazide diuretics, Vitamin A, and Vitamin D).

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^11412ZMm]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale

The workgroup agreed that each of the treatments here mentioned could be considered as first line alone or in combination. A supplementary round of Delphi did not allow prioritization of one intervention over another. Comparative studies were rare, and more than one interventions were done concurrently in most of the studies reviewed. Therefore, the workgroup emphasized that the first-line treatments should be prioritized based on the desired effect tailored to the individual patient's clinical condition (Fig. 3; Supplemental Table 1, Supplemental Digital Content 2).

The workgroup recommended IV calcium as a first-line treatment based on improvement in contractility and blood pressure observed in some case series and animal studies. This therapy is readily available and carries little risk provided central venous or secure peripheral venous access is available. The regimen often used for the administration of 10% calcium chloride in CCB-poisoned adults is 10–20 mL (1–2 g) every 10–20 minutes or an infusion at 0.2–0.4 mL/kg/hr (0.02–0.04 g/kg/hr). When 10% calcium gluconate is given, notably to minimize peripheral vein irritation, the dose regimen frequently used is 30–60 mL (3–6 g) every 10–20 minutes or an infusion at 0.6–1.2 mL/kg/hr (0.06–0.12 g/kg/hr).

### Treatment for calcium channel blocker poisoning: a systematic review [^113Rgkc3]. Clinical Toxicology (2014). Low credibility.

Two independent reviewers blinded to authors and journal names selected the studies based on eligibility criteria. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or, when required, by a third reviewer. The kappa statistic was used to quantify agreement on the articles included. A data abstraction form to standardize the data collection process was used after a pilot version was tested among data abstractors with five articles related to digoxin poisoning. No significant abstraction difference was noted between abstractors. For each included study, two reviewers independently abstracted study characteristics (year of publication, authors, and study design), subjects (number, inclusion/exclusion criteria, age, gender, co-morbidities, co-ingestions, type of animal studied where applicable, sample size calculation, and weight for animal studies), treatment and control group characteristics, CCB involved (type, dose, route, and form), treatment(s) provided, outcomes, and results. To ensure uniformity, an independent individual merged the data collection into a single flow sheet.

Two independent reviewers carried out quality analysis for all of the studies except case reports. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or by a third party if required. The Cochrane risk of bias toolwas not required because no controlled trials were found. The STROBE (STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology) checklistand the Thomas toolwere used for observational studies, the Institute of Health Economics toolfor case series, and the ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments) guidelinesand the modified NRCNA (National Research Council for the National Academies) checklistfor animal studies. The percent agreement was documented for each item, and the kappa statistic was calculated for each type of quality analysis tool. Qualitative synthesis was used to summarize the evidence for each outcome. A planned meta- analysis was not performed due to heterogeneity of studies, interventions, and outcomes. The search strategy identified 15,577 citations. Two reviewers selected 216 articles (Kappa on articles inclusion = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.73–0.89) (Supplementary Appendix 1, to be found at online). Six full-text articles were not found because the foreign language journals were inaccessible. Professional translation was performed on 23 manuscripts. A list of the articles translated and excluded after full-text review is available upon request.

### Calcium chloride [^112niynb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 End-Organ Damage due to Intravascular Ceftriaxone-Calcium Precipitates

The use of Calcium Chloride Injection is contraindicated in newborns (up to 28 days of age) if they require (or are expected to require) ceftriaxone intravenous treatment because of the risk of precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium, regardless of whether these products would be received at different times or through separate intravenous lines [see Contraindications (4)]. Cases of fatal reactions with calcium-ceftriaxone precipitates in lungs and kidneys in premature and full-term newborns aged less than 1 month have occurred when ceftriaxone and calcium were administered either simultaneously or non-simultaneously and through different intravenous lines. In-vitro studies demonstrated that neonates have an increased risk of precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium compared to other age groups.

In patients older than 28 days of age, Calcium Chloride Injection and ceftriaxone intravenous solutions may be administered sequentially one after another if infusion lines at different sites are used, infusion lines are replaced, or infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with physiological salt solution to avoid precipitation. Do not mix or administer Calcium Chloride Injection simultaneously with ceftriaxone, even if using different infusion lines or different infusion sites as it can lead to precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

5.2 Hypotension, Bradycardia, Arrhythmias, and Syncope with Rapid Administration

Rapid injection of Calcium Chloride Injection may cause vasodilation, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, arrhythmias, syncope, and cardiac arrest. It is particularly important to prevent a high concentration of calcium from reaching the heart because of the risk of syncope. Too rapid an injection exceeding 1 mL/minute may lead to hypotension and cardiac syncope [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

5.3 Arrhythmias with Concomitant Digoxin Use

Arrhythmias may occur if Calcium Chloride Injection and digoxin are administered together. Hypercalcemia resulting from an overdose of Calcium Chloride Injection increases the risk of digoxin toxicity. Avoid the use of Calcium Chloride Injection in patients receiving digoxin. If concomitant therapy is necessary, closely monitor ECG and calcium levels [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker toxicity — supportive therapy and dosing: Because of improvements in heart rate and blood pressure, coupled with low risk of adverse effects, intravenous calcium is often recommended as a first-line therapy if central or reliable peripheral venous access is present, and a systematic review of treatment for calcium channel blocker poisoning not specific to SND found 7 animal studies demonstrating reduced mortality and hemodynamic improvement with intravenous calcium, while hemodynamic benefits in humans were less consistent in 11 case series and 21 case reports; both calcium chloride and calcium gluconate (to minimize peripheral vein irritation) are commonly used. Glucagon dosing in this setting is described as the standard therapy in cardiac arrest being a bolus of 10 mg given over 3 to 5 minutes, and because effects are transient, an infusion of 3 to 5 mg/h is also initiated; although scores of case reports and case series (the largest comprised of 9 patients) have been published showing increased heart rate in the settings of beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker overdose, no clinical trials have been performed. High-dose insulin therapy has been studied using a bolus of 1 unit/ kg followed by an infusion of 0.5 units/ kg/ h in patients with severe beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker poisoning.

7	DRUG INTERACTIONS

- **Cardiac Glycoside**: Synergistic arrhythmias may occur if calcium and cardiac glycosides are administered together. (7.1)

- **Calcium Channel Blockers**: Administration of calcium may reduce the response. (7.2)

- **Drugs that may cause hypercalcemia**: Vitamin D, vitamin A, thiazide diuretics, estrogen, calcipotriene and teriparatide administration may cause hypercalcemia. Monitor plasma calcium concentrations in patients taking these drugs concurrently. (7.3)

7.1	Cardiac Glycosides

Hypercalcemia increases the risk of digoxin toxicity, while digoxin may be therapeutically ineffective in the presence of hypocalcemia. Synergistic arrhythmias may occur if calcium and cardiac glycosides are administered together. Avoid administration of Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection in patients receiving cardiac glycosides; if considered necessary, administer Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection slowly in small amounts and monitor ECG closely during administration.

7.2	Calcium Channel Blockers

Administration of calcium may reduce the response to calcium channel blockers.

7.3	Drugs that may cause Hypercalcemia

Vitamin D, vitamin A, thiazide diuretics, estrogen, calcipotriene and teriparatide administration may cause hypercalcemia. Monitor plasma calcium concentrations in patients taking these drugs concurrently.

### Expert consensus on the diagnosis and management of digoxin toxicity [^1152sAET]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

While there has been a decline in the use of digoxin in patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation, acute and chronic digoxin toxicity remains a significant clinical problem. Digoxin's narrow therapeutic window and nonspecific signs and symptoms of toxicity create clinical challenges and uncertainty around the diagnostic criteria of toxicity and responsive treatment choices for the bedside clinician. A systematic review of published literature on digoxin toxicity (34,587 publications over 6 decades, with 114 meeting inclusion criteria) was performed to develop 33 consensus statements on diagnostic and therapeutic approaches which were then evaluated through a modified Delphi process involving a panel of experts in cardiology, nursing, emergency medicine, and medical toxicology. The results demonstrate agreement about the need to consider time of ingestion and nature of the exposure (ie, acute, acute-on-chronic, chronic) and the use of digoxin immune Fab for life-threatening exposure to decrease risk of death. While several areas of continued uncertainty were identified, this work offers formalized guidance that may help providers better manage this persistent clinical challenge.

### Calcium gluconate (calcium gluconate in sodium chloride) [^113oJAwB]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.1	Arrhythmias with Concomitant Cardiac Glycoside Use

Cardiac arrhythmias may occur if calcium and cardiac glycosides are administered together. Hypercalcemia increases the risk of digoxin toxicity. Administration of Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection should be avoided in patients receiving cardiac glycosides. If concomitant therapy is necessary, Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection should be given slowly in small amounts and with close ECG monitoring [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.2	End-Organ Damage due to Intravascular Ceftriaxone-Calcium Precipitates

Concomitant use of ceftriaxone and Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection is contraindicated in neonates (28 days of age or younger) due to cases of fatal outcomes in neonates in which a crystalline material was observed in the lungs and kidneys at autopsy after ceftriaxone and calcium were administrated simultaneously through the same intravenous line. Concomitant administration can lead to the formation of ceftriaxone-calcium precipitates that may act as emboli, resulting in vascular spasm or infarction [see Contraindications (4)].

In patients older than 28 days of age, ceftriaxone and Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection may be administered sequentially, provided the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid. Do not administer Ceftriaxone simultaneously with Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection via a Y-site in any age group.

5.3	Tissue Necrosis and Calcinosis

Intravenous administration of Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection and local trauma may result in calcinosis cutis due to transient increase in local calcium concentration. Calcinosis cutis can occur with or without extravasation of Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection, is characterized by abnormal dermal deposits of calcium salts, and clinically manifests as papules, plaques, or nodules that may be associated with erythema, swelling, or induration. Tissue necrosis, ulceration, and secondary infection are the most serious complications.

If extravasation occurs or clinical manifestations of calcinosis cutis are noted, immediately discontinue intravenous administration at that site and treat as needed.

Heart Rhythm (2018). Medium credibility.

Medication-induced arrhythmias — management directives: For sustained ventricular arrhythmias (VA) potentially due to digoxin toxicity, administration of digoxin antibodies is recommended. In patients with recurrent torsades de pointes associated with acquired QT prolongation and bradycardia not suppressed with intravenous magnesium, increasing the heart rate with atrial or ventricular pacing or isoproterenol are recommended to suppress the arrhythmia. For patients with QT prolongation due to a medication, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or other acquired factor and recurrent torsades de pointes, administration of intravenous magnesium sulfate is recommended to suppress the arrhythmia. For torsades de pointes with acquired QT prolongation, potassium repletion to 4.0 mmol/L or more and magnesium repletion to normal values are beneficial. In patients taking sodium channel blockers who present with elevated defibrillation or pacing thresholds, discontinuing the presumed responsible medication or reprogramming the device can be useful to restore effective device therapy. In congenital or acquired long QT syndrome, QT-prolonging medications are potentially harmful.

### Cardiotoxic medication poisoning [^115XEjy2]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers result in a disproportionate number of fatalities from cardiac medication overdoses, and share similar characteristics. High-dose insulin is a superior therapy for both overdoses, but is likely synergistic with vasopressors; therefore we recommend starting vasopressors and high-dose insulin simultaneously. Digoxin remains an important cardiac poison and can likely be safely treated with smaller doses of fab fragments than in the past, except for patients in extremis. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is an invasive but promising nonspecific therapy for refractory shock from cardiotoxic overdose and should be considered primarily in cases of refractory cardiogenic shock.

### The effects of intravenous calcium in patients with digoxin toxicity [^116n6DhX]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Digoxin is an inhibitor of the sodium-potassium ATPase. In overdose, hyperkalemia is common. Although hyperkalemia is often treated with intravenous calcium, it is traditionally contraindicated in digoxin toxicity.

Objectives

To analyze records from patients treated with intravenous calcium while digoxin-toxic.

Methods

We reviewed the charts of all adult patients diagnosed with digoxin toxicity in a large teaching hospital over 17.5 years. The main outcome measures were frequency of life-threatening dysrhythmia within 1 h of calcium administration, and mortality rate in patients who did vs. patients who did not receive intravenous calcium. We use multivariate logistic regression to ensure that no relationship was overlooked due to negative confounders (controlling for age, creatinine, systolic blood pressure, peak serum potassium, time of development of digoxin toxicity, and digoxin concentration).

Results

We identified 161 patients diagnosed with digoxin toxicity, and were able to retrieve 159 records. Of these, 23 patients received calcium. No life-threatening dysrhythmias occurred within 1 h of calcium administration. Mortality was similar among those who did not receive calcium (27/136, 20%) compared to those who did (5/23, 22%). In the multivariate analysis, calcium was non-significantly associated with decreased odds of death (odds ratio 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24–2.5). Each 1 mEq/L rise in serum potassium concentration was associated with an increased mortality odds ratio of 1.5 (95% CI 1.0–2.3).

Conclusion

Among digoxin-intoxicated humans, intravenous calcium does not seem to cause malignant dysrhythmias or increase mortality. We found no support for the historical belief that calcium administration is contraindicated in digoxin-toxic patients.

### Teriparatide (Forteo) [^111BQpcE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of teriparatide SC (also known as Forteo):
- **Digoxin toxicity**: use caution in patients taking digoxin, as teriparatide transiently increases serum calcium predisposing patients to digoxin toxicity.
- **Exacerbation of urolithiasis**: use caution in patients with active or recent urolithiasis. Consider measuring urinary calcium excretion in patients with hypercalciuria or active urolithiasis.
- **Orthostatic hypotension**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as teriparatide may cause orthostatic hypotension, especially with the first several doses. Administer initial doses of teriparatide under circumstances in which the patient can sit or lie down if symptoms of orthostatic hypotension occur.

---

### Digoxin (digox) [^115Ctcbc]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

Use in Patients with Impaired Renal Function: Digoxin is primarily excreted by the kidneys; therefore, patients with impaired renal function require smaller than usual maintenance doses of digoxin (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Because of the prolonged elimination half-life, a longer period of time is required to achieve an initial or new steady-state serum concentration in patients with renal impairment than in patients with normal renal function. If appropriate care is not taken to reduce the dose of digoxin, such patients are at high risk for toxicity, and toxic effects will last longer in such patients than in patients with normal renal function.

Use in Patients with Electrolyte Disorders: In patients with hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, toxicity may occur despite serum digoxin concentrations below 2.0 ng/mL, because potassium or magnesium depletion sensitizes the myocardium to digoxin. Therefore, it is desirable to maintain normal serum potassium and magnesium concentrations in patients being treated with digoxin. Deficiencies of these electrolytes may result from malnutrition, diarrhea, or prolonged vomiting, as well as the use of the following drugs or procedures: diuretics, amphotericin B, corticosteroids, antacids, dialysis, and mechanical suction of gastrointestinal secretions.

Hypercalcemia from any cause predisposes the patient to digitalis toxicity. Calcium, particularly when administered rapidly by the intravenous route, may produce serious arrhythmias in digitalized patients. On the other hand, hypocalcemia can nullify the effects of digoxin in humans; thus, digoxin may be ineffective until serum calcium is restored to normal. These interactions are related to the fact that digoxin affects contractility and excitability of the heart in a manner similar to that of calcium.

### Should digoxin immune fAb be administered based solely on reported ingested amount in acute digoxin poisoning? [^116o4vwP]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute digoxin poisoning is increasingly uncommon in emergency medicine. Furthermore, controversy exists regarding indications for antidotal digoxin immune fab in acute poisoning. In healthy adults, the fab prescribing information recommends administration based on "known consumption of fatal doses of digoxin: ≥ 10mg", while many emergency medicine textbooks suggest fab administration be driven by clinical features or potassium concentration. A 54 kg adult, not on digoxin, presented one hour after ingesting 12.5 mg. Electrocardiogram revealed only ST depression and first degree heart block. Initial pulse was 102 beats/min, systolic blood pressure was 170 mmHg. The patient was otherwise asymptomatic. Poison center recommended immediately obtaining serum potassium and digoxin concentrations; call-back was planned for two hours. The emergency physician was instructed to have ≥ 10 fab vials bedside and to administer if instability ensued. Thirty-five minutes later (≈90 min post-ingestion) ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest occurred; initial serum potassium resulted at this time at 3.3 mEq/L. Bicarbonate, insulin and glucose, amiodarone, magnesium, calcium, and 10 fab vials were administered. Cardioversion resulted in wide-complex tachycardia which became ventricular fibrillation then asystole and the patient died. Serum digoxin concentration drawn on hospital arrival resulted after death at 44 ng/mL. In this fatal case of acute digoxin poisoning, fab was not empirically recommended because the patient initially did not have significant signs or symptoms that accompanied the history of ingesting ≥ 10 mg digoxin. While the bedside team was given clear anticipatory guidance by the regional poison center, the patient died despite fab administration once instability occurred.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Electrolyte disturbances — potassium and magnesium management in ventricular arrhythmias: Potassium (and magnesium) salts are useful in treating ventricular arrhythmias secondary to hypokalemia (or hypomagnesemia) resulting from diuretic use in patients with structurally normal hearts (Level of Evidence: B). Class IIa guidance states it is reasonable to maintain serum potassium levels above 4.0 mM/L in any patient with documented life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and a structurally normal heart (Level of Evidence: C) and to maintain serum potassium levels above 4.0 mM/L in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) (Level of Evidence: B). Magnesium salts can be beneficial in the management of ventricular tachycardia (VT) secondary to digoxin toxicity in patients with structurally normal hearts (Level of Evidence: B). Supporting context notes that hypokalemia (less than 3.5 mM) and hypomagnesemia are associated with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD), hypomagnesemia is classically associated with polymorphic VT or torsades de pointes and may respond to intravenous magnesium, and significant hypokalemia can prolong the QT interval.

### Management of yellow oleander poisoning [^115VNTKB]. Clinical Toxicology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Poisoning due to deliberate self-harm with the seeds of yellow oleander (Thevetia peruviana) results in significant morbidity and mortality each year in South Asia. Yellow oleander seeds contain highly toxic cardiac glycosides including thevetins A and B and neriifolin. A wide variety of bradyarrhythmias and tachyarrhythmias occur following ingestion. Important epidemiological and clinical differences exist between poisoning due to yellow oleander and digoxin; yellow oleander poisoning is commonly seen in younger patients without preexisting illness or comorbidity. Assessment and initial management. Initial assessment and management is similar to other poisonings. No definite criteria are available for risk stratification. Continuous ECG monitoring for at least 24 h is necessary to detect arrhythmias; longer monitoring is appropriate in patients with severe poisoning. Supportive care. Correction of dehydration with normal saline is necessary, and antiemetics are used to control severe vomiting. Electrolytes. Hypokalemia worsens toxicity due to digitalis glycosides, and hyperkalemia is life-threatening. Both must be corrected. Hyperkalemia is due to extracellular shift of potassium rather than an increase in total body potassium and is best treated with insulin-dextrose infusion. Intravenous calcium increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and is not recommended in treating hyperkalemia. Oral or rectal administration of sodium polystyrene sulfonate resin may result in hypokalemia when used together with digoxin-specific antibody fragments. Unlike digoxin toxicity, serum magnesium concentrations are less likely to be affected in yellow oleander poisoning. The effect of magnesium concentrations on toxicity and outcome is not known. Hypomagnesaemia should be corrected as it can worsen cardiac glycoside toxicity. Gastric decontamination. The place of emesis induction and gastric lavage has not been investigated, although they are used in practice. Gastric decontamination by the use of single dose and multiple doses of activated charcoal has been evaluated in two randomized controlled trials, with contradictory results. Methodological differences (severity of poisoning in recruited patients, duration of treatment, compliance) between the two trials, together with differences in mortality rates in control groups, have led to much controversy. No firm recommendation for or against the use of multiple doses of activated charcoal can be made at present, and further studies are needed. Single-dose activated charcoal is probably beneficial. Activated charcoal is clearly safe. Arrhythmia management. Bradyarrhythmias are commonly managed with atropine, isoprenaline, and temporary cardiac pacing in severe cases, although without trial evidence of survival benefit, or adequate evaluation of possible risks. Accelerating the heart rate with atropine or beta-adrenergic agents theoretically increases the risk of tachyarrhythmias, and it has been claimed that atropine increases tachyarrhythmic deaths. Further studies are required. Tachyarrhythmias have a poor prognosis and are more difficult to treat. Lidocaine is the preferred antiarrhythmic; the role of intravenous magnesium is uncertain. Digoxin-specific antibody fragments. Digoxin-specific antibody fragments are effective in reverting life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias; prospective observational studies show a beneficial effect on mortality. High cost and lack of availability limit the widespread use of digoxin-specific antibody fragments in developing countries.

Conclusions

Digoxin-specific antibody fragments remain the only proven therapy for yellow oleander poisoning. Further studies are needed to determine the place of activated charcoal, the benefits or risks of atropine and isoprenaline, the place and choice of antiarrhythmics, and the effect of intravenous magnesium in yellow oleander poisoning.

### Cardiovascular toxicity related to cancer treatment: a pragmatic approach to the American and European cardio-oncology guidelines [^1173XVRD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Atrial Fibrillation

What do the Guidelines Say?

Only the ESC‐2016 guidelines provide recommendations regarding the management of AF associated with cancer treatments (Table S9). 9

Which Pragmatic Approach May be Suggested?

The pragmatic harmonized approach proposed by the working group is depicted in Figure 5C.

In summary, the initial approach to manage AF associated with cancer treatment has been chosen according to the 2 usual considerations, namely, the rhythm versus the rate‐control strategy and thromboembolic prophylaxis. 59, 60, 61 Although no score has been validated to predict the thromboembolic and bleeding risk in the context of active cancer, the working group suggests to indicate anticoagulation according to a multiparametric evaluation including the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score; thromboembolic and bleeding risk of the cancer; hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile INR, elderly (> 65 years), drugs/alcohol (HAS‐BLED) score; platelet count; and life expectancy. It seems that lung, gastric, and pancreatic cancer are associated with a high risk of thromboembolic events. 62 Low‐molecular‐weight heparin may be considered as a short‐term measure, while warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants may be considered as long‐term anticoagulation options. The choice should be based on the risk assessment of drug‐drug interactions of each anticoagulant with cancer treatments and the specific bleeding risk of each cancer. Regarding direct oral anticoagulants, Xa inhibitors may be preferred to IIa inhibitors. The uptake of all direct oral anticoagulants is influenced by the P‐glycoprotein system, 60 but dabigatran appears to be the most at‐risk direct oral anticoagulants because of its low bioavailability and important renal elimination, which exposes it to a theoretical increased risk for drug levels outside of the therapeutic range. Regarding the decision on rate versus rhythm control, rate control rather than rhythm control strategy should be preferred, especially if the suspected cancer treatment causing AF is continued. 9, 59, 63 BBs represent the first‐line pharmacological class because of no/few drug‐drug interactions with cancer treatments. Digoxin and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem) must be avoided because of the high risk of drug‐drug interactions with cancer treatments (P‐glycoprotein system, cytochrome P450 system). 64, 65 A rhythm control strategy can be discussed in patients who remain symptomatic despite rate control or in cases of hemodynamic instability. 9, 59 However, the potential for drug‐drug and QTc interval prolongation must be considered when associating antiarrhythmic with anticancer drugs.

### Parathyroid hormone — Natpara — parathyroid hormone [^113HF6Xi]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3	Hypercalcemia

Severe hypercalcemia has been reported with NATPARA. In the pivotal trial, 3 patients randomized to NATPARA required administration of IV fluids to correct hypercalcemia during treatment with NATPARA. The risk is highest when starting or increasing the dose of NATPARA, but can occur at any time. Monitor serum calcium and patients for signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia. Treat hypercalcemia per standard practice and consider holding and/or lowering the dose of NATPARA if severe hypercalcemia occurs [see Dosage and Administration (2), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.4	Hypocalcemia

Severe hypocalcemia has been reported in patients taking NATPARA, including cases of hypocalcemia that resulted in seizures. The risk is highest when NATPARA is withheld, missed or abruptly discontinued, but can occur at any time. Monitor serum calcium and patients for signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia. Resume treatment with, or increase the dose of, an active form of vitamin D or calcium supplements or both if indicated in patients interrupting or discontinuing NATPARA to prevent severe hypocalcemia [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.5	Risk of Digoxin Toxicity with Concomitant Use of Digitalis Compounds

The inotropic effects of digoxin are affected by serum calcium levels. Hypercalcemia of any cause may predispose to digoxin toxicity. In patients using NATPARA concomitantly with digitalis compounds, monitor serum calcium and digoxin levels and patients for signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity. Adjustment of digoxin and/or NATPARA may be needed. No drug-drug interaction study has been conducted with digoxin and NATPARA [see Drug Interactions (7), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.6	Hypersensitivity

There have been reports of hypersensitivity reactions in patients taking NATPARA. Reactions included anaphylaxis, dyspnea, angioedema, urticaria, and rash. If signs or symptoms of a serious hypersensitivity reaction occur, discontinue treatment with NATPARA, treat hypersensitivity reaction according to the standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve [see Contraindications (4), Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. Monitor for hypocalcemia if NATPARA is discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

### Palopegteriparatide (Yorvipath) [^117JVkB3]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.4	Potential Risk of Osteosarcoma

YORVIPATH is a PTH analog. An increased incidence of osteosarcoma (a malignant bone tumor) has been reported in male and female rats treated with PTH analogs, including teriparatide. Osteosarcoma occurrence in rats is dependent on teriparatide or PTH dose and treatment duration. Osteosarcoma has been reported in patients treated with teriparatide in the postmarketing setting; however, an increased risk of osteosarcoma has not been observed in observational studies in humans. There are limited data assessing the risk of osteosarcoma beyond 2 years of teriparatide use.

YORVIPATH is not recommended in patients who are at increased risk of osteosarcoma, such as patients with:

Open epiphyses. YORVIPATH is not approved in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].
Metabolic bone diseases other than hypoparathyroidism, including Paget's disease of bone.
Unexplained elevations of alkaline phosphatase.
Bone metastases or a history of skeletal malignancies.
History of external beam or implant radiation therapy involving the skeleton.
Hereditary disorders predisposing to osteosarcoma.

Instruct patients to promptly report clinical symptoms (e.g., persistent localized pain) and signs (e.g., soft tissue mass tender to palpation) that could be consistent with osteosarcoma.

5.5	Orthostatic Hypotension

Orthostatic hypotension has been reported with YORVIPATH. Associated signs and symptoms may include decreased blood pressure, dizziness (including postural dizziness), palpitations, tachycardia, presyncope, or syncope. Such symptoms can be managed by dosing at bedtime, while reclining. YORVIPATH should be administered initially when the patient can sit or lie down due to the potential of orthostatic hypotension.

5.6	Risk of Digoxin Toxicity with Concomitant Use of Digitalis Compounds

YORVIPATH increases serum calcium, and therefore, concomitant use with digoxin (which has a narrow therapeutic index) may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity if hypercalcemia develops. Digoxin efficacy may be reduced if hypocalcemia is present. When YORVIPATH is used concomitantly with digoxin, measure serum calcium and digoxin levels routinely, and monitor for signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity. Refer to the digoxin prescribing information for dose adjustments, if needed [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Palopegteriparatide (Yorvipath) [^1162jWQY]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of palopegteriparatide SC (also known as Yorvipath):
- **Digoxin toxicity**: use caution in patients taking digoxin, as palopegteriparatide transiently increases serum calcium predisposing patients to digoxin toxicity. Measure serum calcium and digoxin levels routinely, and monitor for signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity.
- **Hypercalcemia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as palopegteriparatide has been associated with serious hypercalcemia requiring hospitalization, particularly during initiation and up-titration. Measure serum calcium 7–10 days after any dose change or if signs or symptoms of hypercalcemia occur, and at least every 4–6 weeks once the maintenance dose is achieved. Interrupt palopegteriparatide for at least 2–3 days when albumin-corrected serum calcium is > 12 mg/dL. Adjust the dose of palopegteriparatide, vitamin D, and/or calcium supplements in cases of less serious hypercalcemia.
- **Hypocalcemia, hypercalcemia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as unintended changes in serum calcium levels may occur with two injections per day. Use only one injection to achieve the recommended once daily dosage.
- **Hypocalcemia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as palopegteriparatide has been associated with serious hypocalcemia, especially following abrupt discontinuation. Measure serum calcium 7–10 days after any dose change or if signs or symptoms of hypocalcemia occur, and at least every 4–6 weeks once the maintenance dose is achieved. Treat hypocalcemia and adjust the dose of palopegteriparatide, vitamin D, and/or calcium supplements as needed if hypocalcemia occurs.
- **Orthostatic hypotension**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as palopegteriparatide may cause orthostatic hypotension. Administer initial doses of palopegteriparatide under circumstances in which the patient can sit or lie down if symptoms of orthostatic hypotension occur.

Medication-induced arrhythmias — digoxin toxicity management (COR I, LOE B-NR) states that administration of digoxin antibodies is recommended for patients who present with sustained ventricular arrhythmias (VA) potentially due to digoxin toxicity; typical toxicity produces enhanced atrial, junctional, or ventricular automaticity often with atrioventricular block, fascicular or bidirectional ventricular tachycardia (VT) suggests digoxin toxicity, and severe overdose causes hyperkalemia and cardiac standstill; mild cases may be managed by discontinuing the medication, monitoring rhythm, and maintaining normal serum potassium, with intravenous magnesium often used if VAs are present and temporary pacing sometimes needed for atrioventricular block or asystole; for more severe intoxication with serious arrhythmias such as VT and serum digoxin concentrations exceeding 4 ng/mL, the treatment of choice is digoxin-specific Fab antibody, with one series of 150 severely intoxicated patients showing rapid response (30 minutes to 4 hour) and 54% survival to hospital discharge among those presenting with cardiac arrest, while adverse effects can include worsening of underlying disease and hypokalemia and doses lower than the full neutralizing dose may be effective if cardiac arrest is not imminent.

The overall incidence of adverse reactions with digoxin has been reported as 5–20%, with 15–20% of adverse events considered serious. Cardiac toxicity accounts for about one-half, gastrointestinal disturbances for about one-fourth, and CNS and other toxicity for about one-fourth of these adverse events. Digoxin toxicity: Indicated by nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, and cardiac arrhythmias. Advanced age, low body weight, impaired renal function and electrolyte abnormalities predispose to toxicity. Risk of ventricular arrhythmias during electrical cardioversion. Not recommended in patients with acute myocardial infarction. DIGOXIN may cause severe sinus bradycardia or sinoatrial block particularly in patients with pre- existing sinus node disease and may cause advanced or complete heart block in patients with pre- existing incomplete AV block. Consider insertion of a pacemaker before treatment with digoxin.

### The amount of calcium in calcium chloride-is there a need to clarify emergency treatment of hyperkalaemia algorithm? [^11611QSM]. Resuscitation (2022). Medium credibility.

European Resuscitation Council (ERC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines emphasize a rapid administration of calcium chloride (10 mL 10% CaCl 2) to protect the myocardium in the hyperkalaemia algorithm. However, calcium chloride preparations available in European markets vary from country to country. In our opinion, the drug dose recommended in the guidelines should not raise questions about the volume and amount of calcium in the intravenous supply and should be unambiguous to minimize the risk of error. Calcium dose should be given in terms of mmol/L or mEq or mg of calcium ions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Objective, Scope, Target Users, and Analytical Framework

These recommendations aimed to improve the management of CCB-poisoning and address which types of in-hospital interventions should be considered for adults with a potentially toxic ingestion of CCB. In addition to these recommendations, the workgroup would also like to emphasize the possible important role of poison centers. The workgroup (Table 1) was created as detailed in Appendix 2 (Supplemental Digital Content 1,), and an analytical framework illustrating the links between key questions (KQ) to be answered (Fig. 1) was developed.

TABLE 1.
Participating Organizations

Figure 1.
Analytical framework for calcium channel blocker (CCB) poisoning treatment guidelines. Key questions (KQ): 1) Is there direct evidence that one (or more than one) intervention reduces mortality (critical outcome), improves functional outcomes, reduces hospital length of stay (LOS) or reduces ICU LOS (important outcomes)? 2) Does the patient clinical presentation or type of ingestion influence the intervention(s) provided and the outcomes? 3) Does one (or more than one) intervention decrease CCB serum concentration, improve hemodynamics, or reduce the duration of vasopressor use? 4) Are the intermediate outcomes reliably associated with reduced mortality or improved functional outcomes? 5) Does one (or more than one) intervention result in adverse effects or demonstrate a lack of cost-effectiveness?

The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation II instrument (13) provided the basis for the development of these recommendations and for the review process. The level of evidence was determined using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (14) and the strength of recommendation using a modified Delphi like it has been used in consensus recommendations for extracorporeal treatments (Table 2) (Appendix 2, Supplemental Digital Content 1,) (Fig. 2).

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Triggered activity in ventricular arrhythmia (VA) describes early and delayed afterdepolarization mechanisms and their clinical associations. Early afterdepolarizations occur during late phase 2 or early phase 3 of the action potential and are the trigger for torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia (VT) associated with QT prolongation due to medications, other acquired factors, or long QT syndrome. Delayed afterdepolarizations occur after complete membrane repolarization under intracellular calcium overload; contributing factors include tachycardia, catecholamines, hypokalemia, digoxin toxicity, cardiac hypertrophy, and heart failure (HF). Delayed afterdepolarizations are the underlying mechanism for VT in digoxin toxicity, catecholaminergic polymorphic VT, and idiopathic outflow tract VA, are considered an important trigger of VA in HF, and Purkinje cell susceptibility to spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release suggests early and/or delayed afterdepolarizations as a mechanism for some Purkinje fiber–related VA.

Recommendations for use of cardiac glycosides in clinical practice

Cardiac glycosides should only be used with proper clinical indications according to best evidence recommended by current guidelines (ESC) as well as very recently reviewed for the increasing number of patients suffering from HF and/or AF: –

Cardiac glycosides still may be considered in symptomatic HF patients (NYHA II–IV) in sinus rhythm despite treatment with ACE inhibitor (or angiotensin receptor blocker), beta-blocker, and a mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonist to reduce risk of hospitalization (ESC HF guidelines, class IIb recommendation). Cardiac glycosides are recommended (with/without beta-blocker) for rate control of AF in HF patients with an ejection fraction ≤ 40% (ESC AF guidelines, class I recommendation). For patient safety, target serum concentrations should be 0.5–0.9 ng/mL for digoxin and 8–18 ng/mL for digitoxin, which is in the lower part of the so called 'therapeutic' range (Figure 3). Furthermore, target serum concentrations should be controlled, especially for digoxin in chronic kidney disease due to its predominant renal excretion, whereas excretion of digitoxin is still sufficient even in advanced chronic kidney disease due to its pronounced entero-hepatic recycling.

Figure 3
Recommendations for the use of cardiac glycosides in clinical practice for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and/or atrial fibrillation (AF). Therapy with cardiac glycosides should be preferred in certain populations and target serum concentrations for digoxin and digitoxin should be in the lower part of the so called 'therapeutic' range as described. *Lower daily doses of digitoxin are recommended by the authors to achieve target serum concentrations of 8–18 ng/mL digitoxin. This differs from the recommended daily dose of 0.05–0.3 mg digitoxin for rate control in ESC guidelines for management of AF, which do not recommend certain target serum concentrations for digitoxin. ACE-I: ACE-inhibitor; ARB, angiotensin receptor antagonist; ARNI: angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor; BB: beta blocker; CCB: calcium channel blocker; CRT: cardiac resynchronization therapy; MRA: mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist; GFR: glomerular filtration rate; RR: blood pressure.

Objective

To provide a management approach for adults with calcium channel blocker poisoning.

Data Sources, Study Selection, and Data Extraction

Following the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation II instrument, initial voting statements were constructed based on summaries outlining the evidence, risks, and benefits.

Data Synthesis

We recommend 1) for asymptomatic patients, observation and consideration of decontamination following a potentially toxic calcium channel blocker ingestion (1D); 2) as first-line therapies (prioritized based on desired effect), IV calcium (1D), high-dose insulin therapy (1D-2D), and norepinephrine and/or epinephrine (1D). We also suggest dobutamine or epinephrine in the presence of cardiogenic shock (2D) and atropine in the presence of symptomatic bradycardia or conduction disturbance (2D); 3) in patients refractory to the first-line treatments, we suggest incremental doses of high-dose insulin therapy if myocardial dysfunction is present (2D), IV lipid-emulsion therapy (2D), and using a pacemaker in the presence of unstable bradycardia or high-grade arteriovenous block without significant alteration in cardiac inotropism (2D); 4) in patients with refractory shock or who are periarrest, we recommend incremental doses of high-dose insulin (1D) and IV lipid-emulsion therapy (1D) if not already tried. We suggest venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, if available, when refractory shock has a significant cardiogenic component (2D), and using pacemaker in the presence of unstable bradycardia or high-grade arteriovenous block in the absence of myocardial dysfunction (2D) if not already tried; 5) in patients with cardiac arrest, we recommend IV calcium in addition to the standard advanced cardiac life-support (1D), lipid-emulsion therapy (1D), and we suggest venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation if available (2D).

Conclusion

We offer recommendations for the stepwise management of calcium channel blocker toxicity. For all interventions, the level of evidence was very low.

### Digoxin (Lanoxin) [^116bwSqH]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.3 Digoxin Toxicity

Signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, visual changes and cardiac arrhythmias [first-degree, second-degree (Wenckebach), or third-degree heart block (including asystole); atrial tachycardia with block; AV dissociation; accelerated junctional (nodal) rhythm; unifocal or multiform ventricular premature contractions (especially bigeminy or trigeminy); ventricular tachycardia; and ventricular fibrillation]. Toxicity is usually associated with digoxin levels greater than 2 ng/mL although symptoms may also occur at lower levels. Low body weight, advanced age or impaired renal function, hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, or hypomagnesemia may predispose to digoxin toxicity. Obtain serum digoxin levels in patients with signs or symptoms of digoxin therapy and interrupt or adjust dose if necessary [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Overdosage (10)]. Assess serum electrolytes and renal function periodically.

The earliest and most frequent manifestation of digoxin toxicity in infants and children is the appearance of cardiac arrhythmias, including sinus bradycardia. In children, the use of digoxin may produce any arrhythmia. The most common are conduction disturbances or supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, such as atrial tachycardia (with or without block) and junctional (nodal) tachycardia. Ventricular arrhythmias are less common. Sinus bradycardia may be a sign of impending digoxin intoxication, especially in infants, even in the absence of first-degree heart block. Any arrhythmias or alteration in cardiac conduction that develops in a child taking digoxin should initially be assumed to be a consequence of digoxin intoxication.

Given that adult patients with heart failure have some symptoms in common with digoxin toxicity, it may be difficult to distinguish digoxin toxicity from heart failure. Misidentification of their etiology might lead the clinician to continue or increase LANOXIN dosing, when dosing should actually be suspended. When the etiology of these signs and symptoms is not clear, measure serum digoxin levels.

5.4 Risk of Ventricular Arrhythmias During Electrical Cardioversion

It may be desirable to reduce the dose of or discontinue LANOXIN for 1–2 days prior to electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation to avoid the induction of ventricular arrhythmias, but physicians must consider the consequences of increasing the ventricular response if digoxin is decreased or withdrawn. If digitalis toxicity is suspected, elective cardioversion should be delayed. If it is not prudent to delay cardioversion, the lowest possible energy level should be selected to avoid provoking ventricular arrhythmias.

5.4 Orthostatic Hypotension

FORTEO should be administered initially under circumstances in which the patient can sit or lie down if symptoms of orthostatic hypotension occur. In short-term clinical pharmacology studies of FORTEO in healthy volunteers, transient episodes of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension were observed in 5% of volunteers. Typically, these events began within 4 hours of dosing and resolved (without treatment) within a few minutes to a few hours. When transient orthostatic hypotension occurred, it happened within the first several doses, it was relieved by placing the person in a reclining position, and it did not preclude continued treatment.

5.5 Risk of Digoxin Toxicity

Hypercalcemia may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity because FORTEO transiently increases serum calcium. Consider the potential onset of signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity when FORTEO is used in patients receiving digoxin [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^117GTHp2]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale

In patients refractory to the first-line treatments, the workgroup considered therapies supported by a limited number of case series and associated with a moderate risk. The workgroup kept therapies associated with higher risks for rescue treatments. Therefore, in the presence of myocardial dysfunction, the workgroup suggested to titrate high-dose insulin infusion rates up to 10 U/kg/hr to improve inotropy and facilitates the use of carbohydrates by the myocardium with a dextrose infusion to maintain euglycemia if needed. Pacing has been associated with frequent capture and pacing problems. However, there may be hemodynamic improvement in patients presenting with unstable bradycardia or high-grade AV block. To avoid spending time on a therapy that involves risk and may not be effective, the workgroup suggested to attempt transcutaneous pacing first. If transcutaneous pacing is effective, IV pacing can be instituted when clinically appropriate.

Based on possible hemodynamic improvement documented in animal studies, case series and case reports, the workgroup also suggested the use of lipid-emulsion therapy. However, this is not recommended earlier in therapy in the absence of cardiac arrest, given the inconsistent response and the concern of potentially increasing the absorption of medications still present in the gastrointestinal tract by changing the distribution of the CCB. This concern was reported in an animal study only published as an abstract at the time of analysis showing worse outcomes with an oral model of CCB poisoning. The workgroup felt that there were insufficient data to recommend a specific dose regimen of lipid-emulsion therapy. The dose most commonly used is 1.5 mL/kg of 20% lipid emulsion administered as a bolus, repeated up to twice as needed until clinical stability is achieved, and followed by an infusion of 0.25 mL/kg/min for 30–60 minutes. The Food and Drug Administration fixed a maximum total dose administered per 24 hour of 12.5 mL/kg.

Ventricular arrhythmias — triggered activity mechanisms are described, noting that early afterdepolarizations occur during late repolarization and can precipitate torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia (VT), whereas delayed afterdepolarizations arise after repolarization with intracellular calcium overload and underlie VT in specific contexts. Early afterdepolarizations occur "during late phase 2 or early phase 3 of the action potential" and "are the trigger for torsades de pointes VT associated with QT prolongation either induced by medications or other acquired factors or due to mutations of ion channels causing the long QT syndrome". In contrast, "Delayed afterdepolarizations occur after complete membrane repolarization and develop under conditions of intracellular calcium overload", and they are "the underlying mechanism for VT in the setting of digoxin toxicity, catecholaminergic polymorphic VT, and idiopathic outflow tract VA", and are "also considered to be an important trigger of VA in the setting of HF". The substrate may be Purkinje-related, as "Purkinje cells are more susceptible to spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release than ventricular myocytes suggesting that delayed afterdepolarizations may be an important mechanism for some Purkinje fiber-related VA".

RECOMMENDATIONS

Therapy in Asymptomatic Patients

For the treatment of patients who ingested a potentially toxic amount of CCB, the workgroup recommends observation and consideration of decontamination following the position statements previously published jointly by the European Association of Poison Centres and Clinical Toxicologists (EAPCCT) and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology (AACT) (1D): "Based on volunteer studies, the administration of activated charcoal may be considered if a patient has ingested a potentially toxic amount of a poison… up to one hour previously.… the potential for benefit after one hour cannot be excluded".

Rationale

Based on case series (17–19), it is preferable to observe and monitor in a hospital setting for approximately 24 hours asymptomatic patients who ingested a potentially toxic amount of CCB, defined as more than a single therapeutic dose, to consider gastrointestinal decontamination and to intervene with other treatments if signs of toxicity develop. The workgroup deferred the indications for, and types of, decontamination to the AACT and the EAPCCT position statement (2005) instead of proposing new recommendations.

First-Line Therapy for Symptomatic Patients

For first-line therapy of symptomatic CCB-poisoned patients, the workgroup recommends the use of

IV calcium (1D)
High-dose insulin therapy with other first line treatment(s) if evidence of myocardial dysfunction is present (1D),
Norepinephrine and/or epinephrine in the presence of shock (even if myocardial function has not yet been assessed), with preferential use of norepinephrine in the presence of vasodilatory shock (1D).

For the first-line therapy of symptomatic CCB-poisoned patients, the workgroup suggests the use of

High-dose insulin therapy as a monotherapy in the presence of myocardial dysfunction (2D),
High-dose insulin therapy in the absence of documented myocardial dysfunction if used in combination with IV fluids, calcium, and vasopressors (2D),
Dobutamine or epinephrine in the presence of cardiogenic shock (2D),
Atropine in the presence of symptomatic bradycardia or conduction disturbances (2D).

For the first-line therapy of symptomatic CCB-poisoned patients, the workgroup suggests not to use

Dopamine in the presence of shock (2D),
Vasopressin as a single vasoactive agent in the presence of documented cardiogenic shock (2D).

1 Introduction

Atrioventricular block (AVB) that develops in patients receiving bradycardic and/or antiarrhythmic drug therapy (drug‐related AVB) presents a clinical challenge, prompting considerations about whether the AVB is directly induced by the medications (drug‐induced AVB) or if it reveals a pre‐existing, severe conduction system disease. B‐blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (non‐DHP CCBs), class Ic/III antiarrhythmics, and digoxin have been considered reversible causes of AVB in clinical practice. However, an accumulating body of evidence demonstrates a weak cause‐and‐effect relationship between treatment with these agents and AVB, as well as high recurrence rates of AVB following initial resolution after drug discontinuation. Therefore, there is a discrepancy between the traditional perception of the natural history and prognosis of patients with drug‐related AVB and the actual clinical outcomes observed in real‐life clinical situations.

Indeed, current guidelines reflect this ambiguity. The European Society of Cardiology Guidelines do not recommend permanent pacing for AVB due to transient factors that can be corrected and prevented (Class III recommendation, Level of Evidence C). On the other hand, the Guidelines of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association suggest that permanent pacemaker implantation may be reasonable for certain patients with symptomatic second‐ or third‐degree AVB who are on chronic stable doses of necessary antiarrhythmic or β‐blocker therapy without further observation for drug washout or reversibility (class IIa recommendation, level of evidence B). Additionally, they note that while a bradycardic drug overdose may cause reversible AVB, therapeutic doses of these medications typically do not lead to AVB. Therefore, the management of drug‐related AVB remains a topic of debate.

In this context, we sought to synthesize current evidence on the clinical characteristics of drug‐related AVB, assess recovery and recurrence outcomes, and propose management strategies for these patients based on the available data reported in the literature.

### ACC / AHA 2005 guideline update for the diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in the adult: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (writing committee to update the 2001 guidelines for the evaluation and management of heart failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society [^1134xry3]. Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA 2005 chronic heart failure guideline — digoxin adverse effects, toxicity thresholds, and drug interactions: When administered with attention to dose and to factors that alter its disposition, digoxin is well tolerated by most patients with HF, but principal adverse reactions occur primarily with large doses, and the major side effects include cardiac arrhythmias, gastrointestinal symptoms, and neurological complaints. Overt digitalis toxicity is commonly associated with serum digoxin levels greater than 2 ng per mL, though toxicity may occur with lower levels, especially if hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or hypothyroidism coexists. The concomitant use of clarithromycin, erythromycin, amiodarone, itraconazole, cyclosporine, verapamil, or quinidine can increase serum digoxin concentrations and may increase the likelihood of digitalis toxicity, and the dose of digoxin should be reduced if treatment with these drugs is initiated. Spironolactone does not inhibit the disposition of digoxin; cross‑reactivity of some digoxin antibody assays with spironolactone confounded earlier attempts to assess the effect of spironolactone on digoxin clearance. In addition, a low lean body mass and impaired renal function can elevate serum digoxin levels, and one analysis suggested that women may not benefit from digoxin therapy and may be at increased risk for death with such therapy.

### Parathyroid hormone — Natpara — parathyroid hormone [^113zpNbN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Digoxin: Monitor serum calcium more frequently when using NATPARA in patients receiving digoxin. (5.5, 7.2)

7.1	Alendronate

Co-administration of alendronate and NATPARA leads to reduction in the calcium-sparing effect, which can interfere with the normalization of serum calcium. Concomitant use of NATPARA with alendronate is not recommended.

7.2	Digoxin

NATPARA causes transient increase in calcium and therefore, concomitant use of NATPARA and cardiac glycosides (e.g., digoxin) may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity if hypercalcemia develops. Digoxin efficacy is reduced if hypocalcemia is present. In patients using NATPARA concomitantly with digoxin, carefully monitor serum calcium and digoxin levels, and patients for signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity. Adjustment of digoxin and/or NATPARA may be needed. No drug-drug interaction study has been conducted with digoxin and NATPARA.

Antihypertensive medications — pharmacokinetic drug–drug interactions are detailed across absorption, metabolism, elimination, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) effects, with specific mitigation where stated. Potassium binder (patiromer) decreases absorption of multiple antihypertensives and to mitigate this, administer the antihypertensives at least 3 h before or after taking the potassium binder. Potassium binder (sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) increases absorption of furosemide with increased clinical effects (eg, diuresis or risk of hypokalemia); the effect is diminished with separation of administration by 2 h. Iron salts decrease absorption of methyldopa leading to reduced BP lowering. CYP2D6 inhibitors increase BB concentration with enhanced clinical effects (eg, hypotension and bradycardia), and CYP3A4 inhibitors increase nondihydropyridine concentration (diltiazem, verapamil) with enhanced clinical effects. CYP3A4 inhibition via amlodipine, verapamil, or diltiazem increases calcineurin inhibitor (tacrolimus, cyclosporine) concentration with increased risk for side effects (eg, renal impairment). With eplerenone plus diltiazem there is increased risk of hypotension and hyperkalemia, and using a lower dose of eplerenone when combined with diltiazem could be considered a productive interaction. Lithium clearance is reduced by thiazide-type diuretics and RAS blockers, increasing lithium toxicity risk. Verapamil via P-gp inhibition increases dabigatran levels with a higher risk of bleeding, and verapamil or carvedilol via P-gp inhibition increases digoxin levels with a higher risk of digoxin toxicity.

### ATTR amyloidosis: current and emerging management strategies: state-of-the-art review [^1144Gk9A]. JACC: CardioOncology (2021). Medium credibility.

There are insufficient data to inform whether vitamin K antagonists or direct oral anticoagulants are preferred for oral anticoagulation. The role of left atrial appendage occlusion devices in ATTR-CA is unknown, but there is concern for potential device thrombosis given the known increased risk of intracardiac thrombus.

Rate control can be challenging in ATTR-CA because of a narrow range of heart rate to optimize hemodynamics given the likely presence of a low and relatively fixed stroke volume. Nevertheless, cautious beta-blocker use is reasonable for persistent AF. Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should be avoided in CA owing to concerns for amyloid fibril binding, negative inotropic effect, blunting of heart rate response, and risk of hypotension. When necessary, these agents should be started at low doses with frequent monitoring.

The role of digoxin in the management of CA remains controversial. Historically, there were concerns for digoxin binding with amyloid fibrils leading to increased risk for toxicity in AL. However, a contemporary, retrospective study evaluated digoxin use in 69 patients with cardiac amyloidosis, 42 of whom had ATTR-CA; digoxin-related toxicity or arrhythmias occurred in 15.9%, with no deaths attributed to digoxin toxicity. Thus, low-dose digoxin with close monitoring is a reasonable alternative for rate control, especially in patients prone to hypotension.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — risks and precautions of direct-current cardioversion are primarily thromboembolism and arrhythmias, with thromboembolic events reported in 1% to 7% of patients not given prophylactic anticoagulation before cardioversion. Various benign arrhythmias may occur and subside spontaneously, but more dangerous arrhythmias can arise with hypokalemia, digitalis intoxication, or improper synchronization; serum potassium should be in the normal range. Magnesium supplementation does not enhance cardioversion. Cardioversion is contraindicated in digitalis toxicity; it is not routinely necessary to interrupt digoxin before elective cardioversion of AF, but clinicians should exclude signs of digitalis excess and delay cardioversion until corrected, which usually requires withdrawal of digoxin for longer than 24 h. In long-standing AF, cardioversion can unmask sinus node dysfunction; a slow ventricular response without AV nodal–slowing drugs may indicate intrinsic conduction disease, and a transvenous or transcutaneous pacemaker can be used prophylactically.

### Management of rhythm and conduction disorders in cardiac amyloidosis: a French nationwide Delphi study [^1154fn7n]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Repeated EC was not advised by our panel due to the lack of specific guidelines, urging a personalized approach, case-by-case approach. Misleading electrocardiogram (ECG) morphology complicates diagnosis, and careful consideration of the risk-benefit ratio, symptoms, and patient preferences are essential. Studies have shown that patients with CA face higher risks of postablation complications, net adverse clinical events, and mortality. It is important to note that the study's findings may be limited, as it did not distinguish between paroxysmal and persistent AF.

For rate control, the panel agrees on the use of both amiodarone to slow down the heart rate and AV node ablation, as described by others. The use of digoxin was not favored by our panel, as others demonstrated that it should be used cautiously due to its association with increased mortality. Historically, digoxin was considered contraindicated in CA due to in vitro evidence suggesting its binding to amyloid fibrils. However, more recent data indicate that digoxin can be cautiously used for rate control in AF in carefully monitored ATTR patients. The absence of large-scale, prospective studies on digoxin in CA, combined with long-standing concerns about its potential toxicity, likely contributed to the lack of consensus among the panel on this issue. Similarly, calcium channel blockers are generally poorly tolerated by CA patients, and experts on our panel reached a strong negative consensus on their use. These medications may interact with amyloid fibrils, leading to toxicity and potentially exacerbating heart failure. Current recommendations and position papers advise against the routine use of beta-blockers in initial treatment, though this remains debated within the medical community. At normal doses, beta-blockers can often lead to low cardiac output, fatigue, conduction disturbances, hypotension, and even syncope. Importantly, when beta-blockers are deemed necessary in early stages of the disease, it is critical to maintain low dosages to minimize potential adverse effects. However, results in different centers yield different results highlighting the need for further studies on low-dose usage. Beta-blocker therapy should be assessed on a case-by-case basis, tailored to the patient's individual response to treatment.

Thrombus management poses a significant challenge, necessitating systematic imaging to detect their presence. This is particularly critical for patients requiring ablation or cardioversion, as 14% to 40% of amyloidosis patients present with thrombi despite intensive anticoagulation. However, these studies were conducted on a small number of patients, and there is a need for confirmation through larger-scale cohorts.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Reversible causes — evaluation, Lyme carditis, and drug toxicity: In patients presenting with new atrioventricular (AV) block, medical evaluation may disclose treatable or reversible causes, the treatment or resolution of which may make permanent pacing unnecessary. Lyme carditis is one of the more common reversible causes and should be sought in appropriate patients, as AV block in such cases is almost always reversible; the most common manifestation is AV block, usually at the atrioventricular nodal level. Approximately 40% of clinically identified patients require temporary pacing, and in 1 review the median time to resolution of AV block was 6 days with a range out to 42 days; permanent AV block after antibiotic therapy is rare. Digoxin toxicity may be reversed with drug washout or neutralizing antibody fragment therapy, yet it still occurs despite lower chronic doses and serum level testing; therapeutic doses of other antiarrhythmic drugs, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers are not commonly responsible for new AV block and most patients in that scenario ultimately require permanent pacing. Treatment of hypothyroidism suggested by laboratory testing and cardiac sarcoidosis associated with new AV block usually does not make permanent pacing unnecessary when otherwise indicated.

### Why has positive inotropy failed in chronic heart failure? Lessons from prior inotrope trials [^113nwHdf]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

The mechanism and dosage of inotropic agents can cause adverse effects

There is a possibility that the adverse effects of inotropic agents on myocardial energetics and intracellular calcium could explain the results of prior trials: by increasing energy consumption and leading to exhaustion of the energy stores, these agents could promote pump failure as well as ventricular arrhythmias via dysfunctional calcium cycling. In fact, the negative long‐term impact of catecholamines on the heart, and the beneficial impact of β‐blockade, has been demonstrated in several landmark studies. 90 Additionally, data suggest that drugs acting via cAMP modulation lead to adverse effects in the long term by causing desensitization of the contractile apparatus to calcium, disturbing intracellular calcium homeostasis, causing ventricular arrhythmias, and disrupting lusitropy. Studies have shown that left ventricular function deteriorates to below pre‐treatment levels after withdrawal of inotropes, demonstrating that the therapy accelerates ventricular dysfunction. 91 It is conceivable that β‐adrenergic blocking agents might have prevented this deterioration of ventricular function, but their usage was infrequent during most clinical trials.

An intriguing corollary to the notion that the inotropic effects of drugs might explain their negative impact on clinical outcomes is that many clinical trials studying these agents aimed to maximize their positive haemodynamic effects and used very high doses for this purpose. Similar to the deleterious effects of very high doses of digoxin, it is quite possible that by chasing the wrong intermediate measures of heart failure, prior studies drove up the risk of myocardial toxicity and shifted the risk–benefit equation in the wrong direction. 80 This was articulated by Dr. Milton Packer in a perspective article published in a 1993 issue of JACC — in the aftermath of a large number of negative inotrope trials — where he concluded: 'The belief that positive inotropic agents for heart failure should be developed at inotropic doses may have been the primary factor for the controversy that has surrounded these drugs for the last 200 years'. 80

- **Preserved Left Ventricular Systolic Function**: Patients with heart failure with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction may be more susceptible to digoxin toxicity.
- **Impaired Renal Function**: Renal impairment results in increased digoxin exposure and requires dosage adjustments.
- **Electrolyte Disorders**: Toxicity is increased by hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypercalcemia. Studies have shown diminished efficacy at serum levels < 0. 5 ng/mL, while levels above 2 ng/mL are associated with increased toxicity without increased benefit. The inotropic effects of digoxin tend to appear at lower concentrations than the electrophysiological effects. Based on retrospective analysis, adverse events may be higher in the upper therapeutic range.
5.

6 Use in Patients with Electrolyte Disorders In patients with hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, toxicity may occur at concentrations within therapeutic range because potassium or magnesium depletion sensitizes the myocardium to digoxin. Therefore, it is desirable to maintain normal serum potassium and magnesium concentrations in patients being treated with digoxin. Serum potassium levels should be carefully monitored when digoxin is given to patients at high risk of hypokalemia. Digoxin toxicity is also more likely in the presence of hypomagnesemia. Hypomagnesemia is common in most of the same conditions in which hypokalemia appears.

Most notably, it is commonly seen in alcoholics and in patients with diabetes mellitus or hypercalcemia. Because digoxin's therapeutic and toxic effects are all largely mediated by intracellular calcium distribution, they are affected by abnormalities in serum calcium levels. Hypercalcemia increases the risk of digoxin toxicity, while digoxin may be therapeutically ineffective in the presence of hypocalcemia. Evidence suggests that the incidence of toxicity has decreased since the introduction of the serum digoxin assay and improved standardization of digoxin tablets. Cardiac toxicity accounts for about one-half, gastrointestinal disturbances for about one-fourth, and CNS and other toxicity for about one-fourth of these adverse reactions. Adverse reactions are less common when digoxin is used within the recommended dose range or therapeutic serum concentration range and when there is careful attention to concurrent medications and conditions.

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^1132PBQY]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

In situations in which there is symptomatic bradycardia or conduction disturbances, the workgroup suggested using atropine at a dose regimen of 0.5 mg every 3–5 minutes for few doses if needed. This suggestion is supported based on considerations that the therapy may temporarily help, is easily accessible, is inexpensive, and is associated with few risks.

Although fluid resuscitation is commonly used, no formal recommendation was made because no fluid repletion studies were found specifically for CCB poisoning. Nonetheless, the workgroup considered fluid administration as a first-line therapy and continued administration as long as the patient demonstrates evidence of fluid responsiveness (e.g. hemodynamic improvement based on hemodynamic parameters and monitoring devices such as echocardiography after receiving 10–20 mL/kg of crystalloid over 10–15 min).

Therapy for Patients Refractory to First-Line Treatments

For the therapy of CCB-poisoned patients refractory to first-line treatments, the workgroup suggests the use of

Incremental doses of high-dose insulin therapy (up to 10 U/kg/hr) if evidence of myocardial dysfunction is present (2D),
Pacemaker in the presence of unstable bradycardia or high-grade AV block, without significant alteration in cardiac inotropism (2D),
IV lipid-emulsion therapy (2D).

Digitalis (digoxin) intoxication — clinical presentation and management note that certain arrhythmias are typical and diagnosis relies on characteristic rhythm disturbances with ancillary symptoms and elevated serum concentrations. In mild cases, management includes discontinuing the drug, monitoring rhythm and maintaining normal serum potassium, and temporary pacing may be needed. For more severe intoxication (serum digoxin concentration greater than 4 to 5 ng/mL with serious arrhythmias), the treatment of choice is digoxin-specific Fab antibody. In one series of 150 severely intoxicated patients, response was rapid (30 min to 4 h), and 54% of patients presenting with a cardiac arrest survived hospitalization. Side effects include worsening of the underlying disease and hypokalemia; digoxin concentration monitoring is unreliable after antidigoxin antibody, and previously used therapies such as lidocaine or phenytoin have little role.

### Digoxin-specific antibody fragments in the treatment of digoxin toxicity [^115ecj96]. Clinical Toxicology (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Digoxin-specific antibody fragments (digoxin-Fab) are widely regarded as a safe and effective treatment for the management of acute and chronic digoxin poisoning. Calculated equimolar doses of digoxin-Fab are high, very expensive, and infrequently used.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, efficacy, effectiveness, indications, safety and the dosage of digoxin-specific antibody fragments.

Methods

Pubmed, Embase, Medline and Cochrane were searched from 1946 to May 2013 using the terms digoxin, digoxin-specific Fab, and digoxin antibody. Pharmacology and kinetics of digoxin and digoxin-Fab. Digoxin acts via inhibition of Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase. It has a narrow therapeutic index. Digoxin has 60–80% bioavailability, a mean plasma half-life of 40 h and a volume of distribution (Vd) of 5–10 L/kg and low protein binding (20%). A 40-mg vial of digoxin-Fab (DigiFab) binds 0.5 mg digoxin. Digoxin-Fab has a mean plasma half-life of 19–30 h and a Vd of 0.4 L/kg. The half-lives of both digoxin and digoxin-Fab are prolonged in renal failure to over 100 h. Efficacy and effectiveness of digoxin-Fab. There were no randomised clinical trials examining the use of digoxin-Fab for acute or chronic digoxin poisonings. Ten case series with a total of 2,080 patients have reported on the use of digoxin-Fab in digoxin poisoning. In three large case series of 430 acute and 1308 chronic poisonings, response rates to digoxin-Fab vary from 80–90% to 50%. The time for reversal of digoxin toxicity is reported to be 30–45 min. Studies with pharmacokinetic data showed that free digoxin concentration fell to almost zero within a few minutes following the administration of digoxin-Fab. Digoxin-Fab was used more frequently in acute than chronic digoxin poisoning with a higher reported success rate when used in acute overdose. It is sometimes recommended to use full neutralisation doses (based on serum concentration × Vd or ingested dose). It has also been proposed to use half this dose. Indications for digoxin-Fab. Patients who have life-threatening tachy-bradyarrhythmias, hyperkalaemia (> 6 mmol/L) or haemodynamic instability with an elevated digoxin concentration (> 2 μg/L or 2.6 nmol/L). The lowest effective digoxin-Fab dosing regimen has not been established. Safety of digoxin-Fab. Adverse events such as exacerbation of heart failure, increased ventricular rate and hypokalaemia are uncommon (< 10%). Recrudescence of digoxin toxicity and allergic reactions are infrequent. Digoxin-Fab dosing in acute poisoning. Digoxin load based on ingested dose will generally overestimate digoxin-Fab doses as bioavailability is 60–80%, and further reduced by vomiting and activated charcoal. Digoxin load based on concentration also will be overestimated when the concentration is taken before distribution is complete (around 6 h). Much smaller doses of digoxin-Fab can eliminate the digoxin in the central compartment (Vd ≈ 55 L). In imminent cardiac arrest, it may be justified to give a full neutralising dose. Otherwise, based on pharmacokinetic modelling, it is recommended to give 80 mg bolus digoxin-Fab, repeated as required according to clinical parameters because the onset of clinical response is usually rapid. Most patients would be expected to require a total of less than half of the calculated neutralising dose using this strategy. Digoxin-Fab dosing in chronic poisoning. Even if digoxin load is estimated following distribution (> 6 h), excessive neutralisation doses may still be calculated because of variation in Vd due to equations failing to account for lean body weight, age and renal failure. In practice, it is suggested to give 40 mg (1 vial) digoxin-Fab at a time and repeat after 60 min if patient is still symptomatic, sooner if patient is clinically unstable. In general, 40–120 mg (1–3 vials) should be sufficient.

Conclusions

Digoxin-Fab is safe and indicated in all patients with life-threatening arrhythmias and an elevated digoxin concentration. However, calculated full neutralising doses of digoxin-Fab are expensive and may not be required. In acute poisoning, a small bolus of 80 mg, repeat if necessary, titrated against clinical effect, is likely to achieve equivalent benefits with much lower total doses. With chronic poisoning, it may be simplest to give 40 mg (1 vial) digoxin-Fab at a time and repeat after 60 min if there is no response.

### 2018 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline on the Evaluation and management of Patients with bradycardia and cardiac Conduction delay: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^117EXBzG]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 bradycardia guideline — anti-digoxin Fab evidence and dialysis: There are no RCTs of anti-digoxin Fab for treatment of digitalis overdose, and a systematic review of observational series including a total 2080 patients reported a clinical response of improvement to reversal of symptoms in 50% to 90% of patients within 30 to 45 minutes, with adverse effects occurring in < 10% of patients. A systematic review comprising 84 patients found that digoxin is only slightly dialyzable and that dialysis is unlikely to improve the outcome of patients with digoxin toxicity, although hemodialysis may be considered for treatment of associated life-threatening hyperkalemia.

### Digitalis toxicity: a fading but crucial complication to recognize [^117Bm8dH]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Digoxin usage has decreased in the treatment of congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation as a result of its inferiority to beta-adrenergic inhibitors and agents that interfere with the deleterious effects of the activated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. As a result of reduction of usage and dosage, glycoside toxicity has become an uncommon occurrence but may be overlooked when it does occur. Older age, female sex, low lean body mass, and renal insufficiency contribute to higher serum levels and enhanced risk for toxicity. Arrhythmias suggesting digoxin toxicity led to its recognition in the case presented here.
