## Question

Is it possible for a patient that has malaria to has a normal blood pressure?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a patient with malaria can have normal blood pressure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how "normal blood pressure" is defined in adults and children. Then, I should verify what the literature says about baseline blood pressure in malaria across severities. Next, I will examine the pathophysiology that explains why blood pressure is often preserved despite severe disease. After that, I should review exceptions where hypotension or shock occur and what that implies. Finally, I will synthesize a clear answer with supporting references and caveats about context and definitions of severity.

> Let me first confirm the definition of "normal blood pressure" so I don't anchor on a vague concept. In adults, a systolic blood pressure around 90–140 mmHg and a diastolic around 60–90 mmHg is generally considered normal, with mean arterial pressure commonly targeted at about 65 mmHg in critical care contexts; in children, normal values are age-specific, and pediatric shock definitions often use thresholds like systolic blood pressure less than 70 mmHg in young children and less than 80 mmHg in older children, recognizing that compensated shock can occur without frank hypotension.

> Now, I should review direct clinical evidence on blood pressure in malaria. Wait, let me verify whether patients with malaria, even severe forms, commonly present with normal blood pressure. In a prospective pediatric cerebral malaria cohort, mean arterial pressure was approximately 74 ± 8 mmHg, essentially normal for children, and did not differ across subgroups defined by cerebrovascular tone metrics, indicating preserved systemic blood pressure despite severe neurologic disease [^113G95Dm]. In adults with severe falciparum malaria, echocardiographic studies show a hyperdynamic circulation with preserved stroke volume and mean arterial pressure, again consistent with normal blood pressure on presentation in many cases [^112nKr6w] [^113MhZCS]. Even in imported malaria case series, travelers frequently present with normal blood pressures, such as 128/78 mmHg in a knowlesi case and 110/71 mmHg in a falciparum case with renal failure, reinforcing that normal blood pressure is entirely compatible with malaria across species and severities [^1126cXcR] [^111VGkEM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check the pathophysiology explaining why blood pressure is often normal despite severe disease. The core problem in severe malaria is microvascular obstruction from parasite sequestration and impaired red cell deformability, not primary macrovascular vasodilation or myocardial depression; patients frequently mount a compensatory hyperdynamic state with increased heart rate and maintained stroke volume, preserving systemic vascular resistance and thus normal blood pressure despite tissue hypoperfusion and lactic acidosis [^113MhZCS] [^112nKr6w] [^116De5Ch]. Let me consider nitric oxide biology for a moment; cell-free hemoglobin scavenges NO, paradoxically increasing vascular tone and contributing to preserved systemic vascular resistance, which helps maintain normal blood pressure even when the microcirculation is failing [^1123M9zF].

> But wait, what if the patient is hypotensive — does that negate this pattern? I should confirm the exceptions. Hypotension and shock do occur in malaria, but they are relatively infrequent on admission and often reflect late decompensation, concomitant bacterial sepsis, or a terminal cardiovascular collapse phase; in adults, hypotension occurs in roughly 12% of severe cases, and in children, decompensated shock is uncommon at presentation but carries high mortality when it evolves [^112fCWbd] [^116EVaC3] [^1118i4Te]. Case reports and series document algid malaria with shock requiring vasopressors, and observational cohorts show that shock developing after admission is frequently fatal, underscoring that hypotension is a severity signal rather than the typical baseline in malaria [^1126JX33] [^1176MLWg] [^111sBTnv].

> I should double-check the clinical implications for fluid management, because that often gets conflated with blood pressure status. Even when patients with severe malaria are intravascularly depleted, liberal fluid boluses do not reliably improve perfusion and can worsen outcomes, particularly in children; guidelines and trials support conservative, individualized fluid strategies unless there is overt hypotensive shock, reflecting that macrovascular blood pressure is often preserved and that excess fluids can precipitate pulmonary edema without correcting microvascular flow [^113MhZCS] [^112fCWbd] [^1118i4Te] [^111xPsQa]. This strengthens the inference that normal blood pressure is common in malaria and that hypotension should trigger careful reassessment for shock physiology and coinfections rather than reflexive large-volume resuscitation [^116EVaC3].

> Let me reconsider the original question and synthesize. Yes, patients with malaria can have normal blood pressure; in fact, many do, including those with severe disease, because compensatory cardiovascular responses and maintained systemic vascular resistance preserve blood pressure despite microvascular obstruction and organ dysfunction; hypotension, when present, signals advanced severity, decompensation, or coinfection and warrants urgent, guideline-concordant management rather than routine liberal fluid loading [^113G95Dm] [^112nKr6w] [^112fCWbd] [^113MhZCS].

---

Yes, patients with malaria can have **normal blood pressure**, especially in uncomplicated cases [^113MhZCS]. In severe malaria, **hypotension is uncommon** [^116EVaC3] because systemic vascular resistance and cardiac function are often preserved [^113MhZCS], though shock can occur in a minority [^1176MLWg]. Blood pressure may also be normal in early or mild infection, and even in some severe cases until late decompensation [^1176MLWg]. Thus, normal BP does not exclude malaria, and clinicians should not rely on BP alone to assess severity [^113MhZCS].

---

## Blood pressure in uncomplicated malaria

In uncomplicated malaria, patients often have **normal blood pressure** [^notfound]. Typical symptoms include fever, chills, headache, and malaise, with minimal hemodynamic disturbance [^117UeD3a]. Normal BP in this context reflects preserved autonomic and cardiovascular function [^notfound].

---

## Blood pressure in severe malaria

Severe malaria can cause significant hemodynamic changes, but **hypotension is not universal** [^116EVaC3]. Key points include:

- **Hypotension frequency**: Hypotension occurs in about 12% of severe cases [^112fCWbd], often late or with complications [^1176MLWg].

- **Preserved vascular resistance**: Severe malaria often maintains normal or high systemic vascular resistance, helping preserve BP [^113MhZCS] [^1123M9zF].

- **Cardiac function**: Cardiac output is usually preserved, contributing to normal BP in many cases [^112nKr6w] [^115AuEmb].

- **Shock syndrome**: When hypotension occurs, it is typically part of a shock syndrome with multi-organ dysfunction [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing blood pressure in malaria

Several factors **influence BP** in malaria:

| **Factor** | **Effect on blood pressure** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|-|
| Parasite species | - P. falciparum more often causes severe disease and hypotension than P. vivax or P. ovale [^notfound] | - Sequestration <br/> - Endothelial dysfunction [^113ZEFjJ] |
| Parasite burden | Higher parasitemia increases risk of hypotension | - Microvascular obstruction <br/> - Endothelial dysfunction [^111xPsQa] |
| Patient age | Children more often have hypotension than adults | - Immature cardiovascular system <br/> - Higher susceptibility to shock [^notfound] |
| Comorbidities | - HIV <br/> - Diabetes <br/> - Cardiovascular disease increase hypotension risk | - Impaired immune response <br/> - Existing cardiovascular compromise [^notfound] |
| Hydration status | Dehydration can lower BP | - Volume depletion [^113MhZCS] |

---

## Clinical implications

- **Normal BP does not exclude malaria**: Patients with normal BP can still have malaria, including severe disease [^112fCWbd].

- **Monitoring**: Regular BP monitoring is essential in severe malaria, as hypotension can develop rapidly [^1176MLWg].

- **Management**: Hypotension in malaria requires careful fluid management and supportive care, as aggressive fluid resuscitation can worsen outcomes [^113MhZCS] [^1118i4Te].

---

## Conclusion

Patients with malaria can have **normal blood pressure**, particularly in uncomplicated cases [^117EPoYF]. In severe malaria, hypotension is not universal and often reflects late decompensation or complications [^116EVaC3]. Clinicians should not rely on BP alone to assess severity; **regular monitoring and comprehensive clinical assessment are essential** [^111w3t9z].

### Fluid therapy for severe malaria [^113MhZCS]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Fluid therapy is an important supportive measure for patients with severe malaria. Patients with severe malaria usually have normal cardiac index, vascular resistance, and blood pressure and a small degree of hypovolaemia due to dehydration. Cell hypoxia, reduced kidney function, and acidosis result from microcirculatory compromise and malarial anaemia, which reduce tissue oxygenation, not hypovolaemia. Hence, aggressive fluid loading does not correct acid-base status, enhance kidney function, or improve patient outcomes, and it risks complications such as pulmonary oedema. Individualised conservative fluid management is recommended in patients with severe malaria. Physical examination and physiological indices have limited reliability in guiding fluid therapy. Invasive measures can be more accurate than physical examination and physiological indices but are often unavailable in endemic areas, and non-invasive measures, such as ultrasound, are mostly unexplored. Research into reliable methods applicable in low-resource settings to measure fluid status and response is a priority. In this Review, we outline the current knowledge on fluid management in severe malaria and highlight research needed to optimise fluid therapy and improve survival in severe malaria.

### The malaria-high blood pressure hypothesis [^117L2ZGk]. Circulation Research (2016). Low credibility.

Rationale

Several studies have demonstrated links between infectious diseases and cardiovascular conditions. Malaria and hypertension are widespread in many low- and middle-income countries, but the possible link between them has not been considered.

Objective

In this article, we outline the basis for a possible link between malaria and hypertension and discuss how the hypothesis could be confirmed or refuted.

Methods and Results

We reviewed published literature on factors associated with hypertension and checked whether any of these were also associated with malaria. We then considered various study designs that could be used to test the hypothesis. Malaria causes low birth weight, malnutrition, and inflammation, all of which are associated with hypertension in high-income countries. The hypothetical link between malaria and hypertension can be tested through the use of ecological, cohort, or Mendelian randomization studies, each of which poses specific challenges.

Conclusions

Confirmation of the existence of a causative link with malaria would be a paradigm shift in efforts to prevent and control hypertension and would stimulate wider research on the links between infectious and noncommunicable disease.

### The malaria-high blood pressure hypothesis: revisited [^111v6ceP]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Malaria etiologies with pathophysiological similarities to hypertension currently constitute a major subject of research. The malaria-high blood pressure hypothesis is strongly supported by observations of the increasing incidence of hypertension in malaria-endemic, low- and middle-income countries with poor socioeconomic conditions, particularly in sub-Saharan African countries. Malnutrition and low birth weight with persistent symptomatic malaria presentations in pregnancy correlate strongly with the development of preeclampsia, gestational hypertension and subsequent hypertension in adult life. Evidence suggest that the link between malaria infection and high blood pressure involves interactions between malaria parasites and erythrocytes, the inflammatory process, effects of the infection during pregnancy; effects on renal and vascular functions as well as effects in sickle cell disease. Possible mechanisms which provide justification for the malaria-high blood pressure hypothesis include the following: endothelial dysfunction (reduced nitric oxide (NO) levels), impaired release of local neurotransmitters and cytokines, decrease in vascular smooth muscle cell viability and/or alterations in cellular calcium signaling leading to enhanced vascular reactivity, remodeling, and cardiomyopathies, deranged homeostasis through dehydration, elevated intracellular mediators and proinflammatory cytokine responses, possible genetic regulations, activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system mechanisms and renal derangements, severe anemia and hemolysis, renal failure, and end organ damage. Two key mediators of the malaria-high blood pressure association are: endothelial dysfunction (reduced NO) and increased angiotensin-converting enzyme activity/angiotensin II levels. Sickle cell disease is associated with protection against malaria infection and reduced blood pressure. In this review, we present the state of knowledge about the malaria-blood pressure hypothesis and suggest insights for future studies.

Implications of the Hypothesis

Current efforts at understanding hypertension in LMIC have had a narrow focus anchored on traditional risk factors identified among populations in high-income countries. Confirmation of the causative role of malaria in elevating BP would be of immense scientific interest and could lead to a paradigm shift on how to control hypertension in LMIC.

Malaria is only one of many infectious diseases that have a high incidence across LMICs. The inflammatory pathways activated in malaria infection are similar to those of other illnesses. It is therefore likely that if malaria contributes to the burden of hypertension through inflammation, the same could be true of other chronic infections, such as HIV and tuberculosis, providing a novel impetus for the study and control of these infections. Currently, most treatment for infectious illnesses is focused on eliminating the pathogen with little regard for modulating the inflammatory responses that might result in adverse vascular consequences later. Elucidating these inflammatory pathways and their consequences would pave the way for trials of adjunctive therapy such as statins or specific cytokine antagonists to prevent adverse vascular remodeling as a result of infection.

### The malaria-high blood pressure hypothesis [^1129WKGh]. Circulation Research (2016). Low credibility.

Age standardized mean blood pressures (BPs) are higher in many parts of Asia and sub-Saharan Africa than in high-income countries. Despite the high burden of cardiovascular disease in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), few studies have examined their pathophysiology or treatment. Although demographic and lifestyle changes including urbanizationcontribute substantially to the burden of hypertension in LMICs, examining factors unique to or more prevalent in LMIC settings might reveal new pathophysiological mechanisms that could aid efforts to control the condition.

Editorial, see p

In This Issue, see p

The rise of cardiovascular disease in LMIC is occurring against the background of continuing high burden of infectious diseases. Several studies in more developed settings have reported links between infectious or inflammatory conditions and cardiovascular disease. In this article, we outline the hypothesis that hypertension, the leading risk factor for death in LMIC, could be linked to one of the leading infectious conditions in the same region, malaria.

### The fluid management of adults with severe malaria [^111MocWX]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Fluid resuscitation has long been considered a key intervention in the treatment of adults with severe falciparum malaria. Profound hypovolemia is common in these patients and has the potential to exacerbate the acidosis and acute kidney injury that are independent predictors of death. However, new microvascular imaging techniques have shown that disease severity correlates more strongly with obstruction of the microcirculation by parasitized erythrocytes — a process termed sequestration. Fluid loading has little effect on sequestration and increases the risk of complications, particularly pulmonary edema, a condition that can develop suddenly and unpredictably and that is frequently fatal in this population. Accordingly, even if a patient is clinically hypovolemic, if there is an adequate blood pressure and urine output, there may be little advantage in infusing intravenous fluid beyond a maintenance rate of 1 to 2 mL/kg per hour. The optimal agent for fluid resuscitation remains uncertain; significant anemia requires blood transfusion, but colloid solutions may be associated with harm and should be avoided. The preferred crystalloid is unclear, although the use of balanced solutions requires investigation. There are fewer data to guide the fluid management of severe vivax and knowlesi malaria, although a similar conservative strategy would appear prudent.

### Guidelines for the treatment of malaria [^111w3t9z]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2015). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for severe malaria" for malaria infection.

The diagnostic criteria for severe malaria is a clinical tool designed to identify patients with severe manifestations of malaria, a potentially life-threatening condition. The criteria are used to stratify patients based on the severity of their symptoms and the presence of specific clinical and laboratory findings, which can guide appropriate treatment strategies.

The primary components of the diagnostic criteria for severe malaria include a range of clinical and laboratory findings. Clinical findings include prostration or impaired consciousness, multiple convulsions, pulmonary edema, compensated or decompensated shock, and significant bleeding. Laboratory findings include jaundice with a parasite count greater than 100,000/mcL, severe anemia with a parasite count greater than 10,000/mcL, hypoglycemia, acidosis, renal impairment, and hyperparasitemia.

The severity of malaria is determined by the presence of any one of these criteria. A patient is considered to have severe malaria if they exhibit any one of the listed clinical or laboratory findings. Conversely, a patient does not meet the criteria for severe malaria if they do not exhibit any of the listed findings.

This diagnostic criteria is crucial in the clinical setting as it aids in the early identification of severe malaria, enabling prompt initiation of appropriate treatment and potentially improving patient outcomes.

This diagnostic tool evaluates whether a patient meets the criteria for severe malaria based on a series of clinical indicators. The user selects from a list of conditions that are associated with severe malaria, and the tool determines if the criteria are met. Here's how it works:

1. The user is presented with a list of conditions related to severe malaria:

- Prostration or impaired consciousness
- Multiple convulsions
- Pulmonary edema, identified by oxygen saturation below 92% and a respiratory rate exceeding 30 breaths per minute or confirmed radiologically
- Compensated shock, indicated by a capillary refill time of 3 seconds or more or a temperature gradient on the leg without hypotension
- Decompensated shock, described by a systolic blood pressure less than 70 mmHg in children or less than 80 mmHg in adults, accompanied by impaired perfusion
- Significant bleeding
- Jaundice with bilirubin levels over 50 micromoles per liter and a parasite count greater than 100,000 per microliter
- Severe anemia, defined by a hematocrit of less than 15–20% and hemoglobin levels equal to or below 7 grams per liter for adults or 5 grams per liter for children under 12, with a parasite count over 10,000 per microliter
- Hypoglycemia, with glucose levels under 2.2 mmol/L
- Acidosis, characterized by an arterial pH below 7.25, bicarbonate under 15 mmol/L, or venous plasma lactate equal to or above 5 mmol/L
- Renal impairment, evidenced by creatinine levels over 265 micromoles per liter or urea above 20 mmol/L
- Hyperparasitemia, defined as a parasite count of 10% or more

2. After selecting the relevant conditions, the tool checks if any of these indicators are present.

3. The output result is determined as follows:

- If at least one of the selected conditions corresponds to the criteria, the output will be "Meets criteria for severe malaria".
- If none of the conditions match the criteria listed, the result will be "Does not meet criteria for severe malaria".

This method ensures a systematic evaluation through specific clinical markers that are critical in diagnosing severe malaria. By comparing the patient's symptoms against these benchmarks, healthcare providers can effectively assess the severity of the infection.

### The high blood pressure-malaria protection hypothesis [^112T6s2Q]. Circulation Research (2016). Low credibility.

Rationale

A recently proposed hypothesis states that malaria may contribute to hypertension in endemic areas, 1 but the role of angiotensin II (Ang II), a major regulator of blood pressure, was not considered. Elevated levels of Ang II may confer protection against malaria morbidity and mortality, providing an alternative explanation for hypertension in malaria endemic areas.

Objective

To discuss a possible alternative cause for hypertension in populations who have been under the selective pressure of malaria.

Methods and Results

We reviewed published scientific literature for studies that could establish a link between Ang II and malaria. Both genetic and functional studies suggested that high levels of Ang II may confer protection against cerebral malaria by strengthening the integrity of the endothelial brain barrier. We also describe strong experimental evidence supporting our hypothesis through genetic, functional, and interventional studies.

Conclusions

A causal association between high levels of Ang II and protection from malaria pathogenesis can provide a likely explanation for the increased prevalence in hypertension observed in populations of African and South Asian origin. Furthermore, this potential causative connection might also direct unique approaches for the effective treatment of cerebral malaria.

### The malaria-high blood pressure hypothesis [^115oB5PV]. Circulation Research (2016). Low credibility.

Genetic Studies

Mendelian randomization studies, where genetic polymorphisms are used as instrumental variables representing malaria exposure, would be particularly attractive for answering the question as they overcome many of the limitations of observational and intervention studies described above. Several hemoglobin polymorphisms provide some level of protection against malaria, including Hemoglobin C and S, and thalassemia. – A comparison of arterial stiffness indices and BP in subjects with and without the polymorphisms in regions where they have been exposed to malaria in childhood would provide a robust test of the effect of malaria exposure on the development of hypertension.

An important prerequisite for using Mendelian randomization to make causal inferences about the effects of environmental exposures, is that the polymorphisms should not display pleiotropic effects, that is, they should not influence the outcome being studied through a pathway that is independent of the environmental exposure that they are being used as a proxy for. Some studies suggest that individuals with the sickle cell trait (SCT) are more likely to have cardiovascular events especially under extreme conditions, such as military training or athletics. A recent study among blacks found similar baseline BP in those with and without SCT, although on follow-up there was an increased incidence of chronic kidney disease in individuals with SCT. To exclude the possibility of confounding by pleiotropy, it may be necessary to include a control group that has not been exposed to malaria or use additional independent genetic polymorphisms, such as α thalassemia. If malaria causes hypertension and there are no pleiotropic effects of SCT, then one would expect to find higher BP in individuals without SCT compared with those with SCT in groups that have been exposed to malaria. Conversely, there would be no difference in BP based on trait status among those who have not been exposed to malaria.

Testing the Hypothesis

Observational Studies

Ecological studies examining BP levels in relation to malaria incidence are hampered by the lack of finely scaled data on the relevant BP distributions. A worldwide study on BP levels had scarce raw data on BP from sub-Saharan Africa, where most malaria endemic countries are situated. In contrast, there are good epidemiological data on the spatial and temporal distribution of malaria.

Although traditional case–control studies (with malaria as the exposure and hypertension as the outcome) could provide an efficient way to test the hypothesis, they are limited by the nonspecificity and nondurability of immunologic markers for malaria, a prerequisite for identifying individuals who have previously been exposed to malaria. – This limitation also applies to the potential use of propensity scoresto assemble groups that are comparable in their risk of malaria; in order to generate such scores reliable immunologic markers of malaria exposure would be needed.

A life-course epidemiological approach with longitudinal cohorts from the antenatal period or birth would allow the study of many of the postulated pathways through which malaria could be leading to hypertension in LMIC. Studies of pregnant women and children exposed to malaria in demographic surveillance systems with good quality ascertainment of exposure status are necessary. However, most demographic surveillance systems in LMIC were only set up in the last 15 years, and therefore may not have accumulated enough follow-up time to examine these outcomes, assuming that the biases of such retrospective studies can be overcome. Prospective surveillance, however, would also require long follow-up and be expensive to conduct.

Randomized Intervention Studies

Because malaria is of such great public interest, there have been and will continue to be a succession of randomized controlled trials of interventions tested at population level, such as vaccines, bed nets, and drug treatments. For those interventions that turn out to be effective it might be possible to examine their effect on arterial stiffness and BP. Prospective studies of interventions known to be effective as well as studies of controlled human malaria infectioncannot be used here because although they satisfy the criterion of having 2 randomized groups with and without malaria, the fact that the vascular outcomes being tested are potentially irreversible pose an ethical challenge. As with observational studies, extended follow-up might be needed as vascular differences in trial groups because of the effects of malaria may take longer to be apparent compared with the antimalarial effects of the interventions.

Animal studies are hampered by the fact that murine models of malaria and hypertension are imperfect approximations of their human analogs that have complex pathophysiology.

2. Malaria is associated with stunting and malnutrition in childhood, which predisposes to the development of hypertension in later life.

Although the biological pathways have not been fully characterized, postulated mechanisms involved in the development of hypertension after stunting and chronic malnutrition include reduced nephron numbersand premature senescence in the kidney, which is particularly prominent when there is rapid weight gain after growth restriction. In addition, Jamaican survivors of severe acute malnutrition in childhood were found at the age of 30 years to have markedly smaller left ventricular outflow tracts with reduced cardiac output in the presence of elevated peripheral resistance, a pattern of changes that is likely to lead to hypertension in later life.

3. Malaria is a cause of chronic inflammation, and inflammation predisposes to cardiovascular diseases in high-income countries. In a prospective study of 20 525 female US health professionals, there was a linear relationship between baseline C-reactive protein levels and incident hypertension. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis have increased arterial stiffness, which precedes hypertension. – The link between inflammatory conditions and hypertension may be related to perturbations in the levels of endothelial-based growth factors. Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) is a multimeric ligand of the Tie 2 receptor, part of a vascular-specific tyrosine kinase signaling pathway that is essential for vessel development and stability. Ang-2 is predominantly secreted by endothelial cells and some smooth muscle cells in many inflammatory and angiogenic states (Figure). Ang-2 levels are elevated in children with severe malaria in several different settings,– and in returning travellers infected with malaria. Ang-2 levels predict cardiovascular disease in children with chronic kidney disease. Although no causal association has been established, several studies have demonstrated an association between Ang-2 levels and arterial stiffness and BP in adults.

Figure.
The malaria-high blood pressure hypothesis. Malaria is known to cause low birth weight, inflammation as well as stunting. All these factors have been separately associated with the development of high blood pressure in high-income countries. Studies are needed to confirm whether malaria contributes to the development of high blood pressure in low- and middle-income countries.

### What's new in sepsis recognition in resource-limited settings? [^111MxFdi]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Results and recommendations for sepsis recognition in resource-limited settings

Four clearly defined questions regarding sepsis recognition in resource-limited settings were formulated using the GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool. The literature search was performed using the same techniques as described for the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. Specific attention was paid to identify publications originating from resource-limited settings. The quality of evidence was classified as high (grade A) to very low (grade D) and recommendations as strong (grade 1 — 'we recommend') or weak (grade 2 — 'we suggest'). Factors influencing this classification were the level of scientific evidence, certainty about the benefit/risk ratio, certainty in or similar values, resource implications, availability and feasibility, affordability, and safety for resource-limited settings (Table 1).

Table 1
Recommendations for sepsis recognition in resource-limited settings (with grading)

PCR polymerase chain reaction, HIV human immunodeficiency virus

With regard to sepsis recognition, we recommend defining sepsis in adults as the combination of acute infection and the presence of two of the following three parameters: (a) respiratory rate ≥ 22 bpm, (b) systolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mmHg, (c) any acute change in mental state; these criteria have not been validated to recognize sepsis from non-bacterial infections such as malaria, dengue, or other tropical infectious diseases. Until data confirm their predictive value in malaria, we recommend diagnosing malaria-induced sepsis if malaria and one or more of the following signs occur: impaired consciousness, prostration, respiratory distress, multiple convulsions, hypoglycemia, severe malarial anaemia, renal impairment, jaundice, malaria-induced shock, significant bleeding, hyperparasitemia. Similarly, until further data are available, we recommend diagnosing dengue-induced sepsis if dengue infection and any of the following symptoms occur: shock, respiratory distress, severe bleeding, or any organ dysfunction; we recommend that healthcare workers, irrespective of their proficiency, be alert to consider sepsis in adults and children with acute infection of any etiology. Recognition of sepsis in children is based on different severity indicators; these are summarized in another set of the expert consensus recommendations that will be published separately.

### Advancing understanding of cerebrovascular hemodynamic perturbations in pediatric cerebral malaria using a modified critical closing pressure evaluation – A prospective, observational study [^113kbDqE]. Neurocritical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Cerebral malaria (CM) results in significant mortality globally. Abnormal cerebral blood flow (CBF) has been described in CM and may contribute to poor outcomes. Changes to vascular tone may be contributing to flow aberrations but measuring it in the clinical setting is difficult. Critical closing pressure (CrCP) is calculated as CrCP = intracranial pressure (ICP) + vascular tone + venous pressure. If CrCPs other components are determined, vascular tone can be inferred. CrCP can also be used to determine the diastolic closing margin (DCM = diastolic blood pressure (DBP)-CrCP) which represents the lower safety limit of cerebral perfusion pressure.

Methods

Children 6 months-12 years with CM and age-matched healthy controls were enrolled. Using concurrent transcranial doppler ultrasound (TCD) CBF velocities and systemic blood pressure measurements, CrCP was determined, and DCM calculated. Non-invasive estimates of ICP were assessed and venous flow was measured. Vascular tone was deduced. Differences in CrCP between controls and CM patients were determined. DCM and its association with outcome was assessed.

Results

We enrolled 220 children with CM and 400 controls. In CM patients, there were significantly more children with CrCP > 1SD below (n = 37, 17%) and > 1 SD above (n = 42, 19%) the mean normal value of the control group (n = 15, 5% > 1SD below and n = 20, 5% > 1 SD above, p < 0.001 for both). Opening pressure, an estimate of ICP, was not different between patients and controls. Venous flows were higher in children with CM than controls, but no difference was seen in CM patients with CrCP less than, within, or greater than 1SD from normal. A DCM < 20mmHg conferred a relative risk of poor outcome (RR 1.4, 95%CI 1.2–1.9, p = 0.008).

Conclusions

CrCP was > 1SD lower or higher than the mean normal value in a significant number of children with CM. A low DCM is associated with a worse prognosis and may serve as a therapeutic target.

### Advancing understanding of cerebrovascular hemodynamic perturbations in pediatric cerebral malaria using a modified critical closing pressure evaluation – A prospective, observational study [^111N4zeG]. Neurocritical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Many pediatric patients with CM have a critical closing pressure below or above normative values. Altered vascular tone may be a significant contributor to these findings. Future studies identifying causative factors for abnormal vascular tone, such as PaCO2 and/or deranged levels of paracrine modulators, could lead to the administration of pathophysiologically relevant adjunctive therapies in this patient population. Additionally, a low diastolic closing margin is associated with worse outcomes, and thus may represent a therapeutic target for future studies.

Physiologic Variables Impacting Vascular Tone

The strongest measurable drivers of vascular tone, blood pH and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), were evaluated. The mean pH in healthy controls was 7.4 ± 0.03 mmHg and the mean PaCO2 was 38 ± 3 mmHg. The mean pH in the cohort of CM patients was 7.39 ± 0.09 mmHg and the mean PaCO2 27 ± 10 mmHg (p = 0.9 and p = 0.04 compared to controls, respectively, Table 4). However, there were no significant differences in pH or PaCO2 identified between children with CM and CrCP within 1SD of the age normal compared to those with a CrCP > 1SD below the mean normal (7.39 ± 09 mmHg and 27 ± 11 mmHg) or > 1SD above the mean normal (7.4 ± 0.07 mmHg and 24 ± 11 mmHg)(p = 0.74 and p = 0.35 respectively)(Table 4).

When evaluating other modulators of vascular tone, the mean temperature for the control patients was 36.6 ± 0.3 degrees Celsius, mean arterial blood pressure was 75 ± 8 mmHg, oxygen saturation was 98 ± 1%, and packed cell volume was 34.8 ± 4.2%. Patients with CM had a similar mean temperature of 37.0 ± 0.6 degrees Celsius, mean blood pressure of 74 ± 8 mmHg and median oxygen saturations of 98 ± 2%, but a lower packed cell volume of 24 ± 3% (Table 4). We found no difference in temperature, mean blood pressure, oxygen saturation, or packed cell volume between CM patients with CrCP within 1SD of the normal mean compared to those CrCP > 1SD below the mean normal or above the mean normal (p > 0.99 for all, Table 4). Based on EEG, no patient was experiencing subclinical status epilepticus at the time of the TCD examination.

Venous pressure

In healthy controls, the mean venous flow velocity was 17 ± 1 cm/sec. It was significantly higher in children with CM at 28 ± 11 cm/sec (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in venous flow identified between children with CM and a CrCP within 1SD of age normal (29 ± 9) compared to those with a CrCP > 1SD below age normal (28 ± 10 mmHg) or > 1SD above age normal (28 ± 11 mmHg)(p = 0.16).

### Does artesunate prolong the electrocardiograph QT interval in patients with severe malaria? [^116651o1]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2009). Low credibility.

Several antimalarials can cause significant prolongation of the electrocardiograph QT interval, which can be associated with an increased risk of potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias. High doses of artemether and artemotil have been associated with QT prolongation in dogs, raising the possibility of a class effect with the artemisinin derivatives. Serial electrocardiograms were recorded, and QTc interval was calculated before and after administration of artesunate by intravenous injection in patients with severe falciparum malaria in Bangladesh. Of 21 adult patients with severe malaria enrolled, 8 (38%) died. The mean QTc interval was unaffected by bolus intravenous artesunate (2.4 mg/kg). In two patients, the QTc interval exceeded 0.5 seconds, but in both cases, an alternative explanation was plausible. No effect was observed on the JTc or PR interval, QRS width, blood pressure, or heart rate. Intravenous artesunate does not have significant cardiovascular effects in patients with severe falciparum malaria.

### Managing malaria in the intensive care unit [^114mvmQJ]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Although not considered a traditional manifestation of severe malaria, there is emerging evidence that cardiac dysfunction may complicate severe disease. A number of studies have found evidence of increased circulating levels of cardiac enzymes including BNP in individuals with severe malaria. – Intravascular haemolysis as a result of severe malaria has been shown in one small study to result in decreased levels of nitric oxide, increased pulmonary pressures, and myocardial wall stress. Further studies to understand the clinical importance of cardiac dysfunction in severe malaria are warranted.

Previous studies have demonstrated that traditional markers of fluid balance correlate poorly with acid–base status and respiratory function. The argument against aggressive fluid loading is strengthened by recent data on the physiological response of 28 adult ICU patients with severe malaria to fluid expansion guided by invasive cardiac monitoring. Despite trans-pulmonary thermodilution (PiCCO) guided therapy, acid–base status deteriorated in 68% and no improvement in renal function was observed after volume expansion. Significant increases in extravascular lung water occurred in 17 of 22 (77%) patients who were liberally resuscitated, with eight developing frank pulmonary oedema despite being hypo- or euvolaemic. Five patients died, all of whom developed pulmonary oedema. The authors found that the degree of lactataemia correlated with the degree of parasite microvascular sequestration, but not with hypovolaemia.

It would appear that, in the absence of prospective, randomized trial data, liberal fluid therapy is best avoided in the context of severe malaria. Because of the propensity of these patients towards capillary leak and thus a greater risk of ARDS and cerebral oedema, our own management approach is to target significant hypovolaemia with concurrent tissue hypoperfusion, that is, clinical markers of organ dysfunction (e.g. oliguria) with biochemical markers (e.g. lactate and central venous oxygen saturation). Fluid loading is guided by a goal-directed algorithm using both the stroke volume response to a fluid challenge (measured by minimally invasive oesophageal Doppler) and markers of tissue perfusion as therapeutic endpoints. Otherwise, fluid balance is kept neutral, in line with studies in critically ill patients showing a strong association between positive fluid balance and worse outcomes. Where vasopressor, inotrope, or both requirements persist, we maintain an acceptable cardiac output, avoiding fluid overload but targeting tissue perfusion and have a low threshold for diuresis in the haemodynamically stable patient in the postinflammatory phase of illness.

ICP

Tissue pressure (ICP) is a key variable that contributes to CrCP. Two indirect estimates of intracranial pathology/pressure, the volume of brain swelling on magnetic resonance imaging (or the brain volume score ((BVS)) and the opening pressure (OP) on lumbar puncture were measured on all patients with CM at the time of admission concurrently to TCD and blood pressure measurements done to calculate CrCP. The median BVS for the cohort was 5 (IQR 5–6), significantly higher than the normal BVS of 3 (Table 4). There were no significant differences in BVS identified between children with CM and CrCP within 1SD from normal compared to those with CrCP > 1SD below the mean normal (5 (IQR 5, 6)) or > 1SD above the mean normal (6 (IQR 4–7)) (p = 0.39)(Table 4).

### Retinopathy, histidine-rich protein-2 and perfusion pressure in cerebral malaria [^115Zd53c]. Brain (2014). Low credibility.

The authors omitted to discuss pressure autoregulation, and vascular response to carbon dioxide and oxygen in the brain and retina. Cerebral autoregulation seems to be impaired in Kenyan children with cerebral malaria, so that cerebral blood flow is likely to be determined by the cerebral perfusion pressure. It is unclear if retinal blood flow is determined by blood pressure in malaria, and raised intraocular pressure has not been reported in malaria. Many patients with cerebral malaria have hypocapnia, with deep breathing, to compensate for the metabolic acidosis. The cerebral and retinal circulations seem to have similar responses to hypocapnia, although there may be quantitative differences. There appear to be differences in the brain and retina to arterial oxygen content, which may affect the blood flow in these organs in those patients who have severe anaemia.

Retinopathy is observed in a proportion of Bangladeshi adults with cerebral malaria, and likely represents one pathogenesis of cerebral malaria. Retinopathy-negative and retinopathy-positive children had similar odds of abnormal neurological outcomes (61.9 versus 63.0) in a Malawian study, suggesting that both groups are clinically important.alluded to the fact that the retinopathy-negative group may have a different pathophysiological mechanism, related to the heterogeneous aetiologies observed in an autopsy study, but the role of observed parasitaemia remains unclear. In fact, some authors support other pathophysiological mechanisms (e.g. inflammation) in the development of cerebral malaria, although further studies are required to understand if this has a role in retinopathy-negative cerebral malaria. Thus other surrogate biological markers such as HRP2 that can be measured easily, should be identified, since these may be more useful in terms of initiating therapeutic interventions and determine endpoints for intervention studies for both retinopathy-positive and retinopathy-negative cerebral malaria.

### Effect of previous exposure to malaria on blood pressure in kilifi, Kenya: a mendelian randomization study [^116JAJhg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

SCT was associated with lower BP and reduced prevalence of hypertension in Kilifi but not in Nairobi, Kenya, or Jackson, Mississippi, an observation compatible with a causal association between malaria and higher BP. One implication is that malaria elimination would lead to health benefits well beyond those currently described. A second implication is that elucidating the mechanisms by which malaria leads to an elevation in BP could yield new preventive strategies for hypertension and consequent cardiovascular disease.

### Advancing understanding of cerebrovascular hemodynamic perturbations in pediatric cerebral malaria using a modified critical closing pressure evaluation – A prospective, observational study [^117YEpnG]. Neurocritical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

DCM

The diastolic closing margin in healthy children was 38 ± 12 mmHg whereas it was 31 ± 14 in children with CM (p < 0.001). A low DCM was identified in a total of 39 children with CM (18%), and a critical DCM was identified in 2 children (6%). Patients with a low DCM were significantly older (4.9 ± 2.7 years vs 3.8 ± 2.7 years, p = 0.02) and had lower PaCO2 values (22 ± 10 mmHg vs 29 ± 8 mmHg, p < 0.0001) than those with a DCM > 20mmHg. Blood pressure adjusted for age, packed cell volume, and opening pressure were not significantly different between children with low DCM compared to the rest of the cohort (p > 0.5 for all values, data not shown).

Outcomes

A good outcome was identified in 155 (70%) children with CM. The rest had a poor outcome, with 30 (14%) being discharged with moderate to severe disability and 35 (16%) dying prior to discharge. CrCP was not associated with outcome. Those children with a good outcome had an average CrCP of 32 ± 12 mmHg whereas those who survived with disability had an average CrCP of 28 ± 14 mmHg and those that died had an average CrCP of 27 ± 15 mmHg (p = 0.22).

A normal DCM was seen in 133 (60% of the entire cohort) of children with a good outcome and in 45 (21% of the entire cohort) with a poor outcome. A low DCM was identified in 23 (11%) children with a good outcome and in 19 (8%) with a poor outcome (Fig. 1). A low DCM < 20mmHg conferred a relative risk of poor outcome (death or disability) of 1.4 (95% CI 1.2–1.9)(p = 0.008). Both children with a critically low DCM died.

### Response to volume resuscitation in children with severe malaria [^115WTfsx]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine whether hypovolemia is an important cause of the acidosis in children with severe malaria.

Design

Prospective phase 1 study examining the safety of volume expansion using detailed hemodynamic monitoring.

Setting

High-dependency unit of Kilifi District Hospital on the coast of Kenya.

Patients

Kenyan children admitted with clinical features of severe malaria (impaired consciousness or deep breathing) complicated by acidosis (base excess of less than -8). Three groups were considered: severe malarial anemia plus acidosis if hemoglobin of < 5 mg/dL and base excess less than -8; moderate malaria acidosis if the base excess was between -8 and -15; severe malaria acidosis if the base excess was less than -15.

Interventions

Patients received between 10 and 40 mL/kg of either 0.9% normal saline or 4.5% human albumin solution.

Measurements and Main Results

A total of 53 children were recruited, and all had evidence of compensated shock at admission, with tachycardia, tachypnea, and prolonged capillary refill time. Mean central venous pressure (se) at admission was 2.9 cm H(2)O (0.5 cm H(2)O); in the severe malaria acidosis group, 44% had hypotension (systolic blood pressure of < 80 mm Hg). Improvements of hemodynamic indices and a reduction in acidosis followed administration of either saline or albumin. By 8 hrs, mean central venous pressure had increased to 7.5 cm H(2)O (0.5 cm H(2)O, F = 34.4, p < .001) and was associated with a reduction in mean respiratory rate from 49 to 41 breaths/min (2 to 1 breaths/min, respectively; F = 7.0; p = .009), a reduction in tachycardia from 151 to 141 beats/min (5 to 3 beats/min, respectively; F = 3.4; p = .06), and a reduction in capillary refill time. No child developed evidence of the life threatening complications of pulmonary edema and increased intracranial pressure.

Conclusions

Volume depletion is present at admission in the majority of children with severe malaria complicated by acidosis. Volume expansion corrects the hemodynamic abnormalities and is associated with improved organ function and reduction in acidosis. Formal trials of volume expansion are needed to determine whether volume expansion will reduce mortality.

### Case report: severe plasmodium vivax malaria after splenectomy [^111sBTnv]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

The patient was diagnosed with severe P. vivax malaria according to the following modified WHO criteria: hypotension/shock and prostration. He also had stage 2 acute kidney injury (AKI) by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. He was given 500 mL Ringer's lactate for fluid resuscitation and 1 g of intravenous paracetamol every 6 hours. Parenteral artesunate therapy was given intravenously at a dose of 2.4 mg/kg, which was repeated after 12 and 24 hours. Despite fluid administration, the patient's blood pressure remained low and dropped to 75/40 mmHg (Figure 1B), prompting the start of 500 mL Ringer's lactate for a second fluid resuscitation, and intravenous norepinephrine titrated to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 80 mmHg. Target MAP was achieved after 2 hours, and vasopressor support continued for 28 hours. Intravenous artesunate was given for 24 hours, followed by 3 days of oral DHP and 15 days of PQ, totaling 7 mg/kg. Antibiotics were not given. Chest examination, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation remained within normal limits during hospital care. The patient's hemodynamic status was monitored closely, with the last recorded blood pressure being 140/80 mmHg prior to discharge after 4 days in hospital care. Parasite clearance was confirmed by microscopy at a follow-up 18 days after discharge. A follow-up creatinine concentration 8 months after discharge (0.71 mg/dL) confirmed normalization of his renal function and defined his AKI at the time of severe malaria as KDIGO stage 2 (creatinine 2–2.9 times baseline).

### Recommendations for the management of severe malaria and severe dengue in resource-limited settings [^112fCWbd]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Severe falciparum malaria

Severe falciparum malaria is a multi-organ disease caused by Plasmodium falciparum transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes. The highest transmission and disease burden is in sub-Saharan Africa, where severe malaria is largely a paediatric disease, as older children and adults become partly immune. In Asia and South America, all age groups may be affected. Independent of age, the presenting symptoms with the strongest prognostic significance are coma (cerebral malaria), metabolic (lactic) acidosis and renal dysfunction. Hypotension occurs infrequently (~12% of cases). One of the main pathophysiologic differences of severe falciparum malaria compared to bacterial sepsis is microcirculatory impairment caused by sequestration of parasite-infected erythrocytes, red cell rigidity and red cell clumping. Management requires rapid parasitological diagnosis by microscopy or rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) and prompt initiation of parenteral artesunate. The SSC recommends that, in patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion and suspicion of hypovolemia, with either hypotension or hyperlactatemia, an initial fluid challenge of at least 30 ml/kg of crystalloids be administered, of which a portion may be albumin equivalent. Both paediatric and adult patients with severe malaria and tissue hypoperfusion are volume depleted intravascularly. A large trial on fluid bolus therapy in 3138 African children with severe infections and compensated shock, 57% of whom had falciparum malaria, showed an overall 40% increase in mortality with fluid bolus therapy (20 or 40 ml/kg with either saline or 5% albumin). In the 1793 children with severe P. falciparum malaria, mortality in the bolus groups was 51% higher [RR 1.51 (1.17–1.95)]. In Asian studies of adult severe malaria, rapid fluid resuscitation did not improve metabolic acidosis and transpulmonary thermodilution-guided rapid fluid resuscitation resulted in pulmonary oedema in 8/28 (29%) patients. One observational study from Myanmar showed no deterioration in renal function or plasma lactate with maintenance fluid therapy between 1.3 and 2.2 ml/kg/h. We recommend against the use of fluid bolus therapy in normotensive patients with severe falciparum malaria (1A). In normotensive patients, we suggest initial (24 h) crystalloid fluid therapy of 2–4 ml/kg/h, which may subsequently be reduced to 1 ml/kg/h in patients receiving additional fluids, e.g. through enteral tube feeding (2D). We suggest fluid bolus therapy (30 ml/kg) with an isotonic crystalloid in patients with hypotensive shock and, if available, early initiation of vasopressor support (ungraded) (Table 1).

### Is malaria an important cause of death among adults? [^116cCdw4]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

With the low level of vital event reporting from most countries with significant malaria burdens, the level of uncertainty about causes of death is not surprising, and similar questions could be asked equally appropriately about other causes. We believe that the aspiration toward malaria elimination and the impressive set of effective interventions available to prevent and treat malaria elevate its importance at this moment. We also believe that an evidence-based add-on VA module focused on the symptomatology of severe malaria in adults can be developed that will much more clearly distinguish malaria from other infectious causes of death, but that biological confirmation is also needed to further reduce the uncertainty. For practical reasons and encouraged by completed and ongoing research, we believe that it should be possible to identify a set of blood-borne severity and parasite-related biomarkers that can help rule in malaria and rule out important differential diagnoses. The approach outlined — which we are actively pursuing — is a practical and feasible alternative to the current uncertainty surrounding the question of adult malaria deaths.

### Associations between restrictive fluid management and renal function and tissue perfusion in adults with severe falciparum malaria: a prospective observational study [^116EVaC3]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite intravascular dehydration and a proinflammatory response in severe malaria, hypotension is not frequently observed. Bacterial coinfection is one of the causes of hypotension in severe malaria, Bloodstream bacterial coinfection is common in pediatric severe malaria. A recent study from Myanmar reported a high incidence of concomitant bacteremia in adults with falciparum malaria. The low incidence of hypotensive shock in severe malaria relates to preserved systemic vascular resistance and cardiac function possibly related to high concentrations of plasma cell-free hemoglobin, and it is compatible with our transpulmonary thermodilution findings in the current study. This contrasts with bacterial sepsis, where hypotensive shock is more common, despite the much lower pathogen density in the blood. Consequently, hypotensive shock is an infrequent indication for fluid bolus therapy in severe malaria, whereas the presence of hypotension should raise the suspicion of concomitant bacterial sepsis.

### Brain swelling and mannitol therapy in adult cerebral malaria: a randomized trial [^112eULqQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Contributors to cerebral swelling in cerebral malaria include an increased blood volume caused by the sequestered biomass, cytotoxic edema, and vasogenic edema. Because parasitized erythrocytes cytoadhere to endothelium in the microcirculation and have reduced flow rates caused by increased rigidity and stickiness to other erythrocytes, the fraction of parasitized red blood cells in the cerebral microcirculation can increase to about 50 times the parasitemia in the peripheral blood. Because overall cerebral blood flow is uncompromised in cerebral malaria, this extra blood volume must be accommodated within the intracranial space and will increase intracerebral pressure. Cytotoxic edema caused by swelling of neurons and glial and other cells is the result of hypoxic, toxic, or other injury. This cannot be distinguished from vasogenic edema by CT scan but can be differentiated by diffusion-weighted MRI scanning; studies addressing this are underway. Vasogenic cerebral edema occurs if the BBB is disrupted and is characteristically reversible (albeit temporarily) by osmotic diuretics. Cytoadherence might compromise the functional integrity of the BBB, and immunohistochemical postmortem studies have shown disruption of endothelial intercellular tight junctions. However, studies on the functional integrity of the BBB in adults with cerebral malaria suggest that the barrier function remains grossly intact and is only modestly changed in children. Albumin and immunoglobulin G indices in CSF, a measure of BBB integrity, were reported mostly within the normal range in a study on Vietnamese adults with cerebral malaria. The present results support the conclusion that it is unlikely that increased cerebral capillary permeability causing brain swelling is the initial cause of coma in cerebral malaria as originally suggested by Rigdon and Maegraith in the 1940s and repeated frequently since.

In conclusion, this study shows that mild to moderate cerebral swelling on CT scan and increased opening pressures on lumbar puncture are common findings in adult patients with cerebral malaria, but their presence does not correlate with coma depth or disease outcome. Mannitol as adjunctive therapy in patients with cerebral malaria and cerebral swelling is associated with prolonged coma duration and may be harmful.

### Aetiology and outcomes of sepsis in adults in sub-saharan Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112kTah7]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

The majority of studies recruited patients using a modified Sepsis-2 definition of sepsis or severe sepsis, though definitions were heterogeneous (primary study inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in Additional file 3). SIRS was used to define sepsis or severe sepsis in 13/14 cohorts, but the definition of SIRS itself was variable. Six of the 13 studies using SIRS did not use the white cell count criterion because of resource limitations, and four different temperature thresholds were used in the 13 studies to define hypo- or hyperthermia.

Of the 13 studies using SIRS as a component of inclusion criteria, 8/13 recruited patients with a definition compatible with Sepsis-2 sepsis (SIRS plus suspected or confirmed infection, 1255 patients in total) and 5/13 studies recruited a population compatible with Sepsis-2 severe sepsis of SIRS plus organ dysfunction (1347 patients in total). A variety of organ dysfunction criteria were used including hyperlactataemia or poor Karnofsky performance score; the most common organ dysfunction criterion was low systolic blood pressure, applied in all five studies. No study specifically recruited patients with septic shock, and despite the frequent use of low systolic blood pressure as a defining criterion for severe sepsis, only one study explicitly defined septic shock, using a definition of hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg or MAP < 65 mmHg) refractory to 2 L of intravenous fluid administered over 2 h; 27 of 150 recruited patients fulfilled this definition.

The one study that used a non-Sepsis 2-based definition defined sepsis as fever plus one severity criterion, adapted from the WHO severe malaria definitions.

RESULTS

Baseline Characteristics and Recruitment

Data from detailed and focused echocardiographic examinations, respectively, were available from 52 and 49 patients with severe malaria, 30 and 53 patients with uncomplicated malaria, and 32 and 12 healthy participants, respectively. Of these patients, 5 with uncomplicated malaria and 3 with severe malaria had a history of cardiovascular disease (hypertension only). The healthy control group had larger body surface areas than the malaria groups (both P < .001) (Table 1). The age range in the severe malaria group was from 10- to 70-year-olds with 8% (8 of 101) being under 18 years. Two patients with severe malaria were receiving inotropes/vasopressors, and 1 patient was mechanically ventilated around the time of assessment. Mortality was 34% (34 of 101) in severe malaria. The volumes of intravenous fluid patients with severe malaria had received before enrollment were similar in those who died (22 mL/kg; interquartile range [IQR], 11–41; N = 20) and in those who survived (22 mL/kg; IQR,11–41; N = 43) (P = 0.895).

### Advancing understanding of cerebrovascular hemodynamic perturbations in pediatric cerebral malaria using a modified critical closing pressure evaluation – A prospective, observational study [^116sBKsN]. Neurocritical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Local Tissue Factors

Blood pH and PaCO2 independently and concomitantly regulate cerebrovascular tone. Blood pH was not significantly different between control patients and those with CM nor between CrCP groupings of CM patients. PaCO2 was significantly lower in children with CM compared to controls, thus making this a possible contributor to increased cerebrovascular tone in CM, particularly in those with high CrCP. However, if PaCO2 were the only driver of the vascular tone alterations leading to different measured CrCP, those with low CrCP would have been expected to have normal or significantly higher PaCO2 than those children with normal or high CrCP. PaCO2 values were not different between children with CM and different CrCPs (less than, within, or greater than 1SD from age normal). Thus, PaCO2 may be contributing to abnormal vascular tone in some individuals, but other factors should also be considered.

Oxygen saturation values were not different between control and CM patients nor between CrCP groupings, making it less likely have contributed to measured CrCP. However, oxygenation saturation was measured peripherally only, and it remains possible that local cerebral tissue hypoxia due to poor delivery or impaired utilization could have contributed to vascular tone derangements in some patients. Direct invasive measurement of brain tissue oxygenation is not possible in our setting, so this could not be measured.

Together, it is less likely that tissue factors such as pH, PaCO2, and oxygen saturation were primary drivers of vascular tone differences between CrCP groupings, albeit the PaCO2 may have influenced tone in some children with high CrCP.

Neuronal Activity/Altered Metabolic Demand

The degree of fever was not significantly different between control and CM participants nor between CrCP groupings of CM patients. Additionally, no patient had evidence of subclinical status epilepticus on EEG done concurrently with the TCD/blood pressure measurements. It is therefore unlikely that neuronal activity/flow metabolism coupling contributed to the CrCP differences in CM patients.

### Reduced cardiac index reserve and hypovolemia in severe falciparum malaria [^115xMw7g]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Using a noninvasive approach maximized recruitment into the study. However, this meant that chamber pressures and central venous oxygen saturations were not measured. In particular, in assessment of contractility and diastolic function, the assessment of pressure-volume loops would be informative. We have not assessed ventriculo-arterial coupling, a factor that can affect cardiac performance. Adolescents were included alongside adults; severe malaria presents similarly in children over 10 years old as in adults. Dimensions were adjusted for body size. Detailed studies were performed at only 1 of the study sites, and additional studies will be required to assess the generalizability of these findings in other settings. Inclusion of exercising or anemic healthy participants would be of value for controlling for the effects of heart rate and hematocrit.

### Respiratory manifestations of malaria [^112178Cg]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Respiratory distress develops in up to 25% of adults and 40% of children with severe falciparum malaria. Its diverse causes include respiratory compensation of metabolic acidosis, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, concomitant pneumonia, and severe anemia. Patients with severe falciparum, vivax, and knowlesi malaria may develop acute lung injury (ALI) and ARDS, often several days after antimalarial drug treatment. ARDS rates, best characterized for severe Plasmodium falciparum, are 5% to 25% in adults and up to 29% in pregnant women; ARDS is rare in young children. ARDS pathophysiology centers on inflammatory-mediated increased capillary permeability or endothelial damage leading to diffuse alveolar damage that can continue after parasite clearance. The role of parasite sequestration in the pulmonary microvasculature is unclear, because sequestration occurs intensely in P falciparum, less so in P knowlesi, and has not been shown convincingly in P vivax. Because early markers of ALI/ARDS are lacking, fluid resuscitation in severe malaria should follow the old adage to "keep them dry". Bacteremia and hospital-acquired pneumonia can complicate severe malaria and may contribute to ALI/ARDS. Mechanical ventilation can save life in ALI/ARDS. Basic critical care facilities are increasingly available in tropical countries. The use of lung-protective ventilation has helped to reduce mortality from malaria-induced ALI/ARDS, but permissive hypercapnia in unconscious patients is not recommended because increased intracranial pressure and cerebral swelling may occur in cerebral malaria. The best antimalarial treatment of severe malaria is IV artesunate.

Discussion

Cerebral malaria impacts thousands of African children annually and is associated with high mortality rates. An improved understanding of the basic pathologic mechanisms of disease is required to rationalize the development and deployment of targeted adjunctive therapies that may improve outcomes. Transcranial doppler ultrasound has identified five distinct alterations to measured CBFVs and morphologic waveforms in two different populations of African children, each associated with different odds ratios of poor outcomes. Further investigations into mechanistic contributors of aberrant cerebral blood flow in CM is paramount as, once identified, these factors may be a target of therapeutic approaches. Previous work has led us to hypothesize that an alteration to vascular tone may be a primary contributor to previously reported deranged CBFVs in some patients with CM. We therefore measured CrCP (CrCP = ICP + vascular tone + venous pressure) to estimate vascular tone in a cohort of children with the disease. Our key findings were 1) Compared to the CrCP in healthy control patients, the CrCP was both significantly lower and higher in many children with CM (17% of children with CM had a CrCP that was > 1SD below the mean CrCP of healthy children and 19% of children with CM had a CrCP that was > 1SD above the mean CrCP of healthy children) 2) A low diastolic closing margin < 20mmHg was associated with increased rates of poor outcome.

Pathophysiology of Altered CrCP in CM

Intracranial Pressure

Critical closing pressure is calculated as: ICP + vascular tone + venous pressure. In CM patients, brain volume scores were significantly higher than is seen in normal individuals. However, as a scoring system of the MRI appearance of cerebral hemispheres, increases, particularly to the lower range of the score (i.e. 5–6 as was seen in most patients in this study) may not translate to elevated intracranial pressure given the compensatory mechanisms of the intracranial space. Indeed, in our cohort, ICP, estimated by opening pressure, was not significantly different than published normative pediatric values. Additionally, when evaluating both BVS and OP with CM by different CrCP groupings (within 1SD of age normal value, > 1SD below age normal value, > 1SD above age normal) there were no significant differences identified. This makes increased ICP less likely to be a significant contributor to abnormal CrCP values in many children with CM.

### Randomized trial of volume expansion with albumin or saline in children with severe malaria: preliminary evidence of albumin benefit [^112PCySQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Metabolic acidosis is the best predictor of death in children with severe falciparum malaria; however, its treatment presents a therapeutic dilemma, because acidosis and hypovolemia may coexist with coma, which can be associated with elevated intracranial pressure. We postulated that volume resuscitation with albumin might correct acidosis and hypovolemia with a lower risk of precipitating cerebral edema than crystalloid. In an open-label, randomized, controlled trial, we compared the safety of resuscitation with albumin to saline in Kenyan children with severe malaria.

Methods

We randomly assigned children with severe malaria and metabolic acidosis (base deficit, > 8 mmol/L) to receive fluid resuscitation with either 4.5% albumin or normal saline. A control (maintenance only) group was only included for patients with a base deficit of < 15 mmol/L. The primary outcome measure was the percentage reduction in base deficit at 8 h. Secondary end points included death, the requirement for rescue therapies, and neurological sequelae in survivors.

Results

Of 150 children recruited for the trial, 61 received saline, 56 received albumin, and 33 served as control subjects. There was no significant difference in the resolution of acidosis between the groups; however, the mortality rate was significantly lower among patients who received albumin (3.6% [2 of 56 patients]) than among those who received saline (18% [11 of 61]; relative risk, 5.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.2–24.8; p = 0.013).

Conclusions

In high-risk children with severe malaria and acidosis, fluid resuscitation with albumin may reduce mortality. Our study design did not enable us to determine whether saline administration is preferable to fluid restriction or whether saline administration is actually hazardous. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings before definitive treatment recommendations can be made.

### Reduced cardiac index reserve and hypovolemia in severe falciparum malaria [^112nKr6w]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Impaired microvascular perfusion is central to the development of coma and lactic acidosis in severe falciparum malaria. Refractory hypotension is rare on admission but develops frequently in fatal cases. We assessed cardiac function and volume status in severe falciparum malaria and its prognostic significance.

Methods

Patients with severe (N = 101) or acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria (N = 83) were recruited from 2 hospitals in India and Bangladesh, and healthy participants (N = 44) underwent echocardiography.

Results

Patients with severe malaria had 38% shorter left ventricular (LV) filling times and 25% shorter LV ejection times than healthy participants because of tachycardia; however, stroke volume, LV internal diameter in diastole (LVIDd), and LV internal diameter in systole (LVIDs) indices were similar. A low endocardial fraction shortening (eFS) was present in 17% (9 of 52) of severe malaria patients. Adjusting for preload and afterload, eFS was similar in health and severe malaria. Fatal cases had smaller baseline LVIDd and LVIDs indices, more collapsible inferior vena cavae (IVC), and higher heart rates than survivors. The LVIDs and IVC collapsibility were independent predictors for mortality, together with base excess and Glasgow Coma Scale.

Conclusions

Patients with severe malaria have rapid ejection of a normal stroke volume. Fatal cases had features of relative hypovolemia and reduced cardiac index reserve.

### Reduced cardiac index reserve and hypovolemia in severe falciparum malaria [^116De5Ch]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Severe falciparum malaria caused an estimated 435 000 deaths globally in 2017. Vital organ dysfunction develops in patients with high parasite biomass infections. Reduced microcirculatory perfusion resulting from microvascular obstruction by sequestered parasites is central to the development of coma and lactic acidosis. Although dehydration is common and hypovolemia may occur, large volume fluid resuscitation is not associated with resolution of acidosis and may result in pulmonary edema. Rapid administration of large fluid volumes is associated with secondary hypotension and increased mortality in children. These findings suggest that microvascular obstruction and dysfunction (rather than hypovolemia or insufficient cardiac output) lead to inadequate tissue perfusion.

The causal chain of events resulting in death from severe malaria has multiple links. The factors that cause severe disease to develop (including sequestration of a high parasite biomass infection) are not necessarily equivalent to the factors affecting subsequent survival. Although hypovolemia does not cause coma or acidosis, macrovascular stability could determine survival after the start of treatment because refractory hypotension is a common terminal event in patients with severe malaria. The cardiovascular system in malaria is hyperdynamic, with an increase in the ratio of oxygen consumption to delivery resulting from increased oxygen consumption and anemia. There have been few studies of cardiac function in adult patients with severe malaria. Post-mortem studies of the heart in adults and children dying from severe falciparum malaria have shown that sequestration of parasitized erythrocytes in the cardiac microvasculature is common.

We studied the relationships between disease severity, cardiac function, and volume status in malaria. We hypothesized that reduced cardiac index reserve resulting from hypovolemia and impaired systolic function are associated with increased mortality.

### Predicting the clinical outcome of severe falciparum malaria in African children: findings from a large randomized trial [^116T2f82]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

METHODS

This analysis is based on a randomized clinical trial comparing parenteral artesunate with parenteral quinine in African children with severe falciparum malaria. The trial was conducted between 2005 and 2010 in 11 participating centers in 9 African countries (Table 1). The spectrum of participating hospitals ranged from university hospitals and research institutes to rural hospitals without prior research experience. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing was approved at 4 sites (Beira, Muheza, Rwamagana/Nyanza, and Kilifi). The reported HIV prevalence (Table 1) relied on historical data from adults.

Table 1.
Age Distribution, Case Fatality Rate, and Adult HIV Prevalence by Study Center

The methods and the outcome of the trial have been reported in detail elsewhere. Febrile children less than 15 years of age with a positive Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2–based rapid test (Optimal) for falciparum malaria were eligible for enrolment based on a clinical judgment of severe malaria, which included at least 1 of the following conditions: coma, defined by a Blantyre Coma Scale (BCS) score ≤ 2 for children less than 2 years of age or a Glasgow Coma Scale (GSC) score ≤ 9 for older children; prostration, defined as the inability to sit unsupported (for children over 6 months of age) or the inability to drink or breast-feed in younger children; convulsions with a duration longer than 30 minutes or a frequency of 2 or more in the 24 hours preceding admission; compensated shock, defined as a peripheral capillary refill time ≥ 3 seconds or the presence of a temperature gradient with a normal systolic BP (≥ 70 mmHg); decompensated shock, defined as a systolic blood pressure < 70 mmHg; severe respiratory distress, defined as nasal alar flaring, costal indrawing, or use of accessory muscles, severe tachypnea, or deep breathing; hypoglycemia, defined as blood glucose < 3 mmol/L or clinical improvement in the level of consciousness immediately after administration of 10% dextrose; severe symptomatic anemia, defined as severe pallor combined with respiratory distress; blackwater fever; clinical jaundice; hyperparasitemia, defined as asexual parasitemia above 10%. Patients were enrolled after a relative or guardian gave informed written consent.

### Algid malaria treated with early goal-directed therapy [^1126JX33]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Severe malaria complicated by circulatory shock is known as algid malaria. Cases of severe imported malaria are seen increasingly frequently in emergency departments in the United States, Europe, and other locales. The optimal volume resuscitation strategy for patients with severe malaria is not well-defined. A 20-year-old woman, who immigrated 2 weeks ago from Niger, Africa, presented to the emergency department of an urban teaching hospital with fever, hypotension, and malaise. She was resuscitated with 5.5 L of normal saline solution and norepinephrine. Thin blood smear demonstrated Plasmodium falciparum with parasitemia of 10% to 15%. She had rapid reversal of circulatory shock, cleared her parasitemia in less than 48 hours with antimalarial therapy, and was discharged home on hospital day 6 in good condition. The optimal resuscitation strategy for algid malaria is unknown, and volume restriction has been advocated as a means to prevent life-threatening cerebral and pulmonary edema. Although not identical, the late inflammatory response in severe malaria leading to capillary permeability shares many similarities with the immunologic response in bacterial sepsis. Our case report discusses a patient with severe imported malaria complicated by shock, successfully managed with large-volume fluid resuscitation, hemodynamic optimization, early antimalarial agents, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. This report questions the strategy of cautious fluid resuscitation in algid malaria and suggests that case series comparing goal-directed resuscitation to historic controls along with prospective multicenter controlled trials should be conducted to determine the best fluid resuscitation strategy.

### Malaria and the conducting system of the heart [^114t4XSB]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

We report the case of an adult male patient who was admitted to our hospital with a diagnosis of vivax malaria complicated with renal insufficiency and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was treated with intravenous artesunate. He was intubated and mechanically ventilated and taken up for haemodialysis in view of worsening renal parameters. He developed tachycardia a few hours later. ECG showed sinus tachycardia. Tachycardia persisted though the blood pressure was normal, there was no evidence of bleeding, and the heart was clinically normal. We tried to control the heart rate with diltiazem, adenosine and metoprolol but the tachycardia persisted. The heart rate was finally controlled with amiodarone. The patient improved, was weaned off from the ventilator and extubated. His renal functions gradually improved. Oral amiodarone was continued and there was no recurrence of tachycardia. We present this case to highlight the interesting association of vivax malaria with persistent, difficult to treat tachycardia.

### Monkey malaria in a European traveler returning from Malaysia [^117JRYd2]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

On day 2 of the patient's hospital stay, fever returned and he was transferred to the Helsinki University Central Hospital (Department of Infectious Diseases at Aurora Hospital). Blood smears obtained there showed Plasmodium parasites that were considered atypical, and the laboratory reported suspicion of a co-infection (P. falciparum and P. malariae) (Figure). The IV quinine dihydrochloride was replaced with oral quinine hydrochloride, and doxycycline was continued. During treatment, the patient experienced an attack of hypoglycemia (electrocardiogram and blood pressure was normal during this attack), transient mild visual and hearing loss, and transient lymphopenia (a low of 0.46 × 10 9 /L). He received quinine hydrochloride and doxycycline for a total of 10 days.

### Reduced cardiac index reserve and hypovolemia in severe falciparum malaria [^115AuEmb]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, our study shows that impaired systolic function is typically absent in malaria and does not predict mortality. Diastolic LV function in malaria patients is usually not impaired and varies with age. Stroke volume index is maintained in adult patients with malaria despite a reduction in LV filling and ejection time. Patients who died from severe malaria had evidence of hypovolemia at baseline and evidence of reduced cardiac index reserve. Future studies should investigate whether tailoring fluid therapy to optimize volume status in these patients is beneficial.

### Effect of previous exposure to malaria on blood pressure in kilifi, Kenya: a mendelian randomization study [^1142NJDN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background Malaria exposure in childhood may contribute to high blood pressure (BP) in adults. We used sickle cell trait (SCT) and α + thalassemia, genetic variants conferring partial protection against malaria, as tools to test this hypothesis. Methods and Results Study sites were Kilifi, Kenya, which has malaria transmission, and Nairobi, Kenya, and Jackson, Mississippi, where there is no malaria transmission. The primary outcome was 24-hour systolic BP. Prevalent hypertension, diagnosed using European Society of Hypertension thresholds was a secondary outcome. We performed regression analyses adjusting for age, sex, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. We studied 1127 participants in Kilifi, 516 in Nairobi, and 651 in Jackson. SCT frequency was 21% in Kilifi, 16% in Nairobi, and 9% in Jackson. SCT was associated with -2.4 (95% CI, -4.7 to -0.2) mm Hg lower 24-hour systolic BP in Kilifi but had no effect in Nairobi/Jackson. The effect of SCT in Kilifi was limited to 30- to 59-year-old participants, among whom it was associated with -6.1 mm Hg (CI, -10.5 to -1.8) lower 24-hour systolic BP. In pooled analysis allowing interaction by site, the effect of SCT on 24-hour systolic BP in Kilifi was -3.5 mm Hg (CI, -6.9 to -0.1), increasing to -5.2 mm Hg (CI, -9.5 to -0.9) when replacing estimated glomerular filtration rate with urine albumin to creatinine ratio as a covariate. In Kilifi, the prevalence ratio for hypertension was 0.86 (CI, 0.76–0.98) for SCT and 0.89 (CI, 0.80–0.99) for α + thalassemia. Conclusions Lifelong malaria protection is associated with lower BP in Kilifi. Confirmation of this finding at other sites and elucidating the mechanisms involved may yield new preventive and therapeutic targets.

### Cell-free hemoglobin is associated with increased vascular resistance and reduced peripheral perfusion in severe malaria [^1123M9zF]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In severe falciparum malaria, unlike sepsis, hypotension on admission is uncommon. We hypothesized that low nitric oxide bioavailability due to the presence of cell-free hemoglobin (CFH) increases vascular tone in severe malaria.

Methods

Patients with severe malaria (n = 119), uncomplicated malaria (n = 91), or suspected bacterial sepsis (n = 56), as well as healthy participants (n = 50), were recruited. The systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) was estimated from the echocardiographic cardiac index and the mean arterial pressure.

Results

SVRI and hematocrit levels were lower and plasma CFH and asymmetric dimethylarginine levels were higher in patients with malaria, compared with healthy participants. In multivariate linear regression models for mean arterial pressure or SVRI in patients with severe malaria, hematocrit and CFH but not asymmetric dimethylarginine were significant predictors. The SVRI was lower in patients with suspected bacterial sepsis than in those with severe malaria, after adjustment for hematocrit and age. Plasma CFH levels correlated positively with the core-peripheral temperature gradient and plasma lactate levels and inversely with the perfusion index. Impaired peripheral perfusion, as reflected by a low perfusion index or a high core-peripheral temperature gradient, predicted mortality in patients with severe malaria.

Conclusions

CFH is associated with mean arterial pressure, SVRI, and peripheral perfusion in patients with severe malaria. This may be mediated through the nitric oxide scavenging potency of CFH, increasing basal vascular tone and impairing tissue perfusion.

### Epidemiological links between malaria parasitaemia and hypertension: findings from a population-based survey in rural Côte D'ivoire [^112Fh13A]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

This result is also compatible with the shared origin hypothesis and the relation to selective pressure of genes protecting against malaria. The observed association of latent malaria with lower hypertension risk suggests that genetic variants were selected, which protect humans against severe malaria and at the same time protect against high BP. This is also supported by the fact that the protective effect of latent malaria tended to be stronger with a positive family history of hypertension.

Candidate genes potentially relevant to the shared origin hypothesis exist. First, genetic variants of ACE (D allele of ACE I/D polymorphism), which were associated with higher ACE levels and increased conversion of angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II, were associated with hypertension, and milder forms of malaria in Indian population. This is not in line with our finding of an inverse association between latent malaria and hypertension. But in line with our findings is a recent study from Nigeria where serum levels of ACE were higher in patients without malaria than in malaria cases, and ACE level was inversely correlated with malaria severity. Second, genetic variants on chemokine receptor 1 (CR1) gene, which are related to atherosclerosis also conferred protection from severe malaria.

Among participants with microscopic malaria, accompanied by elevated body temperature, whose infection is more likely acute and symptomatic, a tendency toward higher BP was observed compared with those without malaria parasitaemia and elevated body temperature. Several aspects may explain this positive association. First, elevated BP could be the acute outcome of disease and fever. Second, the current nonlatent disease could be representative of the person's more general reaction to infection. In this case, the participants may have experienced more severe infections and pro-inflammatory episodes in the past, mediating the effect on high BP. In-utero exposure to microscopic malaria was associated with BP in adolescents. Fever, characteristic of symptomatic malaria results from inflammation and may lead to haemodynamic changes, which raise BP to improve perfusion and restore homeostasis. Third, the observed positive association may again reflect shared genetics with individuals susceptible to severe malaria being at higher risk of hypertension. The mechanisms behind shared genetics are still unclear, but the strengthening of the endothelial–brain barrier via vasoconstriction is thought to be a pathway to reduce the occurrence of cerebral malaria, evidenced by experimental mouse models.

### Effect of previous exposure to malaria on blood pressure in kilifi, Kenya: a mendelian randomization study [^115JK1D7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, SCT, a genetic polymorphism associated with partial protection against malaria, was associated with a 2.4‐mm Hg lower mean 24‐hour SBP and a 14% lower prevalence of hypertension in Kilifi, an area with malaria transmission, but not in Nairobi and Jackson, areas with no malaria transmission. α‐Thalassemia, which provides a lower level of protection against malaria was associated with an 11% reduction in the prevalence of hypertension in Kilifi but not in Nairobi. This suggests that increased risk of malaria is associated with higher adult BP. In the absence of malaria, in Nairobi and Jackson, mean BP estimates were marginally higher among participants with SCT than those without SCT. Incorporating this baseline observation in a pooled analysis that compared malaria with nonmalaria sites, we estimate that malaria is responsible for a mean increase in 24‐hour SBP of 3.5 mm Hg.

This difference in BP is roughly similar to those attributed to reduction of salt intake by ≈4 g/d 25 or a dose of 10 mg/d of ramipril in the HOPE (Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation) trial. 26 At the population level, a reduction in SBP of 3 mm Hg may avert a substantial number of cardiovascular events including an ≈15% reduction in the incidence of stroke. 27 However, several factors suggest that the actual effect of malaria on BP might be greater. First, SCT is only associated with a 50% reduction in incidence of nonsevere malaria 13 and 90% reduction against severe malaria episodes, 28 and this relative protection wanes with age. 14 Second, the protection offered by SCT against malaria is reduced in individuals with concurrent α + thalassemia 24 who comprised 67% of participants in the current study who had SCT. The current study was not powered to analyze the effect of this interaction. In addition, because Kilifi has low to moderate malaria transmission, 6 the effect of malaria on BP in other parts of Africa where malaria is endemic could be considerably higher.

### Epidemiological links between malaria parasitaemia and hypertension: findings from a population-based survey in rural Côte D'ivoire [^113DTGnZ]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The prevalence of hypertension in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) is increasing, contributing to higher mortality rates because of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Although this may be attributed to urbanization and westernization of lifestyle, they do not explain the high rates that have also been observed in rural areas. Persons of African ethnic background are well known to have comparatively higher blood pressure (BP) and stroke risk than Caucasians. At the same time, malaria parasitaemia remains prevalent and a significant contributor to mortality in LMICs. Together with malaria parasitaemia, hypertension contributes to a state of double disease burden, which further strains individual health and poor health systems in LMICs.

A potential link between malaria parasitaemia and hypertension was hypothesized. Suggested pathways can be divided into causative malaria parasitaemia effects and shared origins. Proposed direct effects of malaria parasitaemia include the promotion, in the long-term, of an atherosclerosis-promoting pro-inflammatory state because of repeated infections. In-utero and early life effects of malaria parasitaemia on low birth weight, malnutrition and stunting, are established risk factors for CVD later in life. In pregnant women, malaria parasitaemia effect on preeclampsia puts them at risk for hypertension. In the short-term, malaria parasitaemia could induce BP fluctuations in either direction. It is even conceivable that BP may first increase during the milder stages of malaria parasitaemia and subsequently falls as observed in severe malaria.

The shared origin hypothesis is rooted in pathways common to malaria parasitaemia and hypertension, such as immunity, inflammation and body fluid regulation, and in the observation of higher rates of hypertension among individuals of African and Asian ancestry in malaria-free western settings. It suggests selective pressure of genetic variants that protect against malaria or its pathogenesis, regardless of other potentially resulting negative systemic outcomes. Malaria parasitaemia exerted the strongest selective pressure on the human genome in recent history, in part related to sickle cell trait. But the latter was not related to 24-h BP measurements and arterial stiffness in African children from a malaria-free region. Additional genes under selective pressure include those involved in oxidative stress, inflammation, immunity and endothelial function. Genetic variants that promote angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity, and hypertension, have higher expression rates in African Americans compared with whites, and were associated with milder forms of malaria.

### Advancing understanding of cerebrovascular hemodynamic perturbations in pediatric cerebral malaria using a modified critical closing pressure evaluation – A prospective, observational study [^1125dfp2]. Neurocritical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

The most significant limitation of our work is the method by which the CrCP was calculated. The most accurate methods rely on continuous, simultaneous measurements of middle cerebral artery flow velocity and invasive arterial blood pressure. Offline analysis then allows for the correct compensation of the time delay between blood pressure and cerebral flow velocity curves, eliminating hysteresis of the blood pressure/flow velocity plots during regression analysis. Invasive, continuous arterial blood pressure monitoring is not available at our center, nor in most regions where malaria infection is endemic, making this approach not feasible for use in children with CM. We performed simultaneous measurements of both the TCD and blood pressure at the bedside and then took the averaged absolute values to run a linear regression, where CrCP was determined to be the intersection of that line with the x axis. Consequently, this approach gives only a rough estimate of the CrCP. However, given the relatively rapid heart rate of pediatric patients (mean HR 140 in our cohort), the time resolution may have been marginal and our estimates of CrCP reasonable. This is supported by the fact that the mean CrCP of our healthy control patients calculated in this manner was 31 (± 4) mmHg and values of CrCP reported in healthy adults using invasive monitoring and more advanced processing methods are typically around 30 mmHg as well. Future studies in other settings where advanced neuromonitoring of pediatric patients is possible could be done to validate our approach compared to the gold standard of continuous monitoring with offline analysis described above. If validated, our approach has proven feasible to perform and useful to inform immediate clinical decisions in this resource limited malaria endemic setting, which could potentially be extrapolated to allow real time decision making in other settings as well.

Results

Baseline characteristics of the study population

A total of 138 consecutive patients with severe malaria and 102 with uncomplicated malaria were recruited to participate in this study. Non-malarial reference groups of acutely ill patients included 32 consecutively recruited participants with sepsis and 35 with febrile encephalopathy. At the time of admission, 63% of patients with severe malaria were comatose, 46% had jaundice, 17% were severely anaemic, 16% had acute kidney injury, 2% were hypoglycaemic and 1% had haemodynamic shock. Mortality rates were 28% among participants with severe malaria, 50% for those with sepsis and 43% for patients with encephalopathy. The clinical and biochemical characteristics of these participants at the time of enrolment are shown in Table 1.

### Impact of COVID-19 and malaria coinfection on clinical outcomes: a retrospective cohort study [^115FjRQn]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Despite the possibility of concurrent infection with COVID-19 and malaria, little is known about the clinical course of coinfected patients. We analysed the clinical outcomes of patients with concurrent COVID-19 and malaria infection.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study that assessed prospectively collected data of all patients who were admitted between May and December 2020 to the Universal COVID-19 treatment center (UCTC), Khartoum, Sudan. UCTC compiled demographic, clinical, laboratory (including testing for malaria), and outcome data in all patients with confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized at that clinic. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality during the hospital stay. We built proportional hazard Cox models with malaria status as the main exposure and stepwise adjustment for age, sex, cardiovascular comorbidities, diabetes, and hypertension.

Results

We included 591 patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis who were also tested for malaria. Mean (SD) age was 58 (16.2) years, 446/591 (75.5%) were males. Malaria was diagnosed in 270/591 (45.7%) patients. Most malaria patients were infected by Plasmodium falciparum (140/270; 51.9%), while 121/270 (44.8%) were coinfected with Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. Median follow-up was 29 days. Crude mortality rates were 10.71 and 5.87 per 1000 person-days for patients with and without concurrent malaria, respectively. In the fully adjusted Cox model, patients with concurrent malaria and COVID-19 had a greater mortality risk (hazard ratio 1.43, 95% confidence interval 1.21–1.69).

Discussion

Coinfection with COVID-19 and malaria is associated with increased all-cause in-hospital mortality compared to monoinfection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

### Optimizing intradermal administration of cryopreserved plasmodium falciparum sporozoites in controlled human malaria infection [^115Ydj1N]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2015). Low credibility.

Study population and design.

The clinical study was conducted at the Center for Vaccine Development, at the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMB) in Baltimore, MD. Thirty malaria-naive adults aged 18–45 years were randomized into one of six groups to receive a total dose of 1 × 10 4 (four groups) or 5 × 10 4 PfSPZ (two groups) of PfSPZ Challenge. The total dose was split into either two or eight PfSPZ injections administered parenterally via ID injection in either 10 μL (two groups of 1 × 10 4 and two groups of 5 × 10 4 PfSPZ) or 50 μL aliquots (two groups of 1 × 10 4 PfSPZ) during a single administration session with a total of five subjects per group (Table 1). The lower limit of injectate by needle and syringe is currently ∼5–10 μL. As 50-μL injections in two divided doses did not achieve 100% infection, this study was weighted toward an injectate volume of 10 μL. Although increasing the volume of injectate above 50 μL would likely contribute to tissue destruction, it might also lead to sporozoites being trapped within the injectate and unable to be distributed systemically. We postulated the combination of multiple injections and microaliquots of sporozoites might simultaneously enhance tissue destruction while enabling sporozoite penetration into the capillary system allowing for hepatic delivery. An upper limit of eight injections balanced the need to increase injection number while preserving practicality in a clinical trial setting. Participants were randomized by an online allocation sequence generated by the EMMES Corporation (Rockville, MD). Study personnel were blinded to group assignment. Participants were previously screened for good health, including laboratory testing for hepatitis B and C, human immunodeficiency virus, and for pregnancy testing in females of childbearing potential. Baseline complete blood counts, creatinine, glucose, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were screened and only volunteers with normal values were enrolled. In addition, volunteers with significant cardiovascular risk were excluded (i.e. > 10%, 5-year risk), including evaluation by gender and age for systolic blood pressure (mmHg), smoking status (current versus past or never), body mass index (kg/mm 2), reported diabetes status, and current treatment of raised blood pressure. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and read by a staff cardiologist. Exclusion criteria included known history of malaria infection, long-term residence (> 5 years) in a malaria-endemic area, travel to a malaria-endemic area within the previous 6 months, the presence of hemoglobin S by electrophoresis, and splenectomy.

### The relevance of malaria pathophysiology to strategies of clinical management [^113qKB5q]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Malaria claims 1–2 million lives a year, mostly children in sub-Saharan Africa. The majority of hospital deaths occur within 24 h of admission despite adequate treatment with antimalarial chemotherapy. Understanding the pathophysiological disturbances of malaria should allow the development of supportive therapy to "buy time" for antimalarial chemotherapy to clear the infection. It is sobering, however, that despite many trials over the last quarter of a century all large trials of adjunctive therapy so far have resulted in either increased morbidity or mortality, or both.

Recent Findings

Severe malaria may be divided broadly into neurological and metabolic complications. We review recent findings about the pathophysiology of these complications and the implications for future adjunctive therapy of malaria, including the proposed importance of fluid volume depletion and sequestration of parasitized red cells in severe malaria. We also consider other anaemia, hyperparasitaemia and renal failure, which also require urgent treatment in severe malaria.

Summary

We review the important pathophysiological features of severe malaria and promising adjunctive therapies such as dichloroacetate that warrant further larger trials to determine whether they improve the so-far intractable death rate of severe malaria.

### Predicting the clinical outcome of severe falciparum malaria in African children: findings from a large randomized trial [^1136a3jv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Data from the largest randomized, controlled trial for the treatment of children hospitalized with severe malaria were used to identify such predictors of a poor outcome from severe malaria.

Methods

African children (< 15 years) with severe malaria participated in a randomized comparison of parenteral artesunate and parenteral quinine in 9 African countries. Detailed clinical assessment was performed on admission. Parasite densities were assessed in a reference laboratory. Predictors of death were examined using a multivariate logistic regression model.

Results

Twenty indicators of disease severity were assessed, out of which 5 (base deficit, impaired consciousness, convulsions, elevated blood urea, and underlying chronic illness) were associated independently with death. Tachypnea, respiratory distress, deep breathing, shock, prostration, low pH, hyperparasitemia, severe anemia, and jaundice were statistically significant indicators of death in the univariate analysis but not in the multivariate model. Age, glucose levels, axillary temperature, parasite density, heart rate, blood pressure, and blackwater fever were not related to death in univariate models.

Conclusions

Acidosis, cerebral involvement, renal impairment, and chronic illness are key independent predictors for a poor outcome in African children with severe malaria. Mortality is markedly increased in cerebral malaria combined with acidosis. Clinical Trial Registration. ISRCTN50258054.

### Associations between restrictive fluid management and renal function and tissue perfusion in adults with severe falciparum malaria: a prospective observational study [^111xPsQa]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This observational study from resource-limited settings evaluated the current local practice of conservative fluid management in patients with strictly defined severe falciparum malaria. Restrictive intravenous fluid administration (median 3.0 mL/kg per hour; IQR, 1.7–4.6 mL/kg per hour) during the first 6 hours did not result in worsening of kidney function or hyperlactatemia. The volume of administered fluids did not predict the development of circulatory shock within 24 hours after enrollment. Fluid volumes also did not predict development of pulmonary edema in this setting. The incidence of pulmonary edema (14%) was much lower than observed in our earlier study (31%) in the same setting evaluating liberal fluid resuscitation, with a median fluid administration of 227 mL/hour during 24 hours (range 30–572 mL/hour). The recommended fluid management in severe malaria has varied with changing concepts of pathophysiology. In the 1980s a cautious approach summarized as "keep the patient on the dry side" was advocated. Previous researchers argued that the 2 infectious processes of severe malaria and bacterial sepsis had similar cytokine-mediated pathologies, and recommendations for more aggressive fluid replacement regained traction. These recommendations were reversed in children, when the results of the definitive FEAST study indicated that this approach increased mortality. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines in patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion and suspicion of hypovolemia recommend an initial fluid challenge of minimal 30 mL/kg crystalloids. The observations from our study in combination with earlier fluid studies in severe malaria confirm the suggestion that this recommendation is not applicable to patients with severe malaria and hyperlactatemia in the absence of circulatory shock. Restricted fluid therapy is applicable despite intravascular hypovolemia, as also observed in a subset of patients in this study with transpulmonary thermodilution measurements and in other studies describing hypovolemia in both adults and children with severe malaria using various techniques. In our study, admission or change in GEDVI, as a measure of hypovolemia, did not correlate with admission or change in plasma lactate; the volume of fluid resuscitation also did not correlate with the change of plasma lactate in the acute phase of the disease. It should be noted that early resolution of hyperlactatemia is a strong surrogate for patient survival in severe malaria. These results suggest that in the absence of severe hypotension, hypovolemia is not an important factor limiting tissue perfusion, and that liberal fluid resuscitation does not improve tissue perfusion in severe malaria. More likely, hyperlactatemia results from a compromised microcirculation caused by sequestration of parasitized RBC and reduced RBC deformability, erythrocyte agglutination, and endothelial dysfunction. In our study, hemoglobin, a determinant of oxygen delivery, was independently associated with the proportional change in plasma lactate at 6 hours, suggesting a potential benefit of blood transfusion.

Figure 1
Study flow chart. ABPM indicates ambulatory blood pressure monitoring; BP, blood pressure.

Characteristics of participants by study site and SCT status are presented in Table 1. A higher proportion of participants without SCT versus participants with SCT in Jackson were taking antihypertensive medication. In Kilifi, eGFR was lower among participants with SCT versus participants without SCT. Urine albumin to creatinine ratio was higher among participants with SCT versus participants without SCT in Kilifi and Jackson.

Table 1
Characteristics of Study Participants With and Without SCT by Study Site

Mean 24‐hour SBP in Kilifi was 126 ± 18 mm Hg in individuals with SCT and 127 ± 18 mm Hg in individuals without SCT. In Nairobi/Jackson, mean 24‐hour SBP was 123 ± 13 mm Hg in individuals with SCT and 123 ± 14 mm Hg in individuals without SCT. After adjusting for age, sex, and eGFR in regression analyses, SCT was associated with a −2.4 (95% CI, −4.7 to −0.2) mm Hg (P = 0.037) lower 24‐hour SBP in Kilifi (Figure 2). In Nairobi and Jackson, there was no association between SCT and 24‐hour SBP. As there was no heterogeneity between Nairobi and Jackson in the effect of SCT on any BP measure (test for interaction, P = 0.409–0.944; Table S3) data from these sites were pooled in subsequent analyses. The proportion of variation in BP explained by the regression model as determined by the adjusted r 2 statistic was 25% in Kilifi, 16% in Nairobi, and 7% in Jackson.

### The fluid management of adults with severe malaria [^113ZEFjJ]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Lessons from pediatric malaria

SFM has a different clinical spectrum in adults and children: in adults, coma duration is longer, severe anemia is less frequent, and AKI and APO are much more common. However, there are important similarities in pathophysiology in the two populations, particularly the fundamental role of sequestration. In studies examining the fluid resuscitation of adults and children with SFM, there are many comparable findings.

Although hypovolemia is present in children with SFM, it is relatively mild when assessed by using standardized measures and is not commensurate with the degree of end-organ pathology. Gabonese children with SFM were only mildly dehydrated when assessed isotopically; despite this, over half had a plasma lactate of more than 5 mmol/L. Retinal changes consistent with sequestration have been documented in children with SFM and correlate with outcome and sequestration seen at autopsy. These findings suggest that, as in adults, sequestration and endothelial dysfunction can explain the clinical manifestations of disease in children without hypovolemia being invoked.

The fluid resuscitation of children with SFM has been explored on a larger scale than in adults, culminating in the landmark FEAST (Fluid Expansion as Supportive Therapy) study. Here, febrile African children with clinical evidence of hypoperfusion (57% with P. falciparum parasitemia) were randomly assigned on admission to the hospital to receive boluses of either 20 to 40 mL/kg of 5% albumin or 0.9% saline or to receive no boluses; standard care was otherwise provided. The mortality was increased to a similar degree in the children receiving an albumin or saline bolus (relative risk of death: 1.59) compared with the control group.

A retrospective analysis suggested that the increased mortality resulted from cardiovascular collapse rather than fluid overload per se, although this conclusion was somewhat hampered by limited data regarding the participants' deaths. The mechanism for this cardiovascular collapse was unclear, although a rapid reduction in sympathetically mediated compensatory mechanisms and treatment-induced hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis were suggested. Although APO and increased intracranial pressure were suspected in some patients, neither was identified frequently.

### Associations between restrictive fluid management and renal function and tissue perfusion in adults with severe falciparum malaria: a prospective observational study [^1176MLWg]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Incidence of Shock

Three of 154 (1.9%) patients had hypotensive shock on enrollment. Another 19 of 151 patients (12.6%) developed clinically significant shock defined by a SBP < 80 mmHg with cool extremities or vasopressor use after enrollment: 12 within 24 hours and another 3 during the following 24 hours. Microbiological culture facilities were not available, but concomitant bacterial infections were probable contributing factors: 1 patient had a septic abortion and 4 patients were diagnosed with hospital-acquired infections, 2 of which had aspiration pneumonia. In the 12 patients with an onset of the shock within 24 hours, median time to the onset was 12.3 (IQR, 7.3–15) hours and 11 of 12 (91.7%) died after a median 8.0 (IQR, 2.5–20.0) hours from the onset of shock. Median total fluid intake until the onset of shock was 5.0 (IQR, 2.4–6.3) mL/kg per hour, ranging from 1.7 to 14.0 mL/kg per hour (n = 12). Among them, 1 patient had pulmonary edema on enrollment and developed shock after 6.5 hours and a total fluid intake of 5.1 mL/kg per hour. Another patient developed shock and pulmonary edema at 12 hours after receiving a total fluid volume of 4.8 mL/kg per hour. The median total fluid intake during the first 6 hours in 12 patients developing shock was 4.4 (IQR, 2.6–6.2) mL/kg per hour compared to 3.3 (IQR, 1.8–5.0) mL/kg per hour in 129 patients without shock throughout admission (P = 0.167).

### Fluid resuscitation in pediatric cerebral malaria: insights from the FEAST trial and further evidence from Malawi [^115kT5Ep]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, we highlight to pediatricians across Africa managing critically ill children that in 2020, the Pediatric Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines were updated. They indicate that, "in healthcare systems with no availability of intensive care and in the absence of hypotension, we recommend against bolus fluid administration while starting maintenance fluids (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence)". The FEAST trial showed harm for a fluid bolus in every subgroup (including those with sepsis or malaria) and for every definition of shock (except severe hypotension, for which there was no control group). Given the most common cause of coma in critically ill children in malaria-endemic sub-Saharan Africa is cerebral malaria, by implication, the FEAST results extend to this group. The analysis presented in this issue, in a routine healthcare setting in Malawi, also supports the conclusion that fluid boluses are not indicated for children with cerebral malaria.

### Plasmodium knowlesi in human, Indonesian borneo [^1126cXcR]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

The Patient

A 39-year-old man from Australia came to a suburban hospital in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, with a 2-week history of morning fevers and mild headaches. His symptoms started 13 days after he left Indonesian Borneo (Kalimantan). The patient had spent an average of 10 days per month for the past 18 months working adjacent to a forest area in South Kalimantan Province, Indonesian Borneo. The most recent visit was toward the end of the rainy season. He did not use any personal vector avoidance measures (mosquito nets, long clothing, insect repellent) or receive malaria chemoprophylaxis. The patient did not travel to any other malaria-endemic areas during this 18-month period.

He did not have a remarkable medical history. On examination, he was febrile (38.9°C) and had a heart rate of 88 beats/min, blood pressure of 128/78 mm Hg, normal respiration rate, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. Physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory investigations showed mild thrombocytopenia (106 × 10 9 cells/L, reference range 150–450 × 10 9 cells/L), mild leukopenia (3.7 × 10 9 cells/L, reference range 4.3–10 × 10 9 cells/L), and unremarkable results for levels of hemoglobin (142 g/L, reference range 130–180 g/L), bilirubin (12 μmol/L, reference value < 20 μmol/L), and creatinine (95 μmol/L, reference range 40–120 μmol/L).

Malaria parasites were seen on Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood films (parasitemia level 185 parasites/μL). Parasite morphologic features resembled those of P. malariae with typical trophozoite band forms and heavily pigmented schizonts found inside smaller erythrocytes (Figure). Some parasites had morphologic features similar to those of P. falciparum. These similarities included ring forms and mature trophozoites with stippling of erythrocytes (Figure, panel B). A rapid diagnostic test result for histidine-rich protein 2 of P. falciparum was negative.

Regarding specific circumstances for malaria infection, more specifically with respect to patients with HIV (primary prevention), HIV.gov 2025 guidelines recommend to admit all HIV-positive patients with confirmed or suspected P. falciparum malaria to the hospital for evaluation, initiation of treatment, and observation of response to treatment because P. falciparum malaria can progress within hours from mild symptoms or low-grade fever to severe disease or death.

### Falciparum but not vivax malaria increases the risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in women followed prospectively from the first trimester [^1135pRFp]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Worldwide, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDoP) are estimated to affect 3–10% of all pregnancies, with the greatest risk in the first pregnancies of young women. The clinical presentation ranges from gestational hypertension to pre-eclampsia to life-threatening eclampsia. It is unclear whether gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia are separate entities or represent a spectrum of disease as they share some but not all risk factors and result in varying placental pathology, with findings consistent with placental ischemia specifically associated with pre-eclampsia. In contrast, eclampsia, or maternal seizures, is considered to be the central nervous system-specific presentation of severe pre-eclampsia. Maternal spiral arteries undergo extensive remodeling during a key window of 6 to 20 weeks' gestation allowing for appropriate perfusion of the placenta. Accumulating evidence suggests that pre-eclampsia is the product of abnormal spiral artery development leading to placental hypoxia, triggering the release of fetal-derived molecules that increase maternal blood pressure and perfusion of the placenta but result in diffuse endothelial dysfunction in the mother.

Primigravidae are also particularly susceptible to Plasmodium falciparum malaria in pregnancy with a peak of detection at 13–18 weeks' gestation in higher transmission settings, corresponding to the key period of fetal trophoblast invasion and maternal spiral artery transformation. Falciparum malaria early in pregnancy has been associated with abnormal placental vascular development, and falciparum-infected erythrocytes may sequester in the placental intervillous spaces, a condition known as placental malaria, leading to inflammatory infiltrates and low birth weight. Peripheral falciparum malaria in the absence of placental infection has also been associated with poor pregnancy and birth outcomes including miscarriage; pre-term delivery; intrauterine growth retardation, small for gestational age, and low birth weight; stillbirth; and neonatal death. In contrast, Plasmodium vivax malaria does not display a placental tropism, but in the present study area, has also been associated with poor pregnancy outcomes similar to the effect of falciparum malaria.

### Clinical review: severe malaria [^112fkh58]. Critical Care (2003). Low credibility.

Malaria represents a medical emergency because it may rapidly progress to complications and death without prompt and appropriate treatment. Severe malaria is almost exclusively caused by Plasmodium falciparum. The incidence of imported malaria is increasing and the case fatality rate remains high despite progress in intensive care and antimalarial treatment. Clinical deterioration usually appears 3–7 days after onset of fever. Complications involve the nervous, respiratory, renal, and/or hematopoietic systems. Metabolic acidosis and hypoglycemia are common systemic complications. Intravenous quinine and quinidine are the most widely used drugs in the initial treatment of severe falciparum malaria, whereas artemisinin derivatives are currently recommended for quinine-resistant cases. As soon as the patient is clinically stable and able to swallow, oral treatment should be given. The intravascular volume should be maintained at the lowest level sufficient for adequate systemic perfusion to prevent development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Renal replacement therapy should be initiated early. Exchange blood transfusion has been suggested for the treatment of patients with severe malaria and high parasitemia. For early diagnosis, it is paramount to consider malaria in every febrile patient with a history of travel in an area endemic for malaria.

### Falling plasmodium knowlesi malaria death rate among adults despite rising incidence, sabah, Malaysia, 2010–2014 [^116KFcGS]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

One patient, a 56-year-old man, was comatose, a condition not previously reported in P. knowlesi malaria. He was unresponsive when brought into a health clinic by relatives, who reported a 1-day history of weakness and drowsiness and a 3-day history of fever, chills, arthralgia, and myalgia. At hospital referral, his blood pressure was 85/60 mm Hg, pulse rate 150 beats/min, and oxygen saturation 81% on room air. He had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 6/15. Pupils were reactive but asymmetric (right 2 mm, left 4 mm). Meningism was not present, and neurologic examination showed normal tone, symmetrically reduced reflexes, and downgoing plantar reflexes. Blood investigations showed 6,471 P. knowlesi parasites/μL and metabolic acidosis. Computed tomography brain scan and lumbar puncture were not performed. The patient was intubated and begun on intravenous artesunate and ceftriaxone but died 41 hours after admission. Blood cultures for bacterial infections were negative.

Fatal PCR-Confirmed P. vivax Malaria

One person, a 53-year-old man, died from P. vivax malaria. At admission, he had a 7-day history of fever, rigors, myalgia, nonproductive cough, and abdominal pain. Physical examination results were unremarkable. Thrombocytopenia was present, and his bilirubin level was 21.5 μmol/L; creatinine and hemoglobin levels were normal. A blood film result was reported as 2,090 P. vivax parasites/μL; oral chloroquine and primaquine treatment were begun. The next day, the parasite count was 890 parasites/μL of blood, but the patient became hypotensive, and ARDS developed; a postintubation chest radiograph showed bilateral opacities. Intravenous artesunate and antibiotic drugs were initiated, and hemodialysis was performed for acute kidney injury (creatinine level 316 μmol/L), but the patient died 4 days after admission. Blood cultures for bacterial infections were negative.

### Reduced cardiac index reserve and hypovolemia in severe falciparum malaria [^11427Sis]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Hyperlactatemia, a consistent feature of severe malaria, was associated with tachycardia, a reduction in LV but not IVC dimensions, and an increase in eFS and a preserved SI, consistent with sympathetic stimulation causing a hyperdynamic state. Fatal cases had features consistent with relative hypovolemia and reduced cardiac index reserve, ie, smaller cardiac chamber volumes, increased relative wall thicknesses despite no increases in mass (pseudohypertrophy), and more collapsible IVC. Patients with less cardiac index reserve may be unable to maintain or increase their cardiac index in response to stresses and would therefore be more likely to develop shock. Previous studies have shown that mortality in severe malaria increases with age, which is known to correlate with a decrease in cardiovascular reserve. In healthy individuals, markers of myocardial relaxation deteriorate with aging. This is consistent with the observation in this study that myocardial relaxation (E' and IVRT) worsened significantly with age in the severe malaria group.

In bacterial sepsis, as in severe malaria, vascular resistance is typically reduced and the circulation is typically hyperdynamic (H. W. F. K. manuscript in preparation). Left ventricular systolic, diastolic, and RV function have been assessed in a wide range of ways in sepsis, although not typically in the context of preload and afterload. Where loading conditions have been considered, strong associations of contractility indices with afterload were observed in sepsis, confounding their interpretation in isolation. Reduced indices of ventricular function have been reported more frequently in sepsis than we observed in severe malaria. Patients described in studies of cardiac function in sepsis tend to be much older, with a mean age 50–60 as opposed to median age 30 in this study, which may partially explain the differences in the frequency of abnormalities we observed. In addition, patients may have already received intensive care support including inotropic agents when the study began, which may have complicated assessment of contractility. Left ventricular ejection fraction has not been consistently linked to mortality in sepsis, but smaller nonindexed LV dimensions have been linked in meta-analyses.

### Reduced cardiac index reserve and hypovolemia in severe falciparum malaria [^111jZdbq]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Macrovascular cardiovascular parameters predicted outcome in this cohort of patients despite the fact that coma and lactic acidosis in severe falciparum malaria was not caused by inadequate cardiac output or total oxygen delivery. Differences in cardiac function parameters between severe and uncomplicated malaria were small (smaller atria, shorter ejection time, and higher heart rate in severe disease), but more substantial changes separated severe malaria survivors from fatal cases. Patients who died had higher heart rates, with smaller LV and RA diameters, increased IVC collapsibility, and high LV fractional shortening. Patients presenting with these cardiovascular profiles are expected to have lower cardiac index reserve and hence might be less able to compensate further peripheral vasodilation or other hemodynamic stresses. There was no evidence that systolic LV or RV dysfunction predicted outcome.

Previous studies of hemodynamics in severe malaria have lacked power to assess the association between macrovascular hemodynamic parameters and mortality. In severe malaria, no clinically significant acute change in LVIDd was noted in 2 studies in children and 1 study in adults, and baseline eFS or ejection fraction was usually normal. In children, insulin sensitivity (SI) decreased on recovery in one study in which there was a corresponding increase in hematocrit and increased in another. An increase in IVC collapsibility has been reported in children. One study in children found evidence of increased tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity, suggesting that pulmonary hypertension may occur. Impaired cardiac function in falciparum malaria is rare, presenting as myocarditis, reduced ejection fractional, or acute coronary syndrome in children and adults.

### Obesity and diabetes as risk factors for severe plasmodium falciparum malaria: results from a Swedish nationwide study [^111JH3fy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this nationwide study including 937 adults with P. falciparum malaria in Sweden, we identified comorbidity, and specifically diabetes, obesity, and components of the metabolic syndrome, as risk factors for severe malaria both in nonimmune travelers and immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa.

Patients with ≥ 2 chronic diseases or a Charlson score ≥ 1 had an increased risk of severe malaria. Moreover, age, healthcare delay, nonendemic origin, and HIV were associated with severe malaria as previously shown. However, few patients were HIV infected, and the association with severity became nonsignificant when excluding hyperparasitemia as single criterion for severe malaria.

Diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease were all associated with severe malaria in the univariable analysis; however, diabetes was the only NCD that on its own remained significant after adjustments. Only a few had type 1 diabetes, so conclusions can only be drawn for type 2 diabetes. Other NCDs might also affect the outcome of malaria; however, prevalence in these travelers was too low to assess their impact.

Obesity was highly associated with severity in the population subset with retrieved BMI data. Type 2 diabetes is a complication of obesity and the 2 metabolic disorders often coexist. Adjusting for obesity somewhat reduced the odds of severe malaria among diabetics, whereas adjusting for the potential intermediate factors diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease did not substantially change the association between obesity and severity. Having at least 1 metabolic risk factor was associated with increased odds for severe malaria, and a combination including obesity conferred even higher odds.

Reports on NCDs and malaria are few. To our knowledge, no study has assessed the association between diabetes and severe malaria. Two reports from Ghana have shown that semi-immune adults with type 2 diabetes were more susceptible to Plasmodium infection than controls, but with no inference on severity. A recent animal study indicates enhanced transmission of parasites from diabetics to mosquitoes.

### Malaria: a focused review for the emergency medicine clinician [^115gZR1N]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Malaria is a potentially fatal parasitic disease transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito. A resurgence in locally acquired infections has been reported in the U.S.

Objective

This narrative review provides a focused overview of malaria for the emergency clinician, including the epidemiology, presentation, diagnosis, and management of the disease.

Discussion

Malaria is caused by Plasmodium and is transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito. Disease severity can range from mild to severe. Malaria should be considered in any returning traveler from an endemic region, as well as those with unexplained cyclical, paroxysms of symptoms or unexplained fever. Patients most commonly present with fever and rigors but may also experience cough, myalgias, abdominal pain, fatigue, vomiting, and diarrhea. Hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, pallor, and jaundice are findings associated with malaria. Although less common, severe malaria is precipitated by microvascular obstruction with complications of anemia, acidosis, hypoglycemia, multiorgan failure, and cerebral malaria. Peripheral blood smears remain the gold standard for diagnosis, but rapid diagnostic tests are available. Treatment includes specialist consultation and antimalarial drugs tailored depending on chloroquine resistance, geographic region of travel, and patient comorbidities. Supportive care may be required, and patients with severe malaria will require resuscitation. Most patients will require admission for treatment and further monitoring.

Conclusion

Emergency medicine clinicians should be aware of the presentation, diagnosis, evaluation, and management of malaria to ensure optimal outcomes.

### Increased pulmonary pressures and myocardial wall stress in children with severe malaria [^115qKPpK]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic intravascular hemolysis leads to nitric oxide (NO) depletion and pulmonary hypertension in sickle cell disease. To test whether this pathophysiology occurs in malaria, we examined in Mali 53 children who were admitted to the hospital with severe malaria (excluding cerebral malaria) and 31 age-matched controls.

Methods

Severity of hemolysis was assessed from plasma levels of free hemoglobin and arginase-1. NO metabolism was assessed by whole-blood nitrite levels and plasma NO consumption. Effects on the cardiovascular system and endothelial function were assessed by using echocardiography to measure peak tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity and by evaluating plasma levels of N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1.

Results

Children with severe malaria had higher plasma levels of hemoglobin and arginase-1, reduced whole-blood levels of nitrite, and increased NO consumption relative to controls. They also had increased pulmonary arterial pressures (P < .05) with elevated levels of NT-proBNP and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (P < .001).

Conclusion

Children with severe malaria have increased pulmonary pressures and myocardial wall stress. These complications are consistent with NO depletion from intravascular hemolysis, and they indicate that the pathophysiologic cascade from intravascular hemolysis to NO depletion and its cardiopulmonary effects is activated in children with severe malaria.

Case definition for severe malaria

The definition of severe malaria was based on the 2015 WHO guidelines for severe malaria. In brief, a case of severe malaria was defined as evidence of parasitological confirmation and the presence of life-threatening features, which include any of the following: "Impaired consciousness" was defined as a Glasgow score of less than 11 or a Blantyre coma score of less than 3 for younger children; "prostration" was defined as generalized weakness (a child was unable to sit, stand, or walk without assistance); "multiple convulsions" was defined as a child having more than two episodes of convulsion within 24 h; "Acidosis" was defined as a plasma bicarbonate level of less than 15 mmol/L; "hypoglycaemia" referred to blood or plasma glucose of less than 2.2 mmol while "severe anemia" was defined as hemoglobin concentration less than or equal 5 g/dl or packed cell volume of less than or equal to 15% in children < 12 years of age and less than 7 g/dl or packed cell volume of 20% in those aged 12 years; "acute kidney injury" was defined as plasma or serum creatinine 3 mg/dl or blood urea > 20 mmol/l while "jaundice" was defined as the plasma or serum bilirubin > 50 umol/l or 3 mg/dl; "pulmonary oedema" was defined as radiologically confirmed or oxygen saturation < 92% on room air with a respiratory rate greater than 30/minute, or age appropriate tachypnoea often with chest indrawing and crepitations on auscultation; "significant bleeding" referred to recurrent or prolonged bleeding from the nose, gums or venepuncture sites; hematemesis or melena; "Compensated shock" was defined as capillary refill greater or equal three seconds but no hypotension, and "decompensated shock" was defined as systolic blood pressure < 70 mm Hg with evidence of impaired perfusion (cool peripheries or prolonged capillary refill). "Hyperparasitemia" was defined as plasmodium falciparum parasitemia > 10%.

The parasitological confirmation in this study was based on the child being tested positive with "rapid diagnostic test" (RDT) kits and/or the presence of malaria parasites on light microscopy.

### Vamorolone (Agamree) [^1143Rt5M]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation

Hepatitis B virus reactivation can occur in patients who are hepatitis B carriers treated with immunosuppressive dosages of corticosteroids, including AGAMREE. Reactivation can also occur infrequently in corticosteroid-treated patients who appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection.

Screen patients for hepatitis B infection before initiating immunosuppressive (e.g., prolonged) treatment with AGAMREE. For patients who show evidence of hepatitis B infection, recommend consultation with physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding monitoring and consideration for hepatitis B antiviral therapy.

Fungal Infections

Corticosteroids, including AGAMREE, may exacerbate systemic fungal infections; therefore, avoid AGAMREE use in the presence of such infections unless AGAMREE is needed to control drug reactions. For patients on chronic AGAMREE therapy who develop systemic fungal infections, AGAMREE withdrawal or dosage reduction is recommended.

Amebiasis

Corticosteroids, including AGAMREE, may activate latent amebiasis. Therefore, it is recommended that latent amebiasis or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating AGAMREE in any patients who have spent time in the tropics or patients with unexplained diarrhea.

Strongyloides Infestation

Corticosteroids, including AGAMREE, should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gram-negative septicemia.

Cerebral Malaria

Avoid corticosteroids, including AGAMREE, in patients with cerebral malaria.

5.3 Alterations in Cardiovascular/Renal Function

Corticosteroids, including AGAMREE, can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium and calcium.

Monitor blood pressure and assess for signs and symptoms of volume overload. Monitor serum potassium levels.

AGAMREE should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, hypertension, or renal insufficiency. Literature reports suggest an association between use of corticosteroids and left free wall rupture after a recent myocardial infarction; therefore, therapy with AGAMREE should be used with great caution in these patients.

### Management of severe paediatric malaria in resource-limited settings [^1118i4Te]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The Fluid Resuscitation as A Supportive Therapy trial (FEAST) was conducted to provide evidence on the best fluid management for children with shock and severe febrile illness for doctors practicing in hospitals in resource-limited settings. FEAST was a multicenter three-arm controlled trial comparing albumin bolus, and saline bolus to no bolus control. FEAST was conducted at six centres in three East African countries and involved 3,121 children enrolled at the point of hospital admission. Shock was defined pragmatically (incorporating parameters from all the published paediatric shock definitions including modest hypotension) and the controlled part of the trial (FEAST A) only excluded children without severe hypotension. Two major subgroups included in the trial were those with severe sepsis (n = 1,330) and severe P. falciparum malaria (n = 1,793). The data monitoring committee stopped the trial early after enrollment of 3,141 of a projected 3,600 due to safety concerns. The primary endpoint, 48-hour mortality, was significantly worse in the two fluid bolus arms, 111/1,050 (10.6%) in the albumin-bolus and 110/1,047 (10.5%) in the saline-bolus, compared to the control (no bolus) 76/1,044 (7.3%); relative risk (95% CI) any bolus versus control 1.45 (1.13 to 1.86, P = 0.003). Secondary endpoints including 28-day mortality were worse in the bolus arms, 12% versus 8.7% in the control arm. There was no difference between the treatment arms in the number of adverse events (suspected pulmonary oedema, brain swelling or allergic events). In the subgroup with severe malaria, 48-hour mortality was 110/1,202 (9.2%) in the bolus arms compared to 34/591 (5.7%) in the control (no bolus) arm, a relative risk of death of 1.59 (1.10 to 2.31). In all pre-specified sub-groups analysis, there was no evidence of a benefit of fluid boluses. In a subsequent publication, early shock reversal at one hour (responders), the central principle of the surviving sepsis guidelines, was superior in the bolus arms compared to no bolus control (43% versus 32%, P < 0.001). Despite this, excess mortality with boluses was still evident in both 'responders' (relative risk 1.98 (0.94 to 4.17), P = 0.06), as well as 'non-responders' at one hour (relative risk 1.67 (1.23 to 2.28), P = 0.001), with no evidence of heterogeneity (P = 0.68). Examining the terminal modes of death, the major difference between bolus and control arms was the higher proportion of cardiogenic shock in the bolus arms (n = 123; 4.6% versus 2.6% in controls, P = 0.008), rather than respiratory events or neurological terminal clinical events. A major issue raised following the publication of FEAST was whether the criteria used to define shock in the trial were applicable to other guidelines, including the WHO definition of shock. A further publication provided data to address this issue showing that of the relatively limited number of children fulfilling the WHO shock definition 48-hour mortality was 24/50 (48%) in those receiving boluses compared to 3/15 (20%) in the no-bolus control, an increased absolute risk of 28% and a relative increase of 240% (P = 0.07 by two-sided Fisher's exact test). Moderate hypotension, consistent with many definitions in paediatric shock, was also associated with increased 48-hour mortality on boluses (an absolute risk of 9.4% (‐2.6 to 21.4%)).

### Reversibility of retinal microvascular changes in severe falciparum malaria [^116htHBv]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2014). Low credibility.

This patient had mildly increased tortuosity of retinal blood vessels that decreased on recovery. Although increased vascular tortuosity has not been well-described in malaria, it is a recognized feature of other vascular occlusive diseases of the retina. Vessel tortuosity is caused by a combination of vessel dilation from radial stretching and the vessel taking a more serpentine path because of longitudinal stretching. Several pathogenic mechanisms have been proposed for increased retinal vascular tortuosity. They include (1) increased blood flow in anemia, (2) early angiogenesis caused by ischemia or inflammation and (3) dysregulation of vascular tone caused by microvascular obstruction and relative hypoxia in diabetic retinopathy, and (4) venous congestion causing elevated vascular pressure and dilatation of blocked vessels in CRVO and raised intracranial pressure resulting in central retinal vein compression. In malaria, anemia is common, uninfected red blood cells have reduced deformability, and sequestered parasites cause microvascular and venular obstruction. Angiogenesis is probably unimportant over the short timescale.

Increased vascular tortuosity has not been well-described previously in severe falciparum malaria, possibly because the normal appearance of retinal vessels varies significantly between individuals and subtle changes are difficult to identify. Ophthalmoscopy revealed engorgement and tortuosity of retinal veins in 26% of children with cerebral malaria in Ghana, which mostly resolved by 1 week. In our patient, comparison of retinal photographs provided a more objective measure. Means of quantifying vessel tortuosity using computer-aided image processing are under development.

The angiogram in this patient showed focal leakage of fluorescein across the blood–retinal barrier (BRB) in areas of non-perfusion, suggesting a common etiology. The BRB is analogous to the blood–brain barrier, which is also mildly disrupted in cerebral malaria. Leakage from larger retinal vessels crossing ischemic areas is a well-known phenomenon in retinal ischemia. The significance of this finding as a contributor to the pathogenesis of malarial coma is not known. More angiographic studies are needed.

### Personalized blood pressure targets in shock: what If your normal blood pressure is "Low"? [^113UaG7o]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The cornerstone of resuscitation of septic shock is volume infusion followed by vasopressors if fluid volume does not restore adequate perfusion. Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines recommend an initial target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mm Hg, subsequently adjusted. The target MAP and the relative proportions of use of volume versus vasopressors varies widely. But there remains the overarching large question of how to personalize a MAP target in shock (Figure 1).

Figure 1.
At present, the target resuscitation mean arterial pressure (MAP) is 65 mm Hg, despite patients having premorbid blood pressures ranging from hypertension to normal-to-low blood pressure. The goal now is to personalize the initial MAP target according to premorbid blood pressure, aiming for 80–85 mm Hg in patients with previous hypertension; 65 mm Hg in patients with previous normotension; and a lower target, perhaps 55 mm Hg, in patients having a low premorbid blood pressure. In all patients, resuscitation should also aim to achieve normal peripheral perfusion (normal capillary refill time < 2 s, absence of cyanosis), improved mentation (Glasgow Coma Score > 12 mm Hg without sedation), and adequate urine output > 0.5 ml/kg/h.

### The impact of malaria in pregnancy on changes in blood pressure in children during their first year of life [^114cQ2oV]. Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

We established a maternal birth cohort in Ibadan, Nigeria, where malaria is hyperendemic, to assess how intrauterine exposure to malaria affected infant blood pressure (BP) development. In a local maternity hospital, healthy pregnant women had regular blood films for malaria parasites from booking to delivery. Growth and BP were measured on 318 babies, all followed from birth to 3 and 12 months. Main outcomes were standardized measures of anthropometry and change in BP to 1 year. Babies exposed to maternal malaria were globally smaller at birth, and boys remained smaller at 3 months and 1 year. Change in systolic BP (SBP) during the year was greater in boys than in girls (20.9 versus 15.7 mm Hg; P = 0.002) but greater in girls exposed to maternal malaria (18.7 versus 12.7 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval, 1–11 mm Hg; P = 0.02). Eleven percent of boys (greater than twice than expected) had a SBP ≥ 95th percentile (hypertensive, US criteria), of whom 68% had maternal malaria exposure. On regression analysis (β coefficients, mm Hg), sex (boys > girls; β = 4.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–7.7; P = 0.01), maternal malaria exposure (3.64; 0.3–6.9; P = 0.03), and weight change (2.4; 0.98–3.8/1 standard deviation score; P = 0.001) all independently increased SBP change to 1 year, whereas increase in length decreased SBP (-1.98; -3.6 to -0.40). In conclusion, malaria-exposed boys had excess hypertension, whereas malaria-exposed girls a greater increase in SBP. Intrauterine exposure to malaria had sex-dependent effects on BP, independent of infant growth. Because infant-child-adult BP tracking is powerful, a malarial effect may contribute to the African burden of hypertension.

### Malarial retinopathy in Bangladeshi adults [^116K4c35]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2011). Low credibility.

The frequency of papilloedema in this study was similar to the findings in the African studies, reporting a prevalence of 15% in pediatric cerebral malaria compared with 4% in children with severe malaria anemia. Papilloedema is caused by raised intracranial pressure, which, in patients with cerebral malaria, has been hypothesized to be mainly caused by the increase of the intravascular blood volume caused by the presence of the sequestered biomass. Increased intracranial pressure can also be caused by cerebral edema, and there is still considerable debate as to what extent cerebral edema contributes to coma in falciparum malaria. There is a mild generalized increase in the systemic vascular permeability in severe malaria, but the blood–brain barrier (BBB) in adults with cerebral malaria is functionally grossly intact; however, in African children with cerebral malaria, there is a subtle increase in BBB permeability with a disruption of endothelial intercellular tight junctions on autopsy. Imaging studies reveal that most adults with cerebral malaria have no evidence of cerebral edemaIn African children, cerebral edema is more frequent, although not a consistent finding. Similarly, opening pressures on lumbar puncture are usually normal in adult patients but are elevated in over 80% of children with cerebral malaria. Use of mannitol to lower intracranial pressure in Ugandan children with cerebral malaria did not affect clinical outcome. In the present study, papilloedema was not an independent predictor of mortality.

In children, macular and peripheral whitening are frequent findings, being present in 44% and 46%, respectively, of those with cerebral malaria in one Malawian study. These studies also revealed that areas of retinal whitening coincide with non-perfused areas on fluorescein angiographyand obstructed retinal capillaries on autopsy, strongly suggesting an ischemic etiology for these lesions. This is thought to mirror similar, usually reversible, patchy ischemia in the brain. A recent study in Bangladesh using a portable retinal camera found that the severity of retinal whitening correlated with severity of malaria and blood lactate levels, suggesting ischemia. The prevalence of peripheral whitening was much lower in the present study than previously in the same population using retinal photography, likely because of the much lower sensitivity of the techniques when used by a non-ophthalmologist.

Cerebral and severe malaria — severity markers are defined as follows: Cerebral malaria is usually defined by presence of coma with Glasgow coma scale < 11 or Blantyre coma scale < 3, and severe malaria can present long before hemoglobin goes below the 7 mg/dL threshold because of the hemo-concentrating effects of dehydration.

### Cardiotoxicity of antimalarial drugs [^115uQ1Sq]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

There are consistent differences in cardiovascular state between acute illness in malaria and recovery that prolong the electrocardiographic QT interval and have been misinterpreted as resulting from antimalarial cardiotoxicity. Of the different classes of antimalarial drugs, only the quinolines, and structurally related antimalarial drugs, have clinically significant cardiovascular effects. Drugs in this class can exacerbate malaria-associated orthostatic hypotension and several have been shown to delay ventricular depolarisation slightly (class 1c effect), resulting in widening of the QRS complex, but only quinidine and halofantrine have clinically significant effects on ventricular repolarisation (class 3 effect). Both drugs cause potentially dangerous QT prolongation, and halofantrine has been associated with sudden death. The parenteral quinoline formulations (chloroquine, quinine, and quinidine) are predictably hypotensive when injected rapidly, and cardiovascular collapse can occur with self-poisoning. Transiently hypotensive plasma concentrations of chloroquine can occur when doses of 5 mg base/kg or more are given by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. At currently recommended doses, other antimalarial drugs do not have clinically significant cardiac effects. More information on amodiaquine, primaquine, and the newer structurally related compounds is needed.

### Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in Malawian children with cerebral malaria [^114KMtsC]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome is a major cause of death in critically ill children. – Furthermore, mortality continues to escalate as the severity of organ dysfunction increases and as the number of organ systems involved increases. – Despite the belief that MODS is a complication only seen in adults with severe malaria, our group has previously demonstrated both the presence of MODS in pediatric patients with CM and its association with increased mortality rates. This current study augments our previous findings of MODS prevalence in children with CM by applying a second validated organ dysfunction scoring system as well as two scoring systems specifically developed for use in resource-limited areas. In addition, our findings align with rates of observed MODS in adults with severe malaria.

The PELOD-2 scores and the pSOFA scores revealed comparable rates of MODS within our cohort upon admission. One notable difference in the results of these two scoring systems was the presence of cardiovascular dysfunction, which was identified in more patients when using the PELOD-2 score (92 patients) compared with the pSOFA score (12 patients). This variance may be attributable to the use of lactate as one of the two markers of cardiovascular dysfunction in the PELOD-2 score. Although elevated lactate can indicate cardiovascular dysfunction and shock, multiple other factors are more likely causative in children with CM. For example, tissue hypoxia often results from profound anemia and microvascular occlusion that is classically associated with P. falciparum infection. Parasite metabolism also results in lactate production and release, further increasing a patient's lactatemia. In addition, impaired clearance of lactate may occur owing to concurrent liver dysfunction. It is also possible that we underestimated cardiovascular dysfunction when using the pSOFA score if children with profound hypotension did not survive long enough to be admitted to the hospital.

### Concomitant bacteremia in adults with severe falciparum malaria [^1156FA6Z]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

METHODS

This investigation took place in the severe malaria ward of the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, during 2 sequential studies of adult patients admitted with strictly defined severe falciparum malaria. The first, conducted between 1991 and 1996, was a double-blind comparison of intramuscular quinine and intramuscular artemether, and the second, conducted between 1996 and 2003, was a double-blind comparison of intramuscular artesunate and intramuscular artemether. These 2 studies, reported previously in detail, were contiguous and all eligible patients were enrolled. Both studies were approved by the Ethical and Scientific Committee of the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City.

Entry Criteria

Patients were included in the studies if they (or an accompanying relative) gave informed consent, they had asexual forms of Plasmodium falciparum on a peripheral-blood smear, were older than 14 years, were not in the first trimester of pregnancy, were not intravenous drug users, had received less than 3 g of quinine or 2 doses of artemisinin or a derivative in the previous 48 hours, were not allergic to the study drugs, and had 1 or more of the following: Glasgow Coma Scale score less than 11 (indicating cerebral malaria), anemia (hematocrit, < 20%) with a parasite density greater than 100 000/μL, jaundice (serum total bilirubin, > 2.5 mg/dL [50 µmol/L]) with a parasite density greater than 100 000/μL, acute kidney injury (urine output, < 400 mL/24 hours, and serum creatinine, > 3 mg/dL [250 µmol/L]), hypoglycemia (blood glucose, < 40 mg/dL [2.2 mmol/L]), more than 10% parasitemia, and systolic blood pressure less than 80 mm Hg with cool extremities (indicating shock). These criteria are similar to the World Health Organization–endorsed definition, except that the anemia criterion is more stringent.

### The clinical implications of thrombocytopenia in adults with severe falciparum malaria: a retrospective analysis [^112EuFkg]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

Two datasets were combined for this analysis. The first (n = 560) was compiled prospectively at the Centre for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, between 1991 and 1996 in a study that compared the efficacy of artemether and quinine in adults with severe falciparum malaria. The second comprised data collected prospectively in studies assessing a range of adjunctive therapies in severe falciparum malaria at Chittagong Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh, and Ispat General Hospital, Rourkela, India, between 2004 and 2011.

Malaria transmission was low and seasonal at all sites. Falciparum malaria was diagnosed if a blood film showed asexual forms of Plasmodium falciparum. When expert microscopy was not available immediately, patients were enrolled if an immunochromatographic rapid diagnostic test (Paracheck Pf, Orchid Biomedical Systems, Goa, India) was positive; P. falciparum infection was confirmed later by microscopy of a simultaneously collected blood slide.

All patients satisfied a strict definition of severe falciparum malaria that used modified WHO criteria, including cerebral malaria (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) < 11); severe anaemia (haematocrit < 20% with a parasite count > l00,000/mm 3); renal failure (blood urea nitrogen ≥ 21.4 mmol/L or plasma creatinine level ≥ 265 μmol/L); pulmonary oedema (oxygen saturation < 90% and bibasal crepitations); generalized convulsions; acidosis (venous bicarbonate < 15 mmol/L); hyperparasitaemia (peripheral parasitaemia > 10%); hyperlactataemia (venous lactate > 4 mmol/L); jaundice (bilirubin > 43 μmol/L and a parasite count > l00,000/mm 3); hypoglycaemia (glucose < 2.2 mmol/L); and spontaneous bleeding or shock (systolic blood pressure < 80 mmHg with cool extremities). Patients were excluded if they were < 14 years of age or if they had received parenteral anti-malarial treatment for > 48 hours before enrolment. Disease severity was defined by the number of these criteria that a patient satisfied. The independent prognostic utility of the admission platelet count was compared with the widely validated RCAM score calculated from the patients' respiratory rate and GCS on admission (Table 1). Major bleeding was defined as bleeding which resulted in death or necessitated blood transfusion.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^115rwMpH]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Malaria — severe disease, cerebral malaria, and complications: Uncomplicated malaria infection can progress to severe disease or death within hours, and malaria with central nervous system symptoms can be particularly ominous. Cerebral malaria is defined as unarousable coma not attributable to any other cause in patients infected with P. falciparum; in Africa, case fatality rates with cerebral malaria approach 40%. The risk of severe and complicated illness increases with high levels of parasitemia and absence of partial immunity, with metabolic acidosis an important manifestation of severe malaria and an indicator of poor prognosis. Other acute complications include renal failure, hypoglycemia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, shock, and acute pulmonary edema, and P. falciparum is the species most commonly responsible for severe disease and death, although other species can also cause severe disease and death.

### Assessment of myocardial function and injury by echocardiography and cardiac biomarkers in African children with severe plasmodium falciparum malaria [^1118rUMV]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Perturbed hemodynamic function complicates severe malaria. The Fluid Expansion as Supportive Therapy trial demonstrated that fluid resuscitation, involving children with severe malaria, was associated with increased mortality, primarily due to cardiovascular collapse, suggesting that myocardial dysfunction may have a role. The aim of this study was to characterize cardiac function in children with severe malaria.

Design

A prospective observational study with clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic data collected at presentation (T0) and 24 hours (T1) in children with severe malaria. Cardiac index and ejection fraction were calculated at T0 and T1. Cardiac troponin I and brain natriuretic peptide were measured at T0. We compared clinical and echocardiographic variables in children with and without severe malarial anemia (hemoglobin < 5mg/dL) at T0 and T1.

Setting

Mbale Regional Referral Hospital.

Patients

Children 3 months to 12 years old with severe falciparum malaria.

Interventions

Usual care.

Measurements and Main Results

We enrolled 104 children, median age 23.3 months, including 61 children with severe malarial anemia. Cardiac troponin I levels were elevated (> 0.1ng/mL) in n equals to 50, (48%), and median brain natriuretic peptide was within normal range (69.1 pg/mL; interquartile range, 48.4–90.8). At T0, median Cardiac index was significantly higher in the severe malarial anemia versus nonsevere malarial anemia group (6.89 vs 5.28L/min/m) (p = 0.001), which normalized in both groups at T1 (5.60 vs 5.13L/min/m) (p = 0.452). Cardiac index negatively correlated with hemoglobin, r equals to -0.380 (p < 0.001). Four patients (3.8%) had evidence of depressed cardiac systolic function (ejection fraction < 45%). Overall, six children died, none developed pulmonary edema, biventricular failure, or required diuretic treatment.

Conclusions

Elevation of cardiac index, due to increased stroke volume, in severe malaria is a physiologic response to circulatory compromise and correlates with anemia. Following whole blood transfusion and antimalarial therapy, cardiac index in severe malarial anemia returns to normal. The majority (> 96%) of children with severe malaria have preserved myocardial systolic function. Although there is evidence for myocardial injury (elevated cardiac troponin I), this does not correlate with cardiac dysfunction.

### Neuropsychiatric complications of malaria infection… [^111VGkEM]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

A 37-year-old man was admitted to the medicine unit of a teaching hospital after presenting with the sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting and dark urine with reduced output. In addition, he had been irritable and easily frustrated. The symptoms began seven days after he returned from a trip to West Africa. Physical examination revealed a temperature of 38. 9°C, pulse of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 110/71 mm Hg and respiration rate of 20 per minute. He had bilateral icterus with dry mucous membranes. Examination of the neck revealed no nuchal rigidity. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. The patient was cooperative but anxious, and the results of mental status examination were otherwise within normal limits. A blood smear obtained during the emergency department examination revealed ring forms of malaria parasites consistent with Plasmodium falciparum malaria of 82, 000 per μL.

On admission, additional investigation revealed a white blood cell count of 8, 200 per mm 3, hemoglobin of 12. 2 g per dL and a platelet count of 18, 000 per mm
3. Blood urea nitrogen was 93 mg per dL, and serum creatinine was 6. 4 mg per dL. The lactate dehydrogenase level was elevated at 1, 624 U per L, and the aspartate aminotransferase level was 113 U per L. Total bilirubin was 13. 5 mg per dL, with the direct portion being
11. 2 mg per dL. The admitting diagnosis was P. falciparum malaria complicated by acute renal failure. He was treated with intravenous doxycycline in a dosage of 100 mg twice daily and oral quinine in a dosage of 650 mg twice daily for three days. He was rehydrated with normal saline. The BUN and creatinine levels continued to fall steadily and were within normal limits two weeks after discharge from the hospital.

### Evaluation and diagnosis | Malaria… [^117UeD3a]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

At a glance
- Consider malaria in any febrile person who has traveled to a malaria-endemic area in the weeks to months preceding symptom onset.
- Urgently evaluate patients suspected of having malaria.
- Laboratory diagnosis of malaria can be made through microscopic examination of thick and thin blood smears. Evaluation and Diagnosis Malaria is a common cause of febrile illness in areas where it is transmitted; therefore, the diagnosis and management of malaria should routinely be considered for any febrile person who has traveled to an area with malaria in the weeks to months preceding symptom onset. The CDC's Algorithm for Diagnosis and Management of Malaria provides guidance on the recommended steps to adequately assess and treat malaria patients.

Symptoms of malaria are generally non-specific and most commonly consist of fever, headache, malaise, weakness, gastrointestinal distress, neurologic complaints, back pain, myalgia, chills, and/or cough. The diagnosis of malaria should also be considered in any person with fever of unknown origin regardless of travel history. Patients suspected of having malaria should be urgently evaluated. Reminder Laboratory diagnosis of malaria can be made through microscopic examination of thick and thin blood smears. Thick blood smears are more sensitive in detecting malaria parasites because the blood is more concentrated allowing for a greater volume of blood to be examined; however, they are more difficult to read. Thin smears aid in parasite species identification and quantification.

Blood smears need to be done and read as soon as possible, within 24 hours of patient presentation; qualified personnel who can perform these tasks should always be on-call. A negative blood smear makes the diagnosis of malaria unlikely. However, because non-immune individuals may be symptomatic at very low parasite densities which may be initially undetectable, blood smears should be repeated every 12–24 hours for a total of three sets before the diagnosis of malaria can be ruled out. Once malaria parasites are detected on a blood smear, the parasite density should then be estimated. This can be done by looking at a monolayer of red blood cells on the thin smear using the oil immersion objective at 100x. The slide should be examined where the RBCs are more or less touching.

The most frequent symptoms include fever and chills, which can be accompanied by headache, myalgias, arthralgias, weakness, vomiting, and diarrhea. Other clinical features include splenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypoglycemia, pulmonary or renal dysfunction, and neurologic changes. The clinical presentation can vary substantially depending on the infecting species, the level of parasitemia, and the immune status of the patient. Infections caused by. P. falciparum are the most likely to progress to severe, potentially fatal forms with central nervous system involvement, acute renal failure, severe anemia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Other species can also have severe manifestations. Complications of P. vivax malaria include splenomegaly, and those of P. malariae include nephrotic syndrome. Plasmodium falciparum.

### Clinical features of malaria… [^114N7Hw8]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

All the clinical symptoms associated with malaria are caused by the asexual erythrocytic or blood stage parasites. When the parasite develops in the erythrocyte, numerous known and unknown waste substances such as hemozoin pigment and other toxic factors accumulate in the infected red blood cell. These are dumped into the bloodstream when the infected cells lyse and release invasive merozoites. The hemozoin and other toxic factors such as glucose phosphate isomerase stimulate macrophages and other cells to produce cytokines and other soluble factors which act to produce fever and rigors and probably influence other severe pathophysiology associated with malaria. Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes, particularly those with mature trophozoites, adhere to the vascular endothelium of venular blood vessel walls and do not freely circulate in the blood.

When this sequestration of infected erythrocytes occurs in the vessels of the brain it is believed to be a factor in causing the severe disease syndrome known as cerebral malaria, which is associated with high mortality.
- Elevated temperatures
- Perspiration
- Weakness
- Enlarged spleen
- Mild jaundice
- Enlargement of the liver
- Increased respiratory rate Diagnosis of malaria depends on the demonstration of parasites in the blood, usually by microscopy. Additional laboratory findings may include mild anemia, mild decrease in blood platelets, elevation of bilirubin, and elevation of aminotransferases.
- High percent parasitemia
- Impaired consciousness
- Seizures
- Circulatory collapse/shock
- Pulmonary edema or acute respiratory distress syndrome
- Acidosis
- Acute kidney injury
- Abnormal bleeding or disseminated intravascular coagulation
- Jaundice
- Severe anemia. P. malariae.
- Hyperreactive malarial splenomegaly occurs infrequently and is attributed to an abnormal immune response to repeated malarial infections. The disease is marked by a very enlarged spleen and liver, abnormal immunologic findings, anemia, and a susceptibility to other infections.

### Clinical testing and diagnosis for malaria… [^114Vy4FM]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

At a glance
- Obtain a recent travel history from febrile patients.
- Always confirm a clinical diagnosis of malaria with a laboratory test.
- Rapid diagnosis of malaria and accurate identification the parasite species is integral to the appropriate treatment of affected individuals.
- Follow-up testing by microscopy is also recommended to ensure parasite clearance following treatment completion. Considerations Healthcare providers should always obtain a travel history from febrile patients. Fever in a person who has recently traveled in a malaria-endemic area should always be immediately evaluated using the appropriate diagnostic tests for malaria. Clinical diagnosis Clinical findings should always be confirmed by a laboratory test for malaria. In addition to ordering the malaria specific diagnostic tests described below, the health-care provider should conduct an initial workup and request a complete blood count and a routine chemistry panel.

In the event that the person does have a positive malaria test, these additional tests will be useful in determining whether the patient has uncomplicated or severe manifestations of the malaria infection. Specifically, these tests can detect severe anemia, hypoglycemia, renal failure, hyperbilirubinemia, and acid-base disturbances. If the patient has traveled to an area with. Plasmodium vivax transmission, testing for G6PD deficiency early in the evaluation would expedite the ability to administer treatment for the dormant liver stages. However, it depends on the quality of the reagents, of the microscope, the blood smear, and on the experience of the laboratorian. A negative blood smear makes the diagnosis of malaria unlikely.

However, because non-immune individuals may be symptomatic at very low parasite densities which may be initially undetectable, blood smears should be repeated every 12–24 hours for a total of three sets before the diagnosis of malaria can be ruled out. Malaria RDTs are currently used in some clinical settings and programs. On June 13, 2007, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first RDT for use in the United States. This RDT is approved for use by clinical laboratories, not by individual clinicians or by patients themselves. It is recommended that all RDTs are followed-up with microscopy to confirm the results and if positive, to confirm the species and quantify the proportion of red blood cells that are infected. The use of this RDT may decrease the amount of time that it takes to determine whether a patient is infected with malaria.
