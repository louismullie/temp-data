## Question

For example, in the sequence x₁, x₂, ⋯, xₙ, ⋯, the sum of any three consecutive terms is 20, and x₁ = 9, x₁₂ = 7. Find the value of x₂₀₀₀.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to find the value of (x_{2000}) in a sequence where the sum of any three consecutive terms is 20, with given values (x_1 = 9) and (x_{12} = 7). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the recurrence relation implied by the three-term sum condition. Then, I should verify whether the sequence is periodic and determine its period. Next, I will use the given values to solve for the unknowns and write the general formula. Finally, I will compute (x_{2000}) using modular arithmetic and double-check the result.

> Let me first confirm the recurrence. The condition (x_n + x_{n+1} + x_{n+2} = 20) for all (n \\geq 1) implies that (x_{n+3} = 20 - x_{n+2} - x_{n+1}). But wait, I can also relate consecutive triplets: subtracting the equation for (n) from the equation for (n+1) gives (x_{n+3} - x_n = 0), so (x_{n+3} = x_n). This means the sequence is periodic with period 3, and I should verify that this holds for all (n).

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should explicitly check the periodicity. If (x_{n+3} = x_n), then the sequence repeats every 3 terms, so the pattern is (a, b, c, a, b, c, \\dots) for some constants (a, b, c). Given (x_1 = 9), I have (a = 9), and the triplet sum condition becomes (9 + b + c = 20), which simplifies to (b + c = 11). I need to ensure this aligns with the given (x_{12} = 7).

> Next, I should review how to use (x_{12} = 7). Since the period is 3, the index 12 maps to the same position as 3, 6, and 9, so (x_{12} = x_3 = c = 7). Substituting (c = 7) into (b + c = 11) gives (b = 4). Therefore, the repeating triplet is (9, 4, 7), and I should double-check that the sum is indeed 20: (9 + 4 + 7 = 20), which checks out.

> Now, I will write the general formula. For any positive integer (n), (x_n) depends on (n \\mod 3): if (n \\equiv 1 \\mod 3), then (x_n = 9); if (n \\equiv 2 \\mod 3), then (x_n = 4); if (n \\equiv 0 \\mod 3), then (x_n = 7). I should confirm this mapping matches the indices correctly, especially that (x_3 = 7) and (x_{12} = 7), which it does.

> Finally, I need to compute (x_{2000}). Let me think about the modulus: (2000 \\div 3 = 666) with remainder 2, so (2000 \\equiv 2 \\mod 3). According to the mapping, that corresponds to the second value in the triplet, which is 4. Therefore, (x_{2000} = 4). I should double-check the arithmetic to avoid a mistake, and yes, (3 \\times 666 = 1998), so 2000 is indeed 2 more than a multiple of 3, confirming the remainder is 2.

The sequence is periodic with period 3, and the repeating pattern is (9, 4, 7). Since (2000 mod 3 = 2), (x₂₀₀₀) corresponds to the second element in the cycle, which is **4**.

---

## Step 1: establish the recurrence relation

Given that the sum of any three consecutive terms is 20, we have:

x_n + x_(n+1) + x_(n+2) = 20

Shifting the index by 1, we also have:

x_(n+1) + x_(n+2) + x_(n+3) = 20

Subtracting the first equation from the second yields:

x_(n+3) − x_n = 0 ⇒ x_(n+3) = x_n

Thus, the sequence is **periodic with period 3**.

---

## Step 2: determine the repeating pattern

Let the repeating triplet be ((a, b, c)). Then:

x₁ = a = 9, x₂ = b, x₃ = c

Using the sum condition:

a + b + c = 20 ⇒ 9 + b + c = 20 ⇒ b + c = 11

We are also given (x_{12} = 7). Since the sequence repeats every 3 terms, (x_{12} = x_3 = c), so:

c = 7 ⇒ b = 11 − 7 = 4

Therefore, the repeating pattern is ((9, 4, 7)).

---

## Step 3: find (x_{2000})

Because the sequence repeats every 3 terms, we compute the position of 2000 within the cycle:

2000 mod 3 = 2

This means (x_{2000}) corresponds to the second element of the triplet, which is **4**.

---

The value of (x_{2000}) is **4**.

### Interleukin-7 receptor expression: intelligent design [^c44602d5]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2007). Medium credibility.

Interleukin-7 (IL-7) is produced by stromal cells in lymphoid tissues and is required for the development of T cells and for their persistence in the periphery. Unlike many other cytokines that act on lymphocytes, IL-7 production by stromal cells is not substantially affected by extrinsic stimuli. So, the amount of available IL-7 protein is thought to be regulated by the rate that it is scavenged by T cells. As we review here, there is mounting evidence indicating that the amount of IL-7 receptor expressed on a cell not only determines how vigorously the cell responds to IL-7, but it can also determine how efficiently the cell consumes IL-7 and, therefore, affect the supply of this limiting resource in the niche.

### IL-7 promotes T (H) 1 development and serum IL-7 predicts clinical response to interferon-β in multiple sclerosis [^d5750254]. Science Translational Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The interleukin-7 receptor α chain (IL-7Rα) gene was identified as a top non-major histocompatibility complex-linked risk locus for multiple sclerosis (MS). Recently, we showed that a T helper 1 (T(H)1)-driven, but not a T(H)17-driven, form of MS exhibited a good clinical response to interferon-β (IFN-β) therapy. We now demonstrate that high serum levels of IL-7, particularly when paired with low levels of IL-17F, predict responsiveness to IFN-β and hence a T(H)1-driven subtype of MS. We also show that although IL-7 signaling is neither necessary nor sufficient for the induction or expansion of T(H)17 cells, IL-7 can greatly enhance both human and mouse T(H)1 cell differentiation. IL-7 alone is sufficient to induce human T(H)1 differentiation in the absence of IL-12 or other cytokines. Furthermore, targeting IL-7/IL-7Rα is beneficial in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of MS. Mice treated with IL-7Rα-blocking antibodies before or after onset of paralysis exhibited reduced clinical signs of EAE, with reduction in peripheral naïve and activated T cells, whereas central memory T, regulatory T, B, and natural killer cell populations were largely spared. IL-7Rα antibody treatment markedly reduced lymphocyte infiltration into the central nervous system in mice with EAE. Thus, a serum profile of high IL-7 may signify a T(H)1-driven form of MS and may predict outcome in MS patients undergoing IFN-β therapy. Blockade of IL-7 and the IL-7Rα pathway may have therapeutic potential in MS and other autoimmune diseases.

### A brief measure for assessing generalized anxiety disorder: the GAD-7 [^c35d9568]. Archives of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale (GAD-7)" for generalized anxiety disorder, suicidal ideation, anxiety and depression in patients with cancer and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia.

The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 score, commonly abbreviated as GAD-7, is a clinical tool used to measure the severity of generalized anxiety disorder in adults. It is a self-reported questionnaire that consists of seven items, each scored from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day), providing a 0–21 severity scale. The GAD-7 score is used to screen for and assess the severity of generalized anxiety disorder, and it can also be used to monitor treatment response in patients with this disorder. It is not recommended for use in children or adolescents, or for diagnosing other types of anxiety disorders.

The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) score is a simple tool used to assess anxiety levels based on seven key questions about common symptoms. Each question pertains to how often specific feelings or behaviors have been experienced recently, ranging from being nervous to feeling afraid that something awful might happen.

For each of these seven questions, the following answers are possible, each with an associated score that reflects symptom frequency:

| **Response option** | **Score** |
|-|-|
| Not at all | 0 |
| Several days | 1 |
| More than half the days | 2 |
| Nearly every day | 3 |

The questions focus on:

- Feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge
- Inability to stop or control worrying
- Excessive worrying about various things
- Trouble relaxing
- Restlessness that makes it difficult to sit still
- Irritability or annoyance
- Feeling afraid that something bad might happen

By converting each response to its numerical score, the results are then summed to produce a total score ranging from 0 to 21. This score allows individuals and healthcare providers to identify the severity of anxiety in a standardized manner.

The total score is interpreted as follows:

- Scores of 0 to 4 suggest "No anxiety disorder", indicating minimal anxiety symptoms.
- Scores of 5 to 9 indicate "Mild anxiety disorder", reflecting a low level of anxiety that might warrant attention.
- Scores of 10 to 14 denote "Moderate anxiety disorder", suggesting a noticeable impact that could benefit from further evaluation or intervention.
- Scores of 15 or more are categorized as "Severe anxiety disorder", pointing to significant anxiety that likely requires professional help or intervention.

### Mavorixafor (Xolremdi) [^ab62ceb7]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

7.2 Effect of XOLREMDI on Other Drugs

CYP2D6 Substrates

The use of XOLREMDI with drugs that are another drug highly dependent on CYP2D6 for clearance is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)].

Mavorixafor is a CYP2D6 inhibitor. Mavorixafor increases exposure of CYP2D6 substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the risk of adverse reactions related to these substrates.

CYP3A4 Substrates

Monitor for CYP3A4 substrate related adverse reactions more frequently, unless otherwise recommended in the substrate's Prescribing Information, when XOLREMDI is used concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates where minimal substrate concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions.

Mavorixafor is an inhibitor of CYP3A4. Mavorixafor may increase the Cmaxand AUC of CYP3A4 substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the risk of adverse reactions from the CYP3A4 substrate.

P-gp Substrates

Monitor for P-gp substrate related adverse reactions more frequently, unless otherwise recommended in the substrate's Prescribing Information, when XOLREMDI is used concomitantly with P-gp substrates where minimal substrate concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions.

Digoxin: Measure serum digoxin concentrations before initiating concomitant use with XOLREMDI, and continue monitoring serum digoxin concentrations as recommended in the Prescribing Information for digoxin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Mavorixafor is an inhibitor of P-gp. Mavorixafor may increase the Cmaxand AUC of P-gp substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the risk of adverse reactions from the P-gp substrate.

Metformin: Monitor for glycemic control and adjust the dose of metformin as necessary. Mavorixafor may decrease the mean Cmaxand AUC of metformin, which may reduce metformin's effectiveness. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown.

7.3 Drugs that Prolong the QTc Interval

Obtain an electrocardiogram when initiating, during concomitant use, and as clinically indicated in patients receiving concomitant medications with a known potential to prolong the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

XOLREMDI causes QTc interval prolongation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Concomitant use of XOLREMDI with other products that prolong QTc interval may result in a greater increase in QTc interval and adverse reactions associated with QTc interval prolongation, including torsade de pointes, other serious arrythmias, and sudden death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Specific IgE to peanut 2S albumin ara h 7 has a discriminative ability comparable to ara h 2 and 6 [^c0109041]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Little is known on the clinical relevance of peanut 2S albumin Ara h 7.

Objective

To investigate the discriminative ability of Ara h 7 in peanut allergy and assess the role of cross-reactivity between Ara h 2, 6 and Ara h 7 isoforms.

Methods

Sensitization to recombinant peanut storage proteins Ara h 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 was assessed using a line blot in sera from 40 peanut-tolerant and 40 peanut-allergic patients, based on food challenge outcome. A dose-dependent ELISA inhibition experiment was performed with recombinant Ara h 2, 6 and Ara h 7 isoforms.

Results

For Ara h 7.0201, an area under the ROC curve was found of 0.83, comparable to Ara h 2 (AUC 0.81) and Ara h 6 (AUC 0.85). Ara h 7 intensity values strongly correlated with those from Ara h 2 and 6 (r s = 0.81). Of all patients sensitized to 2S albumins Ara h 2, 6, or 7, the majority was co-sensitized to all three (n = 24, 68%), although mono-sensitization to either 2S albumin was also observed in selected patients (Ara h 2: n = 6, 17%; Ara h 6: n = 2, 6%; Ara h 7: n = 2, 6%). Binding to Ara h 7.0101 could be strongly inhibited by Ara h 7.0201, but not the other way around.

Conclusions and Clinical Relevance

Specific IgE against Ara h 7.0201 has a predictive ability for peanut allergy similar to Ara h 2 and 6 and possesses unique IgE epitopes as well as epitopes shared between the other Ara h 7 isoform and Ara h 2 and 6. While co-sensitization to all three 2S albumins is most common, mono-sensitization to either Ara h 2, 6, or 7 occurs in selected patients, leading to a risk of misdiagnosis when testing for a single 2S albumin.

### Breast MRI at 7 tesla with a bilateral coil and T1-weighted acquisition with robust fat suppression: image evaluation and comparison with 3 tesla [^ff7a88e9]. European Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the image quality of T1-weighted fat-suppressed breast MRI at 7 T and to compare 7-T and 3-T images.

Methods

Seventeen subjects were imaged using a 7-T bilateral transmit-receive coil and 3D gradient echo sequence with adiabatic inversion-based fat suppression (FS). Images were graded on a five-point scale and quantitatively assessed through signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), fibroglandular/fat contrast and signal uniformity measurements.

Results

Image scores at 7 and 3 T were similar on standard-resolution images (1.1×1.1×1.1–1.6 mm(3)), indicating that high-quality breast imaging with clinical parameters can be performed at 7 T. The 7-T SNR advantage was underscored on 0.6-mm isotropic images, where image quality was significantly greater than at 3 T (4.2 versus 3.1, P ≤ 0.0001). Fibroglandular/fat contrast was more than two times higher at 7 T than at 3 T, owing to effective adiabatic inversion-based FS and the inherent 7-T signal advantage. Signal uniformity was comparable at 7 and 3 T (P < 0.05). Similar 7-T image quality was observed in all subjects, indicating robustness against anatomical variation.

Conclusion

The 7-T bilateral transmit-receive coil and adiabatic inversion-based FS technique produce image quality that is as good as or better than at 3 T.

Key Points

- High image quality bilateral breast MRI is achievable with clinical parameters at 7 T.
- 7-T high-resolution imaging improves delineation of subtle soft tissue structures.
- Adiabatic-based fat suppression provides excellent fibroglandular/fat contrast at 7 T.
- 7- and 3-T 3D T1-weighted gradient-echo images have similar signal uniformity.
- The 7-T dual solenoid coil enables bilateral imaging without compromising uniformity.

### A cohort of caenorhabditis species lacking the highly conserved let-7 microRNA [^8b65354d]. G3 (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Most Caenorhabditis species belonging to the Japonica group lack let-7 microRNA

The let-7 microRNA was the first microRNA whose sequence and developmental function in promoting the differentiation of cell fates were shown to be conserved from nematodes to vertebrates. While studying the evolution of regulatory sequences within the let-7 genomic loci of related nematodes, we discovered that most species of the Japonica group of Caenorhabditis lack the let-7 sequence in their genomic assemblies (Figure 1B and Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, one exceptional Japonica group species, C. macrosperma, had let-7 sequence in its genomic assembly, which we confirmed using PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Figure S1).

To determine if the lack of let-7 sequence in the genomic assemblies of these Japonica group species could reflect major genomic rearrangements and/or anomalous assembly of genomic sequence, we analyzed the genome sequences surrounding let-7 in C. elegans for potential synteny to corresponding genomic sequences of all Caenorhabditis species predicted to lack the let-7 sequence. We found that the genomic assemblies of all the Caenorhabditis species lacking let-7 sequence contain a region syntenic to the region surrounding the let-7 locus of C. elegans (representative synteny shown in Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure S2A). Except for Caenorhabditis afra, none of the Caenorhabditis species lacking let-7 sequence exhibited any indication that loss of let-7 sequence is associated with genomic rearrangement (Supplementary Figure S3).

### Teaching old receptors new tricks: biasing seven-transmembrane receptors [^a00ce192]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2010). Medium credibility.

Seven-transmembrane receptors (7TMRs; also known as G protein-coupled receptors) are the largest class of receptors in the human genome and are common targets for therapeutics. Originally identified as mediators of 7TMR desensitization, beta-arrestins (arrestin 2 and arrestin 3) are now recognized as true adaptor proteins that transduce signals to multiple effector pathways. Signalling that is mediated by beta-arrestins has distinct biochemical and functional consequences from those mediated by G proteins, and several biased ligands and receptors have been identified that preferentially signal through either G protein- or beta-arrestin-mediated pathways. These ligands are not only useful tools for investigating the biochemistry of 7TMR signalling, they also have the potential to be developed into new classes of therapeutics.

### Belantamab mafodotin, bortezomib, and dexamethasone for multiple myeloma [^feab28ef]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

The study DREAMM-7 was published by Vania Hungria and colleagues in 2024 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Multiple myeloma. In the DREAMM-7 study, the trial question was: what is the role of belantamab mafodotin, bortezomib, and dexamethasone in patients who had a progression of multiple myeloma after at least one line of therapy? In the DREAMM-7 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the DREAMM-7 study, the population was: 494 patients (222 female, 272 male). The inclusion criteria were patients who had relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma after at least one line of therapy. The key exclusion criteria were disease refractory to anti-CD38 therapy; exposure to anti-B-cell maturation antigen therapy. In the DREAMM-7 study, the interventions were: n = 243 BVd (belantamab mafodotin, bortezomib, and dexamethasone) n = 251 DVd (daratumumab, bortezomib, and dexamethasone). In the DREAMM-7 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in median progression-free survival (36.6 months vs. 13.4 months; HR 2.44, 95% CI 1.89 to 3.23). In the DREAMM-7 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in overall survival at 18 months (84% vs. 73%; HR 1.75, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.5). In the DREAMM-7 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in adverse events, infections and infestations. significant difference in ocular events (79% vs. 29%). In the DREAMM-7 study, the conclusion was: in patients who had relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma after at least one line of therapy, BVd was superior to DVd with respect to median progression-free survival.

### Quantitative assessment of the group of seven's collaboration in sustainable development goals [^b5230698]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Strengthening international collaboration is essential to achieving the United Nations' SDGs. The Group of Seven (G7) is recognized for acting and enhancing cooperation to achieve the SDGs. However, the current understanding of G7's cooperation is rather subjective without quantitative measurements. Here we show a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of G7's cooperation with regards to the economic and environmental SDGs over the period of 2000–2020. The results suggest that G7 countries have all contributed positively to economic indicators thanks to their closely binding relationship. By contrast, significant discrepancies and uncooperative performances in environmental indicators have been revealed. Particularly, Canada and Germany have shown considerable negative synergy contributions to environmental indicators, which might offset the positive contributions brought by France and Italy and lead to an overall negative synergy. Our results highlight the need for further collaboration among G7 to tackle emerging environmental issues, such as climate change and shrinking biodiversity.

### Overall survival with ribociclib plus endocrine therapy in breast cancer [^e89cd9e4]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

The study MONALEESA-7 was published by Seock-Ah Im and colleagues in 2019 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Breast cancer. In the MONALEESA-7 study, the trial question was: what is the effect of ribociclib plus endocrine therapy in patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer? In the MONALEESA-7 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the MONALEESA-7 study, the population was: 672 female patients. The inclusion criteria were adult patients with hormone-receptor-positive/HER2- advanced breast cancer. The key exclusion criteria were receipt of prior CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy; postmenopausal women; inflammatory breast cancer; prior hormonal anti-cancer therapy for advanced breast cancer; concurrent malignancy or malignancy within 3 years or randomization; CNS metastases; active cardiac disease or a history of cardiac dysfunction. In the MONALEESA-7 study, the interventions were: n = 335 ribociclib plus endocrine therapy (ribociclib 600 mg PO daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by 7 days off, for a complete cycle of 28 days plus nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor/tamoxifen 20 mg PO daily and goserelin 3.6 mg SC) n = 337 placebo plus endocrine therapy (matching placebo on days 1–21 of each 28-day cycle plus nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor/tamoxifen 20 mg/day PO and goserelin 3.6 mg SC). In the MONALEESA-7 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in overall survival at 42 months (70.2% vs. 46%; HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.85). In the MONALEESA-7 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in patients who had not yet received a first subsequent chemotherapy (65.8% vs. 49%; HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.17) Significant increase in progression-free survival during receipt of subsequent therapy at 42 months (54.6% vs. 37.8%; HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.82) Significant increase in overall survival at 42 months, patients who received an aromatase inhibitor (69.7% vs. 43%; HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.02 to 2). In the MONALEESA-7 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in prolonged QT interval. significant difference in grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (63.5% vs. 4.5%). In the MONALEESA-7 study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with hormone-receptor-positive/HER2- advanced breast cancer, ribociclib plus endocrine therapy was superior to placebo plus endocrine therapy with respect to overall survival at 42 months.

### Seven-day versus 14-day antibiotic course for culture-proven neonatal sepsis: a multicentre randomised non-inferiority trial in a low and middle-income country [^3873e0c6]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Definitive guidance regarding the duration of antibiotics for neonatal sepsis is lacking. We hypothesised that a 7-day antibiotic course is non-inferior to a 14-day course for treating culture-proven sepsis.

Design

Randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial with masked outcome assessment in eight centres in a low and middle-income country.

Patients

Neonates with a birth weight (BW) ≥ 1000 g and blood culture-proven sepsis were randomised on day 7 of sensitive antibiotic therapy provided sepsis had clinically remitted.

Exclusions

Staphylococcus aureus or fungal sepsis, and infections requiring prolonged antibiotics. We planned to enrol 350 per group, assuming 10% rate of primary outcome, +7% non-inferiority margin, one-sided 5% alpha, 90% power, 10% loss to follow-up.

Intervention

7 days (no further treatment); comparison: 14 days (7 days postrandomisation).

Outcomes

Primary: relapse (definite or probable) within day 21 postantibiotic completion.

Secondary Outcomes

composite of mortality or definite/probable/secondary sepsis and duration of hospitalisation. One interim analysis (per protocol (PP)) was planned.

Results

126 and 135 subjects were recruited in 7-day and 14-day groups, respectively, with mean (SD) birth weight (BW) 2250.9 (741.1) and 2187.8 (718.8) g. The trial was terminated early, based on interim PP analysis. 2/125 and 6/130 subjects had the primary outcome in 7-day and 14-day groups, respectively (risk difference (RD) = -3.0% (99.5% CI -9.2%, +3.1%), below non-inferiority margin). The composite secondary outcome also favoured the 7-day regimen (RD: -3.7% (99.5% CI -12.4% to +5.1%)). Duration of hospitalisation was shorter in 7-day group (median difference: -4 days (95% CI -5 to -3)).

Conclusions

A 7-day course of antibiotics may be non-inferior to a 14-day course for uncomplicated bacterial neonatal sepsis.

Trial Registration Number

NCT03280147.

### Drosophila melanogaster females restore their attractiveness after mating by removing male anti-aphrodisiac pheromones [^0d9b13c8]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Since the largest increase in CHC after mating was in levels of 7-T and this pheromone has known effects on courtship, we hypothesized that cVA requires a concomitant increase in 7-T to mediate courtship inhibition. To directly test whether a mated female's attractiveness is determined by the joint presence of cVA and 7-T naturally transferred by males, we perfumed Oe − males with 1205.32 ng (± 13.86) of synthetic 7-T to specifically restore wild-type levels of 7-T. We found that females mated to perfumed Oe − males (m Oe +7-T) had elevated amounts of 7-T (183.24 ± 4.16 ng) comparable to females mated to wild-type males (see Fig. 1a2), as well the normal amount of cVA. As a result of this manipulation, these females were courted significantly less than virgin females (Fig. 3a) suggesting that the combination of cVA and 7-T can inhibit male courtship behaviour when presented together within biologically relevant ranges.

### CONSORT extension for the reporting of randomised controlled trials conducted using cohorts and routinely collected data (CONSORT-ROUTINE): checklist with explanation and elaboration [^3127be48]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Explanation

Trials using cohorts or routinely collected data might require specific codes or algorithms, such as diagnostic codes, to identify and define outcomes. An electronic health record query can be performed, for example, with a list of diagnostic codes to identify all patients who have experienced a specific adverse event. An algorithm, or sequence of steps necessary to score or grade an outcome, could also be used. To assess validity and to facilitate reproducibility, the list of codes and algorithms should be provided or linked to an external source within the text or in supplementary material, ideally with the computer code used to reproduce this step.

Cohorts and routinely collected data are often collected and entered by staff involved in routine patient care or by non-clinical staff, based on medical records, and the level of completeness varies. Also, procedures for entering data for clinical care or billing might introduce certain biases, and concerns about data completeness and accuracy could arise. Authors should describe data completeness in enough detail so that others can evaluate accuracy. Issues of misclassification, and any efforts to minimise misclassification, should be reported.

Outcome definitions might vary between cohorts and routinely collected data, and standards commonly used in clinical trials and data fields might be missing. The authors should describe any adjudication of outcomes, if adjudication was blinded to trial allocation, and which outcome definitions were used (eg, by referring to a separate adjudication protocol).

Item 6b (unmodified)

Any changes to trial outcomes after the trial commenced, with reasons (see CONSORT 2010).

Sample size

Item 7a (unmodified)

How sample size was determined (see CONSORT 2010).

Item 7b (unmodified)

When applicable, explanation of any interim analyses and stopping guidelines (see CONSORT 2010).

Randomisation

Item 8a (unmodified)

Method used to generate the random allocation sequence (see CONSORT 2010).

### Seven-point checklist of dermoscopy revisited [^51bf1640]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Revised 7-point dermoscopy checklist for melanoma" for cutaneous melanoma.

The Revised 7-point dermoscopy checklist for melanoma is a diagnostic tool designed to aid in the early detection of melanoma, a type of skin cancer. This checklist is particularly useful in assessing suspicious skin lesions in patients at risk for melanoma.

The checklist comprises seven primary components, each assigned a score of 1 if present. These components include an atypical pigment network, a blue-white veil, an atypical vascular pattern, irregular streaks, irregular blotches, irregular dots or globules, and regression structures. The presence of each feature is indicative of potential melanoma and contributes to the overall score.

The total score is calculated by summing the individual scores for each component. A score of 1 or more suggests a high likelihood of melanoma, warranting further investigation through excision and histopathological examination. This scoring system thus provides a structured approach to the dermoscopic evaluation of skin lesions, facilitating early detection and treatment of melanoma.

The revised 7-point dermoscopy checklist for melanoma assessment takes as input seven binary features associated with potential signs of melanoma. Each feature represents a potential indicator of melanoma and can either be present (true) or absent (false). These features are:

atypical pigment network
blue-white veil
atypical vascular pattern
irregular streaks
irregular blotches
irregular dots/globules
regression structures.

To compute the melanoma score, each feature that is present (true) contributes a score of 1. The total score is the sum of the scores for all present features, ranging from 0 to 7. The detailed scoring system is as follows:

| **Feature** | **Score if present** |
|-|-|
| Atypical pigment network | 1 |
| Blue-white veil | 1 |
| Atypical vascular pattern | 1 |
| Irregular streaks | 1 |
| Irregular blotches | 1 |
| Irregular dots/globules | 1 |
| Regression structures | 1 |

The interpretation of the score is straightforward: if the total score is 1 or more, it indicates that melanoma is likely, and excision of the suspected lesion is recommended. Therefore, any positive feature finding (i.e., any score of at least 1) necessitates further medical action. The outputs of the computation are the total score and its interpretation, which always suggests the likelihood of melanoma and the need for excision when the score is non-zero.

### A cohort of caenorhabditis species lacking the highly conserved let-7 microRNA [^9e61444a]. G3 (2021). Medium credibility.

The deep evolutionary roots of let-7 in the heterochronic pathway, including the apparent conservation of specific targeting of LIN-41 mRNA by let-7 microRNA suggests that hypothetical evolutionary loss of let-7 could be expected to be accompanied by significant divergence, compared with C. elegans, in the functions of heterochronic genes downstream of let-7, such as lin-41 and lin-29, and/or upstream genes, such as lin-14, lin-28, and hbl-1. Exploration of these questions would require the identification of species closely related to C. elegans that lack let-7.

Here, we identify a faction of Caenorhabditis species within the Japonica group, a sister group to the Elegans group, that lack the let-7 gene. As far as we know, this is the first described instance of two sister clades where all known species of one clade have retained let-7, whereas numerous species of the sister clade do not have let-7. We demonstrate that for an exemplary let-7- lacking species, Caenorhabditis sulstoni, the functional architecture of the heterochronic pathway is otherwise conserved compared with C. elegans. Our findings indicate thatLIN-41 mRNA is apparently regulated by the remaining let-7 -family microRNAs in most Japonica group species, suggesting that the heterochronic pathway can evolve to re-delegate let-7- family function under certain evolutionary circumstances.

### Toll-like receptor 9 deficiency breaks tolerance to RNA-associated antigens and up-regulates toll-like receptor 7 protein in sle1 mice [^e70fad15]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 7 and 9 are important innate signaling molecules with opposing roles in the development and progression of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). While multiple studies support the notion of a dependency on TLR-7 for disease development, genetic ablation of TLR-9 results in severe disease with glomerulonephritis (GN) by a largely unknown mechanism. This study was undertaken to examine the suppressive role of TLR-9 in the development of severe lupus in a mouse model.

Methods

We crossed Sle1 lupus-prone mice with TLR-9-deficient mice to generate Sle1TLR-9 -/- mice. Mice ages 4.5–6.5 months were evaluated for severe autoimmunity by assessing splenomegaly, GN, immune cell populations, autoantibody and total Ig profiles, kidney dendritic cell (DC) function, and TLR-7 protein expression. Mice ages 8–10 weeks were used for functional B cell studies, Ig profiling, and determination of TLR-7 expression.

Results

Sle1TLR-9 -/- mice developed severe disease similar to TLR-9-deficient MRL and Nba2 models. Sle1TLR-9 -/- mouse B cells produced more class-switched antibodies, and the autoantibody repertoire was skewed toward RNA-containing antigens. GN in these mice was associated with DC infiltration, and purified Sle1TLR-9 -/- mouse renal DCs were more efficient at TLR-7-dependent antigen presentation and expressed higher levels of TLR-7 protein. Importantly, this increase in TLR-7 expression occurred prior to disease development, indicating a role in the initiation stages of tissue destruction.

Conclusion

The increase in TLR-7-reactive immune complexes, and the concomitant enhanced expression of their receptor, promotes inflammation and disease in Sle1TLR9 -/- mice.

### IL-7 expands lymphocyte populations and enhances immune responses to sipuleucel-T in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) [^042720f6]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

While our data clearly demonstrated rhIL-7's effects on CD4+ and CD8+ T cell expansion when given after si-T, the limitations of our study impaired our ability to find associations between the immune findings and clinical outcomes. The finding that greater numbers of CD4+ T cells capable of producing pro-inflammatory cytokines were detected in rhIL-7-treated individuals raises the question of whether sequencing of rhIL-7 before or during sip-T treatment may produce more naive T cells for sip-T stimulation, ultimately leading to improved clinical responses. It is also interesting to consider whether patients with lower (or higher) baseline ALC might incur more clinical benefit from rhIL-7. Overall, our data indicate an acceptable safety profile and immunological rationale for using rhIL-7 in combination with sip-T as well as other immunostimulatory agents, such as checkpoint inhibitors and targeted radiotherapeutics, together. We believe that additional combination studies such as these are needed to improve outcomes for patients with mCRPC.

In summary, while sip-T remains a backbone of prostate cancer immunotherapy, clinical studies to date have made it clear that single agent immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors, are not efficacious in mCRPC. Thus, combination therapies must be pursued. A strength of this clinical trial was the cooperative, multi-institutional, randomized nature of the study. It is also the first to evaluate the addition of a rhIL-7 product in patients receiving sip-T. rhIL-7 treatment was safe and well tolerated. Among rhIL-7-treated patients, we demonstrated a significant expansion in lymphocyte populations, a significant reversal of the NLR, and significant increases in antigen-specific T and B cell responses, including to PAP. Findings from these studies support further exploration of rhIL-7 as part of a combination immunotherapy approach.

Maximum Diffusion Experiment of Patient Preferences

The most preferred ART improvements based on first or second-place rankings by PLHIV in Japan were ART with "fewer side effects" (53.3%), "reduced long-term impact on my body" (48.0%), and "longer-lasting medicine so I don't have to take it every day" (38.7%). Preference shares for ART with fewer side effects and reduced long-term impact were numerically higher in Japan than in other Asian countries or non-Asian countries (Fig. 7). The percentage ranking nondaily regimens in first or second place in terms of perceived importance was 38.7% in Japan, 47.7% in other Asian countries, and 43.5% in non-Asian countries (Fig. 7); the percentage willing to try nondaily regimens was 45.3% in Japan, 63.9% in other Asian countries and 54.3% in non-Asian countries (Table 2). Similarly, the percentage ranking ART with fewer medicines in first or second place in terms of perceived importance was 33.3% in Japan, 38.1% in other Asian countries, and 41.7% in non-Asian countries, while the percentage willing to try ART with fewer medicines was 68.0% in Japan, 63.9% in other Asian countries and 73.0% in non-Asian countries.

### A randomised phase I study of etrolizumab (rhuMAb β 7) in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis [^3c188781]. Gut (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Etrolizumab (rhuMAb β7, anti-β7, PRO145223) is a humanised monoclonal antibody targeting the β7 subunit of the heterodimeric integrins α4β7 and αEβ7, which are implicated in leucocyte migration and retention in ulcerative colitis (UC). This randomised phase I study evaluated the safety and pharmacology of etrolizumab in patients with moderate to severe UC.

Design

In the single ascending dose (SAD) stage, etrolizumab (0.3, 1.0, 3.0, 10 mg/kg intravenous, 3.0 mg/kg subcutaneous (SC) or placebo) was administered 4:1 (n = 25) in each cohort. In the multiple dose (MD) stage, new patients received monthly etrolizumab (0.5 mg/kg SC (n = 4), 1.5 mg/kg SC (n = 5), 3.0 mg/kg SC (n = 4), 4.0 mg/kg intravenous (n = 5)) or placebo (n = 5). The pharmacokinetics was studied and Mayo Clinic Score evaluated at baseline, day 29 (SAD), and days 43 and 71 (MD).

Results

In the SAD stage, there were no dose limiting toxicities, infusion or injection site reactions. Two impaired wound healing serious adverse events occurred in two patients receiving etrolizumab. In the MD stage, there were no dose limiting toxicities, and no infusion or injection site reactions. Headache was the most common adverse event, occurring more often in etrolizumab patients. Antietrolizumab antibodies were detected in two subjects. The duration of β7 receptor full occupancy was dose related. A clinical response was observed in 12/18 patients, and clinical remission in 3/18 patients treated with etrolizumab in the MD stage, compared with 4/5 and 1/5 placebo patients, respectively.

Conclusion

Etrolizumab is well tolerated in moderate to severe UC. Further investigation is warranted.

### Validation of a clinical prediction rule to distinguish Lyme meningitis from aseptic meningitis [^52e62b75]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Rule of 7's for Lyme meningitis" for Lyme disease.

The Rule of 7's for Lyme Meningitis is a clinical calculator used in the diagnosis and management of Lyme disease, specifically in patients suspected of having Lyme meningitis. This scoring system applies to patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of meningitis, particularly in areas where Lyme disease is endemic.

The Rule of 7's helps clinicians differentiate Lyme meningitis from other causes of aseptic meningitis. It is based on the observation that in Lyme meningitis, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lymphocytic pleocytosis is typically less than 300 cells/mm3, the CSF protein is less than 100 mg/dL, and the duration of symptoms before presentation is usually more than a week.

The clinical utility of this calculator is to aid in the diagnosis of Lyme meningitis, thereby guiding appropriate treatment and potentially avoiding unnecessary investigations or treatments for other causes of meningitis.

Exclusion criteria for the use of this calculator would include patients with symptoms not suggestive of meningitis, patients with a clear alternative diagnosis, or patients in areas where Lyme disease is not prevalent.

The Rule of 7's for Lyme meningitis is a diagnostic calculator that uses three specific clinical inputs to assess the risk of Lyme meningitis. These inputs include the number of days a patient has experienced headache, the percentage of mononuclear cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and whether the patient has 7th or another cranial nerve palsy. Each of these inputs is assigned a numerical score based on specific criteria, and the sum of these scores is used for the final interpretation.

The scoring system is as follows:

- For "Number of days of headache", if it is " < 7", the score is 0; if it is " ≥ 7", the score is 1.
- For "CSF mononuclear cells", if it is " < 70%", the score is 0; if it is " ≥ 70%", the score is 1.
- For "7th or another cranial nerve palsy", if the answer is "Yes", the score is 1; if "No", the score is 0.

The total score is calculated by summing the scores from each of the three categories, resulting in a value between 0 and 3. The interpretation of the score is straightforward:

- A total score of 0 indicates that the risk of Lyme meningitis is low.
- A total score of 1 or above indicates that the risk of Lyme meningitis is high.

### Let-7 restrains an epigenetic circuit in AT2 cells to prevent fibrogenic intermediates in pulmonary fibrosis [^83b09dc2]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Our genetic studies to reduce let-7 activity in AT2 cells relied primarily on phenotypic studies of let-7afd but did not provide a mechanistic perspective on the contribution of let-7bc2 and we did not examine the role of other clusters in AT2 cells. Another limitation of our study is that although we demonstrated dynamic changes in AT2 cells upon loss of let-7afd by integrated approaches, we did not achieve transcriptomic and epigenomic depth at a single cell resolution which would have allowed more insight on the role of let-7 on AT2 cell plasticity and alveolar cell niche.

In conclusion, our study provides insights into let-7 as a braking mechanism to oncogene dysregulation in AT2 cell-driven pulmonary fibrosis. Our observation that AB cells from IPF patients express higher levels of the let-7 targetome offers the enticing possibility that targeted delivery of let-7 could be used as a treatment. We point that several reports indicate the effectiveness of targeted let-7 delivery in mitigating fibrosis, and pharmacologic targeting of EZH2 is employed against both cancer and fibrosis.

### Diabetes technology: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^d42bf658]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) accuracy — sensor-interfering substances and actions are described, noting that "Sensor interference due to several medications/substances is a known potential source of CGM sensor measurement errors (Table 7.4)". Hydroxyurea is cited as "one of the most recently identified interfering substances that cause a temporary increase in sensor glucose values discrepant from actual glucose values", and "substances such as mannitol and sorbitol, when administered intravenously or as a component of peritoneal dialysis solution, can cause inaccurate sensor readings of sensor glucose". The guidance states that "it is crucial to routinely review the medications and supplements used by the person with diabetes to identify possible interfering substances and advise them accordingly on the need to use additional BGM if sensor values are unreliable due to these substances". Table 7.4 specifies examples and affected systems, including acetaminophen " > 4 g/day" for Dexcom G6 and Dexcom G7 with "Higher sensor readings than actual glucose", acetaminophen "Any dose" for Medtronic Guardian with "Higher sensor readings than actual glucose", ascorbic acid (vitamin C) " > 500 mg/day" for FreeStyle Libre 14 day, FreeStyle Libre 2, and FreeStyle Libre 3 with "Higher sensor readings than actual glucose", ascorbic acid (vitamin C) " > 1,000 mg/day" for FreeStyle Libre 2 Plus and FreeStyle Libre 3 Plus with "Higher sensor readings than actual glucose", hydroxyurea for Dexcom G6, Dexcom G7, and Medtronic Guardian with "Higher sensor readings than actual glucose", and mannitol or sorbitol (intravenously or as peritoneal dialysis solution) for Senseonics Eversense with "Higher sensor readings than actual glucose".

### Promoting the therapeutic potential of interleukin-7 (IL-7) by expression in viral vectors [^7cf3f540]. Cancer Gene Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Viral expression of IL-7 induces tumor-specific immunity and improves the efficacy of autologous vaccine

Zhao et al. developed a non-replicative IL-7-expressing NDV by inserting the IL-7 transgene into the genome of the LX strain, a non-lytic NDV. The modified virus was designated as LX/IL-7. Subsequently, they developed an LX/IL-7-based autologous tumor vaccine by loading irradiated B16-F10 murine melanoma or EL-4 murine lymphoma cells with LX/IL-7 (i.e. B16-LX/IL-7 or EL4-LX/IL7) and tested its antitumor efficacy, prophylactically and therapeutically.

Prophylactically, subcutaneous immunization with B16-LX/IL-7 significantly inhibited homologous B16-F10 tumor growth compared to vaccination with irradiated B16-F10 cells loaded with LX strain expressing a red fluorescent protein (RFP) (i.e. B16-LX/RFP), highlighting the antitumor role of IL-7 expression. This finding was also similarly reproduced in the EL-4 model. The co-culture of splenocytes with B16 cell lysate demonstrated significantly more IFN-γ-expressing CD8 +, not CD4 +, T cells in the B16-LX/IL-7 group compared to controls. This IFN-γ response was tumor-specific, as splenocytes harvested from B16-LX/IL-7-treated mice efficiently killed B16-F10 cells but not antigenically unrelated EL-4 cells. The tumor specificity of the B16-LX/IL-7 vaccine was further confirmed in vivo, where the B16-LX/IL-7 vaccine controlled B16-F10 tumor growth but failed to inhibit EL-4 lymphoma tumors (Fig. 3; Table 1).

### Ziprasidone hcl (ziprasidone hydrochloride) [^1d78075c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.4 Pharmacokinetic Interactions

Carbamazepine

Carbamazepine is an inducer of CYP3A4; administration of 200 mg twice daily for 21 days resulted in a decrease of approximately 35% in the AUC of ziprasidone. This effect may be greater when higher doses of carbamazepine are administered.

Ketoconazole

Ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, at a dose of 400 mg QD for 5 days, increased the AUC and Cmaxof ziprasidone by about 35 to 40%. Other inhibitors of CYP3A4 would be expected to have similar effects.

Cimetidine

Cimetidine at a dose of 800 mg QD for 2 days did not affect ziprasidone pharmacokinetics.

Antacid

The co-administration of 30 mL of Maalox®with ziprasidone did not affect the pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone.

7.5 Lithium

Ziprasidone at a dose of 40 mg twice daily administered concomitantly with lithium at a dose of 450 mg twice daily for 7 days did not affect the steady-state level or renal clearance of lithium. Ziprasidone dosed adjunctively to lithium in a maintenance trial of bipolar patients did not affect mean therapeutic lithium levels.

7.6 Oral Contraceptives

In vivo studies have revealed no effect of ziprasidone on the pharmacokinetics of estrogen or progesterone components. Ziprasidone at a dose of 20 mg twice daily did not affect the pharmacokinetics of concomitantly administered oral contraceptives, ethinyl estradiol (0.03 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.15 mg).

7.7 Dextromethorphan

Consistent with in vitro results, a study in normal healthy volunteers showed that ziprasidone did not alter the metabolism of dextromethorphan, a CYP2D6 model substrate, to its major metabolite, dextrorphan. There was no statistically significant change in the urinary dextromethorphan/dextrorphan ratio.

7.8 Valproate

A pharmacokinetic interaction of ziprasidone with valproate is unlikely due to the lack of common metabolic pathways for the two drugs. Ziprasidone dosed adjunctively to valproate in a maintenance trial of bipolar patients did not affect mean therapeutic valproate levels.

7.9 Other Concomitant Drug Therapy

Population pharmacokinetic analysis of schizophrenic patients enrolled in controlled clinical trials has not revealed evidence of any clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions with benztropine, propranolol, or lorazepam.

### Continuous glucose monitoring initiation within first year of type 1 diabetes diagnosis is associated with improved glycemic outcomes: 7-year follow-up study [^97302b84]. Diabetes Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate long-term glycemic outcomes of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) initiation within the first year of type 1 diabetes diagnosis.

Research Design and Methods

Patients with type 1 diabetes (N = 396) were divided into three groups: 1) CGM (CGM use within 1 year of diabetes diagnosis and continued through the study), 2) no-CGM (no CGM use throughout the study), and 3) new-CGM (CGM use after 3 years since diabetes diagnosis). Patients were followed up to 7 years.

Results

A1c was significantly lower in the CGM compared with the no-CGM group throughout 7 years of follow-up (least squares mean A1c values: 6 months, 7.3% vs. 8.1%; 1 year, 7.4% vs. 8.6%; 2 years, 7.7% vs. 9.1%; 3 years, 7.6% vs. 9.3%; 4 years, 7.4% vs. 9.6%; 5 years, 7.6% vs. 9.7%; 6 years, 7.5% vs. 10.0%; and 7 years, 7.6% vs. 9.8%; for all, P < 0.001) adjusting for age at diagnosis, sex, and insulin delivery method.

Conclusions

CGM initiation within first year of type 1 diabetes diagnosis results in long-term improvement in A1c.

In the overall population, the percentages (95% CI) are 33.4 (31.2–35.5), 21.0 (19.4–22.7), 12.7 (11.4–14.0), 7.4 (6.5–8.3), 8.9 (8.1–9.6), 6.3 (5.6–7.1), and 10.2 (9.5–11.0), with corresponding n of 33 534 000, 21 151 000, 12 766 000, 7 470 000, 8 940 000, 6 380 000, and 10 300 000. Among men, the percentages (95% CI) are 17.4 (15.2–19.7), 22.7 (20.3–25.1), 15.6 (13.8–17.4), 10.1 (8.5–11.6), 12.1 (10.7–13.5), 8.8 (7.4–10.2), and 13.3 (12.1–14.4), with n of 8 386 000, 10 950 000, 7 511 000, 4 847 000, 5 849 000, 4 248 000, and 6 388 000. Among women, the percentages (95% CI) are 48.0 (44.8–51.3), 19.5 (17.3–21.6), 10.0 (8.3–11.8), 5.0 (3.8–6.2), 5.9 (5.1–6.7), 4.1 (3.4–4.7), and 7.5 (6.5–8.4), with n of 25 148 000, 10 200 000, 5 256 000, 2 622 000, 3 091 000, 2 131 000, and 3 912 000. These estimates were derived by applying the Pooled Cohort Equations to NHANES 2007–2010 with N = 5367 and weighting to 100 542 000 US population.

### Diabetes technology: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^2e886ded]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Glucose meter inaccuracy and interfering substances — health care professionals and people with diabetes should be aware of factors that might impair meter accuracy; a meter reading that seems inconsistent with the clinical picture needs to be retested or verified in a laboratory; in intensive care and other critical illness settings, capillary sampling is less reliable and laboratory-based values may be preferred if there is any doubt; and some meters give error messages if meter readings are likely to be false. Oxygen affects device chemistry: glucose oxidase monitors are sensitive to oxygen and should only be used with capillary blood in people with normal oxygen saturation; higher oxygen tensions may result in false low-glucose readings and low oxygen tensions may lead to falsely elevated glucose readings, while glucose dehydrogenase–based monitors are generally not sensitive to oxygen. Because the enzymatic reaction is temperature sensitive, all monitors have an acceptable temperature range; most will show an error if the temperature is unacceptable, but a few will provide a reading with a message that the value may be incorrect, and humidity and altitude may also alter glucose readings. Several physiologic and pharmacologic factors interfere with glucose readings with personal and professional blood glucose meters in inpatient settings, and they are listed in Table 7.2.

### Standard chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab for women with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer (ICON7): overall survival results of a phase 3 randomised trial [^1ba068b1]. The Lancet: Oncology (2015). Medium credibility.

The study ICON7 was published by Amit M Oza and colleagues in 2015 in the journal Lancet Oncol. This study is related to the following diseases: Ovarian cancer. In the ICON7 study, the trial question was: what is the role of bevacizumab added to platinum-based chemotherapy in women with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer? In the ICON7 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the ICON7 study, the population was: 1528 female patients. The inclusion criteria were adult women with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer that was either high-risk early-stage disease or more advanced disease. The key exclusion criteria were other tumor types; previous systemic therapy; planned surgery; uncontrolled hypertension. In the ICON7 study, the interventions were: n = 764 bevacizumab (intravenous bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg body weight every 3 weeks plus intravenous carboplatin and paclitaxel 175 mg/m² of body surface area) n = 764 standard chemotherapy (six 3-weekly cycles of intravenous carboplatin and paclitaxel 175 mg/m² of body surface area). In the ICON7 study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in mean overall survival in all patients (45.5 months vs. 44.6 months; HR 0.99, 99% CI 0.85 to 1.14). In the ICON7 study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in mean progression-free survival in all patients (29.2 months vs. 27.7 months; HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.05) Significant increase in mean overall survival in high-risk patients (39.3 months vs. 34.5 months; HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.59) Significant increase in mean progression-free survival in high-risk patients (20 months vs. 15.9 months; HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.64). In the ICON7 study, the conclusion was: in adult women with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer that was either high-risk early-stage disease or more advanced disease, bevacizumab was not superior to standard chemotherapy with respect to mean overall survival in all patients.

### Digital measurement of SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk from 7 million contacts [^59b49ffd]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

How likely is it to become infected by SARS-CoV-2 after being exposed? Almost everyone wondered about this question during the COVID-19 pandemic. Contact-tracing apps 1,2 recorded measurements of proximity 3 and duration between nearby smartphones. Contacts-individuals exposed to confirmed cases-were notified according to public health policies such as the 2m, 15min guideline 4,5, despite limited evidence supporting this threshold. Here we analysed 7million contacts notified by the National Health Service COVID-19 app 6,7 in England and Wales to infer how app measurements translated to actual transmissions. Empirical metrics and statistical modelling showed a strong relation between app-computed risk scores and actual transmission probability. Longer exposures at greater distances had risk similar to that of shorter exposures at closer distances. The probability of transmission confirmed by a reported positive test increased initially linearly with duration of exposure (1.1% per hour) and continued increasing over several days. Whereas most exposures were short (median 0.7h, interquartile range 0.4–1.6), transmissions typically resulted from exposures lasting between 1h and several days (median 6h, interquartile range 1.4–28). Households accounted for about 6% of contacts but 40% of transmissions. With sufficient preparation, privacy-preserving yet precise analyses of risk that would inform public health measures, based on digital contact tracing, could be performed within weeks of the emergence of a new pathogen.

### Burden on hydropower units for short-term balancing of renewable power systems [^4f6cb569]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

In this section, we apply deteriorated frequency sequences (mainly caused by the net load variability, the inertial, and the damping) as simulation model inputs (Supplementary Note 10 including Supplementary Table 8 and Supplementary Fig. 23) to study the influence of future VRE scenarios on regulation burden and compensation for individual hydropower units in the timescale of seconds. Relative values of the burden and the payments under different scenarios are shown in Fig. 7, and detailed results are presented in Supplementary Table 9 and Supplementary Table 10, respectively.

Fig. 7
Relative values of the burden and the payments under different scenarios. The results for HPP 1 under Ep1 and S1 are selected and shown. The distance and the amount refer to the corresponding values for RB movements

In terms of the burden, wear and fatigue aspect indicated by the distance and the amount of GV and RB movements are significantly aggravated under the future scenarios. More exactly, the amount of RB movements under Scenario 5 (with the worst frequency quality) and strategy S1 is more than twice of the value under Scenario 1 for the current condition; while this can be well resolved by applying strategy S2 (Supplementary Table 9). Meanwhile, Scenario 4–5 show that the increased net load standard deviation leads to more efficiency loss, however the influence from the inertia and the damping of the system on the efficiency loss is less than 5%, because the frequency sequences of Scenarios 2–3 mainly increase the denseness of the turbine operation trajectory rather than expand it the into low efficiency areas.

As to the payment, first, strength payment inherently does not change under different frequency sequences, revealing a key drawback of it. Second, mileage payment well captures the growth trend of the burden due to its good agreement with the movements of turbine actuators. Third, contribution payment to some extent responds to the different scenarios, especially under the high static gain (Ep3) and S1.

### IL-7 drives Th1 and Th17 cytokine production in patients with primary SS despite an increase in CD4 T cells lacking the IL-7R α [^9bfe6c24]. Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the phenotypic characteristics of and the balance between systemic IL-7 receptor (IL-7R)α+ and IL-7Rα- Tregs in primary SS (pSS) patients as compared with control subjects and to assess the functional consequences this has for (IL-7-induced) T-cell activation.

Methods

The functional properties of IL-7Rα+ and IL-7Rα- (CD25+) CD4 T cells from pSS patients were tested in vitro. Expression of CD25 and FoxP3 by IL-7Rα+ and IL-7Rα- CD4 T cells from pSS patients and healthy controls (HCs) were assessed. Also, the net ex vivo T-cell cytokine production and the capacity of IL-7 to activate total CD4 T cells from pSS patients compared with HCs in vitro was tested.

Results

IL-7Rα+ T cells from pSS patients strongly proliferated and their numbers were slightly reduced compared with HCs. This reduced number was caused by an increase in both anergic and suppressive IL-7Rα- CD25+ T cells expressing high levels of FoxP3, but also by increases in IL-7Rα- CD25- CD4 T cells that only moderately expressed FoxP3. This altered balance in IL-7Rα+ and IL-7Rα- CD4 T cells was accompanied by unchanged ex vivo Th1, Th2 and Th17 cytokine production of total CD4 T cells. Furthermore, the increased numbers of IL-7Rα- CD25+ T cells did not prevent specific IL-7-induced Th1 and Th17 cytokine production by IL-7Rα+ T cells.

Conclusion

IL-7Rα+ cells are highly proliferating cells that respond strongly to IL-7 despite an increased number of IL-7Rα- T cells that express FoxP3 and CD25. The recent finding that IL-7 and IL-7Rα+ T cells were both found to be increased in exocrine glands of pSS patients indicates that IL-7 could contribute to glandular inflammation by activation of IL-7Rα+ responder T cells despite the increased numbers of Tregs.

### Detecting and phasing minor single-nucleotide variants from long-read sequencing data [^cdffe445]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The probability that the greedy algorithm correctly estimates H (x k) is

According to inequation (7), assuming t l ≥ 2000, t r ≥ 2000, and p = 1, which is a typical setting for long-read sequencing data, the probability that the greedy algorithm correctly estimates H (x k) is less than 3.5 × 10 −18 even if ρ 0 = 0.99. The key factor leading to the failure of the greedy algorithm is selecting from too many loci (t l + t r loci). We propose an algorithm called RSM to reduce the number of loci to be considered in the next section.

### CONSORT 2010 explanation and elaboration: updated guidelines for reporting parallel group randomised trials [^6435bfe1]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Many methods of sequence generation are adequate. However, readers cannot judge adequacy from such terms as "random allocation", "randomisation", or "random" without further elaboration. Authors should specify the method of sequence generation, such as a random-number table or a computerised random number generator. The sequence may be generated by the process of minimisation, a non-random but generally acceptable method (see box 2).

In some trials, participants are intentionally allocated in unequal numbers to each intervention: for example, to gain more experience with a new procedure or to limit costs of the trial. In such cases, authors should report the randomisation ratio (for example, 2:1 or two treatment participants per each control participant) (see item 3a).

In a representative sample of PubMed indexed trials in 2000, only 21% reported an adequate approach to random sequence generation; this increased to 34% for a similar cohort of PubMed indexed trials in 2006. In more than 90% of these cases, researchers used a random number generator on a computer or a random number table.

Item 8b. Type of randomisation; details of any restriction (such as blocking and block size)

Examples — "Randomization sequence was created using Stata 9.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) statistical software and was stratified by center with a 1:1 allocation using random block sizes of 2, 4, and 6".

"Participants were randomly assigned following simple randomization procedures (computerized random numbers) to 1 of 2 treatment groups".

Explanation — In trials of several hundred participants or more simple randomisation can usually be trusted to generate similar numbers in the two trial groupsand to generate groups that are roughly comparable in terms of known and unknown prognostic variables. For smaller trials (see item 7a) — and even for trials that are not intended to be small, as they may stop before reaching their target size — some restricted randomisation (procedures to help achieve balance between groups in size or characteristics) may be useful (see box 2).

### Moderately early (7–14 days) postnatal corticosteroids for preventing chronic lung disease in preterm infants [^5e52715c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Corticosteroids have been used late in the neonatal period to treat chronic lung disease (CLD) in preterm babies, and early to try to prevent it. CLD is likely to be the result of persisting inflammation in the lung and the use of powerful anti-inflammatory drugs like dexamethasone has some rationale. Early use tends to be associated with increased adverse effects so that studies of moderately early treatment (7–14 days postnatal) might have the dual benefits of fewer side effects and onset of action before chronic inflammation is established.

Objectives

To determine if moderately early (7–14 days) postnatal corticosteroid treatment vs control (placebo or nothing) is of benefit in the prevention and/or treatment of early chronic lung disease in the preterm infant.

Search Strategy

Randomised controlled trials of postnatal corticosteroid therapy were sought from the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, Cochrane Database of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE (1966 - October 2002), hand searching paediatric and perinatal journals, examining previous review articles and information received from practicing neonatologists. Authors of all studies were contacted, where possible, to confirm details of reported follow-up studies, or to obtain any information about long-term follow-up where none had been reported.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of postnatal corticosteroid treatment from 7–14 days of birth in high risk preterm infants were selected for this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data regarding clinical outcomes including mortality, CLD (including late rescue with corticosteroids, or need for home oxygen therapy), death or CLD, failure to extubate, complications during the primary hospitalisation (including infection, hyperglycaemia, hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, pneumothorax, severe intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), gastrointestinal bleeding, and severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)), and long term outcome (including blindness, deafness, cerebral palsy and major neurosensory disability), were abstracted and analysed using RevMan 4.1.

Main Results

Seven studies enrolling a total of 669 participants were eligible for inclusion in this review. Moderately early steroid treatment (vs placebo or nothing) reduced mortality by 28 days, chronic lung disease at 28 days and 36 weeks, and death or chronic lung disease at 28 days or 36 weeks. Earlier extubation was facilitated. There was no significant effect on the rates of pneumothorax, severe ROP, or NEC. Adverse effects included hypertension, hyperglycaemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and infection. Steroid-treated infants were less likely to need late rescue with dexamethasone. There were limited data from four studies of long term follow-up; these did not show evidence of an increase in adverse neurological outcomes.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Moderately early corticosteroid therapy (started at 7–14 days) reduces neonatal mortality and CLD, but at the cost of important short term adverse effects. Limited evidence concerning long term effects is provided by the trials included in this review. The methodological quality of the studies determining the long-term outcome is limited in some cases, the children have been assessed predominantly before school age, and no study has been sufficiently powered to detect important adverse long-term neurosensory outcomes. Therefore, given the risk:benefit ratio of short-term effects and the limited long-term follow-up data, it seems appropriate to reserve moderately early corticosteroid treatment to infants who cannot be weaned from mechanical ventilation and to minimise the dose and duration of any course of therapy. More research is urgently needed, including long term follow-up of survivors included in previous and any future trials, before the benefits and risks of postnatal steroid treatment, including initiation at 7–14 days, can be reliably assessed (See DART study; Doyle 2000a).

### Tenecteplase (Tnkase) [^b7d5f2ee]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8	USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

8.1	Pregnancy

Risk Summary

There are risks to the mother and fetus from acute ST elevation myocardial infarction, which is a medical emergency in pregnancy and can be fatal if left untreated (see Clinical Considerations). Published data consisting of a small number of case reports involving the use of related thrombolytic agents in pregnant women have not identified an increased risk of major birth defects. There are no data on the use of tenecteplase during pregnancy to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.

TNKase does not elicit maternal and direct embryo toxicity in rabbits following a single IV administration. In developmental toxicity studies conducted in rabbits, the no observable effect level (NOEL) of a single IV administration of TNKase on maternal or developmental toxicity (5 mg/kg) was approximately 7 times human exposure (based on AUC) at the dose for STEMI.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk

Myocardial infarction is a medical emergency which can be fatal if left untreated. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld because of potential concerns regarding the effects of tenecteplase on the fetus.

8.2	Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence of tenecteplase in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effect on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for TNKase and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the TNKase or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4	Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of TNKase in pediatric patients have not been established.

8.5	Geriatric Use

In the ASSENT-2 study, 41% (3500/8458) of patients who were treated with TNKase were aged 65 years or older. In this population, rates of 30-day mortality, stroke, intracranial hemorrhage and major bleeds requiring blood transfusion or leading to hemodynamic complications were higher than in those aged less than 65 years.

### Disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) L100P mutants have impaired activity-dependent plasticity in vivo and in vitro [^7c9d5dc4]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

L100P mutants have altered expression of cellular and synaptic markers during development

In an attempt to clarify the developmental expression of synaptic markers in vivo, we performed protein expression analysis in brain extracts from WT and L100P mice at different ages: synaptic formation (P8–10), synaptic pruning (P30–40), and adulthood (above P60). For the analysis of synaptic proteins, we isolated synaptoneurosomes from total brain extracts and we measured the expression of presynaptic (SYN) and postsynaptic (PSD95) markers. We find that the expression of SYN in WT versus L100P mutants has a trend which is dependent on the developmental stage: the expression at P8–10 SYN levels in mutants was more than twofold higher than in age-matched controls (Supplementary Figure 7; P8–10 WT = 1 ± 0.095, L100P = 1.4 ± 0.13, N = 12 animals, P -value = 0.01), while at P30–40 the mutants show 35% reduction in SYN levels (P30 WT = 1 ± 0.1, L100P = 0.62 ± 0.2, N = 12 animals, P -value = 0.4) and more than 40% reduction in adulthood (P60 WT = 1 ± 0.03, L100P = 0.58 ± 0.08, N = 12 animals, P -value = 0.01). The expression of PSD95 follows a different developmental trend: at P8–10, there are no significant differences in the expression of PSD95 in WT and mutants (although there is a 20% increase in mutants versus WT: P30 WT = 1 ± 0.9, L100P = 1.2 ± 0.1, N = 9 animals, P -value = 0.4). Expression of PSD95 is significantly reduced in mutants versus WT at P30–40 (WT = 1 ± 0.06, L100P = 0.7 ± 0.7, N = 9 animals, P -value = 0.01) while P60 brains express comparable levels of the protein (WT = 1 ± 0.12, L100P = 0.96 ± 0.11, N = 12 animals; Supplementary Figure 7).

### SCORTEN: a severity-of-illness score for toxic epidermal necrolysis [^674b76c4]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2000). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Severity of Illness Score for Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (SCORTEN score)" for Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

The SCORTEN score, also known as the Severity of Illness Score for Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, is a clinical tool used to predict mortality in patients diagnosed with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN). These are severe skin reactions, often to medication, that can be life-threatening.

The SCORTEN score is calculated based on seven clinical and laboratory parameters, each contributing one point to the total score. These parameters include age, malignancy, heart rate, initial body surface area of epidermal detachment, serum urea, serum glucose, and bicarbonate levels.

The higher the SCORTEN score, the higher the predicted mortality rate. This score is particularly useful in the early stages of disease to guide treatment decisions and inform discussions about prognosis with patients and their families.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the SCORTEN score, but it should be noted that it is most accurate when applied within the first 24–48 hours of hospital admission for SJS/TEN. It may not be as accurate in predicting outcomes for patients with less severe forms of the disease or for those with other severe concurrent illnesses.

The Severity of Illness Score for Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (SCORTEN score) calculator assesses the risk of mortality in patients by evaluating seven clinical parameters, each represented by a boolean input. Each true parameter contributes 1 point to the total score. The inputs assessed are:

- Age > 40 years
- Presence of malignancy
- Tachycardia > 120/min
- > 10% initial epidermal detachment
- Serum urea > 10 mmol/L
- Serum glucose > 14 mmol/L
- Serum bicarbonate < 20 mmol/L

The calculator sums the points for true conditions to yield a total score between 0 and 7. The interpretation of the score relates to the risk of mortality, with different scores indicating the following risks:

| **Score** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|
| 0 | Risk of mortality not precisely defined |
| 1 | Risk of mortality is 3.88% |
| 2 | Risk of mortality is 12.20% |
| 3 | Risk of mortality is 32.37% |
| 4 | Risk of mortality is 62.25% |
| 5 | Risk of mortality is 85.03% |
| 6 | Risk of mortality is 95.14% |
| 7 | Risk of mortality is 98.54% |

### Cedazuridine and decitabine (Inqovi) [^f25ec889]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Among the 41 patients who were dependent on red blood cell (RBC) and/or platelet transfusions at baseline, 20 (49%) became independent of RBC and platelet transfusions during any consecutive 56-day post-baseline period. Of the 39 patients who were independent of both RBC and platelet transfusions at baseline, 25 (64%) remained transfusion-independent during any consecutive 56-day post-baseline period.

Study ASTX727-02

INQOVI was evaluated in ASTX727-02, an open-label, randomized, 2-cycle, 2-sequence crossover study (NCT03306264) that included 133 adult patients with MDS or CMML, including all French-American-British (FAB) classification criteria and IPSS Intermediate-1, Intermediate-2, or high-risk prognostic scores. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive INQOVI (35 mg decitabine and 100 mg cedazuridine) orally in Cycle 1 and decitabine 20 mg/m2intravenously in Cycle 2 or the reverse sequence. Both INQOVI and intravenous decitabine were administered once daily on Days 1 through 5 of the 28-day cycle. Starting with Cycle 3, all patients received INQOVI orally once daily on Days 1 through 5 of each 28-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. No stratification was performed. Twenty-seven (20%) of the 133 patients went on to stem cell transplantation following INQOVI treatment.

The baseline demographic and disease characteristics are shown in Table 7.

The primary outcome measure was comparison of the 5-day cumulative decitabine AUC between INQOVI and intravenous decitabine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Efficacy was established on the basis of complete response (CR) and the rate of conversion from transfusion dependence to transfusion independence. Efficacy results are shown in Table 8. The median follow-up time was 12.6 months (range: 9.3 to 20.5) and median treatment duration was 8.2 months (range 0.2 to 19.7).

Among the 57 patients who were dependent on RBC and/or platelet transfusions at baseline, 30 (53%) became independent of RBC and platelet transfusions during any 56-day post-baseline period. Of the 76 patients who were independent of both RBC and platelet transfusions at baseline, 48 (63%) remained transfusion-independent during any 56-day post-baseline period.

### The influence of SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2 on a different clinical course and severity of COVID-19 in children hospitalized in 2021 compared with 2020 [^bfdd5e0a]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

This study aimed to analyze the differences in the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children hospitalized in 2021, when the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variants B.1.1.7 (alpha) and B.1.617.2 (delta) dominated, compared with 2020.

Methods

In this multicenter study based on the pediatric part of the national SARSTer register (SARSTer-PED), we included 2771 children (0–18 years) with COVID-19 diagnosed between March 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021, from 14 Polish inpatient centers. An electronic questionnaire, which addressed epidemiologic and clinical data, was used.

Results

Children hospitalized in 2021 were younger compared with those reported in 2020 (mean 4.1 vs. 6.8 years, P = 0.01). Underlying comorbidities were reported in 22% of the patients. The clinical course was usually mild (70%). A significant difference in the clinical course assessment between 2020 and 2021 was found, with more asymptomatic patients in 2020 and more severely ill children in 2021. In total, 5% of patients were severely or critically ill, including < 3% of the participants in 2020 and 7% in 2021. The calculated mortality rate was 0.1% in general and 0.2% in 2021.

Conclusion

Infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variants alpha and delta lead to a more severe course of COVID-19 with more pronounced clinical presentation and higher fatality rates than infection with an original strain. Most of the children requiring hospitalization due to COVID-19 do not have underlying comorbidities.

### Phase 3 trial of concizumab in hemophilia with inhibitors [^cb0a0b84]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study explorer7 was published by Tadashi Matsushita and colleagues in 2023 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Hemophilia A and Hemophilia B. In the explorer7 study, the trial question was: what is the role of concizumab prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors? In the explorer7 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the explorer7 study, the population was: 52 male patients. The inclusion criteria were patients aged ≥ 12 years with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors. The key exclusion criteria were hypersensitivity to the trial drug; known inherited or acquired coagulation disorder other than congenital hemophilia; ongoing/planned immune tolerance induction treatment; history of thromboembolic disease. In the explorer7 study, the interventions were: n = 33 concizumab prophylaxis (loading dose of 1.0 mg/kg of body weight, followed by 0.2 mg/kg/day for at least 32 weeks) n = 19 no prophylaxis (no injection for at least 24 weeks). In the explorer7 study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in treated spontaneous and traumatic bleeding episodes (1.7 episodes vs. 11.8 episodes; RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.29). In the explorer7 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in spontaneous bleeding episodes (1.3 episodes vs. 9.4 episodes; RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.3) Significant decrease in joint bleeding episodes (1.4 episodes vs. 9.1 episodes; RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.32) Significant decrease in all treated and untreated bleeding episodes (4.4 episodes vs. 13.3 episodes; RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.64). In the explorer7 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. In the explorer7 study, the conclusion was: in patients aged ≥ 12 years with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors, concizumab prophylaxis were superior to no prophylaxis with respect to treated spontaneous and traumatic bleeding episodes.

### Coagulation factor viia recombinant human (sevenfact) [^f411a287]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of SEVENFACT have been established for pediatric patients ≥ 12 years of age for the treatment and control of bleeding episodes. Limited clinical data for SEVENFACT in adolescents (≥ 12 to < 18 years) were collected in an adult and adolescent study (Study 1). A total of 5 subjects were dosed with SEVENFACT. These 5 subjects were treated for a total of 79 bleeding episodes (all mild or moderate) that occurred while subjects were still under 18 years of age. Hemostatic efficacy in this subgroup (n = 5) was comparable to efficacy observed in the overall population [See Clinical Studies (14)].

The safety and effectiveness of SEVENFACT for the treatment and control of bleeding episodes have not been established in children < 12 years of age. Effectiveness was not demonstrated in a trial of 25 pediatric patients 6 months to < 12 years of age. The safety and effectiveness of SEVENFACT in infants less than 6 months of age have not been evaluated.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of SEVENFACT in patients > 65 years of age have not been evaluated in clinical trials. The presence of age-related comorbidities and the attendant risks associated with thrombotic and thromboembolic events should be considered when administering SEVENFACT to patients older than 50 years of age.

### Ultra-high-field 7 T magnetic resonance imaging including dynamic and static contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging improves detection of secreting pituitary microadenomas [^3e89a783]. Investigative Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

A prospective preoperative evaluation of 7 T ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with suspected pituitary microadenomas for both adenoma detection and intrasellar localization compared with 3 T MRI was carried out.

Materials and Methods

Patients underwent prospective preoperative standardized 3 and 7 T MRI. A distinct qualitative (lesion detection, intrasellar lesion location) and quantitative (lesion diameters, T1/T2 signal intensity ratio of the lesion to normal pituitary gland tissue) analysis was performed, along with an evaluation of image quality (IQ) regarding overall IQ, anatomical parameters, and artifacts; the findings of the qualitative analysis were compared with intraoperative findings and endocrinological outcomes.

Results

Sixteen patients (mean age, 43 ± 16 years; 13 women) with pituitary microadenomas were included. Using 7 T MRI allowed the detection of 15 microadenomas-3 more than 3 T MRI. In addition, 7 T MRI allowed more precise lesion localization with 93.75% (15/16) agreement with intraoperative findings, compared with 75% (12/16) agreement using 3 T MRI. Lesion diameters showed no significant difference between 3 and 7 T MRI. T1 and T2 signal intensity ratio between microadenomas and normal pituitary gland tissue were higher in 7 T MRI than in 3 T MRI. The overall IQ and the IQ of each anatomical parameter of 7 T MRI were rated higher than those of 3 T MRI. No significant differences in susceptibility or head motion artifacts were observed between 3 and 7 T MRI; however, 7 T MRI was more susceptible to pulsation artifacts.

Conclusion

Ultra-high-field MRI surpasses 3 T MRI in pituitary microadenoma detection and enables more precise delineation with higher correlation with intraoperative findings. Thus, 7 T sellar imaging is a promising option-especially in previously magnetic resonance-negative patients with endocrinologically confirmed hormone oversecretion-and helps reduce the need for invasive diagnostics.

14.2 Combination Treatment of PAH

In a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial (AMBITION), 605 patients with WHO Functional Class II or III PAH were randomized 2:1:1 to once daily Letairis plus tadalafil or to Letairis or tadalafil alone. Treatment was initiated with Letairis 5 mg and tadalafil 20 mg. If tolerated, tadalafil was increased to 40 mg at 4 weeks and Letairis was increased to 10 mg at 8 weeks.

The primary endpoint was time to first occurrence of (a) death, (b) hospitalization for worsening PAH, (c) > 15% decrease from baseline in 6MWD combined with WHO Functional Class III or IV symptoms sustained over 14 days (short term clinical worsening), or (d) reduction in 6MWD sustained over 14 days combined with WHO Functional Class III or IV symptoms sustained over 6 months (inadequate long term clinical response).

Patients had idiopathic PAH (55%), heritable PAH (3%), or PAH associated with connective tissue diseases, congenital heart disease, stable HIV infection, or drugs or toxins (APAH, 43%). Median time from diagnosis to first study drug administration was 25 days. Approximately 32% and 68% of patients were in WHO Functional Class II and III, respectively. The mean patient age was 55.7 years (34% were ≥ 65 years old). Most patients were white (90%) and female (76%); 45% were North American.

Principal results are shown in Figures 6 and 7.

### Antibiotic treatment for 7 versus 14 days in patients with bloodstream infections [^a910af91]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Bloodstream infections are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Early, appropriate antibiotic therapy is important, but the duration of treatment is uncertain.

Methods

In a multicenter, noninferiority trial, we randomly assigned hospitalized patients (including patients in the intensive care unit [ICU]) who had bloodstream infection to receive antibiotic treatment for 7 days or 14 days. Antibiotic selection, dosing, and route were at the discretion of the treating team. We excluded patients with severe immunosuppression, foci requiring prolonged treatment, single cultures with possible contaminants, or cultures yielding Staphylococcus aureus. The primary outcome was death from any cause by 90 days after diagnosis of the bloodstream infection, with a noninferiority margin of 4 percentage points.

Results

Across 74 hospitals in seven countries, 3608 patients underwent randomization and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis; 1814 patients were assigned to 7 days of antibiotic treatment, and 1794 to 14 days. At enrollment, 55.0% of patients were in the ICU and 45.0% were on hospital wards. Infections were acquired in the community (75.4%), hospital wards (13.4%) and ICUs (11.2%). Bacteremia most commonly originated from the urinary tract (42.2%), abdomen (18.8%), lung (13.0%), vascular catheters (6.3%), and skin or soft tissue (5.2%). By 90 days, 261 patients (14.5%) receiving antibiotics for 7 days had died and 286 patients (16.1%) receiving antibiotics for 14 days had died (difference, -1.6 percentage points [95.7% confidence interval {CI}, -4.0 to 0.8]), which showed the noninferiority of the shorter treatment duration. Patients were treated for longer than the assigned duration in 23.1% of the patients in the 7-day group and in 10.7% of the patients in the 14-day group. A per-protocol analysis also showed noninferiority (difference, -2.0 percentage points [95% CI, -4.5 to 0.6]). These findings were generally consistent across secondary clinical outcomes and across prespecified subgroups defined according to patient, pathogen, and syndrome characteristics.

Conclusions

Among hospitalized patients with bloodstream infection, antibiotic treatment for 7 days was noninferior to treatment for 14 days. (Funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and others; BALANCE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03005145.).

Cryo-EM resolves open gate conformation of the h 20S

Using this structure, we explored the potential mechanisms contributing to the opening of the h 20S gates. In other systems, the open gate conformation is regulated by a cluster of conserved N-terminal residues (αTyr8, αAsp9, αPro17, and αTyr26). Specifically, these residues are repositioned away from the central pore during gate opening and are anchored in that position by a characteristic set of intra- and intermolecular contacts. However, these residues are less conserved in humans, particularly in α1 and α2 (α-subunits are labeled to match the numbering used in yeast 20S), where the canonical αTyr8 and αAsp9 are replaced with α1 Phe9 and α2 Ser7, respectively. We wondered whether these differences might impact either the gating mechanism or the extent of opening. In the liganded α-ring of our structure, the N-termini of α5, α6, and α7 formed the expected, ordered clusters at the α-subunit interface, including a repositioned αPro17 within CH-π distance from αTyr26 and αTyr8, consistent with the fully open state. However, the equivalent residues in α1 and α2 formed clusters with fewer contacts likely resulting from displaced polar contacts in the noncanonical α1 Phe9 and α2 Ser7 residues, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 8a). In addition, the N-terminal residues were poorly resolved in α1 and α2 relative to N-termini from the ordered clusters. Interestingly, we noted that although subunits neighboring α1 and α2, namely α3 and α4, have canonical N-terminal sequences, these conserved residues formed limited contacts within clusters and/or had side chains that could not be structurally resolved. Furthermore, α2, α3, and α4, the subunits that primarily seal the pore's entrance of the closed gate apo h 20S, displayed disordered N-terminal extensions that seems to partially occlude the pore, unlike the ordered and fully displaced N-termini of reported open states (Supplementary Fig. 8b). Such conformations have uniquely been observed in human 26 S proteasome structures, however, it was not entirely clear if the 19S's C-termini were incapable of fully opening the gate. These observations support previous claimsand further demonstrate how noncanonical residues in the human α-subunits limit gate opening by displacing stabilizing interactions, which propagates disorder along the α-ring to, in turn, destabilize a fully opened gate state in the h 20S.

### Sequence of plasmodium falciparum chromosomes 2, 10, 11 and 14 [^9b461c90]. Nature (2002). Excellent credibility.

The mosquito-borne malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum kills an estimated 0.7–2.7 million people every year, primarily children in sub-Saharan Africa. Without effective interventions, a variety of factors-including the spread of parasites resistant to antimalarial drugs and the increasing insecticide resistance of mosquitoes-may cause the number of malaria cases to double over the next two decades. To stimulate basic research and facilitate the development of new drugs and vaccines, the genome of Plasmodium falciparum clone 3D7 has been sequenced using a chromosome-by-chromosome shotgun strategy. We report here the nucleotide sequences of chromosomes 10, 11 and 14, and a re-analysis of the chromosome 2 sequence. These chromosomes represent about 35% of the 23-megabase P. falciparum genome.

### Vancomycin hydrochloride (vancomycin hydrochloride for oral solution) [^cef61540]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

There are no available data on vancomycin hydrochloride use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. Available published data on vancomycin use in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters have not shown an association with adverse pregnancy-related outcomes (see Data). Vancomycin did not show adverse developmental effects when administered intravenously to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses less than or equal to the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area (see Data).

All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

Data

Human Data

A published study evaluated hearing loss and nephrotoxicity in infants of pregnant intravenous drug users treated with vancomycin for suspected or documented methicillin‑resistant S. aureus in the second or third trimester. The comparison groups were 10 non‑intravenous drug‑dependent patients who received no treatment, and 10 untreated intravenous drug‑dependent patients served as substance abuse controls. No infant in the vancomycin-exposed group had abnormal sensorineural hearing at 3 months of age or nephrotoxicity.

A published prospective study assessed outcomes in 55 pregnant women with a positive Group B Streptococcus culture and a high‑risk penicillin allergy with resistance to clindamycin or unknown sensitivity who were administered vancomycin at the time of delivery. Vancomycin dosing ranged from the standard 1 g intravenously every 12 hours to 20 mg/kg intravenous every 8 hours (maximum individual dose 2 g). No major adverse reactions were recorded either in the mothers or their newborns. None of the newborns had sensorineural hearing loss. Neonatal renal function was not examined, but all of the newborns were discharged in good condition.

Animal Data

Vancomycin did not cause fetal malformations when administered during organogenesis to pregnant rats (gestation days 6 to 15) and rabbits (gestation days 6 to 18) at the equivalent recommended maximum human dose (based on body surface area comparisons) of 200 mg/kg/day IV to rats or 120 mg/kg/day IV to rabbits. No effects on fetal weight or development were seen in rats at the highest dose tested or in rabbits given 80 mg/kg/day (approximately 1 and 0.8 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was observed in rats (at doses 120 mg/kg and above) and rabbits (at 80 mg/kg and above).

### Cystic fibrosis newborn screening: a systematic review-driven consensus guideline from the United States Cystic Fibrosis Foundation [^c2536890]. International Journal of Neonatal Screening (2025). High credibility.

Cystic fibrosis newborn screening — history and molecular methods integration: Newborn screening (NBS) for cystic fibrosis (CF) "became feasible in 1979 [1], measuring immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) using a dried blood spot specimen", and "Infants whose first IRT was out of range (elevated) had a second IRT measurement performed, termed an IRT-IRT protocol [2,3]". "In the early 1990s", identification of the CFTR gene and the common "c.1521_1523del (p. Phe508del; legacy: F508del or [delta]F508)" led some programs to replace the second IRT with molecular testing for F508del, "introducing the IRT-DNA protocol for CF NBS", which "allowed programs to lower the IRT cutoff" and yielded "higher sensitivity and faster identification of infants with CF". Over "the next 20 years", expanded multi-variant panels became "the preferred IRT-DNA strategy [7] in the US". The Clinical and Functional TRanslation of CFTR (CFTR2) project "began in 2012" with a public resource "(https://cftr2.org [accessed on 5 February 2025])" and "As of September 2024, 1167 CFTR variants had been interpreted by CFTR2, with 1085 deemed CF-causing". More recently, "next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been utilized" and "has recognized utility as part of CF NBS", with sequencing-based algorithms termed "IRT-DNA-SEQ (also referred to as IRT-DNA-EGA [extended gene analysis])", and "reporting software can be used to limit sequencing results to a customizable list of hundreds of variants" for programs continuing an IRT-DNA approach.

### Reporting of cluster randomised crossover trials: extension of the CONSORT 2010 statement with explanation and elaboration [^b4bbb83b]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Methods: Randomisation

Item 8a: Allocation schedule generation

Method used to generate the random allocation schedule.

Explanation

In a CRXO trial, clusters are randomly allocated to a sequence of treatments, where the sequence defines the order in which each cluster will receive the treatments. For example, a two treatment, two period design might have two sequences: treatment A followed by treatment B (sequence 1), and treatment B followed by treatment A (sequence 2). The allocation schedule dictates the random allocation of clusters to either sequence 1 or 2. Note that our use of the term "sequence" differs from its use in the CONSORT statementand the cluster CONSORT extension, where for these parallel group designs, "sequence" refers to the randomly generated list of allocations to a single treatment (eg, treatment A or treatment B). In this CRXO statement, the term "schedule" is instead used to refer to this randomly generated list of allocations to sequences of treatments (eg, AB, or BA; table 5 presents an example).

Table 5
Distinguishing use of terms "sequence" and "schedule" in relation to random allocation of units in parallel group randomised trials and cluster randomised crossover (CRXO) trials

The set of candidate sequences and the method used to generate the random allocation of clusters to these sequences should be sufficiently described so that an assessment can be made as to its adequacy. Use of general terms such as "random", "randomisation", and "random allocation" are insufficient. Details of the method are required (eg, random numbers generated by computer).

Example of item 8a

"Each hospital unit is randomised to perform medical reconciliation or usual care for the first 14-day period and is crossed over to the other group for a second 14-day period". (Figure 1 of Pourrat et al.)

"The randomisation sequence was generated. using a computerised process".

Item 8b: Randomisation method

Type of randomisation; details of any restricted randomisation, if used.

### Epiluminescence microscopy for the diagnosis of doubtful melanocytic skin lesions. comparison of the ABCD rule of dermatoscopy and a new 7-point checklist based on pattern analysis [^eec2e1af]. Archives of Dermatology (1998). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "7-point dermoscopy checklist for melanoma" for cutaneous melanoma.

The 7-point dermoscopy checklist for melanoma is a diagnostic probability tool designed to assess the likelihood of melanoma in patients presenting with suspicious skin lesions. This tool aids in the early detection of melanoma, thereby facilitating timely intervention and improving patient outcomes.

The checklist comprises seven key dermoscopic features, each assigned a specific point value. These features include an atypical pigment network, gray-blue areas, an atypical vascular pattern, radial streaming or streaks, irregular diffuse pigmentation or blotches, irregular dots and globules, and a regression pattern. The points for each feature are summed to yield a total score, which is then used to estimate the probability of melanoma.

A score of 4 or more suggests a high likelihood of melanoma, with a reported sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 78%. Conversely, a score of 3 or less indicates a low risk of melanoma. This scoring system thus provides a structured approach to the dermoscopic evaluation of skin lesions, enhancing the accuracy of melanoma diagnosis and reducing unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions.

The 7-point dermoscopy checklist offers a systematic way to evaluate the likelihood of melanoma by examining specific features of a skin lesion. By answering seven yes-or-no questions about distinct lesion characteristics, the checklist produces a score and interpretation that estimate melanoma risk.

The checklist assesses the following seven features:

- Atypical pigment network
- Gray-blue areas
- Atypical vascular pattern
- Radial streaming or streaks
- Irregular diffuse pigmentation or blotches
- Irregular dots and globules
- Regression pattern

Each detected feature contributes to a score based on its significance:

| **Feature** | **Score** |
|-|-|
| Atypical pigment network | 2 |
| Gray-blue areas | 2 |
| Atypical vascular pattern | 2 |
| Radial streaming, streaks | 1 |
| Irregular diffuse pigmentation, blotches | 1 |
| Irregular dots and globules | 1 |
| Regression pattern | 1 |

The checklist's algorithm adds up the scores for each present feature. This cumulative score provides an overall assessment of melanoma risk.

The resulting interpretation depends on the total score:

- A score of 4 or more suggests "Melanoma is likely" with 93% sensitivity and 78% specificity. This indicates a high probability of the lesion being melanoma.

- A score of 3 or less implies "The risk of melanoma is low", suggesting a lower probability of the lesion being melanoma.

The process results in a straightforward summary that aids clinicians in evaluating the risk of melanoma, delivering both the numerical score and the pertinent interpretation.

### Aclidinium bromide (tudorza Pressair) [^30750388]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

There are no adequate and well controlled studies of TUDORZA PRESSAIR in pregnant women to inform drug associated risks.

No adverse developmental effects were seen with inhalation administration of aclidinium bromide to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at 15 or 20 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily inhaled dose (MRHDID). However, reduced pup weights were seen when pregnant rats continued inhalation administration through lactation at 5 times the MRHDID of aclidinium bromide. Adverse developmental effects occurred when rabbits were orally dosed with aclidinium bromide at approximately 1,400 times the MRHDID [see Data].

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage of the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Data

Animal Data

In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6–17, no evidence of structural alterations was observed at approximately 15 times the MRHDID [based on summed AUCs of aclidinium bromide and its metabolites at inhaled doses less than or equal to 5.0 mg/kg/day]. However, in a pre- and post-natal development study, decreased pup weights were observed when pregnant rats were exposed from gestation day 6 and continuing during the lactation period at approximately 5 times the MRHDID [based on summed AUCs of aclidinium bromide and its metabolites at inhaled doses greater than or equal to 0.2 mg/kg/day]. Maternal toxicity was also observed at inhaled doses greater than or equal to 0.2 mg/kg/day.

### When do newborns die? A systematic review of timing of overall and cause-specific neonatal deaths in developing countries [^a9d67ee8]. Journal of Perinatology (2016). Low credibility.

Data abstraction and synthesis

The following list depicts the steps used to summarize the data from the included studies.

We first made a master chart with the day of life in columns and different studies in rows. For the first week of life, we made columns for each day — that is, day 0, day 1 and so on. For the next 3 weeks, we made columns for the week(s) rather than days (week 2 and weeks 3 to 4), as it was unlikely that the studies would have provided daily mortality rates for the second week onwards.
As it was likely that different studies would have used different terminologies to describe the day of birth, we assumed the following to ensure uniformity across the studies: We considered 0 to 23 h as day 0 of life, 24 to 47 h as day 1, 48 to 71 h as day 2 and so on for studies that mentioned the age in hours. For studies that did not mention the age in hours but reported it as < 1 day, day 1, day 2 and so on, < 1day was considered as 'day 0'. For those studies that did not report either of these two, we examined whether they had reported days 1 to 28 or days 0 to 27 as the neonatal period. For studies reporting deaths from days 1 to 28, we considered day 1 of the study to be 'day 0' for our analysis. Similarly, day 2 was considered as 'day 1', day 3 as 'day 2' and so on. For studies that reported deaths from day 0 to day 27, we used the data as such — that is, day 0 of the study is 'day 0'. For those studies that provided data for 0 to 28 days, we included day 7 figures in the data for the second week.
We then attempted to pool the data for different time points. For pooling, we included only those studies that provided data for at least three time points in the first 4 weeks of life (for example, day 1, day 2 and days 3 to 28; days 1 to 3, days 4 to 7, days 8 to 28; and so on). Studies that provided data for only two time points were simply enumerated in the table but not included in the final analysis.
Pooling of the data was done in three steps: Initially, the data from those studies that provided data for all the time points were pooled to obtain the summary estimate (proportion) for each time point. We then used this summary estimate to calculate the proportion for the missing time points in the other studies (extrapolation). For example, if a study provided data for day 1, day 2 and days 3 to 28, we split the data of 3 to 28 days into data for day 3, day 4, day 5, day 6, week 2 and weeks 3 to 4 based on the proportion obtained from step (i) for these time points. The data — original and extrapolated — were pooled again to obtain the final estimate for each time point.
We made the final graph based on the pooled result for each day in the first week and also for week 1, week 2 and weeks 3 to 4.
For cause-specific mortality, the same steps were carried out for each of the major outcomes — asphyxia, prematurity, sepsis/pneumonia/diarrhea, congenital malformations and others. The denominator was the total number of deaths secondary to a particular cause (for example, asphyxia) while the numerator was the number of deaths due to that cause on a given day.

### Fezolinetant (Veozah) [^591aa04f]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

There are no data on VEOZAH use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.

In embryo-fetal toxicity animal studies with fezolinetant, embryo-lethality occurred at high doses above the human therapeutic dose in rats and rabbits, but no teratogenicity was observed. In the pre- and post-natal development animal study, delayed parturition and embryo-lethality occurred at high doses above the human therapeutic dose in rats. Additionally, in the male offspring delayed male reproductive maturation was observed, characterized by incomplete preputial separation, which affected male fertility at doses above the human therapeutic dose in rats [see Data].

In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

Data

Animal Data

In embryo-fetal development toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, embryo-lethality was noted at the highest doses (128- and 174-fold the human AUC24at the human therapeutic dose for rats and rabbits, respectively). The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for embryo-fetal development was 50 mg/kg/day in rats and 45 mg/kg/day in rabbits (62- and 16‑fold the human AUC24at the human therapeutic dose for rats and rabbits, respectively). Fezolinetant showed no effects on fertility and early embryonic development in rats [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

In the pre- and post-natal development study in rats, the NOAEL for maternal and fetal toxicity was 30 mg/kg/day (36‑fold the human AUC24at the human therapeutic dose) based on delayed parturition and embryo-lethality at 100 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for F1generation development was determined to be 100 mg/kg/day for females (204-fold the human AUC24at the human therapeutic dose) and 10 mg/kg/day for males (11-fold the human AUC24at the human therapeutic dose). The F1male showed delayed male reproductive maturation, characterized as incomplete balanopreputial separation at time of mating, at doses of greater than or equal to 30 mg/kg/day (36-fold the human AUC24at the human therapeutic dose), which affected male fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

### ABM clinical protocol # 10: breastfeeding the late preterm (34–36 6 / 7 weeks of gestation) and early term infants (37–38 6 / 7 weeks of gestation), second revision 2016 [^adf9f927]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Late preterm and early term infants — risk profile and monitoring — Close observation and monitoring are required, especially in the first 12–24 hours after birth when the risk of inadequate adaptation to extra-uterine life is the highest. Late preterm infants born at 34 0/7 to 34 6/7 weeks of gestation have a 50% risk for morbidity during the birth hospitalization, and early term infants, born between 37 0/7 and 38 6/7 weeks of gestation, are also at higher risk compared with term infants, born between 39 0/7 and 41 6/7 weeks of gestation, for problems including hyperbilirubinemia, hospital readmission, and reduced breastfeeding initiation and duration. Morbidities in late preterm infants include hypothermia, hypoglycemia, excessive weight loss, dehydration, slow weight gain, failure to thrive, prolonged infant formula supplementation, exaggerated jaundice, kernicterus, dehydration, fever secondary to dehydration, sepsis, apnea, re-hospitalization, and breastfeeding failure, and transfer to a higher level of care for appropriate care and monitoring may be needed.

### Etrolizumab for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis [^d796d98d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Etrolizumab (rhuMAb beta7) is an anti-integrin that selectively targets the β7 subunits of the α4β7 and αEβ7 integrins, which are involved in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis.

Objectives

The objectives of this review were to assess the efficacy and safety of etrolizumab for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis.

Search Methods

We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) from inception to 12 March 2015. References and conference abstracts were searched to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) trials in which etrolizumab was compared to placebo or another active comparator in patients with active ulcerative colitis were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened studies for inclusion, assessed methodological quality and extracted data. We assessed methodological quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcome was failure to induce clinical remission (as defined by the primary studies). Secondary outcomes included failure to induce clinical improvement (as defined by the primary studies), failure to induce endoscopic remission (as defined by the primary studies), adverse events, serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, and health-related quality of life (as defined by the primary studies). We assessed the overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE criteria. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for each dichotomous outcome.

Main Results

Two RCTs including 172 patients with moderate to severe UC who failed conventional therapy met the inclusion criteria. Both studies were rated as low risk of bias. We did not pool efficacy data from the two included studies due to differences in dose and route of administration. The small phase I study found no statistically significant differences between etrolizumab and placebo in the proportion of patients who failed to enter remission (RR 1.04, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.69; participants = 23) or respond at week 10 (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.26 to 10.82; participants = 23). The phase II study reported on failure to enter clinical remission at weeks 6 and 10. In the etrolizumab group 91% (71/78) of patients failed to enter remission at week 6 compared to 95% (39/41) of placebo patients (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.06). Subgroup analysis revealed no statistically significant differences by dose. At week 10, there was a statistically significant difference in clinical remission rates favouring etrolizumab over placebo. Of the patients who received etrolizumab, 85% (66/78) failed to enter remission at week 10 compared to 100% (41/41) patients in the placebo group (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.95). A subgroup analysis by dose found a statistically significant difference in clinical remission rates favoring 100 mg etrolizumab over placebo (RR 0.81 CI 95% 0.68 to 0.96), but not 300 mg etrolizumab over placebo (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.03). No significant heterogeneity was detected for this comparison (P = 0.28, I(2) = 13.5%). GRADE analyses indicated that the overall quality of evidence for the clinical remission outcomes was moderate due to sparse data. Both of the included studies reported on safety. The outcome adverse events was initially pooled, however this analysis was removed due to high heterogeneity (I(2) = 88%). The phase I study found no statistically significant difference between etrolizumab and placebo in the proportion of patients who had at least one adverse event. Ninety-five per cent (36/38) of etrolizumab patients had at least one adverse event compared to 100% (10/10) of placebo patients (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.14). Common adverse events reported in the phase I study included exacerbation of UC, headache, fatigue, abdominal pain, dizziness, nasopharyngitis, nausea, arthralgia and urinary tract infection. There was a statistically significant difference between etrolizumab and placebo in the proportion of patients who had at least one adverse event. Fifty-six per cent (44/78) of etrolizumab patients had at least one adverse event compared to 79% of placebo patients (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.91). A GRADE analysis indicates that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was moderate due to sparse data. Common adverse events reported in the phase II study included worsening UC, nasopharyngitis, nervous system disorders, headache and arthralgia. A pooled analysis of two studies indicates that there was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients who had a serious adverse event. Twelve per cent (14/116) of etrolizumab patients had a serious adverse event compared to 12% of placebo patients (6/49) (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.34). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was low due to very sparse data (20 events). Common serious adverse events included worsening of UC, impaired wound healing and bacterial peritonitis.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate quality evidence suggests that etrolizumab may be an effective induction therapy for some patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis who have failed conventional therapy. Due to small numbers of patients in dose subgroups the optimal dosage of etrolizumab is unclear. Due to sparse data we are uncertain regarding the risk of adverse events and serious adverse events. Further studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of etrolizumab in this patient population. There are five ongoing phase III etrolizumab trials and two ongoing open-label extension studies that will provide important new information on the efficacy, safety and optimal dose of this drug for the treatment of UC.

Weight Gain

Weight gain has been observed with atypical antipsychotic use. Monitoring of weight is recommended. Pooled data from short-term, placebo-controlled studies in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are presented in Tables 9–10.

In long-term (at least 1 year), placebo-controlled, flexible-dose studies in schizophrenia, the mean change from baseline weight for ziprasidone 20–40 mg BID was -2.3 kg (N = 124); for ziprasidone 60–80 mg BID was +2.5 kg (N = 10); and for placebo was -2.9 kg (N = 72). In the same long-term studies, the proportion of subjects with ≥ 7% increase in weight from baseline for ziprasidone 20–40 mg BID was 5.6% (N = 124); for ziprasidone 60–80 mg BID was 20.0% (N = 10), and for placebo was 5.6% (N = 72). In a long-term (at least 1 year), placebo-controlled, fixed-dose study in schizophrenia, the mean change from baseline weight for ziprasidone 20 mg BID was -2.6 kg (N = 72); for ziprasidone 40 mg BID was -3.3 kg (N = 69); for ziprasidone 80 mg BID was -2.8 kg (N = 70) and for placebo was -3.8 kg (N = 70). In the same long-term fixed-dose schizophrenia study, the proportion of subjects with ≥ 7% increase in weight from baseline for ziprasidone 20 mg BID was 5.6% (N = 72); for ziprasidone 40 mg BID was 2.9% (N = 69); for ziprasidone 80 mg BID was 5.7% (N = 70) and for placebo was 2.9% (N = 70).

We then further analyzed whether the NK1 receptor antagonist differentially affected the extinction of the first sequence learned versus the learning of the new reverse sequence. A 2 × 8 mixed ANOVA showed a significant Session effect (F (7,63) = 4.53; p = 0.0004) and Treatment × Session interaction (F (7,63) = 2.35; p = 0.03) on the rate at which rats extinguished the first learned sequence (Figure 3(e)). Post hoc pairwise t -test revealed significant differences in session 5 (t (9) = 2.44, p = 0.04, d = 1.47), and marginally significant differences on sessions 4 (t (9) = 2.91, p = 0.05, d = 1.32) and 7 (t (9) = 1.96, p = 0.08, d = 1.19), suggesting that rats injected with L-733,060 stopped performing the previous sequence faster. On the other hand, the rate at which the new sequence was performed consistently increased, with a significant Session effect (F (7,63) = 11.47; p = 2.7e-09, Figure 3(f)); but with no significant Treatment effect (F (1,9) = 0.05; p = 0.83) or Treatment × Session interaction (F (7,63) = 1.45; p = 0.20), indicating that the effect of L-733,060 seems to be limited to extinguishing the first learned sequence.

### Pimecrolimus [^4d3a5463]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% is not indicated for use in children less than 2 years of age.

The long-term safety and effects of Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% on the developing immune system are unknown.

Three Phase 3 pediatric trials were conducted involving 1114 subjects 2–17 years of age. Two trials were 6-week randomized vehicle-controlled trials with a 20-week open-label phase and one was a vehicle-controlled (up to 1 year) safety trial with the option for sequential topical corticosteroid use. Of these subjects, 542 (49%) were 2–6 years of age. In the short-term trials, 11% of Pimecrolimus subjects did not complete these trials and 1.5% of Pimecrolimus subjects discontinued due to adverse events. In the 1-year trial, 32% of Pimecrolimus subjects did not complete this trial and 3% of Pimecrolimus subjects discontinued due to adverse events. Most discontinuations were due to unsatisfactory therapeutic effect.

The most common local adverse event in the short-term trials of Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% in pediatric subjects ages 2–17 was application site burning (10% vs. 13% vehicle); the incidence in the long-term trial was 9% Pimecrolimus vs. 7% vehicle [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Adverse events that were more frequent (> 5%) in subjects treated with Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% compared to vehicle were headache (14% vs. 9%) in the short-term trial. Nasopharyngitis (26% vs. 21%), influenza (13% vs. 4%), pharyngitis (8% vs. 3%), viral infection (7% vs. 1%), pyrexia (13% vs. 5%), cough (16% vs. 11%), and headache (25% vs. 16%) were increased over vehicle in the 1-year safety trial [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In 843 subjects ages 2–17 years treated with Pimecrolimus Cream, 1%, 9 (0.8%) developed eczema herpeticum (5 on Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% alone and 4 on Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% used in sequence with corticosteroids). In 211 subjects on vehicle alone, there were no cases of eczema herpeticum. The majority of adverse events were mild to moderate in severity.

### Modeling protein conformational ensembles by guiding alphaFold2 with double electron electron resonance (DEER) distance distributions [^e2de78e5]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

As shown in Fig. 5A, unconstrained DEERFold predicts narrow IF conformation of Pgp, with a median RMSD value of 3.41 Å compared to experimental structure (7A65,), and a median RMSD value of 6.29 Å and 6.24 Å compared to the occluded/OF structures (7ZK4, 6C0V). Including the raw distance distributions (Experiment 1) corresponding to the ADP-Vi intermediate reduces the median RMSD to the OF structures to 3.25 Å(7ZK4) and 3.30 Å(6C0V). The distance distribution overlay between the Experimental 1 set and the top predicted model are provided in Supplementary Fig. 6 for the ADP-Vi intermediate. Similarly, Experiment 2 yielded comparable results with median RMSD values of 3.25 Å and 3.29 Å for 7ZK4 and 6C0V, respectively (see Fig. 5A, C). In contrast, predictions with the Apo dataset yielded conformations with a wider intracellular opening than both reference IF structures (7A65 and 7ZK7). Models predicted with Experiment 1 data set have a median RMSD to the IF-wide structure (7ZK7) of 4.90 Å down from 6.30 Å while simultaneously increasing the RMSD from 3.41 Å to 4.90 Å for the IF-narrow structure (7A65). The distance distribution overlay between the Experimental 1 set and the top predicted model are provided in Supplementary Fig. 8 for the Apo dataset. Experiment 2 induced an even more pronounced opening, with the median RMSD of 5.34 Å to the IF-wide structure(7ZK7), and the median RMSD to the IF-narrow structure further increasing to 11.01 Å (see Fig. 5B, C).

### Vancomycin hydrochloride (Vancocin) [^1f1e8e23]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Systemic absorption of vancomycin is low following oral administration of VANCOCIN; however, absorption may vary depending on various factors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. There are no available data on vancomycin use in pregnant women to assess a risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. Available published data on intravenous vancomycin use in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters have not shown an association with adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data).

Vancomycin did not show adverse developmental effects when administered intravenously to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses less than or equal to the recommended maximum human dose (see Data).

Data

Human Data There are no available data on first trimester use of vancomycin in pregnant women to assess a risk of major birth defects or miscarriage.

A published study evaluated hearing loss and nephrotoxicity in infants of 10 pregnant intravenous drug users treated with intravenous vancomycin for suspected or documented methicillin-resistant Staphylococcal aureus in the second or third trimester. The comparison groups were 10 uninfected non-intravenous drug-dependent patients who received no treatment and 10 uninfected untreated intravenous drug-dependent patients. No infant in the vancomycin exposed group had abnormal sensorineural hearing at 3 months of age or nephrotoxicity.

A published prospective study assessed outcomes in 55 pregnant women with a positive Group B streptococcus culture and a high-risk penicillin allergy with resistance to clindamycin or unknown sensitivity who were administered intravenous vancomycin at the time of delivery. Vancomycin dosing ranged from the standard dose of 1 g intravenously every 12 hours to a dose of 20 mg/kg intravenously every 8 hours (maximum individual dose 2 g). No major adverse reactions were recorded either in the mothers or their newborns. None of the newborns had sensorineural hearing loss. Neonatal renal function was not examined, but all of the newborns were discharged in good condition.

Animal Data Vancomycin did not cause fetal malformation when administered intravenously during organogenesis to pregnant rats (gestation days 6 to 15) and rabbits (gestation days 6 to 18) at the equivalent recommended maximum human dose of 200 mg/kg/day to rats or 120 mg/kg/day to rabbits. No effects on fetal weight or development were seen in rats at the highest dose tested or in rabbits given 80 mg/kg/day (approximately 1 and 0.8 880 mg/m2 or 0.74 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area). Maternal toxicity was observed in rats (at doses 120 mg/kg and above) and rabbits (at 80 mg/kg and above).
