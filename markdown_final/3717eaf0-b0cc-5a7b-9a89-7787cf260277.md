## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option best captures the most important impact of security studies from a post-structuralist perspective. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core post-structuralist premises and how they apply to security discourse. Then, I should evaluate each answer choice against those premises. Next, I will look for concrete examples in the provided sources that illustrate how security studies shapes legitimacy, inclusion, and exclusion. Finally, I will synthesize and confirm the best fit, making sure I'm not overextending beyond the evidence base.

> Let me first confirm the post-structuralist frame. Post-structuralism emphasizes that knowledge is constructed through discourse, that power operates by producing truth and legitimacy, and that seemingly neutral fields often reproduce hierarchies by privileging certain subjects and marginalizing others. In security studies, this means the field does not merely describe threats but actively constitutes what counts as a threat, who is dangerous, and whose lives are grievable, thereby shaping practice and policy.

> Now, Option A claims security studies contributes to literature and builds theoretical understanding. Wait, let me verify whether that aligns with a post-structuralist critique. While security studies does produce literature, a post-structuralist would argue that this production of knowledge is itself a form of power that structures reality rather than just reflecting it, so calling this the most important impact misses the performative, world-making dimension of discourse. I should keep this in mind as I compare options.

> Option B says security studies records the history of modern warfare. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. Recording history sounds descriptive, but post-structuralists would question which histories get recorded, whose voices are amplified, and how narratives are framed. For example, embedded journalism in Iraq shaped what the global audience saw and did not see, illustrating that "recording" is itself a selective, power-laden act rather than a neutral archive, so this option understates the constitutive role of discourse [^114FSq2m].

> Option C claims security studies teaches a new generation about the reality of warfare and strategy. Hmm, wait a minute, this sounds pedagogical and again presumes a transparent transmission of reality. A post-structuralist would counter that what is taught as "reality" is a discursively constructed version that legitimizes certain actors, tactics, and epistemologies while obscuring others, so this option fails to capture the field's performative effects on legitimacy and subjectivity.

> Option D asserts that security studies creates and perpetuates claims that shape warfare, defining legitimacy, favoring some subjects and marginalizing others. Let me consider whether this matches the evidence. Multiple sources show how security framings constitute threats and legitimate responses: the health-security nexus mobilizes urgency and resources but can also co-opt health actors and erode norms; biodefense discourse shapes research priorities and public fear; and war narratives construct "good" versus "evil" frames that justify intervention and obscure civilian harm, all of which exemplify discourse producing power-laden truths and exclusions [^1133em9s] [^114mfXvv] [^114FSq2m].

> I should double-check concrete examples that illustrate marginalization and legitimacy effects. The 12-D framework highlights how global health security agendas often sideline war as a public health catastrophe, despite its massive impacts, showing how security discourse determines what counts as a legitimate security threat. Similarly, the snakebite case reveals how epistemic injustice and funding asymmetries shape whose suffering is recognized and addressed, reinforcing a "foreign gaze" and unequal legitimacy. And in conflict zones, medical neutrality is invoked selectively, exposing how claims about legitimacy can shield some actors while exposing others to violence, all of which resonate with post-structuralist concerns about discourse, power, and exclusion [^113vLRLd] [^111AkhDR] [^116NDA7f].

> But wait, what if I'm overstating that security studies alone drives these effects? Let me reconsider and anchor the claim in the sources. The documents repeatedly show that security framings — whether in health, bioterror, or war reporting — do not merely describe but constitute threats, authorize actors, and delimit moral communities, which is precisely the post-structuralist point about discourse as a technology of power. Thus, Option D best captures the field's most important impact from this perspective [^1133em9s] [^114mfXvv] [^114FSq2m].

> Final answer: D. Security studies creates and perpetuates claims that shape warfare, defining legitimacy, favouring some subjects and marginalising others [^1133em9s] [^114mfXvv] [^114FSq2m].

---

The most important impact of security studies for post-structuralists is that it **constructs and legitimizes power relations** by defining what counts as a threat, who is dangerous, and whose lives are valued, thereby shaping warfare and marginalizing certain groups [^1133em9s]. Post-structuralists argue that security discourse is not neutral but **produces knowledge that justifies violence, surveillance, and exclusion**, often reinforcing hierarchies of race, gender, and class [^115go58m]. This aligns with option D, whereas options A–C are too descriptive or pedagogical and miss the critical, power-laden role of security studies emphasized by post-structuralist thought.

## Post-structuralist perspective on security studies

Post-structuralism, particularly through the works of Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, and Judith Butler, emphasizes the following key principles:

- **Discourse and power**: Knowledge is produced through discourse, which is inherently linked to power relations. Discourses shape what is considered truth, normal, or legitimate [^notfound].

- **Subjectivity and identity**: Identities are constructed through discourse and are fluid, contingent, and historically specific [^113gaoDU].

- **Deconstruction**: Texts and practices should be analyzed to uncover hidden assumptions, binaries, and power structures [^notfound].

Applying these principles to security studies, post-structuralists argue that security discourse **constructs threats, enemies, and allies**, thereby shaping political realities and legitimizing certain forms of violence and exclusion [^notfound].

---

## Analysis of answer choices

### Option A: Security studies contributes to the literature and builds greater theoretical understanding of the subject

While security studies does contribute to academic literature and theoretical understanding, this answer is **too descriptive and apolitical** from a post-structuralist perspective. Post-structuralists are concerned with how knowledge is produced, whose interests it serves, and how it shapes power relations. Simply stating that security studies builds theoretical understanding overlooks the critical question of **how this knowledge functions politically and epistemologically** [^notfound].

---

### Option B: Security studies records the history of modern warfare

This option is **insufficiently critical**. Post-structuralists would argue that security studies does not merely record history but actively constructs it by framing events, actors, and narratives in specific ways. The discipline's historical accounts are shaped by discursive practices that privilege certain perspectives and marginalize others, thereby influencing how warfare is understood and remembered [^114FSq2m].

---

### Option C: Security studies teaches a new generation about the reality of warfare and strategy

This option is **too pedagogical and uncritical**. Post-structuralists would question what constitutes "reality" in this context, arguing that the "reality" of warfare is itself constructed through discourse. Teaching about warfare inevitably involves transmitting specific narratives, values, and assumptions that shape future practitioners' understanding and actions [^notfound].

---

### Option D: Security studies creates and perpetuates claims that shape warfare, defining legitimacy, favouring some subjects and marginalising others

This option **aligns most closely with post-structuralist thought**. Security studies, through its discourses, constructs threats, defines enemies, and legitimizes certain forms of violence while marginalizing others. It shapes who is considered dangerous, who deserves protection, and whose lives are valued. This process is inherently political and power-laden, reflecting and reinforcing existing hierarchies and inequalities [^1133em9s].

---

## Examples and evidence

Several examples illustrate how security studies constructs and perpetuates power relations:

- **War on terror**: The discourse of the "war on terror" constructed terrorism as an existential threat, legitimizing extensive surveillance, indefinite detention, and military interventions. This discourse also racialized and marginalized Muslim communities, portraying them as potential threats [^notfound].

- **Human security**: While human security discourse aims to broaden the concept of security beyond state-centric perspectives, critics argue that it has been co-opted by powerful states to justify interventionist policies, thereby reinforcing neo-colonial power structures [^117JNfAm].

- **Biosecurity**: The field of biosecurity constructs certain diseases and populations as threats, influencing public health policies and resource allocation. This construction often reflects and reinforces existing social inequalities and power relations [^1133em9s].

---

## Conclusion

For post-structuralists, the most important impact of security studies is its role in **constructing and perpetuating power relations** through discourse. By defining threats, legitimizing violence, and marginalizing certain groups, security studies shapes political realities and reinforces existing hierarchies. Option D best captures this critical, power-laden dimension of security studies, whereas options A–C are too descriptive, pedagogical, or uncritical to align with post-structuralist thought.

### A health systems resilience research agenda: moving from concept to practice [^111rHWsh]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

How is legitimacy created?

Legitimate health systems are accepted through de facto and de jure processes and trusted by communities, who have the power to influence the system. After COVID-19, health systems need to create consistent and institutionalised channels to incorporate the political and socioeconomic context. The power of competing actors and interests within the health system and between technical and political decision makers are all likely to affect legitimacy. With COVID-19, health system actors, politicians, other decision-makers and the general public are receiving an ever-changing flow of information and evidence as COVID-19 circumstances change. This unprecedented global awareness and general knowledge of COVID-19 has shaped political actions and population beliefs in health expertise, bringing the health system's response to COVID-19 into sharp relief for communities. Community experiences with corruption and accountability and their perceptions of actors with power who are outside of the health system are also likely to influence trust in the health system. Their trust in the system and actors can directly impact the system's ability to respond to shocks. At present, mistrust is at the root of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, a barrier which will force health systems to adapt if countries are to reach herd immunity. The pandemic highlights the importance of clear communication to build and maintain trust in the population and the role of information and evidence in shaping legitimacy. Health systems will need to understand the internal and external mechanisms that generate legitimacy and will need to adapt to changing levels of trust if they are to effectively respond to shocks like COVID-19. For example, sound communication strategies could reinforce legitimacy and could constitute an important space for collaboration between public and private sectors and the community, while reinforcing systems thinking for resilience in social systems like health systems.

### How and why snakebite became a global health priority: a policy analysis [^111AkhDR]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

The prioritisation of snakebite occurred in a crescendo, de-crescendo, re-crescendo manner. In the re-crescendo phase, it was enabled by a diverse network composition, better understanding of the processes and funding needs of WHO, recognition of the need for engaging the media and the use of intersecting and layered framing strategies. Involvement of Costa Rica and Kofi Annan was important to overcome ebbs in establishing legitimacy and to garner support from state actors. Funding and strategic engagement by the Wellcome Trust enabled prioritisation of snakebite and shaped the agenda within the WHO. Reluctant acceptance of snakebite within the NTD community is a barrier to its sustained placement on the global health agenda.

The success of getting snakebite in the global health agenda was on account of various factors, but largely driven by the core inner group of the snakebite network — individuals who were committed to the cause of snakebite and provided leadership to build a network and enabled by civil society actors — who were equally committed. However, the fluctuating pattern of prioritisation implies a fragile placement of snakebite in the global health agenda. Despite the successes of integrating snakebite in the agenda, the network faces a challenge in sustaining its legitimacy, particularly in endemic nations. This might be due to several factors. Recent calls for decolonising global health have increased awareness and recognition of the 'foreign gaze', epistemic injustice, power asymmetries in global health initiatives and the need for structural reforms in the global health ecosystem. Data from the snakebite envenoming medicines database show that 11 of the 13 projects funded by Wellcome Trust, a key global health funder for antivenom research, were awarded to research institutions in non-endemic nations (UK, Europe and USA). Disproportionate allocation of material resources reinforces perceptions around legitimacy. The Wellcome Trust Program on snakebite is till 2026, and it is recommended that future funding decisions look into more long-term gains (eg, existing infrastructure, capacities and capability strengthening) and with different set of recipients in endemic nations. Research on fluctuating interest of other global health funders on snakebite is warranted.

### How elections shape perceptions of ideal leadership [^113CwfVH]. The American Psychologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Individuals hold internal leadership representations, termed leadership prototypes. We examined how these prototypes changed in reaction to the 2020 U.S. presidential election. A sample of Republicans (N = 200), Democrats (N = 200), and individuals who identified with neither major party (N = 200), surveyed eight times between October 2020 and January 2021, and reported their perceptions of the characteristics of the ideal leader. Results from a regression discontinuity in time and repeated measurement analyses found that the election altered two dimensions of the average U.S. leadership prototype. We specifically find participants' perceptions of Tyranny and Masculinity to decrease, that is, shifts to more Biden-like and less Trump-like leadership prototypes. Other dimensions of the leadership prototype remained stable, that is, charisma, sensitivity, dedication, intelligence, and dynamism. Analyses examined two boundary conditions of the effect: political identification and the acceptance of the election result as legitimate. Only perceived legitimacy was found to moderate the effect with the shift in leadership prototypes being driven by individuals who accepted the result of the election as legitimate. Our findings demonstrate the dynamic nature of leadership prototypes in response to real-world events and more broadly how an election can shape psychological perceptions.

### Public safety personnel's interpretations of potentially traumatic events [^113sWbv2]. Occupational Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Extending the work of Carleton et al. we document what appears to be evidence of a trauma hierarchy from responses provided by PSP; specifically, suffering is considered most legitimate if the exposure to trauma is direct, rather than indirect or cumulative. Suffering in response to events that PSP perceive as traumatic, but are not thought to warrant suffering, may cause PSP to deny or avoid their feelings, and may deter treatment seeking. PSP expressed a belief that the suffering associated with an event should only take place immediately after an incident. Unfortunately, the trauma exposure hierarchy, in conjunction with the constraints placed when suffering must occur to be legitimate, may be real potential barriers to treatment seeking and problematic reinforcers of mental health stigma.

Our study is the first to explore how direct and indirect PTE exposures shape perceptions of perceived traumatic experience legitimacy through unstructured, open-ended survey items. Through an anonymous survey, our respondents expressed their opinions about their perceptions of exposure to trauma and PTEs without fear of sanctions or stigma and potential impact on career advancement, though we underscore recruitment and self-selection biases as design limitations that should be considered when interpreting our results. The use of an online survey platform is also inherently restrictive in that participants may have had other relevant contributions that were left unexpressed due to a lack of prompting or perceived opportunity.

### Ethics in times of conflict: some reflections on syria, in the backdrop of Iraq [^1137vtCz]. BMJ Global Health (2016). Medium credibility.

Some claim, perhaps with legitimacy, that it is a near impossible task to provide fair representation in any conflict. There is always a different story. But where this is the case, one needs to take a position on one side or another, declare it and move forward. For researchers working in conflict regions, this involves admitting to the challenges of accessing unbiased data, the near impossibility of obtaining 'representative' samples and the risk of the contamination of evidence. Anthropologist Elizabeth Wood argued that the "ethical imperatives of research ('does no harm') is intensified in conflict zones due to… political polarization, the presence of armed fighters and the precarious security of most residents". To these, one may add the ever-changing scenarios on the ground, from a military and a humanitarian perspective. For Ken Wilson, "researching in an 'ethical manner' seems not about proclaiming good and evil, but about enabling the reader to hear the voices and appreciate the actions of as many of the different people involved as possible". Indeed, contextualising the differing perspectives of different people can give a more accurate representation of the multiple truths in these settings.

### Fake news, real war [^115YLgWf]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Misinformation as relational aggression

Yet, I suggest that misinformation often stems from deliberate acts of proactive intergroup aggression, in which false narratives and rumors are actively created and disseminated to harm outgroups while benefiting ingroups. This framing positions misinformation as the outcome of an intentional behavior embedded within intergroup dynamics: disinformation behavior. I thus propose that much misinformation can be more accurately understood through the lens of proactive relational aggression, a form of aggression that seeks to damage others through social manipulation, rather than through direct physical violence.

While the distinction between misinformation and disinformation is useful, it remains problematic if misinformation is simply viewed as false information. In this case, misinformation research becomes indistinguishable from the broader study of belief, overlapping substantially with core areas of psychology. However, a closer look at the field reveals a concentrated focus on specific types of false information — particularly fake news related to politics, science, and public health (e.g. infodemics), which is initially crafted with the intent to deceive. My argument does not deny the importance of research focusing on recipients or on misinformation that is not the result of malicious actors. Rather, it highlights the need to shift attention toward the intentional actors behind disinformation campaigns. The most consequential misinformation beliefs — such as narratives about the legitimacy of the invasion of Ukraine or the "stolen" 2020 U.S. election — are not simple byproducts of cognitive biases. Rather, they are the result of systematically orchestrated operations, carefully designed and disseminated by politically motivated entities to shape public opinion. In essence, much of what is labeled as misinformation is, in fact, disinformation.

Going back to the epidemiological metaphor, these narratives are not random "viruses" spreading from person to person as a result of their vulnerabilities, but rather engineered bioweapons, deliberately introduced into the information ecosystem. The field has made progress by focusing on the targets of disinformation, which has led to the development of cost-effective cognitive "vaccines" — such as critical thinking or inoculation interventions. To develop more powerful treatments, it needs to start addressing the actors responsible for producing and disseminating disinformation, who constitute a critical part of the problem. In other words, mitigating public susceptibility is necessary, but insufficient without confronting the architects and amplifiers of disinformation — the true pathogenic source.

### Role of risk perceptions and vaccine hesitancy on decision-making among low-income mothers in Kenya: a qualitative study [^117BNrBp]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Misinformation and rumours

Misinformation and rumours circulating within communities and spread through social networks played a role in shaping mothers' perceptions of vaccines seem to have a significant influence on mothers and created additional fears, as did apprehension over adverse reactions like paralysis or sickness. Some of the common misinformation regarding vaccines included that vaccines were being used for population control as observed during one of the FGDs. 'People say that these vaccines are not safe for our children. They say they can cause infertility or other long-term problems' (Murang'a — FGD: Participant 5).

Lack of trust in vaccine quality

Doubts about safety and distrust of health systems increased hesitancy. Mothers expressed distrust of vaccine providers, especially those involved in door-to-door campaigns, and questioned the motives and legitimacy of vaccinators and vaccines. This distrust extended to fears about faulty or unsafe injections from healthcare workers and contributed to concerns about adverse reactions, as one mother from Murang'a observed, 'I have heard stories of expired vaccines being used. How can I be sure that my child is getting a good vaccine?' (Murang'a — IDI: Participant 13). Some mothers also worried about the storage and handling of vaccines, questioning their efficacy and safety due to potential mishandling. 'I worry about how these vaccines are stored and transported. If they are not kept properly, they might not work or even cause harm' (Machakos — FGD: Participant 1).

### Impairment and disability identity and perceptions of trust, respect, and fairness [^115h4tjG]. JAMA Health Forum (2023). High credibility.

In addition, the standard disability questions do not ask about identity. The degree of overlap between individuals who are considered to have a disability by their ACS-6 responses and those who self-identify as disabled is unknown and may vary by other personal or cultural attributes. Disability identity is a key dimension of diversity that is distinct from one's impairment status and that "shapes a person's ways of seeing themselves, their bodies, and their way of interacting with the world". (p198) Furthermore, some factors that shape identity also are associated with health injustices and disparities, including stigma, bias, politics, and systems of power or oppression.

This study analyzes findings from a nationally representative survey to explore which sociodemographic factors could be associated with the adoption of a disability identity and to examine whether impairment status and disability identity are associated with patients' perceptions of trust, communication, respect, and fairness in clinical encounters. Henceforth, these concepts are considered components of procedural justice, a type of justice that is concerned with perceptions about processes that correlate with views of both situational outcomes and institutional legitimacy. We hypothesized that disability identity is independently associated with procedural justice measures, even when controlling for other sociodemographic traits. Recognizing different preferences, we use both person-first and identity-first disability language throughout.

### Enhancement, ethics and society: towards an empirical research agenda for the medical humanities and social sciences [^115EMdvP]. Medical Humanities (2015). Low credibility.

One useful resource is Catherine Coveney's sociological study of a range of individuals (including university students, health professionals and other shift workers) asked to envision the use of a drug promoting wakefulness (specifically, modafinil; brand name: Provigil). Her findings showed that potential uses of this enhancement included ensuring safety at work (eg, ameliorating the dangers posed by sleepy surgeons), but also as a study aid. However, perceptions both of legitimate use and the legitimacy of the drug per se were tightly interwoven with its legality, and how readily available it was (eg, from local pharmacists, without a prescription, or from physicians only). Accordingly, what Coveney's research shows is that public attitudes towards enhancement drugs are linked to broader feelings towards pharmaceuticals more generally — and, specifically, the ways in which (to borrow historian Keith Wailoo's term) the 'identities' of drugs are constituted through regulatory regimes. This insight has salience for bioethical debate that might take the meanings of pharmaceuticals to be solely a function of personal mores, as opposed to being powerfully shaped by the social frameworks in which they and their consumers are embedded.

### Unveiling the metaphors of (in) formal care: understanding dementia through language [^112wsZzB]. The Gerontologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Metaphors in dementia

Non-literal/figurative language is often used in the illness discourse to articulate the complex nature of care. Metaphors are non-literal or figurative language commonly used in dialogical contexts, that intentionally require further elaboration compared to literal meaning. According to the Conceptual Metaphor Theory, metaphors are more than descriptive linguistic expressions; they reflect and shape how individuals map, understand, conceptualize, interpret, and communicate about reality — including illness.

In the context of dementia, caregivers may employ voluntary and involuntary non-literal expressions to articulate their emotional and practical struggles. Through metaphors caregivers can communicate complex and abstract experiences by using simple, concrete, and more relatable concepts, creating a sense of community and giving meaning to the disease. Nevertheless, while enhancing accessibility, metaphors can also distort or oversimplify intricate concepts and phenomena, potentially leading to misunderstanding and stigma. In fact, previous research has shown that metaphors influence how carers approach and treat people with dementia. Some metaphors, such as the warfare metaphor, can be stigmatizing, contributing to dehumanize those affected; other metaphors, such as the companion one, can foster a more compassionate perspective, emphasizing the value of moments of lucidity and connection (­). Therefore, the analysis of metaphorical language can reveal underlying beliefs about the nature of dementia, its causes, and impact on caregivers' roles and may contribute to inform tailored support strategies as well as to address stigma.

However, despite the growing body of literature on non-literal language in dementia, which includes people with dementia's narratives and disease representations analysis, only few studies have analyzed metaphors as a lens in the caregivers' perspective. These studies suggest that metaphors and their interpretation vary across cultural contexts, as cultural norms profoundly shape metaphorical thinking and expressions and can influence the individual and collective perception of both dementia and caregiving. We conducted this study to expand and advance knowledge on metaphors and dementia. Given the cultural specificity of metaphors, we concentrated our investigation in the Italian-speaking southern region of Switzerland. By analyzing non-literal language in the narratives of formal and informal caregivers of people with dementia in this region, we sought to understand the cognitive and emotional frameworks that shape their conceptualization of the disease, their role, and their relationship with the person affected.

### Mass casualty management of a large-scale bioterrorist event: an epidemiological approach that shapes triage decisions [^113QKFzy]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The threat of a BT event has catalyzed serious reflection on the troublesome issues that come with event management and triage. Such reflection has had the effect of multiplying the efforts to find solutions to what could become a catastrophic public health disaster. Management options are becoming more robust, as are reliable detection devices and rapid access to stockpiled antibiotics and vaccines. There is much to be done, however, especially in the organizing, warehousing, and granting/exercising authority for resource allocations. The introduction of these new options should encourage one to believe that, in time, evolving standards of care will make it possible to rethink the currently unthinkable consequences. Unfortunately the cost of such preparedness is high and out of reach of most governments. Most of the developing world has neither the will nor the means to plan for BT events and remains overwhelmed with basic public health concerns (i.e., water, food, sanitation, shelter) that must take priority. Therefore, developed countries will be expected to respond using international exogenous resources to mitigate the effects of such a disaster. As a result, the state capacity of the effected government will be severely compromised. If triage and management of casualties is further compromised, terrorists will have met their goals. One could argue that health sciences will continue for decades to play catch up with the advanced technology driving potential bioagent weaponry. If one lesson was learned from the review of the former Soviet Union's biological weapons program, it is that the unthinkable remains an option to terrorists who have comparable expertise. It is crucial to develop realistic strategies for a BT event. Triage planning (the process of establishing criteria for health care prioritization) permits society to see cases in the context of diverse moral perspectives, limited resources, and compelling health care demands. This includes a competent and compassionate management and triage system and an in-depth and accurate health information system that appropriately addresses every level of threat or consequence. In a PICE stage I to III BT event resources will be compromised. Triage and management will be one process requiring multiple levels of cooperation, coordination, and decision-making. An immediate challenge to existing emergency medical services systems (EMSS) is the recognition that locally there will be a shift of emphasis and decision-making from prehospital first responders to community public health authorities. The author suggests that a working relationship, in most areas, between EMSS and the public health system is lacking. As priorities shift in a BT event to hospitals and public health care systems, they need to: 1. Improve their capabilities and capacities in surveillance, discovery, and in the consequences of different triage and management decisions and interventions in a BT environment, starting at the local level. 2. Develop triage and management systems (with clear lines of authority) based on public health and epidemiologic requirements, capability, and capacity (triage teams, categories, tags, rapid response, established operational priorities, resource-driven responsible management process), and link local level surveillance systems with those at the national or regional level. 3. Use a triage and management system that reflects the population (cohort) at risk, such as the epidemiologic based SEIRV triage framework. 4. Develop an organizational capacity that uses lateral decision-making skills, pre-hospital outpatient centers for triage-specific treatments, health information systems, and resource-driven hospital level pre-designated protocols appropriate for a surge of unprecedented proportions. Such standards of care, it is recommended, should be set at the local to federal levels and spelled out in existing incident-management system protocols.

### Reconceptualising health security in post-COVID-19 world [^115go58m]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Despite the widespread usage and acceptance of the significance of 'health security' in academic and policy discourses, there is little consensus on what this term actually means. This is primarily due to the interdisciplinary disposition of the term — since health and security correspond to different disciplines — and to its usage in a variety of contexts (individual, national and global) for a variety of purposes. At the individual level, for instance, health security refers to all aspects of public health that protect the vital core of human lives. At the national and global level, the term 'health security' usually refers to protecting people from those public health threats — such as infectious diseases and bioterrorism — that pose threats to national and international peace and stability. Since the term 'security' invokes concerns of urgency, power and the legitimate use of extraordinary means, it is often deployed strategically to position public health on the global agenda, seek political attention and secure financial resources.

### Social hierarchy of pain and its connection to the memory of previously suffered pain [^1167oGE1]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

It has been noted that the social legitimacy of pain is not the same according to the type of pain suffered and to who is suffering it. Therefore, apart from a socially constructed hierarchy of pain, we have found that the experienced pain is an essential element in the experience of pain, which makes its memory linger in the sufferer's memory, conditioning its perception of legitimacy. Furthermore, certain social characteristics of the person also have an influence, such as the fact of being a woman with a low level of education, which is the reflection of the profile of people who suffer emotional pain. Sadly, pain and women go together, and, if the characteristics reflecting a low social status are added, this connection is more frequent. Women, mainly with a low level of education, as mentioned above, are the people who mention emotional pain as the worst one that may be suffered, because, in addition, they remember it, they have experienced it.

In turn, emotional pain holds a strong position on the collective imagination, as a pitiful pain, socially legitimated and recognized as such. It is not the case for psychological pain, which is only recognized by the people who have suffered it and considered it as the most relevant pain they have experienced. It is a socially invisible and hardly legitimized pain, which sometimes is difficult to assume as such, as another type of pain, which is perceived as a clear influence of the social stigma often suffered by patients suffering from illnesses of a mental nature.

Therefore, the "social prejudice" against certain illnesses may be found in the belief that these diseases are the responsibility of the individual, that they are an illegitimate deviation and, therefore, morally reprehensible. Thus, the pain itself, as well as the person who suffers it, is element with its own legitimacy, due to its social class, gender, etc, which has an influence on the disease's legitimacy. The way in which people interpret their own pain and other people's pain influences the way in which people in pain end up behaving. One's behavior is shaped in accordance with one's expectations and how one considers that others interpret their pain, the social pain being just another element for diagnosis, which will have influence in the modulation of pain, and on how it is confronted and expressed.

### The 12 dimensions of health impacts of war (the 12-D framework): a novel framework to conceptualise impacts of war on social and environmental determinants of health and public health [^113vLRLd]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Initiatives such as the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015 and more recently Global Health Security (GHS) popularised by the WHO and UN system were lost opportunities to address health issues related to wars. The dilution of health impacts of war is illustrated in some of the documents related to GHS, defined as 'the activities required, both proactive and reactive, to minimise the danger and impact of acute public health events that endanger people's health across geographical regions and international boundaries'. Its objectives include the promotion of 'social stability, global public goods, equity or social justice, and recognising shared responsibilities by governments across national boundaries'. However, subsequent sentences narrow down this overarching approach and begin to focus on impacts of microbes, vectors and invasions by diseases, instead of including a broader canvas of issues of security such as wars. This is operationalised by the GHS Index 2021, which is used to assesses the severity of security risks of countries using 6 categories, 37 indicators and 171 questions. Five of the six categories of GHS, ie prevention, detection and reporting, rapid response, health system, compliance with international norms, mainly focus on infectious threats such as antimicrobial resistance, zoonotic diseases, infection control practices and biosecurity. The sixth category termed 'Risk Environment' has the potential to capture war as a risk to global public health security since it deals with determinants such as political and security factors. It has five indicators, and the most relevant is the indicator 'Political and Security risks', which in turn has seven subcategories: government effectiveness, orderly transfers of power, risk of social unrest, illicit activities by non-state actors, armed conflict, government territorial control and international tensions. See below (table 1).

Questions under the sub-categories relevant to war

Its last subcategory is 'International tensions' draws attention to 'inter-state wars' by posing the question, 'Is there a threat that international disputes/tensions could have a negative effect?' This indirect and twisted approach observed in the literature could be viewed as an attempt to shy away from addressing one of the most important public health catastrophes imposed on humanity by humans, that is, wars. It is in this context that the 12-D framework was developed with the goal to raise awareness to the multidimensional health-related impacts of wars.

### Impacts of psychological science on national security agencies post-9 / 11 [^1133EZfL]. The American Psychologist (2011). Low credibility.

Psychologists have been an integral part of national security agencies since World War I, when psychological science helped in personnel selection. A robust infrastructure supporting wider applications of psychology to military and intelligence problems developed further during World War II and the years following, primarily in the areas of testing, human factors, perception, and the decision sciences. Although the nature of the attacks on 9/11 raised the level of perceived need for increased human-based intelligence, the impacts of psychologists on the policies and practices of national security agencies in the decade since have not increased significantly.

### Mitigating the global health threat of violent conflict: a preventive framework [^114YRNqK]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

The prevention principle: addressing the precursors of conflict

The prevention principle, proposed by Shapiro and Kinon, suggests that the global health community can best prevent violent conflict by addressing its precursors 'at the earliest possible time at the lowest legitimate level'. The earlier one acts to prevent violence, the less damage there will be to population health and economic security; and the more localised and credible the stakeholders involved in the intervention, the more likely they will account for the nuanced political, historical and cultural context.

A comprehensive approach to prevention must address conflict's structural and situational roots. At the structural level, the global health community can promote initiatives to address inequalities in access to social services, political power, status and wealth. For example, global health practitioners can create a multistakeholder coalition on the prevention of violent conflict that lobbies for structural reform and laws that respect the dignity of all members of society. This coalition could launch an international campaign to mobilise the insights and authority of the global health community to promote peaceful societies, building on the work of organisations such as the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War and its Campaign to Prevent Armed Violence.

The global health community also has an important role to play in mitigating the situational roots of conflict — the local, on-the-ground triggers that exacerbate tension. First, global health scholars can collaborate with public health specialists and local conflict resolution experts to research early warning systems, building on epidemiological modelling of disease tracking to improve statistical indicators and qualitative measures of emerging conflict within and across borders. Because individuals suffering from conflict-inflicted injury often seek out medical help, health systems often have unique access to data on early warning signs of incipient conflict.

Second, global health leaders can 'immunise' groups from violent conflict and its downstream effects through formal and informal educational initiatives. Global health workers can gain skill in culturally tailored consensus-building methods, model those behaviours and promote their widespread application. Local health professionals can collaborate with schools to teach students practical, widely accepted concepts of constructive conflict resolution such as the importance of perspective taking and looking beneath a disputant's stated position to understand underlying interests. Global health leaders can join with non-partisan conflict resolution organisations to train top decision makers in interest-based negotiation, an empirically supported method to help disputants shift from staunch political postures to mutually satisfying agreements.

### The history and threat of biological warfare and terrorism [^11731RtE]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The inevitable conclusion is that the availability of biological warfare agents and supporting technologic infrastructure, coupled with the fact that there are many people motivated to do harm to the United States, means that America must be prepared to defend her homeland against biological agents. Some have argued to the contrary, that the threat and risks from a biological weapon attack are not to be considered serious, because [39]: They've not been used yet on a large scale so they probably won't be in the near future. Their use is so morally repugnant that they probably won't be used at all. The technologic hurdles associated with isolating, growing, purifying, weaponizing, and disseminating adequate quantities of pathologic agents are so high that only the most advanced laboratories could attempt the process. Similar to a 'nuclear winter', the aftermath of a biological attack is so unthinkable that none would attempt it. Unfortunately, the trends associated with biotechnology globalization, terrorist group dynamics, and global/regional politics render these beliefs untenable and inappropriate, as recent events have underscored. To that end, the United States has accelerated its program of defense against biological weapons, as it must. Biological weapons are such dreadful weapons of uniqueness and complexity that a specific defense strategy is paramount. Elements of this program include pharmaceutical stockpiles, heightened surveillance systems, energized vaccine development programs, and comprehensive training initiatives. Although the depth and breadth of these efforts are unprecedented, above all these efforts is the absolute necessity for medical and public health care professionals to be educated and actively involved. These professionals are the sine qua non of future defensive readiness. This is just the start; unfortunately, there is no end yet in sight.

Language to reduce stigma — when communicating with Veterans and active duty Service members, considering that language can shape perceptions is important; the term "attack" can carry "negative connotations" and "might have strong connotations for Veterans and active duty Service members", so "you might consider using phrases such as 'symptom onset' or 'symptom escalation' rather than the word attack", and "asking the Veteran or active duty Service member their language preference can be helpful to describe both discrete headaches and their overall headache disease".

### Exploring motivated reasoning in polarization over the unfolding 2023 judicial reform in Israel [^111X3kML]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Perceived societal polarization

Participants rated the extent to which they think Israel is polarized, without mentioning the reform. Higher scores indicated higher perceived polarization.

Motivated perceptions

We assessed two perceptions that can be motivated by participants' views on the reform — false consensus and importance of democratic features. To assess false consensus, we looked at participants' perceptions of the distribution of opinions about the reform in the population. Participants indicated the percentage of the population that supports, opposes, and has no opinion about the reform (adding up to 100). False consensus manifests when participants estimate their own camp (either pro- or anti-reform) as larger than the other camps. To assess importance of democratic features, we presented participants with six features — majority rule, separation of power between branches of government, protection of minority rights, independent and free media, free elections, and protection of human rights for everyone equally. Participants rated the extent to which they believe each feature is important to Israel's democracy.

Motivated downstream consequences

Participants rated their opinions regarding downstream consequences that can be motivated by the extremity of their views on the reform (i.e. issue-based polarization) and their feeling towards opposing camps (i.e. affective polarization). Following Exploratory Factor Analysis (see Supplementary Methods 4 in SI for full description), we focused on four immediate downstream consequences of polarization: endorsement of extreme protest methods (e.g. civil revolt), support of extreme protest control (e.g. police violence), conflict management strategies (e.g. compromise, dialogue), and delegitimization of political opponents. Delegitimization was assessed in the context of the judicial reform. Participants rated characteristics of people who support the reform and of people who oppose it (e.g. "They do not understand what democracy is", "They want revenge"). As with affective polarization, for each participant, we used only the items reflecting delegitimization of the opposing camp. Higher scores indicated greater delegitimization.

### The 12 dimensions of health impacts of war (the 12-D framework): a novel framework to conceptualise impacts of war on social and environmental determinants of health and public health [^1125H9tR]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Global rates of armed conflicts have shown an alarming increase since 2008. These conflicts have devastating and long-term cumulative impacts on health. The overriding aim in these conflicts is to achieve military or political goals by harming human life, which is the antithesis of the moral underpinnings of the health professions. However, the profession has rarely taken on a global advocacy role to prevent and eliminate conflicts and wars. To assume such a role, the health profession needs to be aware of the extensive and multiple impacts that wars have on population health. To facilitate this discourse, the author proposes a novel framework called 'The Twelve Dimensions of Health Impacts of War' (or the 12-D framework). The framework is based on the concepts of social and environmental determinants of population health. It has 12 interconnected 'dimensions' beginning with the letter D, capturing the adverse impacts on health (n = 5), its social (n = 4) and environmental determinants (n = 3). For health, the indices are Deaths, Disabilities, Diseases, Dependency and Deformities. For social determinants of health, there are Disparities in socioeconomic status, Displacements of populations, Disruptions to the social fabric and Development reversals. For environmental determinants, there is Destruction of infrastructure, Devastation of the environment and Depletion of natural resources. A relatively simple framework could help researchers and lay public to understand the magnitude and quantify the widespread health, social and environmental impacts of war, comprehensively. Further validation and development of this framework are necessary to establish it as a universal metric for quantifying the horrific impacts of war on the planet and garner support for initiatives to promote global peace.

### Current methods for the rapid diagnosis of bioterrorism-related infectious agents [^115ojmpQ]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Bioterrorism is the calculated use of violence against civilians to attain political, religious, or ideologic goals using weapons of biological warfare. Bioterrorism is of particular concern because these weapons can be manufactured with ease and do not require highly sophisticated technology. Moreover, biologic agents can be delivered and spread easily and can effect a large population and geographic area. The terrorist attacks occurring around the world necessitate society's continued investment in adequate defense against these unpredictable and irrational events.

### The political and security dimensions of the humanitarian health response to violent conflict [^113F21Jf]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

The nature of armed conflict throughout the world is intensely dynamic. Consequently, the protection of non-combatants and the provision of humanitarian services must continually adapt to this changing conflict environment. Complex political affiliations, the systematic use of explosive weapons and sexual violence, and the use of new communication technology, including social media, have created new challenges for humanitarian actors in negotiating access to affected populations and security for their own personnel. The nature of combatants has also evolved as armed, non-state actors might have varying motivations, use different forms of violence, and engage in a variety of criminal activities to generate requisite funds. New health threats, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and new capabilities, such as modern trauma care, have also created new challenges and opportunities for humanitarian health provision. In response, humanitarian policies and practices must develop negotiation and safety capabilities, informed by political and security realities on the ground, and guidance from affected communities. More fundamentally, humanitarian policies will need to confront a changing geopolitical environment, in which traditional humanitarian norms and protections might encounter wavering support in the years to come.

### Healthocide and medical neutrality: a call for action and reflection [^113hercW]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

These attacks have been met with astounding silence or, at best, terse and often belated statements from American, European, or Israeli medical associations, professional groups, and journals. Are medical doctors ready to forsake the principle of medical neutrality, first forged amidst the carnage of 19th century wars and profoundly reshaped following the liberation of Nazi death camps in 1945? And if so, at what cost? As difficult as this question is, it is one that physicians must address as they grapple with the normalisation of healthcare's weaponisation in a world where warfare has changed dramatically, marked by the use of Artificial Intelligence for mass killing, the reliance on drones and killing robots, the deployment of internationally banned weapons, which carry devastating public health and ecological consequences, and of course the looming threat of nuclear weapons.

Medical neutrality refers to the principles and laws that protect healthcare workers and facilities from attack during armed conflict and civil unrest. Even if it cannot always be fully upheld, it has served as the foundation of medical humanitarianism throughout the latter half of the 20th century. While neutrality is not absolute — and healthcare professionals, including humanitarians, often operate within complex political landscapes — medical neutrality has emerged as both a concept and an ethic of care in times of war and crisis. It evolved alongside growing recognition of fundamental human rights, such as the rights to care, dignity, health, and life. Medical neutrality is understood not only as a legal and ethical framework protecting medical personnel, but also as a critical mechanism for ensuring that care reaches those most in need during conflict. Crucially, it also safeguards healthcare workers as they deliver care — wherever it is needed — and serves as a bulwark against targeted violence.

### Fake news, real war [^111qxduk]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Finally, if disinformation functions as malicious intergroup gossip, then strategic counter-gossip should be explored as a potential deterrent. Liberal democracies do not need to manufacture falsehoods; instead, they can amplify truthful narratives about the corruption, human rights abuses, and failings of authoritarian regimes or actors that rely on disinformation. While ethical concerns surrounding counter-disinformation campaigns must be carefully considered, transparency and the factual reporting of adversary misconduct remain legitimate and effective tools for deterrence.

As in other domains of conflict, passivity invites aggression. Disinformation is not only a problem of belief — it is a problem of power. A comprehensive response must integrate behavioral science insights with legal accountability and strategic deterrence, targeting both the cognitive vulnerabilities of individuals and the behaviors of disinformation architects. By broadening the scope in this way, we can build a more effective and resilient information ecosystem.

### Defence context for the UK's defence engagement (health) [^1172Harx]. BMJ Military Health (2024). High credibility.

Defence Engagement (DE) has been a core UK Defence task since 2015. DE (Health) is the use of military medical capabilities to achieve DE effects within the health sector to achieve security and defence objectives. DE (Health) practitioners must understand the underlying defence context that shapes these objectives. The strategic context is becoming more uncertain with the return of great power competition layered on enduring threats from non-state actors and transnational challenges. The UK response has been to develop the Integrated Review, outlining four national security and international policy objectives. UK Defence has responded by developing the integrated operating concept, differentiating military activity between operating and warfighting. Engage is one of the three functions of operate activity, which is complementary to the other operate functions of protect and constrain. DE (Health) can play a unique role in engagement, given its ability to develop new partnerships through health-related activity. DE (Health) may be an enabler for other engagements or to enable the protect and constrain functions. This will be dependent on delivering improvement in health outcomes. Therefore, the DE (Health) practitioner must be conversant with both the contemporary defence and global health contexts to deliver effective DE (Health) activities. This is an article commissioned for the DE special issue of BMJ Military Health.

### Ethics in times of conflict: some reflections on syria, in the backdrop of Iraq [^114FSq2m]. BMJ Global Health (2016). Medium credibility.

Iraq

Fifteen years following our experience in south Lebanon, few lessons appear to have been learnt from the 'embedded' narratives of 'good' and 'evil' of the Iraq war. That this narrative was orchestrated by a US-led coalition, to retain a monopoly on news of the human cost of the invasion and on the polity and society of Iraq, is well documented. During the 2003 Iraq invasion, ground realities affecting civilians were reported by journalists 'embedded' in the front line, meaning all information was derived from the US-led coalition front. The global audience rarely received information independent of the military. Since the war had caused a huge rift between the public and political leaders in the Western world, there was need to control its outputs. The false trigger for the war, that is, the Weapons of Mass Destruction, was unravelled only afterwards, marking the Iraq war as one of the biggest Western follies of the 20th century, for its human, economic, social and political consequences.

Results of civilian deaths published by the Lancet in 2006 undermined official narrative on 'precision' bombing and 'targeted' warfare. Researchers in the USA and Europe challenged its findings, mostly on methodological grounds; some led by coalition governments, others with considerable chagrin. The credibility of authors, the methodology used and even the possibility of a 'conspiracy' by the Lancet were raised due to the date of publication, prior to a US election. While such challenges within and across scientific research are routinely part of academic discourse, the systematic attempts at discrediting data from the study of Burnham and colleagues in the Lancet, against embedded reporting, established an ominous trend: it highlighted attempts to influence science with journalistic reporting and official discourse on the war in Iraq. This kind of pressure is of concern because many reporters 'embedded' in Iraq have since admitted they regretted not cross-checking evidence provided by the coalition forces. Despite this, however, had it not been for WikiLeaks (in 2010), we would probably never have known of systematic abuse at Abu Ghraib prison, or of the executions of innocent civilians by members of the US army and its subcontractors. Their mission to promote democracy was often in total violation of the international laws guiding rules of engagement in conflict.

### Reconceptualising health security in post-COVID-19 world [^115bdfit]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

While drawing upon the existing literature and policy documents on health security and its practice at the national and global levels, this article shows that the idea of health security has mostly remained rhetoric or at the most conceptualised and operationalised within the narrow Westphalian tradition of protecting nation states from external threats. By undertaking a critical examination of the national security strategies of some powerful G-20 countries, we show that non-traditional threats such as infectious diseases and pandemics are either absent from the list of potential threats or are accorded a weak priority and addressed within the state and military-centric notion of security. This approach has shortcomings that are laid bare by the ongoing pandemic. In this article, we show how national and global health security agendas can be advanced much more productively by mobilising a wider securitisation discourse that is driven by the human security paradigm as advanced by the United Nations in 1994, that considers people rather than states as the primary referent of security and that emphasises collective action rather than competition to address the transnational nature of security threats. We discuss the relevance of this paradigm in broadening the concept of health security in view of the contemporary and future threats to public health.

### Interim planning guidance for preparedness and response to a mass casualty event resulting from terrorist use of explosives [^112YUgai]. CDC (2010). Medium credibility.

Media engagement in mass casualty events — a strategy for clear, reliable, and contiguous messages should be established to inform the public continuously about the progress of the event, and leaders have a great deal of influence over the expectations, understanding, and responses of both individuals and communities to an MCE; informing the public in a timely manner can decrease the flow of worried well patients and lessen demands on the health care system, and this communication planning should be a joint effort of key stakeholders.

### Future pandemics and the urge to' do something' [^111hbBzZ]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2025). Medium credibility.

How reliable are proponents' assertions that the benefits of ePPP research outweigh its risks?

In many areas of medicine, it makes sense to defer to expert (e.g. clinical) judgement, even if clinicians cannot articulate the experience and wisdom that ground their judgement. However, this is not true when we have reason to believe that expert judgements are likely to be compromised by biases that undermine their reliability, as they often are.

And we have such reason in the case of experts who support ePPP research.

First, processes generating expert intuitions could underestimate the probability of a human-engineered pandemic. In response to concerns about risky research, proponents cite existing regulatory structures as if they could not fail or be evaded by a malevolent actor. Such underappreciation may reflect the sheer fact that we have never experienced a devastating engineered pandemic (that the risk is 'theoretical' not 'tangible'). It may also reflect the common tendency to assign too little weight to what are perceived as small probability events, acting as if the probability were zero. The combined bias is especially common in risky decisions that one has made frequently without experiencing harm — precisely the situation of proponent researchers who have never unleashed a pandemic. Proponents' trope that 'nature is the ultimate bioterrorist and we need to do all we can to stay one step ahead' neglects what actual bioterrorists could do with future capabilities. In light of these considerations, there is a high probability that proponents are underestimating the probability that ePPP research will produce engineered pandemics.

### Crisis + emergency risk communication. 2012 edition [^111t4osm]. CDC (2012). Medium credibility.

Stakeholder and partner communication — when issues are framed broadly, communicators are directed to "ask questions that are more specific to the audience" to surface concrete concerns and actions, using prompts such as "What are the ramifications to you (your family, your community, or the nation) when faced with this current problem?", "What consequences are you hoping to avoid?", "What do you see as the worst outcome for you (or your community)?", and "What courses of action do you believe could lead to this outcome?" The page adds that "Questions that encourage audience members to state the benefits they would like to see result from a course of action may promote understanding of anticipated outcomes", with examples including "Because you have brought up quarantine, what benefits would you (or your community) expect if you accepted quarantine as a course of action to reduce spread of disease?" and "From what I understand, you are looking for a way to protect yourself (or your family or community) from more illness or death. If I can explain how quarantine will meet those needs, are you open to implementing it?" It emphasizes the approach by noting, "Allowing people to persuade themselves is not an easy process" and that "It is the most effective way to gain your audience's acceptance in thought and behavior".

### Surgeons in conflict zones: ethical considerations beyond the operating room [^116NDA7f]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2025). Medium credibility.

THE SURGEON'S ROLE DURING ASYMMETRIC WARFARE

As surgeons confronting modern conflicts, we must also acknowledge the ethical imperatives in asymmetric warfare — conflicts between grossly unequal powers where 1 side possesses overwhelming technological, economic, and military advantages. These asymmetries stem from historic, social, and political inequities and typically result in disproportionate civilian casualties among vulnerable populations.

Physicians working in conflict have traditionally emphasized remaining neutral from the standpoint of political advocacy. We believe that this tradition is appropriate and should not be compromised in asymmetric conflicts. However, when power disparities between parties are extreme, political neutrality may be used as an excuse for silence, reinforcing existing inequities. Such power disparities between warring parties often lead to claims that reporting of civilian casualties, attacks on healthcare infrastructure, or patterns of indiscriminate violence are a violation of medical neutrality, but this is not the case. Neutrality requires healthcare workers to care for all, regardless of affiliation, and to report potential crimes that they have witnessed regardless of the political alignment of the suspected perpetrators, not to report equal numbers of crimes committed by 2 warring parties. Reporting is not a political act but rather a fulfillment of our ethical obligation to truth and the protection of human dignity. Surgeons must maintain their professional integrity while recognizing that documentation of disproportionate civilian casualties, targeted destruction of healthcare infrastructure, and patterns of indiscriminate violence uphold the humanitarian principles of humanity and impartiality, and the ethical principle of justice, by ensuring that suffering is acknowledged regardless of who inflicts it and who suffers from it. Surgeons have a crucial role in these contexts, not only treating the wounded but bearing witness to the consequences of violence. Justice — the fair and equitable treatment of all people — is one of the ethical pillars of medicine, and requires accountability for harms and the restoration of equal rights alongside human dignity. The promotion of peace through justice should constitute the foundational imperative of injury prevention initiatives of surgical societies, in both national and international contexts, including reporting on crimes witnessed by surgeons in times of armed conflict.

### Genomics and future biological weapons: the need for preventive action by the biomedical community [^1157SAM7]. Nature Genetics (2001). Medium credibility.

There is an increasing concern within both the scientific and security communities that the ongoing revolution in biology has great potential to be misused in offensive biological weapons programs. In light of the 11 September tragedy, we can no longer afford to be complacent about the possibility of biological terrorism. Here we review the major relevant trends in genomics research and development, and discuss how these capabilities might be misused in the design of new bioweapons. We also discuss how the breakthroughs that have come from the genomics revolution may be used to enhance detection, protection and treatment so that biological warfare agents are never used.

### Foresight approaches for future health shocks: integration into policy making and accompanying research priorities [^117Qux5w]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Principle 5 — Situational awareness

Situational awareness involves anticipating and being prepared to respond to challenges associated with any given emergency. A deep understanding of the current context and resources is needed to enable both preventive and response planning — and an understanding of how communities will react to different emergencies.

For instance, preparedness might take the form of "war gaming" exercises (meaning simulation of a crisis situation in a "safe-to-fail" environment to better prepare key actors to respond to a real crisis). Recent examples include pandemic preparedness exercises in the UK, as well as system maps of local healthcare, social care, and transport options for flood resilience. Part of situational awareness should include what Curtis and colleagues call "enhanced risk identification". This not only identifies communities at most risk from specified disasters but also seeks to understand what (modifiable and non-modifiable) factors contribute to that risk. This information could be captured in existing protocols such as risk registers.

The final stage in creating resilient and effective preparedness plans is to enable rapid identification of when an emergency has begun. Although the occurrence of a fire or a flood may be obvious, an emerging pandemic or a wide scale cyber attack may not immediately be treated as an emergency. Slow recognition of an emergency delays action and makes effective responses more difficult. This is especially true if the optimal response (prevention of escalation) can be implemented only in the very early stages (for example, when an infectious disease is spreading).

A key challenge to overcome is normalcy bias, which results from a combination of our unfamiliarity with extreme events and the tendency to believe that things will continue to function in the future in the same way as they have in the past. Normalcy bias causes people to minimise, question, or disregard warnings of imminent threats because they are so far beyond the realm of our experience as to make them unbelievable. This is compounded in decision makers by a reluctance to take expensive action that might be unnecessary.

Research priorities related to situational awareness include how to incorporate new understanding of the causes of enhanced risk in emergency preparedness policies; how best to plan for a range of community responses following an emergency; and supporting the rapid identification of new emergencies(for instance, exploring the implementation and impact of methods such as adaptive surveillance and horizon scanning within foresight approaches).

### Quantifying the dynamics of failure across science, startups and security [^113jKktv]. Nature (2019). Excellent credibility.

Human achievements are often preceded by repeated attempts that fail, but little is known about the mechanisms that govern the dynamics of failure. Here, building on previous research relating to innovation 1–7, human dynamics 8–11 and learning 12–17, we develop a simple one-parameter model that mimics how successful future attempts build on past efforts. Solving this model analytically suggests that a phase transition separates the dynamics of failure into regions of progression or stagnation and predicts that, near the critical threshold, agents who share similar characteristics and learning strategies may experience fundamentally different outcomes following failures. Above the critical point, agents exploit incremental refinements to systematically advance towards success, whereas below it, they explore disjoint opportunities without a pattern of improvement. The model makes several empirically testable predictions, demonstrating that those who eventually succeed and those who do not may initially appear similar, but can be characterized by fundamentally distinct failure dynamics in terms of the efficiency and quality associated with each subsequent attempt. We collected large-scale data from three disparate domains and traced repeated attempts by investigators to obtain National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants to fund their research, innovators to successfully exit their startup ventures, and terrorist organizations to claim casualties in violent attacks. We find broadly consistent empirical support across all three domains, which systematically verifies each prediction of our model. Together, our findings unveil detectable yet previously unknown early signals that enable us to identify failure dynamics that will lead to ultimate success or failure. Given the ubiquitous nature of failure and the paucity of quantitative approaches to understand it, these results represent an initial step towards the deeper understanding of the complex dynamics underlying failure.

### Biodefence and the production of knowledge: rethinking the problem [^114hrbXG]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2013). Low credibility.

Biodefence, broadly understood as efforts to prevent or mitigate the damage of a bioterrorist attack, raises a number of ethical issues, from the allocation of scarce biomedical research and public health funds, to the use of coercion in quarantine and other containment measures in the event of an outbreak. In response to the US bioterrorist attacks following September 11, significant US policy decisions were made to spur scientific enquiry in the name of biodefence. These decisions led to a number of critical institutional changes within the US federal government agencies governing scientific research. Subsequent science policy discussions have focused largely on 'the dual use problem': how to preserve the openness of scientific research while preventing research undertaken for the prevention or mitigation of biological threats from third parties. We join others in shifting the ethical debate over biodefence away from a simple framing of the problem as one of dual use, by demonstrating how a dual use framing distorts the debate about bioterrorism and truncates discussion of the moral issues. We offer an alternative framing rooted in social epistemology and institutional design theory, arguing that the ethical and policy debates regarding 'dual use' biomedical research ought to be reframed as a larger optimisation problem across a plurality of values including, among others: (1) the production of scientific knowledge; (2) the protection of human and animal subjects; (3) the promotion and protection of public health (national and global); (4) freedom of scientific enquiry; and (5) the constraint of government power.

### The effect of military training on the sense of agency and outcome processing [^112dkdYM]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Some social structures, such as the armed forces, rely on a strict hierarchical organization where people are required to follow orders. Historical precedentsand early experimental studies, drew attention to how markedly coercive orders can transform normal patterns of behavior. Milgramreported that 65% of his volunteer participants administered what were described to be dangerous levels of electrical shock to another individual they had just met few minutes before, simply because they had been ordered by an experimenter to do so for the sake of the experiment.

In normal circumstances, society assumes that individuals are responsible for the outcomes of their actions. However, individuals are also expected to conform to more-or-less rigid social rules governing behavior. Individuals are thus constantly in balance between taking full responsibility for their own actions, and subjugating their personal action choices to social forces, at which point the notion of personal responsibility seems less pertinent. Military personnel acting under command represent an extreme of this balancing act, since their professional role implies compliance to hierarchical authority, based on the mandate society has given to that authority. The structure of most armies is based on strict hierarchies where people have a professional legal duty to follow orders. At the same time, they also have a professional legal duty to disobey illegal orders. In recognition of this unusual structure of responsibility, military personnel acting under orders are often considered differently from other agents in discussions of responsibility. In particular, under some circumstances, though certainly not all, "only obeying orders" may be accepted as a basis of diminished responsibility. Here we ask how the highly hierarchical and even coercive structure of the military affects the experience of autonomy and agency.

### Firefighter perceptions of COVID-19 mitigation strategies and messaging [^112QKjHq]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The COVID-19 pandemic presented significant public health and operational challenges for the fire service, exposing firefighters to heightened risks of infection and increased distrust and confusion.

Methods

This qualitative study explored US firefighters' perceptions of COVID-19-related protective measures and public health messaging.

Results

Interviews with 17 firefighters from diverse geographic regions revealed key themes, including communication challenges, trust and distrust in public health authorities, concerns about autonomy, and the controversial nature of mask usage and vaccination.

Conclusions

Findings highlight the critical role of trust, transparency, and consistent messaging in effective science and health communication. Participants emphasized the need for evidence-based educational materials, proactive partnerships with healthcare providers, and enhanced training in research literacy. These insights provide actionable recommendations for fire service leaders, city managers, and public health officials to develop tailored, trust-building communication strategies.

### Global health security and the health-security nexus: principles, politics and praxis [^1133em9s]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

The past four decades have seen a steady rise of references to 'security' by health academics, policy-makers and practitioners, particularly in relation to threats posed by infectious disease pandemics. Yet, despite an increasingly dominant health security discourse, the many different ways in which health and security issues and actors intersect have remained largely unassessed and unpacked in current critical global health scholarship. This paper discusses the emerging and growing health-security nexus in the wake of COVID-19 and the international focus on global health security. In recognising the contested and fluid concept of health security, this paper presents two contrasting approaches to health security: neocolonial health security and universal health security. Building from this analysis, we present a novel heuristic that delineates the multiple intersections and entanglements between health and security actors and agendas to broaden our conceptualisation of global health security configurations and practices and to highlight the potential for harmful unintended consequences, the erosion of global health norms and values, and the risk of health actors being co-opted by the security sector.

Public information for an MCE — leaders have much influence over the expectations, understanding, and responses of both individuals and communities to an MCE, and the management of the acute situation sets the tone for the ways society will respond. Accurately describing ongoing efforts and successfully forecasting predictable events will enhance the credibility of authorities and diminish negative outcomes, and informing the public in a timely manner can decrease the flow of worried well patients and lessen demands on the health care system. This communications campaign should be a joint effort by emergency medical services (EMS), hospitals, and other health care facilities.

### The effect of military training on the sense of agency and outcome processing [^1171uqU4]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Although obedience is an essential aspect of the efficiency of armed forces, international law state clearly that military members must refuse orders if they do not fit in the interest of the service or if they imply committing a crime. On the one hand, soldiers may have to disengage their moral control to follow orders and take distance from their personal responsibilitybecause the organizational objectives may imply actions that society rejects in peacetime (notably, killing and wounding others). On the other hand, past and recent events show that refusing an illegitimate or illegal order is far from straightforward, and requires considerable personal courage. In the present study, we could not investigate to what extent a strong sense of agency helps individuals to resist illegitimate orders, since disobedience rates were extremely low. This question would nonetheless be worth investigating to understand how to manage the risks associated with blind obedience.

Previous studies reported that the sense of agency decreased as the number of alternative possible actions decreased. This could explain the reduced sense of agency in the coercion condition, where participants have only one action available, relative to our free-choice condition, where two actions are available. In the present experiment, the response set size was similar for all the groups tested, but only civilians and senior cadets displayed a coercion effect. This suggests that sense of agency under coercion is a matter of how context influences choice, rather than the strict availability of a number of choices. One might also suggest that in our study we did not control for causality between experimental conditions since participants received an auditory instruction in the coercion condition but not in the free-choice condition, which corresponds to real-life situations. However, previous studies involving a verbal instruction in both conditions yet observed the coercion effect on sense of agency, e.g. ref. Further, a difference in causality or instruction could not explain differences between groups since all groups were instructed in the same way.

### Threat perceptions and the intention to acquire firearms [^111EANwa]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Firearm sales have surged during COVID-19, raising concerns about a coming wave of suicide deaths. Little is known, however, about the individuals considering acquiring firearms during the pandemic. Recent research has highlighted that individuals considering acquiring firearms may be motivated by exaggerated threat expectancies. In a sample of 3,500 Americans matched to 2010 United States Census data, we compared individuals intending to buy firearms in the coming 12 months (assessed in late June and early July 2020) to those undecided or not planning to acquire firearms on a range of demographic, anxiety, and firearm ownership variables. Our results indicated that those intending to acquire a firearm in the next twelve months are less tolerant of uncertainty, endorse exaggerated threat expectancies, and are experiencing more severe COVID-19 specific fears. Individuals intending to purchase firearms were also more likely to have experienced suicidal ideation in the past year, to have worked in law enforcement, and to have been considered essential workers during COVID-19. Furthermore, such individuals were more likely to already own firearms and to have purchased firearms during the opening months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Those intending to purchase firearms did not endorse lower perceived neighborhood safety, however, indicating that their intent to purchase firearms is unlikely to be driven by tangible threats in their immediate environment. These findings highlight that exaggerated fears may be motivating individuals to purchase firearms to diminish anxiety and that this trend may be particularly common among individuals who already own firearms.

### Power dynamics and health initiative design as determinants of peacebuilding: a case study of the Syrian conflict [^116D6C15]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

A literature review of published reports and peer-reviewed literature was conducted. We also drew on our collective field experience observing and implementing health initiatives in Syria; specifically working with international agencies and with/in local non-governmental organisations (NGO) on healthcare provision, community health campaigns, and humanitarian support mechanisms for refugees, internally displaced individuals and citizens of northern and southern Syria. We recognise that our positionality, including our nationality (Syrian, Syrian American or Arab American), language (all fluent in Arabic), our personal life-history (ie, ranging from only visiting to growing up in Syria), and professional experiences (ie, ranging from having done no prior research or practice to extensive academic and community work over 20 years in Syria) influence the design, conduct and interpretation of our analysis. Our mix of 'insider and outsider' positionalities relative to the Syrian conflict benefit our analysis. As insiders, we benefit from being able to ask meaningful questions given a priori knowledge in terms of culture and political context, enabling us to produce more 'thick description'. As outsiders, we benefit from being able to sufficiently detach ourselves from the culture and conflict to be able to study without bias.

We conducted the analysis at three levels of the power structure using a categorisation introduced by WHO's thematic paper on Health and Peace. State citizen level refers to disruption of vertical relations between the state and its citizens due to state-associated violence, territorial withdrawal, neglect and poor services. The interbelligerent level concerns the conflicts between armed parties or mid-level authorities, often driven by competition over political dominance, resources or differences in ideology, religion or ethnicity. Intercommunity level refers to the disruption in the horizontal relations between individuals and communities along primordial conflicts, which is aggravated by collective trauma due to atrocities and marginalisation.

General approaches of health initiatives at each level were assessed based on public reports, peer-reviewed scholarship, and field experience; aspects evaluated included the nature of healthcare provided (e.g. material vs service-dependent), geographical scope (e.g. national, regional or local), funding amount and sources, logistics (e.g. central vs local), implementers (e.g. authority linked vs community members) and credit attributions (e.g. authorities, agencies or community).

### Researchers' agency and the boundaries of global mental health: perspectives from and about Latin America [^114y4Jez]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

The decolonise global health movement has critically reassessed the field's historical and political underpinnings, urging researchers to recognise biases and power imbalances through reflexivity and action. Genuine change is seen as the outcome of the researcher's self-awareness, often leaving the underlying structures of global health-and global mental health (GMH)-in the background. Here, we problematise how expectations around agency and change have been mobilised in discussions around decolonisation, highlighting the gradual and contingent nature of international collaboration in GMH. We present three international research initiatives based in or focused on South America: RedeAmericas, the Platform for Social Research on Mental Health in Latin America and the HEalthcaRe wOrkErS project. Instead of comparing the three initiatives directly we identify and discuss common elements among them that challenge and redefine the boundaries of GMH by leveraging local leadership, creating hybrid expert profiles and implementing principles of equity and epistemic justice. Particular attention is given to the fragmentary translation of these principles into the project's concrete activities. The interplay of agency and the structural confines of GMH is examined in each initiative, expanding the notion of 'boundaries' in the field beyond geographical or institutional demarcations. Using the notion of milieu, we call for a more nuanced understanding of the field as simultaneously shaping and being shaped by the tentative collaborative infrastructures developed by researchers. We advocate for a reconceptualisation of GMH that is as diverse and complex as the issues it seeks to address.

### Expressing freedom and taking liberties: the paradoxes of aberrant science [^114YrKKV]. Medical Humanities (2006). Low credibility.

Complete freedom does not exist, despite people's preparedness to die for it. Scientific freedom is much defended and yet much misunderstood. Scientists have limits imposed on their freedom by the disciplines and discourse communities in which they place themselves. Freedom within these socially constructed constraints needs to be distinguished from taking liberties with the rules and practices that make up these constraints, and validate the activities of special groups within society. Scientists (and the public) perceive taking liberties with science's rules and practices as aberrant science, and they often react punitively. Aberrant science can be broadly examined under four headings: wicked science, naughty science, dysfunctional science, and ideologically unacceptable science. When we examine examples of perceived aberrant science, we find that these categories of "misconduct" are connected and often confused. Scientific freedom needs to be redefined with due regard to current understandings of scientists as human beings facing powerful social pressures to deliver results of a particular kind.

### The neuropsychiatric aftermath of exposure to weapons of mass destruction: applying historical lessons to protect health during the war in Ukraine [^117V1tQh]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Previous WMD disasters revealed that assessment of risk and protective factors before, during, and after the event are crucial in providing optimal care for affected people (Shigemura et al.). These factors include, but are not limited to, prior and current mental health and trauma exposure, physical health conditions, socioeconomic conditions, social support, risk and health perceptions, and stigma. It is important for healthcare workers to respect and acknowledge patient concerns about exposure to invisible WMD agents while also providing timely medical evaluation. Healthcare workers can build trust and enhance protective health behaviors within communities through empathic listening as well as clear and understandable messages. It is also crucial that the compound effects of war and WMD trauma be anticipated and evaluated. For instance, victims of physical or sexual violence in war may have enhanced fear response to perceived WMD exposure. In humanitarian or emergency settings, utilization of brief, simple fact sheets with specific actions to protect health might be useful to enhance communication with patients who are under extreme stress and may be unable to assimilate complex health information (Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress). It is important for healthcare workers to remember that while these exposures might have occurred suddenly and quickly, the care many people will need could be very long-lasting.

Healthcare workers also experience unique challenges during WMD events likely to be complicated by stress on global healthcare systems from the COVID-19 pandemic, which itself offers lessons learned to protect the health of workers (Morganstein & Flynn). Fear for personal and family safety from exposure or contamination following work activities are common, and best addressed through ensuring adequate supplies and training in personal protective equipment use and procedures, such as decontamination. Organizational factors within healthcare systems, such as timely, updated crisis communication messaging, as well as clear and consistently applied policies and procedures reduce distress and enhance functioning for healthcare workers (Brooks, Dunn, Amlôt, Rubin, & Greenberg). Peer support during the stress of WMD events can foster a sense of safety and connectedness to bridge isolation that results from ongoing uncertainty and required use of protective barrier equipment. Leadership actions, such as role modeling of self-help and stress management, as well as being present with personnel in their workspace to address concerns and remind them of the value of their work are actions that protect health and enhance operational sustainment (Geerts et al.).

### Public awareness of and personal willingness to use California's extreme risk protection order law to prevent firearm-related harm [^115b1H19]. JAMA Health Forum (2021). High credibility.

Finally, it will also be necessary to address distrust of the mainstream criminal legal system, which has systematically oppressed and disenfranchised Asian, Black, and Latinx communities through historical and present policies and practices. More than 20% of respondents who were not at all willing to use a GVRO in 1 or more risk scenarios cited distrust in the fairness of the system and 16% said they did not want to involve the court. A separate analysis that is not yet published will examine whether responses fell along any specific or expected racial-ethnic lines. As recently argued, it will be essential to include assessment of social inequities associated with ERPO implementation and future evaluation — including possible consequences of unequal enforcement and benefits of reduced harm — so that the use of these tools does not perpetuate the uneven burden of structurally rooted trauma and injustice within marginalized communities.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, we relied on self-reported data, which is subject to nonresponse and social desirability biases; however, nonresponse rates were low in the study sample, and evidence suggests that completion rates are higher and social desirability bias is lower in online panel surveys than in random-digit-dial telephone surveys. Second, although we think these findings can inform understandings of EPRO implementation in other states, California is unique. Geographic variations in firearm ownership and the cultural acceptability of firearms, firearm violence, and firearm regulations should be considered when attempting to generalize these results. Third, primary analyses that collapse response categories (eg, somewhat, usually, and always appropriate; somewhat and very willing) may mask more nuanced differences in the extent of support for GVRO appropriateness and willingness overall and by firearm ownership status. However, given the polarizing nature of gun policy discourse, we posit that any indication of support for the appropriateness of or willingness to use an EPRO is not only noteworthy, but may also be valuable for changing behavior via subjective norms — ie, beliefs that an important person or group of people will approve and support a particular behavior. Finally, although we measured the public's perceived appropriateness of GVROs in general and their personal willingness to use these tools, the extent to which such support translates into real-world action is unclear.

### Biodefence research two decades on: worth the investment? [^114mfXvv]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

For the past 20 years, the notion of bioterror has been a source of considerable fear and panic worldwide. In response to the terror attacks of 2001 in the USA, extensive research funding was awarded to investigate bioterror-related pathogens. The global scientific legacy of this funding has extended into the present day, highlighted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Unsurprisingly, the surge in biodefence-related research and preparedness has been met with considerable apprehension and opposition. Here, we briefly outline the history of modern bioterror threats and biodefence research, describe the scientific legacy of biodefence research by highlighting advances pertaining to specific bacterial and viral pathogens, and summarise the future of biodefence research and its relevance today. We sought to address the sizeable question: have the past 20 years of investment into biodefence research and preparedness been worth it? The legacy of modern biodefence funding includes advancements in biosecurity, biosurveillence, diagnostics, medical countermeasures, and vaccines. In summary, we feel that these advances justify the substantial biodefence funding trend of the past two decades and set a precedent for future funding.

### Political variations in pandemic lifestyles and COVID-19 vaccination by age cohort in the United States [^115rYwZA]. Preventive Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

While recent scholarship suggests that political affiliation is a robust predictor of pandemic behaviors and COVID-19 vaccination status, research has yet to examine whether the impact of political affiliation on these outcomes vary by age. Drawing on health lifestyles theory, we contribute to the social epidemiology of infectious disease behaviors by testing whether the impact of political affiliation on risky pandemic health lifestyles and COVID vaccination varies by age cohort. We employ data collected from the 2021 Crime, Health, and Politics Survey (CHAPS), a national study of adults from the United States, to formally assess this understudied association. In all models, Democrats reported less risky pandemic lifestyles compared to their Republican counterparts. Moreover, Democrats displayed greater odds of being vaccinated than Republicans or Independents. Further, the impact of political affiliation on vaccination status varied by age cohort, such that the impact of political affiliation was stronger among the oldest adults in our sample. Our analyses contribute to the growing study of politics and health lifestyles by challenging theoretical perspectives and cultural narratives that claim that older adults are less swayed by political influence when it comes to healthcare decisions. Our results help better our understanding of the ways in which political discourse shapes adopting public health recommendations.

### Guidelines for psychological practice with transgender and gender nonconforming people [^114rGxjt]. The American Psychologist (2015). Medium credibility.

Guideline 12 — psychologists strive to understand the effects that changes in gender identity and gender expression have on the romantic and sexual relationships of TGNC people — highlights relationship dynamics and safety considerations. Relationships involving TGNC people can be healthy and successful, and a study of successful relationships between TGNC men and cisgender women found that these couples attributed the success of their relationship to respect, honesty, trust, love, understanding, and open communication. Just as relationships between cisgender people can evolve in both positive and negative ways, so can relationships between TGNC people and their partners, with some violent partner threats impacting safety. Historical restrictions also shaped access to care and partnerships, as this restriction prescribed only certain relationship partners, denied access to surgery for trans men identifying as gay or bisexual or trans women identifying as lesbian or bisexual, and even required that TGNC people's existing legal marriages be dissolved before they could gain access to transition care. Disclosure of a TGNC identity can have an important impact on the relationship between TGNC people and their partners, and disclosure of TGNC status earlier in the relationship tends to be associated with better relationship outcomes, whereas disclosure of TGNC status many years into an existing relationship may be perceived as a betrayal.

### Exploring global health diplomacy in iran: insights from experts in health and foreign policy [^116J3cct]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The literature on global health diplomacy (GHD) is scarce, particularly in the context of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study thus explores the GHD concept, content, policy-making process and influencing factors in Iran from the perspectives of key health and foreign policy-makers.

Methods

This is a qualitative study using conventional content analysis. We conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 29 experts from the health and diplomatic sectors in Iran, supplemented by five focus group discussions. We used purposeful and snowball sampling techniques to identify key informants and continued data collection until saturation was achieved. Data analysis was facilitated by MAXQDA V.12 software.

Results

A lack of consensus emerged among the health and foreign policy-makers regarding the definition and importance of GHD, and the varying interpretations of the concept were influenced by the level of knowledge, personal experiences and professional backgrounds, values and belief systems of participants. GHD was found under a relative influence of-both explicit and implicit-ideological and political challenges in Iran. The excessive emphasis on the ideological aspects and the dominance of political, security and military considerations over other foreign policy objectives have been identified as a major barrier to achieving the desired policy goals. Health integration into foreign policy has often been reactive and crisis-driven, rather than planned and proactive, failing to adequately identify or optimise available domestic and international opportunities. Additionally, participants singled out the lack of an inter-sectoral institution or steering council to improve policy coherence and enhance coordination across and within sectors.

Conclusion

A common understanding of GHD is expected to pave the way for the implementation and effective achievement of broader foreign and health policy goals in LMICs, such as Iran.

### Toward a safer world by 2040: the JAMA summit report on reducing firearm violence and harms [^113J93gf]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Since the start of the 21st century, more than 800 000 firearm deaths and more than 2 million firearm injuries have occurred in the US. All categories of firearm violence-homicide, suicide, unintentional-result in reverberating harms to individuals, families, communities, and society. The collective responsibility of society is to safeguard the health and safety of its members, including from firearm harms. The JAMA Summit on Firearm Violence convened 60 thought leaders from a wide array of disciplines to chart an innovations roadmap that will lead to substantial reductions in firearm harms by 2040.

Observations

The vision for 2040 is a country where firearm violence is substantially reduced and where all people and communities report feeling safe from firearm harms. The vision centers on practical solutions with an understanding of the country's constitutional protections for firearm ownership. Achieving the 2040 vision will require expansion of proven evidence-based strategies and the development of new, innovative approaches rooted in equity, accountability, and collective responsibility. Discussions centered on projecting a safer world, community violence interventions, technologic innovations, federal and state-level oversight of firearms, ethical considerations, and primordial prevention of firearm violence. The Summit charted a roadmap of 5 essential actions in the next 5 years to achieve this vision: (1) focus on communities and change fundamental structures that lead to firearm harms, (2) harness technological strengths responsibly, (3) change the narrative around firearm harms, (4) take a whole-government and whole-society approach, and (5) spark a research revolution on preventing firearm harms.

Conclusions and Relevance

A safer world will require investing in the discovery, implementation, and scaling of solutions that reduce firearm harms and center on the people and communities most affected by firearm violence.

### How to prevent and address safeguarding concerns in global health research programmes: practice, process and positionality in marginalised spaces [^115ZugFR]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Safeguarding is rapidly rising up the international development agenda, yet literature on safeguarding in related research is limited. This paper shares processes and practice relating to safeguarding within an international research consortium (the ARISE hub, known as ARISE). ARISE aims to enhance accountability and improve the health and well-being of marginalised people living and working in informal urban spaces in low-income and middle-income countries (Bangladesh, India, Kenya and Sierra Leone). Our manuscript is divided into three key sections. We start by discussing the importance of safeguarding in global health research and consider how thinking about vulnerability as a relational concept (shaped by unequal power relations and structural violence) can help locate fluid and context specific safeguarding risks within broader social systems. We then discuss the different steps undertaken in ARISE to develop a shared approach to safeguarding: sharing institutional guidelines and practice; facilitating a participatory process to agree a working definition of safeguarding and joint understandings of vulnerabilities, risks and mitigation strategies and share experiences; developing action plans for safeguarding. This is followed by reflection on our key learnings including how safeguarding, ethics and health and safety concerns overlap; the challenges of referral and support for safeguarding concerns within frequently underserved informal urban spaces; and the importance of reflective practice and critical thinking about power, judgement and positionality and the ownership of the global narrative surrounding safeguarding. We finish by situating our learning within debates on decolonising science and argue for the importance of an iterative, ongoing learning journey that is critical, reflective and inclusive of vulnerable people.

### Reconceptualising health security in post-COVID-19 world [^117JNfAm]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Notwithstanding its broad dimensions and its anti-colonialist outlook, the concept of human security was pursued narrowly and operationalised selectively within the political and economic order that maintained the status quo. Analysts argue that the concept has been co-opted by some states to promote their political and foreign policy agendas, and has often been used as a justification for interventionist foreign policy like peace keeping missions. Critics also argue that Japan, Canada and Norway adopted human security only as their foreign policy tools and not as a tool to address the domestic insecurities of certain groups of their local population.

While some analysts blame the conceptual depth and breadth of the concept as being responsible for the vagueness and its narrow uptake as a concept, the supporters of the concept view the conceptual breadth as the strength since it gives the concept the dynamism and the subjectivity that it needs. It allows the concept many variants to reflect different priorities in different times and places. It provides space for contextualisation and local interpretation and ranking of threats. It is well attuned to the changing vulnerabilities of humankind and is malleable to reflect new threats to security. While we agree that the concept of human security has been co-opted by states and is not practised in its true holistic formulation, we contend that the original concept of human security, as advanced by the UN in 1994, has some distinctive features that can guide us in broadening the notion of health security.

### Health justice in fragile and shock-prone settings: from theory to practice towards building resilient health systems [^114K8KjF]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Health justice is an emerging imperative in global health and health policy and systems research, particularly in fragile and shock-prone settings where inequities are deepened by political instability, conflict and structural violence. This practice paper explores how the ReBUILD for Resilience consortium has sought to operationalise health justice as a guiding principle and embedded practice in four diverse contexts: Myanmar, Nepal, Lebanon and Sierra Leone. Drawing from political philosophy, public health ethics and the capability approach, we outline a framework that positions health justice not only as an aspiration but also as an actionable, community-rooted agenda that centres equity, power redistribution and inclusive governance. Through participatory action research, political economy analysis and embedded learning sites, the ReBUILD teams engaged with communities and health system actors to co-create interventions that respond to local needs while addressing entrenched exclusion and marginalisation. Country experiences demonstrate both the potential and challenges of advancing health justice: from establishing inclusive Municipal Health Committees and revitalising health facility governance to promoting leadership among marginalised groups such as people with disabilities and displaced populations. This paper reflects on tensions around facilitation, participation and positionality and acknowledges the broader political economy, subnational, national and transnational, that shapes opportunities for transformation. We argue that health justice must be pursued through politically astute, reflexive and participatory research approaches, grounded in long-term relationships and a commitment to amplifying community voices. While the road is complex and contested, the pursuit of health justice is essential for building more equitable, inclusive and resilient health systems in the face of protracted crises and global inequities.

### An epidemic recovery framework to jump-start analysis, planning, and action on a neglected aspect of global health security [^116QYDDZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

LEARNING FROM DISASTER RECOVERY RESEARCH

Reviewing studies of postdisaster rehabilitation/restoration more closely — that is, absorbing their lessons and avoiding their missteps — can help accelerate the development of a framework to guide epidemic recovery research, strategy, and operations. The principles below represent key learnings that can help inform future constructs of postoutbreak healing.

Think Holistically, Broadening the Focus Beyond the Immediately Discernible Damages

Early disaster research erred in equating recovery with reconstruction of the physical environment — clearing debris, getting infrastructure back online, rebuilding housing and commercial facilities, and so on. Only later was importance given to social, emotional, economic, political, and natural realms. Beyond material reconstruction is the reconstitution of a sense of safety, social connections, faith in institutions, and economic exchange. Theories of epidemic recovery, too, should avoid an analogous equation of recovery with the obvious yet still narrow indicators of interrupted disease transmission, clinically resolved infections, and a functional health sector. Such a caution is helpful, because the emerging emphasis within global health security regarding the postepidemic context is, understandably, health sector reconstitution and strengthening.

Anticipate Messiness, Seeing Recovery as a Complex, Nonlinear, Unevenly Achieved Process

At its outset, disaster recovery scholarship generated "phased" models with predicted timelines and uniform progression. Yet, further inquiry revealed a process that unfolded in fits and starts, proceeding unevenly across populations and critical community functions and with "fuzzy" endpoints. Now, disaster researchers acknowledge that so-called recovery stages overlap with one another; that actions taken during response influence recovery trajectories; and that preexisting vulnerabilities and capabilities affect if, how, and when different social groups achieve recovery milestones. We, too, should avoid models of epidemic recovery that reinforce notions of a process unfolding in neat, preordained phases. In an epidemic, for instance, the uncertainties during the response — for example, whether a safe and effective medical countermeasure (MCM) exists, the MCM supply and operational capacity for its mass distribution are sufficient, and people of all backgrounds trust in the authorities who recommend taking the MCM — can strongly influence the nature and enormity of the recovery.

### Interim planning guidance for preparedness and response to a mass casualty event resulting from terrorist use of explosives [^115vaUVY]. CDC (2010). Medium credibility.

Nature of explosions — Explosions arise from sudden chemical conversion of a solid or liquid into a gas with energy release, and explosive devices are categorized as high-order explosives (HE) or low-order explosives (LE). High-order explosive detonation produces supersonic, instantaneous gas transformation under extremely high pressure and generates an overpressure blast wave that expands outward in all directions. The extent and pattern of injuries depend on the amount and composition of explosive material, delivery method, distance between the victim and the blast, setting (open vs. closed space, structural collapse, intervening barriers), and other accompanying environmental hazards.

### Common ecology quantifies human insurgency [^112cVEix]. Nature (2009). Excellent credibility.

Many collective human activities, including violence, have been shown to exhibit universal patterns. The size distributions of casualties both in whole wars from 1816 to 1980 and terrorist attacks have separately been shown to follow approximate power-law distributions. However, the possibility of universal patterns ranging across wars in the size distribution or timing of within-conflict events has barely been explored. Here we show that the sizes and timing of violent events within different insurgent conflicts exhibit remarkable similarities. We propose a unified model of human insurgency that reproduces these commonalities, and explains conflict-specific variations quantitatively in terms of underlying rules of engagement. Our model treats each insurgent population as an ecology of dynamically evolving, self-organized groups following common decision-making processes. Our model is consistent with several recent hypotheses about modern insurgency, is robust to many generalizations, and establishes a quantitative connection between human insurgency, global terrorism and ecology. Its similarity to financial market models provides a surprising link between violent and non-violent forms of human behaviour.

### Identity change and informed consent [^112AxoNZ]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2017). Low credibility.

This line of thought is based on what has been called a 'historical' account of the nature of autonomy. According to the historical account, a necessary condition for a mental attitude to be autonomous (or, as some say, authentic) is for it to have the right kind of history. ix What is necessary and sufficient for a history to be of the 'right kind' is controversial among friends of the historical account. However, there appears to be broad agreement that it must be free of non-rational influences that are so far-reaching as to determine how the person will judge them on reflection (cf. refs. p. 16;, p. 14). In the case of Smith's postintervention approval, this condition appears to be violated. And it is plausible to assume that it may be violated in other postintervention assessments of identity-changing interventions too. Therefore, informed consent to such interventions seems to require that identity changes be assessed from the preintervention and not the postintervention perspective.

The argument presupposes that the preintervention identity is always an appropriate vantage point for the assessment of identity changes. However, this assumption is too strong: x some patients' preintervention identities might be 'disease-shaped' such that they qualify as heteronomous according to the historical account outlined above (cf. ref. p. 491). Or their illness and the stigma accompanying it might render them 'overly deferential' to the wishes, opinions or 'discriminatory narratives' of the people around them (cf. refs. p. 523;, p. 566). In these and other cases, we might reasonably doubt the autonomy of judgments from the preintervention perspective. At any rate, they will probably be less autonomous than judgments from the postintervention perspective if the intervention is medically successful.

### Interim planning guidance for preparedness and response to a mass casualty event resulting from terrorist use of explosives [^115XNkMn]. CDC (2010). Medium credibility.

Manage fatalities in a TUE-MCE — Prior to a bombing event, address such issues as cataloging of bodies; availability of body bags and refrigerator trucks; and return of bodies, human remains, and personal belongings to authorized persons. Following a TUE-MCE, avoid transporting bodies and remains from the scene to hospital treatment areas. Pay attention to and be respectful of varying religious beliefs when handling bodies and remains. Consider designating alternate sites outside of hospitals for managing and storing human remains. If possible, document the identity of the dead, human remains, and associated personal belongings. As soon as possible after the crisis, begin to identify human remains using scientific means (e.g., dental records, pathology, anthropology, fingerprints, DNA samples). Dealing with fatalities can have profound and long-lasting consequences for survivors. Coordination and planning with local community and law enforcement agencies, which typically handle identification and disposal of human remains, are important aspects of managing an MCE.

### Biological warfare in a historical perspective [^113w1KJM]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2002). Low credibility.

There are some early examples of biological warfare (BW), but in modern times it was used first for sabotage by Germany during WWI. Development of biological weapons on a military significant scale was initiated in several countries in the period between the world wars. During WWII, several countries had active programs such as the USA, UK, Canada, Germany, Japan and the Soviet Union. It was only Japan that on a fairly large scale used BW. The US program continued until 1969, when President Nixon took a decision to end it in connection with signing the BTWC. The Soviet Union had also continued its program after the war, and this was enhanced after signing the BTWC: in the 1980s the program consisted of around fifty facilities and involved around 60,000 people. The Soviet Union produced and maintained a large stockpile of BW-agents. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, and due to pressure from USA and UK, President Yeltsin issued a decree in 1992 banning continued offensive BW activity. However, there are still concerns of residual activity in Russia. Another program of concern is the Iraqi BW-program. After 10 years of UN inspections that were stopped in 1998, there are still many unanswered questions concerning the BW program. There was also a covert BW-program in South Africa that was terminated around 1993. There have also been a number of allegations of alleged use or possession. In addition, there are indications that 10–12 states are now trying to acquire BW, and this assessment is based on intelligence information, mainly from the USA. For example Iraq, North Korea, Iran, Syria, Sudan and Libya. Another aspect is the strong driving force of technology developments to promote this type of program, opening new risks for future potential military misuse.

### Opacity, difference and not knowing: what can psychiatry learn from the work ofédouard glissant? [^117L5tAa]. Medical Humanities (2024). Medium credibility.

Without wanting to diminish the potentially transformative power of replacing a notion of transparency as the holy grail of psychiatry with a tolerance for and respect for opacity, I would argue that such a shift of focus is primarily concerned with how we do things as clinicians, rather than with what we do. Asking questions and learning from and about the Other is in no way incompatible with a Glissantian approach. However, the specific questions we choose to ask and the things we expect to learn may need to be adapted so as to avoid trying to see through the patient and allow instead for an actual face-to-face encounter with a real person. Analogous to Glissant's view of ethnography touched on above, the problem is not the clinician's gaze in itself so much as the inability of the patient to look back — a returning of the gaze which may, in a clinical setting, include the joint observation and acknowledgement of the many preconceived assumptions that typically colour a psychiatric assessment procedure. A successful example of this type of shift in perspective is the recent introduction of a neurodiversity paradigm, by which autism is seen as one of many variations within a diversity of development trajectories rather than as an inherent flaw. Importantly, this is not merely a question of terminology. The neurodiversity movement explicitly takes issue with traditional ideas of individual deficits in favour of societal change to overcome existing barriers, 'returning the gaze', if you will, in order to challenge dominant concepts of agency and being-acted-upon.

Likewise, many conventional psychiatric tools can readily be used in ways that respect difference and alterity. For example, by accepting that '[t]he right to opacity is freedom from the expectation of complete coherence and comprehensibility in every aspect of your personhood', aiding a patient or client in co-constructing a biographical narrative to help document and make sense of traumatic experiences can and should involve an explicit recognition of the ambiguities and inconsistencies that are part of being human. The contextual layers of a patient's story may diverge and make the narrative seem incoherent and therefore, by default, untrustworthy. This is perhaps especially true in the case of patients with a refugee background, whose stories of trauma, flight and exile may not entirely fit together or even conflict internally — over time, between consecutive retellings, or in different settings — for a number of reasons:

### Perceptions of risk: perspectives on crime and safety in public housing for older adults [^115PKWSb]. The Gerontologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

An increasing number of older adults are aging in place in public housing. Public housing is perceived to have higher rates of crime that have detrimental impacts on health and well-being. We used a qualitative approach to understand the experiences of safety and unsafety for older adults in public housing.

Research Design and Methods

Participants included older adult tenants (n = 58) as well as service providers (n = 58) who offer supports directly in the buildings. Semistructured qualitative interviews and focus groups were used to explore (a) what makes the buildings feel unsafe, (b) how safety concerns affect access to support services, and (c) strategies used to promote safety.

Results

Participants acknowledged the importance of safety for creating a home-like environment; however, many described feeling unsafe at home or work. Participants described extreme examples of antisocial behaviors that were pervasive and viewed as commonplace. Lack of building security was a key issue, which was compounded by a perceived lack of accountability. While service providers were willing to accept a certain level of risk, many acknowledged that unsafe situations forced them to withdraw in-home services or stop community programs, further contributing to feelings of unsafety. In the absence of effective formal security, participants described several measures taken to mitigate risk.

Discussion and Implications

Our findings point to the need for enhanced physical and environmental safety infrastructure, improved building management, increased on-site security, as well as other proactive measures to reduce risk by creating a greater sense of connection and community within the buildings.

### Interim planning guidance for preparedness and response to a mass casualty event resulting from terrorist use of explosives [^114BZWTN]. CDC (2010). Medium credibility.

Altered standards of care during emergencies — the system should be refocused during crisis response to accomplish the greatest good for the community (i.e., save the most victims). The rationale for modifying standards of care in an emergency is that more patients will survive a terrorist attack if key lifesaving interventions are provided to the greatest number of casualties likely to benefit from care. Hospitals and emergency medical services systems above surge capacity will require autonomy to alter regular standards of care and shift to emergency critical care practices, and no universally accepted methodology for this adjustment exists and the process is associated with potential ethical, societal, medical, and legal issues. A protocol is needed to determine when and how to deviate from the norm without repercussions for the health care provider or facility; an altered protocol would improve the management of assessment, treatment, flow, and outcomes for the greatest number of patients, and changing standards of care will require a formal process in each community to determine when and how to transition from standard operating procedures to an altered standard of care.

### Military traumatic brain injury: the history, impact, and future [^112yutNC]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2022). Medium credibility.

This review examines how lessons learned from United States military conflicts, beginning with the United States Civil War through the engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan, have shaped current traumatic brain injury (TBI) care in the United States military, influenced congressional mandates and directives, and led to best practices in caring for the warfighter. Prior to the most recent war, emphasis was placed on improving the surgical and medical care of service members (SM) with severe and especially penetrating brain injuries. However, during the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, also known as the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT), blast injury from improvised explosive devices most often caused mild TBI (mTBI), an injury that was not always recognized and was labelled the "signature wound" of the GWOT. This has led to extensive research on objective diagnostic technologies for mTBI, the association of mTBI with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and the long term consequences of mTBI. Here we summarize the key findings and most important advances from those efforts, and discuss the way forward regarding future military conflicts.

Mass casualty event (MCE) incident command — who is in charge emphasizes that clarifying the response process for leadership, the chain of command, responsibilities, and coordination is critical — especially during a crisis, and states that the MCE response should be led and coordinated by two main levels of operation centers: 1) the unified crisis command center for the local area, which brings together all relevant responding agencies; and 2) the medical command and control center, which coordinates all medical aspects of the MCE. These operation centers can exchange information, develop a common picture of the event and available resources, direct capabilities and resources, coordinate the flow of casualties, maintain mutual communication and understanding, and lead the public messages.

### Early medical students' experiences as system navigators: results of a qualitative study [^112Mhf6n]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To explore how early meaningful experiential learning in community settings impacted medical students' application of systems thinking, their perceptions of systems navigation, and their professional identity as health system change agents.

Methods

Following an immersive Health Systems Science course, first-year medical students partnered with veterans or newly arrived refugee families and served as health system patient navigators embedded within primary care teams for a year. Across two cohorts, fifty-six students participated in the elective. Three voluntary focus groups were conducted each year for a total of six groups with 50 patient navigator students. Inductive content analysis of focus group transcripts was conducted.

Results

Qualitative analysis produced three major themes: program impact on students, student impact on patients, and student perceptions of the role of healthcare providers. Students reported a rich understanding of social determinants of health. By improving patient awareness of health and well-being, building capacity to understand medical issues, and increasing medication adherence through teaching, students recognized their impact on patient care. The importance of interprofessional collaboration with social workers also emerged and helped shape students' understanding of how they as physicians are part of a coordinated team working toward better patient care.

Conclusion

The Case Western Reserve University WR2 curriculum teaches students how to address complex determinants of health and how to consider their role in dynamic health systems. This study highlights rich themes that emerged from students as they recognized the context that creates health for both individuals and communities. It underscores the role of such experiences in reinforcing systems thinking and development of change agency, both contributing to their professional identity formation as physicians.

### Protecting children from tobacco, nicotine, and tobacco smoke [^1114EMum]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Tobacco control programs — "should change the image of tobacco by telling the truth about tobacco" with Evidence quality: B and Recommendation strength: strong recommendation. The 2012 Report of the Surgeon General concluded that "The evidence is sufficient to conclude that school-based programs with evidence of effectiveness, containing specific components, can produce at least short-term effects and reduce the prevalence of tobacco use among school-aged youth", and that "The tobacco companies' activities and programs for the prevention of youth smoking have not demonstrated an impact on the initiation or prevalence of smoking among young people". Mass-reach health communication interventions were endorsed: the 2014 CDC Best Practices stated they "can be powerful tools for preventing the initiation of tobacco use, promoting and facilitating cessation, and shaping social norms related to tobacco use", and the Community Preventive Services Task Force (2013) "recommended mass-reach health communication interventions based on strong evidence of effectiveness in decreasing the prevalence of tobacco use, increasing cessation and use of available services such as quitlines, and decreasing the initiation of tobacco use among young people". Programmatic examples include Florida's youth-oriented campaign funded at "$23 million in fiscal year 1997 and $70 million in fiscal year 1998" with declines from "18.5% to 15.0% (P < .01)" in middle school cigarette use and from "27.4% to 25.2% (P = 0.02)" in high school, along with reductions in cigar use "from 14.1% in 1998 to 11.9% in 1999 (P < .01)". Additional evidence shows in Panama, "From 2002 to 2008, the prevalence of current cigarette smoking among students 13 to 15 years of age in Panama decreased from 13.2% to 4.3%", and that pictorial warnings improved youth risk perceptions as "A survey of 4482 adolescents in Melbourne, Australia, found that adolescents had more accurate perceptions of the health risks of smoking if they had seen the graphic warnings".

### Not war, not terrorism, the impact of hybrid warfare on emergency medicine [^1136qnp1]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Healthcare facilities and medical providers are not immune to aggression and threat from terrorists, criminals and rogue states. The concept of Hybrid Warfare is often described as a mix of conventional warfare, irregular warfare, terrorism, criminality and different types of other hybrid threats such as cyberattacks and drone technology. Healthcare systems can either be primary or secondary targets of hybrid warfare with potentially devastating consequences.

Objective

The aim of this paper is to serve as a primer for clinicians, researchers and emergency managers in understanding the basic aspects of hybrid warfare, how healthcare can be affected, and to provide a framework for mitigation and resilience, especially in an emergency medicine setting. Different hybrid threats and their effect on emergency medicine, and healthcare in general, is discussed.

Discussion

Hybrid warfare is an increasing, multimodal, threat for all segments of healthcare, particularly prehospital care and emergency medicine. Disrupting the healthcare system in a country using hybrid warfare has the ultimate aim of destabilizing organizations and society as well as directly reducing the effectiveness and capabilities of healthcare as a key strategic resource. In this aspect prehospital care and emergency medicine are main targets of aggression.

Conclusion

Clinicians and healthcare managers of all levels should have a basic knowledge of the different components of hybrid warfare so as to mitigate effects of an attack. It is suggested that an emergency department do not aim to create totally new solutions for hybrid threats but use an all hazards approach and the available guidelines for handling generic threats. However, there must be a preparedness for the different ways hybrid warfare can play out, how the threats can be combined in synergistic ways and the potential compounding effects on healthcare and society.

### Irregular warfare must combine good medicine, with both good tactics and good strategies: position paper by the French special operations forces medical command [^1165HMyJ]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Military operations are no longer limited to the application of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency strategies; they are now characterized by hybrid, irregular, and unconventional features. While some authors have indicated the need for medical support to adapt to these new modes of military operations, they have focused mainly on the tactical level of care on the battlefield. As Sun Tzu states, "Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat", further proposals are still needed on the application of both medical tactics and medical strategies in irregular warfare.

Methods

Medical experts from the French Special Operations Forces (SOF) Medical Command have identified specific medical challenges that special operations face in the context of the current transformation of armed confrontations into irregular warfare.

Results

This position paper presents original tactical medical proposals for improving medical support in irregular warfare, ranging from the definition of a Primary-Alternate-Contingency-Emergency medical plan to the promotion of telemedical support. Original strategic medical proposals have highlighted the importance of recognizing medical issues in irregular warfare, including the medical actions carried out through and with local partners and the multiple approaches to countering medical threats.

Conclusion

The SOF medical community must be closely involved with and facilitate the responses to the shift to irregular warfare. International collaboration and interoperability are more necessary than ever, as they will enable a more effective combination of good medicine with both good tactics and good strategies. These perspectives can also be extended to improve medical care in the conventional armed forces and austere civilian settings.

### Strategic attitude expressions as identity performance and identity creation in interaction [^1148qKDp]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig. 5
The effect of cumulative congruence on identification at each item/time point for the experimental ingroup, outgroup, and control conditions.

Higher values on the graph are represented by increasingly saturated purple nodes. Green represents the experimental ingroup. Yellow represents the experimental outgroup. Purple represents the control group.

Fig. 6
Average identification at each item/time point for each, across condition and congruence levels.

'Cong' refers to when individuals have congruence with their dyadic partner on a given attitude. 'Incong' refers to when individuals have incongruence with their dyadic partner on a given attitude. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals (n = 836). Green represents the experimental ingroup, yellow represents the experimental outgroup, grey represents the control group. Average identification begins at the highest point in the ingroup and despite differences in congruence over time, congruent outgroup members never reach an average identification as high as any congruent ingroup members. Incongruent ingroup members never reach an average identification level as low as incongruent outgroup members. This displays the impact of the initial opinion-based group identification.

As can be seen in Fig. 6 (see also Supplementary Note 9), at every time point participants in the experimental ingroup with congruence had significantly higher identification than all other conditions. With the exception of two comparisons, the experimental outgroup with incongruence had significantly lower identification than all other conditions. Thus, having attitude incongruence had the strongest identification weakening effects for those interacting with outgroup members.

Participants in the experimental ingroup with incongruence had higher identification than participants in the experimental outgroup with incongruence with the exception of time 7. Participants in the experimental outgroup with incongruence had lower identification than participants in the experimental ingroup with incongruence at each time point.

### Ending nuclear weapons, before they end us [^114Go8tF]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2025). Medium credibility.

Led by Ireland and New Zealand, in late 2024, the United Nations General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to establish a 21-member independent scientific panel to undertake a new comprehensive study on the effects of nuclear war, with its final report due in 2027. Noting that 'removing the threat of a nuclear war is the most acute and urgent task of the present day', the panel has been tasked with examining the physical effects and societal consequences of a nuclear war on a local, regional and planetary scale. It will examine the climatic, environmental and radiological effects of nuclear war, and their impact on public health, global socioeconomic systems, agriculture and ecosystems.

The resolution calls on UN agencies, including WHO, to support the panel's work, including by 'contributing expertise, commissioned studies, data and papers'. All UN Member States are encouraged to provide relevant information, scientific data and analyses; facilitate and host panel meetings, including regional meetings; and make budgetary or in-kind contributions. Such an authoritative international assessment of evidence on the most acute existential threat to humankind and planetary health is long overdue. The last such report dates from 1989. It is shameful that France, UK and Russia opposed this resolution.

Appendix B case study — therapy with Anthony, a young man with traumatic brain injury (TBI), addresses intimacy and sexuality while accounting for physical and cognitive differences that hamper mobility and capacity for physical contact and affect how he could share attraction verbally or through touch. Interventions included meeting a wider range of peers for friendship and potential dating, working directly on discriminating between interest in intimacy and frank sexual desires, and developing social scripts with coaching provided within treatment, at work, and in the residence. Therapy facilitated inhibiting immediate wishes to connect through touching that were perceived as intrusive and inappropriate, shifting toward initiating interactions verbally with boundaries. Identity work emphasized recognizing membership in wider communities beyond disability, challenging beliefs of being "damaged" and "ugly", and conceptualizing himself as both a survivor and as resilient. Reported changes were seeing a new trajectory and playing a more active role in decision making, which led him to seek new vocational opportunities and to open himself to a peer's dating interest. Questions for discussion include practitioners' considerations regarding cognitive and physical disability within the dominant society's continued emphasis on privilege, oppression, and capability.

### Conflict of interest issues pertinent to veterans affairs medical centers [^114ZupzV]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Conflicts of interest exist when an arrangement potentially exerts inappropriate influence on decision making or professional judgment, or is perceived to do so, and can thus damage the public trust and undermine the integrity of those decisions. Concerns regarding financial conflicts of interest in the medical arena have reached their height as of late, given that physicians now function in a milieu of complex and delicate relationships with pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries. Even when such relationships do not correlate with actual compromise of judgment or patient care, it threatens the credibility of both the health care professional and the institution because of the social perception of the effect of these relationships. Although most institutions in the Western world set forth a code of ethics and conflict-of-interest policies to be followed under threat of termination, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) presents itself as a unique environment in which conflicts of interest are subject to governmental laws, violation of which may not only result in employment-related discipline, but may be sanctioned by civil and criminal penalties. Moreover, these provisions are developed by a national authoritative organization rather than being institution-specific guidelines. Given that many academic physicians working within the VHA may also have a component of their practice in a University setting, it becomes important to understand the differences in policy between these contexts so as not to threaten the public trust in the veracity of decisions made and, therefore, maintain the integrity of the relationship between physician and patient. This article will review aspects of conflict-of-interest policies in the realm of research, financial relationships, foreign travel, and vendor contracting that are particular to the VHA and make it a unique environment to function in as a physician and scientist.

### Crisis + emergency risk communication. 2012 edition [^111xTWB3]. CDC (2012). Medium credibility.

Emotional health issues for families of deployed emergency response workers — support strategies include to "Provide family members with as much information as possible about the disaster and deployment" and, "As a second possible strategy, assign a specific liaison from your organization to family members". Guidance notes that "Family members should understand that deployed staff usually work very long hours in very stressful and emotional conditions", and "In many cases, they may be exposed to scenes of suffering, possible destruction, and the strong emotions, anger, and loss that victims experience". On return, "When a family member returns from a disaster scene, he or she may need time to adjust to the normal pace of everyday life and may require additional rest", and "It is important for family members to be able to talk to one another about what happened and the emotions that accompanied the work", recognizing that "Sometimes, deployed workers do not want to burden family with these stories". Emotions may be "proud, frustrated, angry, sad, tearful, and happy all at the same time", and "It may take some time to sort out these conflicting emotions and share them". "Returning deployed workers also may seem overly preoccupied with the disaster experiences and may not seem to share in excitement, disappointment, or frustration about events at home", and "The disaster experience tends to overshadow everyday events and puts them in a different perspective". "Often, emergency response workers return home with a conscious or unconscious need to reassure themselves about the safety of their environment" and "Response workers often feel that they left something undone or that they could have done more", so "Time, understanding, empathy, and support from family are important to readjustment".

### APA multicultural guidelines executive summary: ecological approach to context, identity, and intersectionality [^113gaoDU]. The American Psychologist (2019). High credibility.

Applications to practice, research, and consultation — psychologists are guided to recognize that "identity and self-definition are fluid and dynamic", and are "encouraged to strive toward attunement to life experiences, transitions, and identity labels, and how identity experience may change over time and context". Attunement "requires careful listening to self-defined narratives", and scholars emphasize "the importance of the therapist's cultural humility". Cultural humility is defined as a "lifelong process of self-reflection, self-critique, continual assessment of power imbalances, and the development of mutually respectful relationships and partnerships", and also as "an other-oriented stance, which is marked by openness, curiosity, lack of arrogance, and genuine desire to understand clients' cultural identities". Outcome data note that "clients' perceptions of therapists' cultural humility is associated with improved therapeutic outcomes", and "evidence indicates that the therapist's attention to clients' identifications of what is salient concerning their identity statuses rather than relying on the therapist's assumptions is an important factor in therapeutic processes and outcomes". The guidance further states, "It is also important that clinicians, researchers, and consultants attend to their own lack of knowledge and/or training concerning language that is affirming of an individual's or group's actual identity experiences".

### Addressing epistemic injustice (and ongoing effects of colonisation) through the Ethiopian intellectual tradition of… [^111H75m9]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Descriptions of Qiné in English-language publications

The major introduction of Qiné to English-speaking audiences was through Donald Levine's 1965 book Wax and Gold: Tradition and Innovation in Ethiopian Culture. Levine spent 3 years in Ethiopia conducting ethnographic research as a post-doctoral fellow and continued to include studies of Ethiopia in his academic work as a sociologist and Ethiopianist at the University of Chicago. Levine depicted wax and gold (one of many tropes of Qiné scholarship) as a charming traditional way of thought that limited Ethiopia's ability to engage with notions of modernity. Ethiopian sociological and theological scholars have contested this analysis. Mohammed Girma instead positions wax and gold as a 'tool that critiques and corrects social vices such as individualism, self-assertion, deception, and mutual suspicion'. (p23) Mamire Mennasemay suggests that Levine's work was more in the tradition of westerners seeing themselves through looking at others than about explaining Qiné as an Ethiopian tradition unto itself. Suffice it to say that issues of language and translation are always present when working across cultures. These are challenges to embrace and work through, rather than reasons to ignore important intellectual approaches less easily expressed in English.

Qiné is little-known among western academics generally, and even less so in areas of medicine and healthcare. We were not able to identify any uses of Qiné within the literatures of medical/health professions education. Clinically, we found only one article using Qiné: Levene, Phillips and Shitaye Alemu (2016) in the journal Tropical Medicine draw on notions of wax and gold to suggest that care for non-communicable diseases in Ethiopia could be more effective if biomedical practitioners engaged with traditional belief systems and healing practices. With such a limited English-language literature using Qiné concepts in medicine and medical education, there is an opportunity and need to expand international understandings of this powerful critical tradition, and consider ways it can be used in medical education and critical global health scholarship.

### Health care clinicians and product promotion by industry [^117DucWE]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Professional guidance on industry influence — key points include that physicians do not believe they are influenced by industry relationships, prescribing behavior of many physicians is likely to be altered by these relationships, and those who do not acknowledge the influence of small gifts are often influenced by them; awareness and vigilance are necessary to guard against attempts to alter physician assessments and behaviors. At a minimum, all physicians must educate themselves about the subtle influence inherent in any relationship with the medical industry, a recent survey suggested that many, if not most, physicians lack an adequate understanding of conflicts of interest and influence, and an important first step is for health care clinicians to recognize that they are vulnerable to persuasive techniques and that they may be vulnerable to unconscious bias.

### Long-term priors influence visual perception through recruitment of long-range feedback [^115Wz5TY]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In summary, we reveal large-scale cortical mechanisms underlying long-term priors' role in guiding visual perception. Across two different ambiguous images, we observed that the preferred percept, which is congruent with long-term experiences, is accompanied by strengthened feedback influences. By contrast, the non-preferred percept is accompanied by increased feedforward influences. These results challenge theories proposing that long-term priors act predominantly in a bottom-up fashion, and support theories suggesting that long-term priors reside in higher-order brain regions and act on perception through top-down feedback.

Although it is well known that priors learnt through lifetime experiences powerfully shape perception — e.g. it is nearly impossible to see a shape with shading at the bottom as concave — the neural mechanisms underlying long-term priors' influence on perception remain poorly understood. To tackle this long-standing question, we collected an extensive ECoG dataset of bistable visual perception, with electrode coverage of all cortical lobes and a large number of simultaneously recorded electrodes in each individual participant, ideal for probing the dynamic information flow between cortical areas. Long-term experience's influence on shaping perceptual asymmetry when viewing ambiguous images is well documented in the psychophysics literature, but has been largely neglected in neuroscientific studies of bistable perception. This phenomenon allowed us to compare, under identical visual input, when perception is and is not congruent with long-term prior. Importantly, we presented two different ambiguous images to each participant, with the data from them separately analyzed, thereby providing a within-study reproducibility and generalizability check.

Crisis leaders should expect that planning will be imperfect and learn to expect the unexpected.

### Recommendations for the appropriate structure, communication, and investigation of tobacco harm reduction claims. An official American Thoracic Society policy statement [^115HhMe7]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

The investigation and/or regulation of potential harm reduction strategies — ethical guidance specifies that marginal harm reduction calculations must use best available options as the comparator, rather than the no-intervention condition, and that harm reduction claims should be accompanied by clear statements of their methodologic decisions. The hazards inherent to prospective population-based evaluations may qualify as "greater than minimal risk", and care should be taken to assess research risks in comparison to current standards of care for reducing harm among people unprepared to quit, rather than to the no-intervention condition. Harm reduction researchers must protect the autonomy of subjects by discussing the unique nature of risk inherent to harm reduction protocols, and promoting an understanding sufficient for subjects to legitimately assume risk protects subjects through fair methods that promote just outcomes. Harm reduction policies should state the perspective(s) from which they are derived, guard against inequitable allocation of resources, provide assurance of longitudinal surveillance, and inform the public of important developments in understanding. Although elimination of risk should remain the goal of public health authorities, this statement highlights the special requirements for ethically pursuing the reduction of harm within the complex social/biological context of tobacco dependence.
